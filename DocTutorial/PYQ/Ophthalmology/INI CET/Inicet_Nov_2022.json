      "solution": "<p>The normal Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. The first line consists of one very large letter, which may be one of several letters, for example E, H, or N. Subsequent rows have increasing numbers of letters that decrease in size. A person taking the test covers one eye from 6 metres or 20 feet away, and reads aloud the letters of each row, beginning at the top. The smallest row that can be read accurately indicates the visual acuity in that specific eye. The symbols on an acuity chart are formally known as \"optotypes\".</p>\n<p>Variation of Snellen chart with another letter sequence. Australia, 1946</p>\n<p>In the case of the traditional Snellen chart, the optotypes have the appearance of block letters, and are intended to be seen and read as letters. They are not, however, letters from any ordinary typographer's font. They have a particular, simple geometry in which:</p>\n<p>the thickness of the lines equals the thickness of the white spaces between lines and the thickness of the gap in the letter \"C\"</p>\n<p>the height and width of the optotype (letter) is five times the thickness of the line.</p>\n<p>Only the nine letters C, D, E, F, L, O, P, T, Z are used in the common Snellen chart. The perception of five out of six letters (or similar ratio) is judged to be the Snellen fraction. Wall-mounted Snellen charts are inexpensive and are sometimes used for approximate assessment of vision, e.g. in a primary-care physician's office. Whenever acuity must be assessed carefully (as in an eye doctor's examination), or where there is a possibility that the examinee might attempt to deceive the examiner (as in a motor vehicle license office), equipment is used that can present the letters in a variety of randomized patterns. BS 4274-1:1968 (British Standards Institution) \"Specification for test charts for determining distance visual acuity\" was replaced by BS 4274-1:2003 \"Test charts for clinical determination of distance visual acuity - Specification\". It states that \"the luminance of the presentation shall be uniform and not less than 120 cd/m2. Any variation across the test chart shall not exceed 20%.\" According to BS 4274-1:2003 only the letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z should be used for the testing of vision based upon equal legibility of the letters</p>\n<p>Snellen defined \"standard vision\" as the ability to recognize one of his optotypes when it subtended 5 minutes of arc. Thus the optotype can only be recognized if the person viewing it can discriminate a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc.</p>\n<p>Outside the United States, the standard chart distance is 6 metres (20 ft), and normal acuity is designated \"6/6\". Other acuities are expressed as ratios with a numerator of 6. Some clinics do not have 6-metre eye lanes available, and either a half-size chart subtending the same angles at 3 metres (9.8 ft), or a reversed chart projected and viewed by a mirror is used to achieve the correct sized letters.</p>\n<p>In the most familiar acuity test, a Snellen chart is placed at a standard distance: 6 metres. At this distance, the symbols on the line representing \"normal\" acuity subtend an angle of five minutes of arc, and the thickness of the lines and of the spaces between the lines subtends one minute of arc. This line, designated 6/6 (or 20/20), is the smallest line that a person with normal acuity can read at a distance of 6 metres. This definition is arbitrary, since human eyes typically have higher acuity, as Tscherning writes, \"We have found also that the best eyes have a visual acuity which approaches 2, and we can be almost certain that if, with a good illumination, the acuity is only equal to 1, the eye presents defects sufficiently pronounced to be easily established.\"</p>\n<p>Three lines above, the letters have twice the height of those letters on the 6/6 (or 20/20 in the US) line. If this is the smallest line a person can read, the person's acuity is \"6/12\" (\"20/40\"), meaning that this person needs to approach to a distance of 6 metres (20 ft) to read letters that a person with normal acuity could read at 12 metres (39 ft). In an even more approximate manner, this person could be said to have \"half\" the normal acuity of 6/6.</p>\n<p>At exactly 6 metre's distance from the patient, the letters on the 6/6 line shall subtend 5 minutes of arc (such that the individual limbs of the letters subtend 1 minute of arc), which means that the chart should be sized such that these letters are 8.73 mm tall and the topmost (6/60) \"E\" should be 87.3 mm tall. Putting it another way, the eye should be at a distance 68.76 times the height of the top (6/60) letter</p>\n<p>Acuity charts are used during many kinds of vision examinations, such as \"refracting\" the eye to determine the best eyeglass prescription.</p>\n<p>The largest letter on an eye chart often represents an acuity of 6/60 (20/200), the value that is considered \"legally blind\" in the US. Many individuals with high myopia cannot read the large E without glasses, but can read the 6/6 (20/20) line or 6/4.5 (20/15) line with glasses. By contrast, legally blind individuals have a visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or less when using the best corrective lens.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Fungal keratitis is a serious ocular infection with potentially catastrophic visual results. Caused by any of the many species of fungi capable of colonizing human tissue, its occurs worldwide and its incidence is increasing in frequency.</p>\n<p><strong>Etiology</strong></p>\n<p>The list covers many fungi including but not limited to yeasts of Candida spp., filamentous with septae such as Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Cladosporium,spp., Curvularia, and non septated such as Rhizopus. Bare in mind that any agent capable of infecting humans is a potential infectious agent, especially if the host has a debilitating disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>A high degree of suspicion from the physician accounts for early diagnosis and treatment, which are paramount for a successful resolution of the fungal keratitis. Corneal ulcers unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, the presence of satellite lesions, and scanty secretions in a large ulcer are some signs that should raise flags to the attending professional about the possibility of a mycotic agent.</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p>Blurred vision, redness, tearing, photophobia, pain, foreign body sensations, secretions related to trauma, ocular surface disease and topical steroid use are all important characteristics to ascertain in the history.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical examination</strong></p>\n<p>After establishing the patient's general condition, the examiner should look for evidence of ocular surface disease and determine the amount and type of secretions and lid swelling. The upper eyelid should be everted to exclude a retained foreign body. The examiner should measure the size and depth of the lesion as well as the presence of satellite lesions. The intraocular pressure should also be ascertained. Anterior chamber reaction and evidence of hypopyon should also be recorded. Vitreous reaction if present may suggest intraocular spread of the disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs</strong></p>\n<p>With filamentary fungi, the corneal lesions have a white/gray infiltrate with feathery borders. There might be satellite lesions with a hypopyon and conjunctival injection as well as purulent secretions. Ulcers caused by yeast are plaque-like and slightly more defined, similar to bacterial keratitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>Symptoms are similar to any corneal infection including blurred vision, redness, tearing, photophobia, pain, foreign body sensation and secretions. In some cases the lesion are rather indolent which help to delay the diagnosis and hence delay the treatment. Suspicion should be high in cases of trauma with vegetable matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Under the slit lamp, early on the lesion might look like an unhealed corneal abrasion with scanty infiltrates and no secretions. With time however, the ulcer develops thicker infiltrates and fuzzy margins. The presence of satellite lesions strongly suggests a fungal infection. Redness and periocular edema are also common. This combined with a history of trauma, especially with vegetable matter, ocular surface disease or chronic use of topical steroids should alert the practitioner to the possibility of a mycotic etiology.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnostic procedures</strong></p>\n<p>Corneal scrapings are taken from deep within the lesion with a surgical blade or sterile spatula. To perform a corneal biopsy, a dermatological 2mm punch can be used.</p>\n<p><strong>Laboratory test</strong></p>\n<p>For a definitive diagnosis, scrapings taken from deep within the lesion should be made and inoculated in Sabouraud agar. The shortcoming is that it can take up to 3 weeks to grow and identify the organism. For a faster result, smears with special stains such as Gomori, PAS, acridine orange, calcofluor white or KOH should be performed. The drawback is that not all laboratories have these stains available, so, again we might need to rely on the patient's evolution and the physician's clinical acumen. If all labs and cultures are negative, corneal biopsy should be considered to obtain a specimen.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\n<p>Risk factors include trauma, ocular surface disease, and topical steroid use. Risks and type of fungi also might vary by geographic location and climate. In warmer climates the rule is that the most common organisms are filamentous fungi, like Fusarium spp and Aspergillus spp. with a strong relationship to trauma. Reports from Brazil show the most common isolates in descending order were Fusarium spp in 67%, Aspergillus spp in 10.5%, and Candida spp in 10%. About 40% of the infections were related to trauma.</p>\n<p>In the northern USA, corneal infection by fungus was, until recently, more common in debilitated or immunocompromised patients and the causative organism being a yeast, such as Candida albicans. Filamentous fungi in these latitudes were then rarely reported. A few years ago a breakout of Fusarium keratitis associated with a type of contact lens solution displaced yeasts as the most common fungal corneal infection in some areas. This trend persists in the most recent epidemiological reports. Still they are, in most cases, related to contact lens use. It should be noted that the incidence of contact lens-related fungal keratitis was increasing before the Fusarium outbreak.</p>\n<p>This new distribution means that we no longer can rely on the geographical distribution only to initiate empirical treatment. Broad-spectrum treatment should be administered once there is a strong probability of a mycotic infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Hyphema (Incorrect)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hyphema is <strong>blood in the anterior chamber</strong>, not pus.</li>\n<li>It is usually due to <strong>blunt trauma</strong>, not trauma involving organic matter (fish tail).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option B: Aqueous Flare (Incorrect)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aqueous flare is <strong>protein leakage into the aqueous humor</strong> due to <strong>uveitis or inflammation</strong>.</li>\n<li>It does not present with <strong>hypopyon or fungal infiltrates</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option D: Conjunctivitis (Incorrect)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conjunctivitis causes <strong>redness, discharge, and itching</strong>, but <strong>does not cause hypopyon</strong>.</li>\n<li>It is not linked to <strong>deep corneal infection or trauma with organic material</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fungal keratitis</strong> should be suspected in cases of <strong>trauma with organic matter</strong> (e.g., fish tail, vegetable matter).</li>\n<li><strong>Hallmark signs:</strong> Feathery margins, satellite lesions, hypopyon, and delayed healing.</li>\n<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Corneal scrapings, Sabouraud agar culture, and special stains (KOH, PAS, Calcofluor white).</li>\n<li><strong>Prompt antifungal treatment</strong> (Natamycin or Voriconazole) is essential to prevent vision loss.</li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by a SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, a disease that was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. COVID-19, formerly known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease, was officially named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020. By 25 May 2021, there were 33,579,116 confirmed cases with 599,109 COVID-19 deaths worldwide. The purpose of this review article is to provide an update on what is currently known about COVID-19 ocular symptoms in adults, the elderly, and children in the literature. Finally, this article will review the eye protection precautions that should be implemented in our clinics. To assess the current literature, PubMed was searched from December 2019 to 25 May 2021. Randomized trials, observational studies, case series or case reports, letters of research, and letters to editors were selected for confirmed cases of COVID-19. According to current scientific literature since the outbreak in December 2019, 205 articles have been published. Conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, and chemosis have been reported in adults with COVID-19. There have been few studies on children and elderly patients, and further research in these age groups is needed. Finally, wearing eye protection when seeing patients on a daily basis during the pandemic is essential.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35434520/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35434520/</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Optic neuritis describes any condition that causes inflammation of the optic nerve; it may be associated with demyelinating diseases, or infectious or inflammatory processes.</p>\n<p>It is also known as optic papillitis (when the head of the optic nerve is involved), neuroretinitis (when there is a combined involvement of the optic disc and surrounding retina in the macular area) and retrobulbar neuritis (when the posterior part of the nerve is involved). Prelaminar optic neuritis describes involvement of the non-myelinated axons in the retina. It is most often associated with multiple sclerosis, and it may lead to complete or partial loss of vision in one or both eyes. Other causes include:</p>\n<p>Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy</p>\n<p>Parainfectious optic neuritis (associated with viral infections such as measles, mumps, chickenpox, whooping cough and glandular fever)</p>\n<p>Infectious optic neuritis (sinus related or associated with cat-scratch fever, tuberculosis, Lyme disease and cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients</p>\n<p>Autoimmune causes (sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, MOG antibody disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis)</p>\n<p>Diabetes mellitus</p>\n<p>Low phosphorus levels</p>\n<p>Hyperkalaemia</p>\n<p>Signs and symptoms</p>\n<p>Example of how optic neuritis affected one eye of a person with multiple sclerosis</p>\n<p>Major symptoms are sudden loss of vision (partial or complete), sudden blurred or \"foggy\" vision, and pain on movement of the affected eye. Early symptoms that require investigation include symptoms from multiple sclerosis (twitching, lack of coordination, slurred speech, frequent episodes of partial vision loss or blurred vision), episodes of \"disturbed/blackened\" rather than blurry indicate moderate stage and require immediate medical attention to prevent further loss of vision. Other early symptoms are reduced night vision, photophobia and red eyes. Many patients with optic neuritis may lose some of their color vision in the affected eye (especially red), with colors appearing subtly washed out compared to the other eye. Patients may also experience difficulties judging movement in depth, which can be particular troublesome during driving or sport (Pulfrich effect). Likewise, transient worsening of vision with increase of body temperature (Uhthoff's phenomenon) and glare disability are a frequent complaint. However, several case studies in children have demonstrated the absence of pain in more than half of cases (approximately 60%) in their pediatric study population, with the most common symptom reported simply as \"blurriness\". Other remarkable differences between the presentation of adult optic neuritis as compared to pediatric cases include more often unilateral optic neuritis in adults, while children much predominantly present with bilateral involvement.</p>\n<p>On medical examination the head of the optic nerve can easily be visualized by a slit lamp with a high positive lens or by using direct ophthalmoscopy; however, frequently there is no abnormal appearance of the nerve head in optic neuritis (in cases of retrobulbar optic neuritis), though it may be swollen in some patients (anterior papillitis or more extensive optic neuritis). In many cases, only one eye is affected, and patients may not be aware of the loss of color vision until they are asked to close or cover the healthy eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>\n<p>The optic nerve comprises axons that emerge from the retina of the eye and carry visual information to the primary visual nuclei, most of which is relayed to the occipital cortex of the brain to be processed into vision. Inflammation of the optic nerve causes loss of vision, usually because of the swelling and destruction of the myelin sheath covering the optic nerve.</p>\n<p>The most common cause is multiple sclerosis (MS) or ischemic optic neuropathy due to thrombosis or embolism of the vessel that supplies the optic nerve. Up to 50% of patients with MS will develop an episode of optic neuritis, and 20-30% of the time optic neuritis is the presenting sign of MS.[citation needed] The presence of demyelinating white matter lesions on brain MRI at the time of presentation of optic neuritis is the strongest predictor for developing clinically definite MS. Almost half of the patients with optic neuritis have white matter lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis.</p>\n<p>Some other common causes of optic neuritis include infection (e.g. a tooth abscess in the upper jaw, syphilis, Lyme disease, herpes zoster), autoimmune disorders (e.g. lupus, neurosarcoidosis, neuromyelitis optica), methanol poisoning, vitamin B12 deficiency, beriberi, dysautonomia (i.e. autonomic nervous system dysfunction), and diabetes, or an injury to the eye. In neuromyelitis optica higher AQP4 autoantibody levels are associated with the occurrence of optic neuritis.</p>\n<p>Less common causes are: papilledema, brain tumor or abscess in the occipital region, cerebral trauma or hemorrhage, meningitis, arachnoidal adhesions, sinus thrombosis, liver dysfunction, or late stage kidney disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>\n<p>In most MS-associated optic neuritis, visual function spontaneously improves over 2-3 months, and there is evidence that corticosteroid treatment does not affect the long term outcome. However, for optic neuritis that is not MS-associated (or atypical optic neuritis) the evidence is less clear and therefore the threshold for treatment with intravenous corticosteroids is lower. Intravenous corticosteroids also reduce the risk of developing MS in the following two years in patients with MRI lesions; but this effect disappears by the third year of follow up.</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, oral administration of corticosteroids in this situation may lead to more recurrent attacks than in non-treated patients (though oral steroids are generally prescribed after the intravenous course, to wean the patient off the medication). This effect of corticosteroids seems to be limited to optic neuritis and has not been observed in other diseases treated with corticosteroids.</p>\n<p>A Cochrane systematic review studied the effect of corticosteroids for treating people with acute optic neuritis. Specific corticosteroids studied included intravenous and oral methylprednisone, and oral prednisone. The authors conclude that current evidence does not show a benefit of either intravenous or oral corticosteroids for rate of recovery of vision (in terms of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, or visual fields). There are a number of reasons why this might be the case. </p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Multiple Myeloma is the cause</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optic neuritis</strong> is commonly associated with <strong>Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</strong>, infections, autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, sarcoidosis), and vitamin B12 deficiency.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple myeloma</strong> is NOT a direct cause of optic neuritis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option C: Painless</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One of the hallmark symptoms of optic neuritis is <strong>pain</strong>, especially during eye movements.</li>\n<li>Painless vision loss is more common in conditions like ischemic optic neuropathy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option D: Oral Steroids is DOC</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intravenous (IV) corticosteroids</strong> (e.g., methylprednisolone) are preferred for treatment.</li>\n<li><strong>Oral steroids alone may actually increase the risk of recurrent optic neuritis</strong>, as shown in the ONTT (Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial).</li>\n<li><strong>Oral steroids may be used after IV therapy for tapering but are not the first-line treatment.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>RAPD is the earliest clinical sign of optic neuritis</li>\n<li>Optic neuritis is often associated with MS, NOT multiple myeloma</li>\n<li>Optic neuritis is painful, NOT painless</li>\n<li>IV steroids (not oral) are the preferred treatment</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_neuritis\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_neuritis</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Keratoconus (KC) is a disorder of the eye that results in progressive thinning of the cornea. This may result in blurry vision, double vision, nearsightedness, irregular astigmatism, and light sensitivity leading to poor quality-of-life. Usually both eyes are affected. In more severe cases a scarring or a circle may be seen within the cornea.</p>\n<p>While the cause is unknown, it is believed to occur due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors. Patients with a parent, sibling, or child who has keratoconus have 15 to 67 times higher risk in developing corneal ectasia compared to patients with no affected relatives. Proposed environmental factors include rubbing the eyes and allergies. The underlying mechanism involves changes of the cornea to a cone shape. Diagnosis is most often by topography. Topography measures the curvature of the cornea and creates a colored \"map\" of the cornea. Keratoconus causes very distinctive changes in the appearance of these maps, which allows doctors to make the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Initially the condition can typically be corrected with glasses or soft contact lenses. As the disease progresses, special contact lenses (such as scleral contact lenses) may be required. In most people the disease stabilizes after a few years without severe vision problems. In 2016, the FDA approved corneal collagen cross-linking to halt the progression of keratoconus. In some cases, when the cornea becomes dangerously thin or when sufficient vision can no longer be achieved by contact lenses due to steepening of the cornea, scarring or lens intolerance, corneal cross-linking is not an option and a corneal transplant may be required.</p>\n<p>Keratoconus affects about 1 in 2,000 people. However, some estimates suggest that the incidence may be as high as 1 in 400 individuals. It occurs most commonly in late childhood to early adulthood. While it occurs in all populations it may be more frequent in certain ethnic groups such as those of Asian descent. The word is from the Greek keras meaning cornea and the Latin conus meaning cone.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>A schematic diagram showing change in cornea</p>\n<p>Corneal topographer, used for mapping the surface curvature of the cornea</p>\n<p>Prior to any physical examination, the diagnosis of keratoconus frequently begins with an ophthalmologist's or optometrist's assessment of the person's medical history, particularly the chief complaint and other visual symptoms, the presence of any history of ocular disease or injury that might affect vision, and the presence of any family history of ocular disease. An eye chart, such as a standard Snellen chart of progressively smaller letters, is then used to determine the person's visual acuity. The eye examination may proceed to measurement of the localized curvature of the cornea with a manual keratometer, with detection of irregular astigmatism suggesting a possibility of keratoconus. Severe cases can exceed the instrument's measuring ability. A further indication can be provided by retinoscopy, in which a light beam is focused on the person's retina and the reflection, or reflex, observed as the examiner tilts the light source back and forth. Keratoconus is amongst the ophthalmic conditions that exhibit a scissor reflex action of two bands moving toward and away from each other like the blades of a pair of scissors.</p>\n<p>If keratoconus is suspected, the ophthalmologist or optometrist will search for other characteristic findings of the disease by means of slit lamp examination of the cornea. An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a Fleischer ring can be observed in around half of keratoconic eyes. The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide hemosiderin within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a cobalt blue filter. Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt's striae, fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning. The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball. A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the lower eyelid when the person's gaze is directed downwards, known as Munson's sign. Other clinical signs of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson's sign becomes apparent, and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.</p>\n<p>A handheld keratoscope, sometimes known as \"Placido's disk\", can provide a simple noninvasive visualization of the surface of the cornea by projecting a series of concentric rings of light onto the cornea. A more definitive diagnosis can be obtained using corneal topography, in which an automated instrument projects the illuminated pattern onto the cornea and determines its topography from analysis of the digital image. The topographical map indicates any distortions or scarring in the cornea, with keratoconus revealed by a characteristic steepening of curvature that is usually below the centerline of the eye. The technique can record a snapshot of the degree and extent of the deformation as a benchmark for assessing its rate of progression. It is of particular value in detecting the disorder in its early stages when other signs have not yet presented</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A: </strong>Munson sign - Munson sign is a V-shaped indentation of the lower eyelid seen in advanced keratoconus when the patient looks downward.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C:</strong> Scissor reflex on retinoscopy - A scissor reflex is observed in keratoconus due to irregular astigmatism and corneal distortion.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D:</strong> Irregular astigmatism - Irregular astigmatism is a hallmark feature of keratoconus due to the progressive corneal thinning and bulging.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Keratoconus is characterized by progressive corneal thinning, leading to irregular astigmatism, Munson sign, and a scissor reflex on retinoscopy. Haab's striae, associated with congenital glaucoma, are not seen in keratoconus.</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus</p>",

      "solution": "<p>A pterygium of the eye (plural pterygia or pterygiums, also called surfer's eye) is a pinkish, roughly triangular tissue growth of the conjunctiva onto the cornea of the eye. It typically starts on the cornea near the nose. It may slowly grow but rarely grows so large that it covers the pupil and impairs vision. Often both eyes are involved.</p>\n<p>The cause is unclear. It appears to be partly related to long term exposure to UV light and dust. Genetic factors also appear to be involved. It is a benign growth. Other conditions that can look similar include a pinguecula, tumor, or Terrien's marginal corneal degeneration.</p>\n<p>Prevention may include wearing sunglasses and a hat if in an area with strong sunlight. Among those with the condition, an eye lubricant can help with symptoms. Surgical removal is typically only recommended if the ability to see is affected. Following surgery a pterygium may recur in around half of cases.</p>\n<p>The frequency of the condition varies from 1% to 33% in various regions of the world. It occurs more commonly among males than females and in people who live closer to the equator. The condition becomes more common with age. The condition has been described since at least 1000 BC.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>Small pterygium</p>\n<p>Large primary pterygium invading the pupil (visual axis)</p>\n<p>Symptoms of pterygium include persistent redness, inflammation, foreign body sensation, tearing, dry and itchy eyes. In advanced cases the pterygium can affect vision as it invades the cornea with the potential of obscuring the optical center of the cornea and inducing astigmatism and corneal scarring. Many patients do complain of the cosmetic appearance of the eye either with some of the symptoms above or as their major complaint. The use of standard contact lenses can become uncomfortable or even impossible although custom shaping may improve the fit to some extent.[citation needed]</p>\n<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>\n<p>The exact cause is unknown, but it is associated with excessive exposure to wind, sunlight, or sand. Therefore, it is more likely to occur in populations that inhabit the areas near the equator, as well as windy locations. In addition, pterygia are twice as likely to occur in men than women.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong></p>\n<p>Micrograph of a conjunctiva associated with prominent blood vessels (left-bottom of image) and elastotic collagen (centre of image), as may be seen in a pterygium. H&amp;E stain.</p>\n<p>Pterygium in the conjunctiva is characterized by elastotic degeneration of collagen (actinic elastosis) and fibrovascular proliferation. It has an advancing portion called the head of the pterygium, which is connected to the main body of the pterygium by the neck. Sometimes a line of iron deposition can be seen adjacent to the head of the pterygium called Stocker's line. The location of the line can give an indication of the pattern of growth.</p>\n<p>The predominance of pterygia on the nasal side is possibly a result of peripheral light focusing, where the sun's rays passing laterally through the cornea, where they undergo refraction and become focused on the limbic area. Sunlight passes unobstructed from the lateral side of the eye, focusing on the medial limbus after passing through the cornea. On the contralateral (medial) side, however, the shadow of the nose medially reduces the intensity of sunlight focused on the lateral/temporal limbus.</p>\n<p>Some research also suggests a genetic predisposition due to an expression of vimentin, which indicates cellular migration by the keratoblasts embryological development, which are the cells that give rise to the layers of the cornea. Supporting this fact is the congenital pterygium, in which pterygium is seen in infants. These cells also exhibit an increased P53 expression likely due to a deficit in the tumor suppressor gene. These indications give the impression of a migrating limbus because the cellular origin of the pterygium is actually initiated by the limbal epithelium.</p>\n<p><strong>The pterygium is composed of several segments:</strong></p>\n<p>Fuch's Patches (minute gray blemishes that disperse near the pterygium head)</p>\n<p>Stocker's Line (a brownish line composed of iron deposits)</p>\n<p>Hood (fibrous nonvascular portion of the pterygium)</p>\n<p>Head (apex of the pterygium, typically raised and highly vascular)</p>\n<p>Body (fleshy elevated portion congested with tortuous vessels)</p>\n<p>Superior Edge (upper edge of the triangular or wing-shaped portion of the pterygium)</p>\n<p>Inferior Edge (lower edge of the triangular or wing-shaped portion of the pterygium).</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Pterygium (conjunctiva) can be diagnosed without need for a specific exam, however corneal topography is a practical test (technique) as the condition worsens.</p>\n<p><strong>Differential Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Pterygium should be differentiated from pinguecula, which is histologically and etiologically similar to pterygium. Unlike pterygium, pinguecula is seen only on the conjunctiva, it will not progress to limbus or cornea.</p>\n<p>Another condition which is similar to pterygium is inflammatory adhesion of conjunctiva to cornea known as pseudopterygium. Unlike pterygium, it may occur anywhere around cornea and the adhesion is usually limited to its apex.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention</strong></p>\n<p>As it is associated with excessive sun or wind exposure, wearing protective sunglasses with side shields and/or wide brimmed hats and using artificial tears throughout the day may help prevent their formation or stop further growth. Surfers and other water-sport athletes should wear eye protection that blocks 100% of the UV rays from the water, as is often used by snow-sport athletes. Many of those who are at greatest risk of pterygium from work or play sun exposure do not understand the importance of protection.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>\n<p>A pterygium typically does not require surgery unless it grows to such an extent that it causes visual problems. Some of the symptoms such as irritation can be addressed with artificial tears. Surgery may also be considered for unmanageable symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Surgery</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pterygium removal surgery</strong></p>\n<p>A Cochrane review found conjunctival autograft surgery was less likely to have reoccurrence of the pterygium at 6 months compared to amniotic membrane transplant. More research is needed to determine which type of surgery resulted in better vision or quality of life.The additional use of mitomycin C is of unclear effect. Radiotherapy has also been used in an attempt to reduce the risk of recurrence.</p>\n<p><strong>Auto-grafting</strong></p>\n<p>Conjunctival auto-grafting is a surgical technique that is an effective and safe procedure for pterygium removal. When the pterygium is removed, the tissue that covers the sclera known as the Tenons layer is also removed. Auto-grafting covers the bare sclera with conjunctival tissue that is surgically removed from an area of healthy conjunctiva. That \"self-tissue\" is then transplanted to the bare sclera and is attached using sutures or tissue adhesive.</p>\n<p><strong>Amniotic membrane transplantation</strong></p>\n<p>Amniotic membrane transplantation is an effective and safe procedure for pterygium removal. Amniotic membrane transplantation offers practical alternative to conjunctival auto graft transplantation for extensive pterygium removal. Amniotic membrane transplantation is tissue that is acquired from the innermost layer of the human placenta and has been used to replace and heal damaged mucosal surfaces including successful reconstruction of the ocular surface. It has been used as a surgical material since the 1940s, and has been shown to have a strong anti-adhesive effect.</p>\n<p>Using an amniotic graft facilitates epithelialization, and has anti-inflammatory as well as surface rejuvenation properties. Amniotic membrane transplantation can also be attached to the sclera using sutures, or glue adhesive. Amniotic membrane by itself does not provide an acceptable recurrence rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A :</strong> Consist of head, neck, and body - Pterygium consists of distinct anatomical parts, including the head, neck, and body.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C :</strong> Progressive and regressive type - Pterygium can be classified as either progressive, where it actively grows towards the cornea, or regressive, where growth remains static or decreases.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D :</strong> Elastoid degeneration of collagen - Pterygium is characterized by elastoid degeneration of collagen (actinic elastosis), which contributes to its fibrovascular growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Pterygium is a fibrovascular growth of the conjunctiva that can be progressive or regressive and involves elastoid degeneration of collagen. Simple excision alone does not effectively prevent recurrence, making adjunctive measures necessary for long-term success.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygium_(eye)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygium_(eye)</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Diagnosis of POAG requires assessment of:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Intraocular pressure</p>\r\n<p>Open - normal appearing anterior chamber angle</p>\r\n<p>Characteristics signs of optic disc damage</p>\r\n<p>Visual function loss on perimetry</p>\r\n<p>Frequently, the diagnosis is not clear-cut and the patient may present with some risk factors and signs, but not others. In such cases, the patient may be labeled as a glaucoma suspect. These patients require repeat assessments at regular intervals with the frequency of visits dependent upon index of suspicion.</p>\r\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\r\n<p>The majority of patients with POAG are asymptomatic. Typically, patients are only symptomatic in late disease, when they may become aware of constricted visual field or blurred vision. Occasionally, patients become aware of earlier visual field defects when performing monocular tasks (such as using the viewfinder of a camera). More frequently, patients are usually diagnosed as part of a routine eye test or as an incidental finding when presenting with another ophthalmic condition (e.g. diabetic retinopathy). A detailed general history would reveal any causes of secondary glaucomas (and therefore refuting POAG), such as steroid usage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Physical examination</strong></p>\r\n<p>Physical examination consists of assessment of IOP, anterior chamber angle, optic disc and visual field.</p>\r\n<p><strong>IOP</strong></p>\r\n<p>The gold standard for IOP measurement is Goldmann Applanation Tonometry (GAT). This is not available in all instances, and non-contact tonometry is also frequently used. In the UK, this is certainly true in the community where optometrist's preferred method of IOP measurement is non-contact.</p>\r\n<p>Almost standard now, in conjunction with tonometry, is the measurement of central corneal thickness (CCT). Theoretically, a thinner cornea may lead to measurements that under-estimate true IOP and vice versa. However, the effect of CCT on IOP measurement is not predictable, and there is no consensus as to the degree of under- or over-estimation of IOP that occurs with thinner or thicker corneas. Moreover, CCT is only one biomechanical attribute of a cornea. For example, a thin cornea that is very stiff may still result in over-estimation of IOP.</p>\r\n<p>Newer methods of IOP measurement aim to overcome variations in corneal biomechanics and give a more accurate estimate of true IOP. These include the Reichert Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA) and the Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer (DCT). The ORA is a non-contact tonometer that measures a biomechanical attribute of the cornea termed hysteresis. The DCT uses uses principle of contour matching instead of applanation to reduce the effect of corneal biomechanics.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on tonometry, please see the section Intraocular Pressure and Tonometry.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Anterior chamber angle</strong></p>\r\n<p>The anterior chamber angle is assessed clinically using the slit lamp (Van Herick technique) and with gonioscopy. Newer techniques for angle assessment include UBM (Ultrasound Biomicroscopy) and AS-OCT (Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Optic disc</strong></p>\r\n<p>Clinical examination of the optic disc is a very important part of the assessment of patients with POAG. Direct ophthalmoscopy offers the most magnified view of the optic disc, but the view is not stereoscopic. Slit lamp biomicroscopy with a lens that offers large magnification (e.g. 60 dioptre or super 66) has the advantage of giving a stereoscopic view. Stereoscopic disc photographs offer a useful documentation of optic disc status, and also allow masked assessment in trials. Clinical assessment of an optic disc is still considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of POAG, though the inter-observer agreement is notoriously variable. Therefore, there is a drive for more objective optic disc assessment such as Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT) and Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT). Assessment of the nerve fiber layer surrounding the disc by the GDx is also useful.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visual field</strong></p>\r\n<p>Automated static threshold perimetry (e.g. Humphrey field analysis) is the gold standard for diagnosis and monitoring of POAG. Various testing algorithms have been validated for POAG and allow reduced testing time for patients (e.g. Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm, SITA). Patients with early POAG may have normal visual fields on testing, and it has been estimated that 50% of ganglion cells need to be lost before a field defect becomes apparent. This rationale has led to development of new perimetric tests such as short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) and frequency doubling technology (FDT), which may be able to enhance earlier detection of functional loss by targeting a specific subset of ganglion cells that have sparse distribution.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Signs</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>IOP</strong></p>\r\n<p>The International Society for Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology has published a consensus definition for POAG. This definition does not include IOP - i.e. POAG is diagnosed based on signs of glaucomatous optic neuropathy regardless of the level of IOP. Patients can be classified as normal tension glaucoma (NTG) or high tension glaucoma (HTG) based on the IOP. Sometimes an IOP spike may be missed in a clinical setting. In these cases, if HTG is suspected, measurement of IOP at hourly intervals throughout the day, beginning in the early morning, may be indicated. This is termed phasing. If a patient has all the features of POAG but consistently normal IOPs (less than or equal to 21 mmHg), this is considered NTG (discussed further in another section).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Anterior chamber angle</strong></p>\r\n<p>By definition, the anterior chamber angle of POAG patients is open. The Van Herick test provides an estimate of anterior chamber depth peripherally and reveals an irido-corneal distance of greater than 25% of corneal thickness. Gonioscopy is essential to make the diagnosis of POAG and should be performed on the initial visit.&nbsp; Various classifications systems have been described to assess the extent of an open angle. Gonioscopy helps to differentiate POAG from secondary open angle glaucomas (such as pigment dispersion in pigmentary glaucoma or neovascularization of the angle in neovascular glaucoma).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Optic disc</strong></p>\r\n<p>Optic disc changes seen on clinical examination of patients with POAG include:</p>\r\n<p>High cup:disc ratio (Figures 1 and 2)</p>\r\n<p>Cup:disc ratio asymmetry between eyes (usually considered significant if greater than 0.2)</p>\r\n<p>Vertical elongation of cup</p>\r\n<p>Focal neuro-retinal rim thinning or notching (Figure 1)</p>\r\n<p>Vessel bayoneting (Figure 2)</p>\r\n<p>Beta-zone peripapillary atrophy</p>\r\n<p>Disc hemorrhage</p>\r\n<p><strong>Clinical diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n<p>Advanced POAG is a relatively clinical diagnosis. Patients will have undisputable characteristic optic nerve damage and restricted visual fields. However, visual function loss from POAG is irreversible; therefore, it is critical to diagnose this disease as early as possible and prevent further loss of vision. Diagnosis of early POAG is more difficult. Optic disc changes or visual field abnormalities may be more equivocal. When the evidence for POAG is not compelling enough to commence therapy, the patient is referred to as a glaucoma suspect and reviewed regularly to watch for any signs of progression. An experienced clinician is able to assess clinical examination findings in conjunction with investigation results and make a decision as to the diagnosis. Clinical findings corresponding with investigative findings add weight to the diagnosis of POAG. For example, Figure 1 shows the left optic disc of a patient, and Figure 3 shows the left visual field of the same patient. The thinning of the superior neuro-retinal rim of the optic disc corresponds well with the dense inferior arcuate scotoma in the visual field. This provides strong evidence for glaucoma.</p>\r\n<p>Another important characteristic of POAG is that it is a progressive disease. If optic disc appearances and visual field changes are static on no therapy, this would count against a diagnosis of glaucoma.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Option A:</strong> Increased C:D ratio - POAG is characterized by an increased cup-to-disc (C:D) ratio due to progressive optic nerve damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option B:</strong> Bayonetting sign - This refers to a sharp angulation of blood vessels as they pass over the cupped optic disc, commonly seen in glaucoma.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D:</strong> Cupping - Optic nerve cupping (enlargement of the central depression in the optic disc) is a hallmark sign of glaucoma.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<p>POAG is associated with progressive optic nerve damage, leading to cupping, an increased C:D ratio, and characteristic visual field defects like nasal steps and arcuate scotomas. However, \"Roen's central nasal step\" is not a recognized feature of POAG.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://eyewiki.aao.org/Primary_Open-Angle_Glaucoma\">https://eyewiki.aao.org/Primary_Open-Angle_Glaucoma</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is the formation of a blood clot within the cavernous sinus, a cavity at the base of the brain which drains deoxygenated blood from the brain back to the heart. This is a rare disorder and can be of two types-septic cavernous thrombosis and aseptic cavernous thrombosis. The most common form is septic cavernous sinus thrombosis. The cause is usually from a spreading infection in the nose, sinuses, ears, or teeth. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus are often the associated bacteria.[citation needed]</p>\n<p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis symptoms include: decrease or loss of vision, chemosis, exophthalmos (bulging eyes), headaches, and paralysis of the cranial nerves which course through the cavernous sinus. This infection is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment, which usually includes antibiotics and sometimes surgical drainage. Aseptic cavernous sinus thrombosis is usually associated with trauma, dehydration, anemia, and other disorders.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>The clinical presentation of CST can be varied. Both acute, fulminant disease, and indolent, subacute presentations have been reported in the literature. The most common signs of CST are related to anatomical structures affected within the cavernous sinus, notably cranial nerves III-VI, as well as symptoms resulting from impaired venous drainage from the orbit and eye. Classic presentations are abrupt onset of unilateral periorbital edema, headache, photophobia, and bulging of the eye (exophthalmos).</p>\n<p><strong>Other common signs and symptoms include:</strong></p>\n<p>Ptosis, chemosis, cranial nerve palsies (III, IV, V, VI). Sixth nerve palsy is the most common. Sensory deficits of the ophthalmic and maxillary branch of the fifth nerve are common. Periorbital sensory loss and impaired corneal reflex may be noted. Papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, and decreased visual acuity and blindness may occur from venous congestion within the retina. Fever, tachycardia and sepsis may be present. Headache with nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness) may occur. One or both pupils may be dilated and sluggishly reactive. Infection can spread to contralateral cavernous sinus within 24-48 hours of initial presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>\n<p>Septic CST most commonly results from contiguous spread of infection from a nasal furuncle (50%), sphenoidal or ethmoidal sinuses (30%) and dental infections (10%). Less common primary sites of infection include tonsils, soft palate, middle ear, or orbit (orbital cellulitis). The highly anastomotic venous system of the paranasal sinuses allows retrograde spread of infection to the cavernous sinus via the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins. It was previously thought that veins in the area were valveless and that this was the major cause of the retrograde spread, but studies have since shown that the ophthalmic and facial veins are not valveless.</p>\n<p>Staphylococcus aureus is the most common infectious microbe, found in 70% of the cases. Streptococcus is the second leading cause. Gram-negative rods and anaerobes may also lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis. Rarely, Aspergillus fumigatus and mucormycosis cause CST.[citation needed]</p>\n<p>Aseptic cavernous sinus thrombosis is much less common and is usually associated with other disorders including trauma, circulatory problems, nasopharynx cancers and other tumors of the skull base, dehydration, and anemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>The diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis is made clinically, with imaging studies to confirm the clinical impression. Proptosis, ptosis, chemosis, and cranial nerve palsy beginning in one eye and progressing to the other eye establish the diagnosis. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a clinical diagnosis with laboratory tests and imaging studies confirming the clinical impression.</p>\n<p><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></p>\n<p>CBC, ESR, blood cultures and sinus cultures help establish and identify an infectious primary source. Lumbar puncture is necessary to rule out meningitis.[citation needed]</p>\n<p><strong>Imaging studies</strong></p>\n<p>Sinus films are helpful in the diagnosis of sphenoid sinusitis. Opacification, sclerosis, and air-fluid levels are typical findings. Contrast-enhanced CT scan may reveal underlying sinusitis, thickening of the superior ophthalmic vein, and irregular filling defects within the cavernous sinus; however, findings may be normal early in the disease course. An MRI using flow parameters and an MR venogram are more sensitive than a CT scan and are the imaging studies of choice to diagnose cavernous sinus thrombosis. Findings may include deformity of the internal carotid artery within the cavernous sinus, and an obvious signal hyperintensity within thrombosed vascular sinuses on all pulse sequences. Cerebral angiography can be performed, but it is invasive and not very sensitive. Orbital venography is difficult to perform, but it is excellent in diagnosing occlusion of the cavernous sinus.</p>\n<p><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Orbital cellulitis</p>\n<p>Internal carotid artery aneurysm</p>\n<p>Stroke</p>\n<p>Migraine headache</p>\n<p>Allergic blepharitis</p>\n<p>Thyroid exophthalmos</p>\n<p>Brain tumor</p>\n<p>Meningitis</p>\n<p>Mucormycosis</p>\n<p>Trauma</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The cavernous sinus contains the internal carotid artery and cranial nerves III, IV, V (ophthalmic and maxillary divisions), and VI.

      "solution": "<p>The parietal lobe is one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex in the brain of mammals. The parietal lobe is positioned above the temporal lobe and behind the frontal lobe and central sulcus.</p>\n<p>The parietal lobe integrates sensory information among various modalities, including spatial sense and navigation (proprioception), the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch in the somatosensory cortex which is just posterior to the central sulcus in the postcentral gyrus, and the dorsal stream of the visual system. The major sensory inputs from the skin (touch, temperature, and pain receptors), relay through the thalamus to the parietal lobe.</p>\n<p>Several areas of the parietal lobe are important in language processing. The somatosensory cortex can be illustrated as a distorted figure - the cortical homunculus (Latin: \"little man\") in which the body parts are rendered according to how much of the somatosensory cortex is devoted to them. The superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule are the primary areas of body or spatial awareness. A lesion commonly in the right superior or inferior parietal lobule leads to hemineglect.</p>\n<p><strong>Functions of the parietal lobe include:</strong></p>\n<p>Two point discrimination - through touch alone without other sensory input (e.g. visual)</p>\n<p>Graphesthesia - recognizing writing on skin by touch alone</p>\n<p>Touch localization (bilateral simultaneous stimulation)</p>\n<p>The parietal lobe plays important roles in integrating sensory information from various parts of the body, knowledge of numbers and their relations, and in the manipulation of objects. Its function also includes processing information relating to the sense of touch. Portions of the parietal lobe are involved with visuospatial processing. Although multisensory in nature, the posterior parietal cortex is often referred to by vision scientists as the dorsal stream of vision (as opposed to the ventral stream in the temporal lobe). This dorsal stream has been called both the \"where\" stream (as in spatial vision) and the \"how\" stream (as in vision for action). The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) receives somatosensory and visual input, which then, through motor signals, controls movement of the arm, hand, and eyes.</p>\n<p>Various studies in the 1990s found that different regions of the posterior parietal cortex in macaques represent different parts of space.</p>\n<p>The lateral intraparietal (LIP) area contains a map of neurons (retinotopically-coded when the eyes are fixed) representing the saliency of spatial locations, and attention to these spatial locations. It can be used by the oculomotor system for targeting eye movements, when appropriate. </p>\n<p>The ventral intraparietal (VIP) area receives input from a number of senses (visual, somatosensory, auditory, and vestibular). Neurons with tactile receptive fields represent space in a head-centered reference frame. The cells with visual receptive fields also fire with head-centered reference frames but possibly also with eye-centered coordinates</p>\n<p>The medial intraparietal (MIP) area neurons encode the location of a reach target in eye-centered coordinates.</p>\n<p>The anterior intraparietal (AIP) area contains neurons responsive to shape, size, and orientation of objects to be grasped as well as for manipulation of the hands themselves, both to viewed and remembered stimuli. The AIP has neurons that are responsible for grasping and manipulating objects through motor and visual inputs. The AIP and ventral premotor together are responsible for visuomotor transformations for actions of the hand.</p>\n<p>More recent fMRI studies have shown that humans have similar functional regions in and around the intraparietal sulcus and parietal-occipital junction. The human \"parietal eye fields\" and \"parietal reach region\", equivalent to LIP and MIP in the monkey, also appear to be organized in gaze-centered coordinates so that their goal-related activity is \"remapped\" when the eyes move.</p>\n<p>Emerging evidence has linked processing in the inferior parietal lobe to declarative memory. Bilateral damage to this brain region does not cause amnesia however the strength of memory is diminished, details of complex events become harder to retrieve, and subjective confidence in memory is very low. This has been interpreted as reflecting either deficits in internal attention, deficits in subjective memory states, or problems with the computation that allows evidence to accumulate, thus allowing decisions to be made about internal representations.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical significance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Features of parietal lobe lesions are as follows:</strong></p>\n<p>Unilateral parietal lobe</p>\n<p>Contralateral hemisensory loss</p>\n<p>Astereognosis - inability to determine 3-D shape by touch.</p>\n<p>Agraphaesthesia - inability to read numbers or letters drawn on hand, with eyes shut.</p>\n<p>Contralateral homonymous inferior quadrantanopia</p>\n<p>Asymmetry of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN)</p>\n<p>Sensory seizures</p>\n<p>Dominant hemisphere</p>\n<p>Conduction aphasia</p>\n<p>Dyslexia - a general term for disorders that can involve difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters, and other symbols</p>\n<p>Apraxia - inability to perform complex movements in the presence of normal motor, sensory and cerebellar function</p>\n<p>Gerstmann syndrome - characterized by acalculia, agraphia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation</p>\n<p>Non-dominant hemisphere</p>\n<p>Contralateral hemispatial neglect</p>\n<p>Constructional apraxia</p>\n<p>Dress apraxia</p>\n<p>Anosognosia - lack of awareness of the existence of one's disability</p>\n<p>Bilateral hemispheres</p>\n<p><strong>Balint's syndrome</strong></p>\n<p>Damage to this lobe in the right hemisphere results in the loss of imagery, visualization of spatial relationships and neglect of left-side space and left side of the body. Even drawings may be neglected on the left side. Damage to this lobe in the left hemisphere will result in problems in mathematics, long reading, writing, and understanding symbols. The parietal association cortex enables individuals to read, write, and solve mathematical problems. The sensory inputs from the right side of the body go to the left side of the brain and vice versa.</p>\n<p>The syndrome of hemispatial neglect is usually associated with large deficits of attention of the non-dominant hemisphere. Optic ataxia is associated with difficulties reaching toward objects in the visual field opposite to the side of the parietal damage. Some aspects of optic ataxia have been explained in terms of the functional organization described above.</p>\n<p>Apraxia is a disorder of motor control which can be referred neither to \"elemental\" motor deficits nor to general cognitive impairment. The concept of apraxia was shaped by Hugo Liepmann about a hundred years ago.[clarification needed] Apraxia is predominantly a symptom of left brain damage, but some symptoms of apraxia can also occur after right brain damage.</p>\n<p>Amorphosynthesis is a loss of perception on one side of the body caused by a lesion in the parietal lobe. Usually, left-sided lesions cause agnosia, a full-body loss of perception, while right-sided lesions cause lack of recognition of the person's left side and extrapersonal space. The term amorphosynthesis was coined by D. Denny-Brown to describe patients he studied in the 1950s.</p>\n<p>Can also result in sensory impairment where one of the affected person's senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste and spatial awareness) is no longer normal</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Pre-motor cortex</strong> - The pre-motor cortex is involved in planning and execution of movements but does not primarily contribute to spatial attention or neglect syndromes.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Right Parietal Lobe</strong> - While the right parietal lobe is involved in spatial processing, hemineglect is more specifically associated with damage to the right <strong>temporo-parietal junction</strong>, rather than the parietal lobe alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C: Left temporo-parietal lobe</strong> - Damage to the <strong>left</strong> temporo-parietal lobe does not typically cause hemineglect, as the right hemisphere plays a dominant role in spatial awareness.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Right temporo-parietal damage causes <strong>left hemineglect</strong>, a condition where patients fail to attend to the left side of space or their body. The right hemisphere is dominant for spatial awareness, and its impairment leads to severe neglect on the left side.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Pineoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the pineal gland. A pineoblastoma is a supratentorial midline primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Pineoblastoma can present at any age, but is most common in young children. They account for 0.001% of all primary CNS neoplasms.</p>\n<p><strong>Epidemiology</strong></p>\n<p>Pineoblastomas typically occur at very young ages. One study found the average age of presentation to be 4.3 years, with peaks at age 3 and 8. Another cites cases to more commonly occur in patients under 2 years of age. Rates of occurrence for males and females are similar, but may be slightly more common in females. One study found incidence of pineoblastoma to be increased in black patients compared to white patients by around 71%. This difference was most apparent in patients aged 5 to 9 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical Features</strong></p>\n<p>The most common symptoms to occur with pineoblastoma are headache, behavior changes, and cognitive disturbances. These masses also often cause obstructive hydrocephalus, leading to increased intracranial pressure. This can result in vision changes and Parinaud's syndrome.</p>\n<p>Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, tumor spread at the time of diagnosis is common. Pineoblastomas often invades locally, with spread to the head and spine seen in 25-41% of patients. While CNS spread is relatively common, these tumors rarely cause distant metastases.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Histology of pineoblastoma</strong></p>\n<p>Several imaging methods can be used to diagnose pineoblastoma. Initially, urgent CTs are recommended, followed by MR imaging. CT will show large, multilobulated masses with heterogenous contrast enhancement and peripheral calcification of the pineal gland. On MRI, pineoblastomas again appear as masses with heterogenous enhancement. They often appear hypo- to isointense on T1 and slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Some areas of necrosis or hemorrhage may be seen as well. PET-CT has also been used in diagnosis, and shows increased uptake of fludeoxyglucose with pineoblastomas compared to other pineal masses.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis also requires CSF sampling via lumbar puncture to assess for cytology and tumor markers.</p>\n<p>Biopsy is required for diagnosis. Pineoblastomas appear as high grade, highly cellular, small blue cells histologically. Features of aggressive malignancies can be seen, like high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ration, poorly differentiated cells, high mitotic activity, and necrosis. Homer Wright, or neuroblastic, and Flexner-Wintersteiner, or retinoblastic, rosettes can also be seen. In contrast to other masses of the pineal gland, pineocytomatous rosettes are not present.  Immunohistochemistry staining will reveal neuronal, glial, and photoreceptor marker positivity. This includes synaptophysin, neurofilament protein, and CRX, a specific pineal or retinal marker, positive staining.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>\n<p>Initial treatment for pineoblastoma often includes a shunting procedure to redirect accumulated cerebrospinal fluid secondary to obstructive hydrocephalus. This shunt can help manage increased intracranial pressure and relieve some symptoms. Surgery to remove the tumor is associated with better outcomes, however, this is not always possible due to the proximity of the pineal gland to neurovascular structures. Complete tumor resection is only seen in about 30% of cases. Following surgery, radiation therapy to the brain and spinal cord can increase survival. However, radiation can only safely be used in patients over 3 years old due to the risk of significant neurological impairment. Chemotherapy treatment can also be used, either before or after surgery; its optimal use is still under investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Prognosis</strong></p>\n<p>Pineoblastomas are very aggressive tumors. 5-year survival for patients with pineoblastomas is around 58%. Prognosis for patients under 5 years old is lower, between 15 and 40%. Disseminated disease at diagnosis is also associated with worse outcomes. When pineoblastomas occur with retinoblastomas, the prognosis is typically worse, and these patients require more aggressive treatment.</p>\n<p>Complete gross tumor resection is associated with improved prognosis, but is difficult and rare to achieve. Radiation therapy after surgery is also linked to improved survival.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option B. Osteosarcoma</strong> - Osteosarcoma is strongly associated with <strong>hereditary retinoblastoma</strong> due to <strong>RB1 gene mutations</strong>, but it is <strong>not the most common primary tumor</strong> associated with retinoblastoma. It typically develops later in life as a secondary malignancy, especially after <strong>radiation therapy</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C. Myosarcoma</strong> - There is <strong>no direct association</strong> between myosarcoma and retinoblastoma. Myosarcomas arise from <strong>muscle tissue</strong> and are unrelated to retinoblastoma or its genetic pathways.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D. Melanoma</strong> - Although both melanoma and retinoblastoma are <strong>ocular tumors</strong>, there is no strong genetic or clinical link between them. Melanomas originate from <strong>melanocytes</strong>, whereas retinoblastoma originates from <strong>retinal neuroectodermal cells</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Pineoblastoma is the most common primary tumor associated with retinoblastoma, often seen in cases of bilateral retinoblastoma or RB1 mutations, forming the condition known as \"trilateral retinoblastoma\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineoblastoma\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineoblastoma</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>he oculo-cephalic reflex (OCR) is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left, and vice versa. This reflex can be tested by the Rapid head impulse test or Halmagyi-Curthoys-test, in which the head is rapidly moved to the side with force, and is controlled if the eyes succeed to remain looking in the same direction. When the function of the right balance system is reduced, by a disease or by an accident, quick head movement to the right cannot be sensed properly anymore. As a consequence, no compensatory eye movement is generated, and the patient cannot fixate a point in space during this rapid head movement. In comatose patients, once it has been determined that the cervical spine is intact, a test of the vestibulo-ocular reflex can be performed by turning the head to one side. If the brainstem is intact, the eyes will move conjugately away from the direction of turning (as if still looking at the examiner rather than fixed straight ahead). Negative Doll's eyes would stay fixed midorbit, so having negative \"doll's eyes\" is a sign that a comatose patient's brainstem is not intact. There is one very important contraindication of this examination - trauma of a cervical spine - because we could seriously injured patient. Sometimes a result can be false-positive thanks to influence of some medication (anesthesia).</p>",

      "solution": "<p>ilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which excess copper builds up in the body. Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver. Liver-related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build up in the abdomen, swelling of the legs, yellowish skin and itchiness. Brain-related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble in speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and psychosis.</p>\n<p>Wilson's disease is caused by a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. This protein transports excess copper into bile, where it is excreted in waste products. The condition is autosomal recessive; for a person to be affected, they must inherit a mutated copy of the gene from both parents. Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing may be used to screen family members of those affected.</p>\n<p>Wilson's disease is typically treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low-copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer and kidney problems. A liver transplant may be helpful to those for whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.</p>\n<p>Wilson's disease occurs in about 1 in 30,000 people. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 35 years. It was first described in 1854 by a German pathologist Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs and is named after British neurologist Samuel Wilson.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come for medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, who tend to be in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Liver disease</strong></p>\n<p>Liver disease may present itself as tiredness, jaundice, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, a condition in which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.</p>\n<p>About 5% of all people are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).</p>\n<p><strong>Neuropsychiatric symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>About half of the people with Wilson's disease have neurological or psychiatric symptoms. Most initially have mild cognitive deterioration and clumsiness, as well as changes in behavior. Specific neurological symptoms usually then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia or slowed movements and a lack of balance are the most common parkinsonian features) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of part of the body). Seizures and migraine appear to be more common in Wilson's disease. A characteristic tremor described as \"wing-beating tremor\" is encountered in many people with Wilson's; this is absent at rest but can be provoked by abducting the arms and flexing the elbows toward the midline.</p>\n<p>Cognition can also be affected in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.</p>\n<p>Psychiatric problems due to Wilson's disease may include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen in conjunction with neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. These symptoms are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present./p>\n<p><strong>Other organ systems</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease:</strong></p>\n<p>Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible in the cornea of the eyes, either directly or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper form a ring around the cornea. This is due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. These rings can be either dark brown, golden, or reddish-green, are 1 to 3 mm wide, and appear at the corneal limbus. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease and may be seen in people with chronic cholestasis. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither causes significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).</p>\n<p>Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis (Type 2), a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the proximal tubules leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), a weakening of bones (due to calcium and phosphate loss), and occasionally aminoaciduria (loss of essential amino acids needed for protein synthesis).</p>\n<p>Heart: cardiomyopathy (weakness of the heart muscle) is a rare but recognized problem in Wilson's disease; it may lead to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat).</p>\n<p>Hormones: hypoparathyroidism (failure of the parathyroid glands leading to low calcium levels), infertility, and recurrent miscarriage.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Location of the basal ganglia, the part of the brain affected by Wilson's disease</p>\n<p>Wilson's disease may be suspected on the basis of any of the symptoms mentioned above, or when a close relative has been found to have Wilson's. Most have slightly abnormal liver function tests such as a raised aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and bilirubin level. If the liver damage is significant, albumin may be decreased due to an inability of damaged liver cells to produce this protein; likewise, the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation) may be prolonged as the liver is unable to produce proteins known as clotting factors. Alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with Wilson's-related acute liver failure. If there are neurological symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is usually performed; this shows hyperintensities in the part of the brain called the basal ganglia in the T2 setting. MRI may also demonstrate the characteristic \"face of the giant panda\" pattern.</p>\n<p>There is no totally reliable test for Wilson's disease, but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in the blood, as well of the amount of copper excreted in urine during a 24-hour period, are together used to form an impression of the amount of copper in the body. The gold standard-or most ideal test-is a liver biopsy.</p>\n<p><strong>Ceruloplasmin</strong></p>\n<p>Levels of ceruloplasmin are abnormally low (&lt;0.2 g/L) in 80-95% of cases. It can, however, be present at normal levels in people with ongoing inflammation as it is an acute phase protein. Low ceruloplasmin is also found in Menkes disease and aceruloplasminemia, which are related to, but much rarer than Wilson's disease.</p>\n<p>The combination of neurological symptoms, eye signs and a low ceruloplasmin level is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. In many cases, however, further tests are needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Serum and urine copper</strong></p>\n<p>Serum copper is low, which may seem paradoxical given that Wilson's disease is a disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 &mu;g/24h (1.6 &mu;mol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 &mu;g/24h (0.6 &mu;mol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).</p>\n<p>In children, the penicillamine test may be used. A 500 mg oral dose of penicillamine is administered, and urine collected for 24 hours. If this contains more than 1600 &mu;g (25 &mu;mol), it is a reliable indicator of Wilson's disease.[clarification needed] This test has not been validated in adults.</p>\n<p><strong>Slit-lamp examination</strong></p>\n<p>The eyes of the patient are examined using a slit-lamp to look for Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are strongly associated with Wilson's Disease and are caused by copper deposition on the inner cornea in Descemet's membrane.</p>\n<p><strong>Liver biopsy</strong></p>\n<p>Once other investigations have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is the removal of a small amount of liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 &mu;g of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.</p>\n<p>In the earlier stages of the disease, the biopsy typically shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Genetic testing</strong></p>\n<p>Mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene, as well as other genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries like the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as they tend to have more mixed populations.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Diet</strong></p>\n<p>In general, a diet low in copper-containing foods is recommended with the avoidance of mushrooms, nuts, chocolate, dried fruit, liver, sesame seeds and sesame oil, and shellfish.</p>\n<p><strong>Medication</strong></p>\n<p>Medical treatments are available for Wilson's disease. Some increase the removal of copper from the body, while others prevent the absorption of copper from the diet.</p>\n<p>Generally, penicillamine is the first treatment used. This binds copper (chelation) and leads to excretion of copper in the urine. Hence, monitoring of the amount of copper in the urine can be done to ensure a sufficiently high dose is taken. Penicillamine is not without problems: about 20% experience a side effect or complication of penicillamine treatment, such as drug-induced lupus (causing joint pains and a skin rash) or myasthenia (a nerve condition leading to muscle weakness). In those who presented with neurological symptoms, almost half experience a paradoxical worsening in their symptoms. While this phenomenon is observed in other treatments for Wilson's, it is usually taken as an indication for discontinuing penicillamine and commencing second-line treatment. Those intolerant to penicillamine may instead be commenced on trientine hydrochloride, which also has chelating properties. Some recommend trientine as first-line treatment, but experience with penicillamine is more extensive. A further agent, under clinical investigation by Wilson Therapeutics, with known activity in Wilson's disease is tetrathiomolybdate. This is regarded as experimental, though some studies have shown a beneficial effect.</p>\n<p>Once all results have returned to normal, zinc (usually in the form of a zinc acetate prescription called Galzin) may be used instead of chelators to maintain stable copper levels in the body. Zinc stimulates metallothionein, a protein in gut cells that binds copper and prevents their absorption and transport to the liver. Zinc therapy is continued unless symptoms recur or if the urinary excretion of copper increases.</p>\n<p>In rare cases where none of the oral treatments are effective, especially in severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) every few weeks and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.</p>\n<p>People who are asymptomatic (for instance, those diagnosed through family screening or only as a result of abnormal test results) are generally treated, as the copper accumulation may cause long-term damage in the future. It is unclear whether these people are best treated with penicillamine or zinc acetate.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical and occupational therapies</strong></p>\n<p>Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are beneficial for patients with the neurologic form of the disease. The copper chelating treatment may take up to six months to start working, and these therapies can assist in coping with ataxia, dystonia, and tremors, as well as preventing the development of contractures that can result from dystonia.</p>\n<p><strong>Transplantation</strong></p>\n<p>Liver transplantation is an effective cure for Wilson's disease but is used only in particular scenarios because of the risks and complications associated with the procedure. It is used mainly in people with fulminant liver failure who fail to respond to medical treatment or in those with advanced chronic liver disease. Liver transplantation is avoided in severe neuropsychiatric illnesses, in which its benefit has not been demonstrated.</p>\n<p><strong>Prognosis</strong></p>\n<p>Left untreated, Wilson's disease tends to become progressively worse and is eventually fatal. Serious complications include liver cirrhosis, acute kidney failure and psychosis. With early detection and treatment, most of those affected can live relatively normal lives. Liver and neurologic damage that occurs prior to treatment may improve, but it is often permanent</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A. Corneal Ulcer</strong> - Atropine is often <strong>used</strong> in corneal ulcers to provide <strong>pain relief</strong> by <strong>paralyzing the ciliary muscle</strong> and preventing ciliary spasm. It also helps reduce <strong>secondary uveitis</strong> associated with corneal infections.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B. Angle-Closure Glaucoma (ACG) - Atropine is contraindicated in primary ACG</strong> because it <strong>dilates the pupil</strong>, which can further narrow the drainage angle and <strong>precipitate an acute attack</strong> by significantly increasing IOP. However, in <strong>some secondary glaucomas</strong>, atropine may have a role in stabilizing the eye, but it is generally avoided in angle closure.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D. Malignant Glaucoma</strong> - Atropine is actually <strong>used</strong> in the management of <strong>malignant glaucoma (aqueous misdirection syndrome)</strong>. It helps by <strong>relaxing the ciliary body</strong>, shifting the <strong>lens-iris diaphragm posteriorly</strong>, and reducing <strong>aqueous misdirection</strong>, thereby relieving the condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Topical atropine is contraindicated in acute anterior uveitis (AAU) due to its potential to increase intraocular pressure and worsen inflammation. It is beneficial in conditions like corneal ulcers and malignant glaucoma but should be avoided in primary angle-closure glaucoma.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_disease\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_disease</a></p>",
