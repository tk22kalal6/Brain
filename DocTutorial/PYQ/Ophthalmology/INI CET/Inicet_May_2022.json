      "solution": "<p>Glaucoma continues to be a major public health problem. It is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide after cataracts. In the United States, primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of glaucoma and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in African Americans. This disease is typically asymptomatic until advanced visual field loss occurs. Some of the risk factors for primary open-angle glaucoma have been extensively described and studied, including elevated intraocular pressure, advancing age, family history, African ancestry, myopia, and perhaps presence of certain systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. The precise mechanism of increased resistance to aqueous outflow remains unclear and is currently an active focus of research. At present, all our treatment strategies are directed at lowering intraocular pressure. Initial treatment is usually started with topical or oral medications. However, with progressive damage, laser trabeculoplasty may be considered as an adjunctive therapy, followed by incisional glaucoma surgery, either with trabeculectomy or glaucoma drainage implant.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Disease Entity</strong></p>\r\n<p>Primary open angle glaucoma</p>\r\n<p><strong>Disease</strong></p>\r\n<p>Glaucoma describes a group of conditions in which there is characteristic cupping of the optic disc with corresponding visual field defects, due to retinal ganglion cell loss. It is a progressive condition and is the most common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a subset of the glaucomas defined by an open, normal appearing anterior chamber angle and raised intraocular pressure (IOP), with no other underlying disease. If there is an identifiable underlying cause for raised IOP, this is termed secondary glaucoma. If the IOP is within normal limits, this is termed normal tension glaucoma (NTG). Secondary glaucoma and NTG are not discussed in this section.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Etiology</strong></p>\r\n<p>The final common pathway for all potential etiologies of POAG is optic nerve head damage. This is thought to be secondary to primarily ganglion cell axon loss, although loss of blood vessels and glial cells has also been observed. There are many postulated mechanisms of ganglion cell damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>IOP related etiology</strong></p>\r\n<p>There is good evidence that IOP related mechanisms of optic nerve damage are very important in the pathogenesis of POAG. By definition, patients with POAG have raised IOP. Raised IOP is an important risk factor for the progression to POAG from ocular hypertension (OHT), and is the only common clinical finding in a wide variety of secondary glaucomas. IOP seems to be important even in NTG, as reduction of IOP was shown to reduce the risk of progression in these patients in the Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma Study. In animal models, raised IOP always precedes glaucomatous nerve damage. It is thought that raised IOP primarily affects the optic nerve via the mechanical changes at the lamina cribrosa. There is consensus that the etiology of raised IOP is due to reduced aqueous outflow, rather than over-production of aqueous. Several theories exist as to the cause of reduced aqueous outflow (see below).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Non-IOP related etiology</strong></p>\r\n<p>A proportion of patients develop glaucoma and continue to progress despite low IOP. Equally, a proportion of patients with elevated IOP never develop POAG. This supports the theories of IOP independent mechanisms of glaucomatous nerve damage. These include ischemia, loss of neurotrophic factors, neurotoxicity, and failure of cellular repair mechanisms.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>IOP</strong></p>\r\n<p>IOP is considered the most important risk factor for the development of POAG, and remains the only known modifiable risk factor. Raised IOP in animal models results in glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Population studies have shown increased prevalence of glaucoma with increasing IOP. In patients with OHT (raised IOP but no signs of glaucomatous optic disc or visual field changes), higher IOP is associated with a higher risk of developing POAG. This has been shown in the OHTS (Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study) and the EGPS (European Glaucoma Prevention Study). IOP is also thought to be a risk factor for NTG, despite IOP never being higher than the normal range.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Age</strong></p>\r\n<p>The prevalence of POAG increases with age, even after compensating for the association between age and IOP. Age was also found to be an important risk factor for the conversion of OHT to POAG in both OHTS and EGPS.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Race</strong></p>\r\n<p>Several studies have shown POAG to be more prevalent in people of African-Caribbean descent compared with Caucasians. Not only is POAG more prevalent in black race, its onset is earlier, and disease progression has been shown to be faster and more refractory to treatment. Black patients with OHT have been found to be more likely to progress to POAG. The prevalence of POAG in Hispanics is thought to be between that of African-Caribbean and Caucasian populations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Refractive error</strong></p>\r\n<p>Myopia has been shown to be a risk factor for POAG in several studies. However, it can be difficult to diagnose true POAG in myopic patients and controversy exists over whether it is real risk factor. Myopic optic discs are notoriously difficult to assess, and myopic patients may have visual field defects unrelated to any glaucomatous process.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Central corneal thickness</strong></p>\r\n<p>A thinner cornea has been shown to be a risk factor for OHT patients developing POAG. This may be in part due to IOP measurement error (IOP tends to be read lower in patients with thinner corneas), but there are also theories that a thinner cornea may indicate less rigid support structures around the optic nerve head, and a resultant increased propensity to damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Family history</strong></p>\r\n<p>A first-degree relative with POAG is a risk factor for the development of POAG. This has been reported in several studies with the odds ratio varying from 3 to 13. The risk is thought to be higher still if the affected relative is a sibling. Several genes associated with POAG have been identified, though these account for less than 5% of all POAG in the general population. It is therefore thought that the hereditary aspect of POAG is likely to be polygenic and that gene-environment interactions are important.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other risk factors</strong></p>\r\n<p>A high prevalence of POAG has been found in diabetic patients, and a high prevalence of diabetes has been found in POAG patients. However, controversy exists as to whether diabetes truly is a risk factor for POAG, as several large population studies have found no association. The role of blood pressure in the development of POAG is complicated and there is no consensus. Hypertension may predispose to glaucomatous damage via increased peripheral vascular resistance in small vessels, while a low blood pressure may reduce the perfusion pressure of the optic disc. There is a relative paucity of data regarding the lifestyle and nutritional epidemiology of POAG. There is a suggestion that exercise and a diet high in green collards and with a high omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acid ratio are protective against POAG.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Retinoblastoma</strong> - An autosomal <strong>dominant</strong> condition caused by mutations in the <strong>RB1 gene</strong>, often inherited but can also occur sporadically.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Retinitis Pigmentosa</strong> - A <strong>genetically heterogeneous disorder</strong> with autosomal <strong>dominant, recessive, and X-linked</strong> inheritance patterns, leading to progressive retinal degeneration.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Myopia</strong> - Shows <strong>strong hereditary influence</strong>, with multiple genes involved.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Ocular involvement in leprosy</strong></p>\n<p>The eye may be involved in leprosy in several ways, depending on the immune status of the patient. Ocular involvement is more common in lepromatous leprosy, where direct invasion of the globe by M. leprae can occur, probably through the bloodstream.</p>\n<p>M. leprae has a known affinity for cooler parts of the body and therefore has a particular attraction to the superficial structures of the face and the anterior segment of the eye. Rarely there is involvement of structures posterior to the equator.</p>\n<p>The most frequent ocular manifestation in lepromatous leprosy is uveitis, commonly in the form of chronic low-grade iridocyclitis. In such cases, the presence of iris pearls is pathognomonic, representing dead M. leprae bacillus that progressively enlarged, coalesce, become pedunculated and lodge in the anterior chamber. Inflammation also promotes cataract development and intraocular hypotony. In later stages of the disease large areas of iris atrophy and miotic pupils may be noted, as a result of chronic inflammation and of sympathetic nerve involvement of the pupillary dilator muscle.</p>\n<p>Corneal involvement in leprosy can also occur, in the form of visible beaded corneal nerves, interstitial keratitis, avascular keratitis and corneal leproma. </p>\n<p>In tuberculoid leprosy, ocular manifestations result from lid closure impairment and reduced corneal sensation, through involvement of the facial nerve and of the ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve. Corneal opacification resulting from exposure keratopathy and chronic neurotrophic keratitis can cause significant visual impairment. Lacrimal gland involvement can result in dry eye and conjunctival keratinization. Miotic pupils in multibacillary leprosy, combined with cataract can also contribute to low visual acuity.</p>\n<p>Scleritis can also happen, as a result of direct infiltration by M. leprae or due to a lepromatous erythema nodosum reaction, although episcleritis is more common than scleritis.</p>\n<p>Acute inflammatory reactions affecting the facial nerve, cornea and iris are a feature of Type I and Type 2 reactions and may cause severe damage to the eye either directly or indirectly.</p>\n<p><strong>List of possible ocular complications in leprosy:</strong></p>\n<p>Lids: madarosis, blepharochalasis, nodules, ectropion, entropion, lagophthalmos, reduced blinking, trichiasis</p>\n<p>Cornea: thickened corneal nerves, superficial stromal keratitis, corneal anesthesia, pannus, exposure keratopathy, intersticial keratitis, band shaped keratopathy, corneal leproma.</p>\n<p>Iris: acute iritis (synechiae, secondary glaucoma, secondary cataract, seclusio pupillae), chronic iritis (iris pearls, iris atrophy, miosis, corectopia, polycoria, secondary cataract), iris leproma.</p>\n<p>Ciliary body: loss of accommodation, hypotonia, phthisis.</p>\n<p>Sclera: episcleritis, scleritis, nodules, staphyloma.</p>\n<p>Lens: cataract.</p>\n<p>Fundus: peripheral choroidal lesions, retinal vasculitis, papillitis</p>\n<p>Lacrimal system: acute dacryocystitis, chronic dacryocystitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Diagnosis of leprosy is made through clinical criteria, namely the existence of: hypopigmented or reddish skin lesions with definite sensory loss, with or without thickened peripheral nerves and acid-fast bacilli identified on skin smears or biopsy samples. There is also a classification of disease based on bacteriological criteria, distinguishing between paucibacillary leprosy and multibacillary leprosy and this distinction has implications on which treatment regimen to choose. Regarding skin smears: patients with negative smears at all sites are considered to have paucibacillary leprosy, while those with positive smears at any site are considered to have multibacillary leprosy. However, in practice, clinical criteria are usually used to distinguish between paucibacillary and multibacillary leprosy, since skin smears are not always available. Regarding the number of skin lesions: one to five skin lesions corresponds to paucibacillary leprosy and more than five skin lesions corresponds to multibacillary leprosy. Paucibacillary leprosy includes the tuberculoid form of the disease and the borderline tuberculoid form, while multibacillary leprosy includes the remaining borderline forms and the lepromatous form of the disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong></p>\n<p>Treatment of leprosy includes multidrug oral therapy and its duration depends on the type of infection (paucibacillary vs multibacillary). First line drugs are rifampin, dapsone and clofazimine, but minocycline and ofloxacin are occasionally used in cases where only one skin lesion exists.</p>\n<p><strong>WHO recommended multidrug treatment regimens are the following:</strong></p>\n<p>For Multibacillary leprosy, the standard regimen in adults has a 12 months duration and includes: Rifampin 600 mg once a month, Dapsone 100 mg daily and Clofazimine 300 mg once a month and 50 mg daily. For Paucibacillary leprosy the regimen as a 6 months duration and includes: Rifampin 600 mg once a month and Dapsone 100 mg daily. If only a single skin lesion exists, the regimen includes a single dose of: Rifampin 600 mg, Ofloxacin 400 mg and Minocycline 100 mg.</p>\n<p>Management of uveitis requires topical corticosteroids and eventually oral corticosteroids to manage acute exacerbations. Phenylephrine is used to keep pupils mobile, in order to prevent miosis</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Acanthamoeba castellanii</strong> - Causes <strong>Acanthamoeba keratitis</strong>, associated with contact lens wear and severe corneal ulceration, but does not cause nerve palsy or corneal anesthesia.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Onchocerca volvulus</strong> - Causes <strong>river blindness (onchocerciasis)</strong>, leading to <strong>punctate keratitis, sclerosing keratitis, and chorioretinitis</strong>, but does not cause lagophthalmos or orbicularis paresis.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: Chlamydia A-C</strong> - Causes <strong>trachoma</strong>, leading to <strong>chronic follicular conjunctivitis and corneal scarring</strong>, but does not affect facial or trigeminal nerves.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The combination of <strong>orbicularis paresis, lagophthalmos, and corneal anesthesia</strong> strongly suggests <strong>ocular leprosy due to <em>Mycobacterium leprae</em></strong></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of infectious retinochroiditis in humans.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Etiology</strong></p>\r\n<p>The causative organism, Toxoplasma gondii, is a single-cell, obligate, intracellular protozoan parasite. Cats are the definitive host for T. gondii, however, humans and a wide range of mammals, birds, and reptiles, may also serve as intermediate hosts. T. gondii has three forms: (1) the oocyst (soil form), (2) the tachyzoite (active infectious form), and (3) the tissue cyst (latent form).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Epidemiology</strong></p>\r\n<p>T. gondii's presence in nature is widespread, but human infections are not equally distributed around the world. It has been estimated that 1 billion people are infected worldwide. Rates of infection are highest in tropical areas and relatively low in dry, arid areas and cold areas. This likely reflects the environment which are most amenable to the organism's proliferation in the environment. In the United States approximately 22.5% are IgG positive for toxoplasmosis and up to 70% in some studies. Ocular disease secondary to toxoplasmosis is estimated to be around 2% in the United States, 17.7% in Brazil, and up to 43% in Africa.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n<p>Exposure to environments where the infectious organism is found, especially those frequented by felines. Increased risk of infection in males, if you own more than 3 kittens, and eating raw or undercooked meat (lamb, ground beef, shell fish, game).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n<p>Physical Examination</p>\r\n<p>List of classic and atypical findings which have been reported.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Classic findings</strong></p>\r\n<p>White focal retinitis with overlying vitreous inflammation (\"headlight in the fog\")</p>\r\n<p>Accompanying nearby or adjacent pigmented retinochoroidal scar</p>\r\n<p>Vitreous inflammation (mild, moderate, or severe )</p>\r\n<p>Secondary nongranulomatous iridocyclitis</p>\r\n<p>Granulomatous and stellate keratic precipitates possible</p>\r\n<p>Inflammatory ocular hypertension 10% to 15% of cases</p>\r\n<p>Retinal vasculitis (typically near the focus of Retinochoroiditis)</p>\r\n<p>Atypical findings which can accompany retinochoroiditis</p>\r\n<p>Papillitis</p>\r\n<p>Neuroretinitis</p>\r\n<p>Retrobulbar neuritis</p>\r\n<p>Scleritis</p>\r\n<p>Retinal detachment</p>\r\n<p>Punctate outer retinitis</p>\r\n<p>Branch retinal artery occlusion</p>\r\n<p>Frosted branch angiitis</p>\r\n<p>Coat's-type response</p>\r\n<p>Fuch's-like anterior uveitis</p>\r\n<p>Multifocal diffuse necrotizing retinitis</p>\r\n<p>Atypical findings which can exist in absence of retinochoroiditis</p>\r\n<p>Retinal vasculitis</p>\r\n<p>Unilateral neuroretinitis (optic disk edema, macular star)</p>\r\n<p>Inflammation in absence of overt necrotizing retinitis</p>\r\n<p>Unilateral pigmentary retinopathy mimicking retinitis pigmentosa</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recurrence</strong></p>\r\n<p>Recurrent lesions tend to occur at the margins of old scars, but they also can occur elsewhere in the fundus. The risk of recurrence is highest within the first year of the initial episode. Older age also predisposes to higher risk of recurrence. The American Academy of Ophthalmology published a report entitled \"Interventions for Toxoplasma Retinochoroiditis\" and agreed that there was level 2 evidence that supports the long-term prophylactic treatment with combined trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole might reduce recurrences.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p>Typical symptoms of active disease are floaters and blurred vision. Eye pain and redness if the patient has a secondary iritis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Clinical diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n<p>Clinical evaluation and diagnosis is the most important part of diagnosing toxoplasmosis retinitis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Diagnostic Evaluations</strong></p>\r\n<p>Because of the high prevalence of positive toxoplasma titers in many populations, the use of serology in the diagnosis is mainly limited to reassuring the clinician that toxoplasmosis should remain in the differential. If the IgG titers for toxoplasmosis are completely negative, down to a 1:1 dilution, then toxoplasmosis is completely ruled out in an immunocompetent person. It is possible that an immunosuppressed patient could have a completely negative immunoglobulin titers and have active ocular toxoplasmosis infection.</p>\r\n<p>The development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been very helpful for the diagnosis of atypical or difficult cases. Detection of T gondii DNA by PCR in both aqueous humor and vitreous fluid is both sensitive and specific.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n<p>Infectious</p>\r\n<p>Tuberculosis</p>\r\n<p>Viral Retinitis (CMV, HSV, VZV)</p>\r\n<p>Toxocariasis</p>\r\n<p>Bartonella</p>\r\n<p>Syphilis</p>\r\n<p>Endophthalmitis</p>\r\n<p>Autoimmune</p>\r\n<p>Behcet's disease</p>\r\n<p>Systemic autoimmune diseases</p>\r\n<p>Retinal vasculitis</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conditions That Do Not Cause Punched-Out Lesions</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Option B: Congenital Rubella</strong> &rarr; <strong>NO</strong>, does not cause punched-out lesions.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Causes <strong>salt-and-pepper retinopathy</strong>, not discrete punched-out scars.</li>\r\n<li>Characterized by <strong>diffuse pigmentary changes</strong> in the retina.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option C: Posterior Staphyloma</strong> &rarr; <strong>NO</strong>, does not cause punched-out lesions.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Occurs in <strong>high myopia</strong> with progressive scleral thinning.</li>\r\n<li>Leads to <strong>posterior elongation</strong> of the globe but does not create chorioretinal punched-out scars.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option D: Choroidal Coloboma</strong> &rarr; <strong>NO</strong>, does not cause punched-out lesions.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Developmental defect due to <strong>failure of optic fissure closure</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Leads to <strong>absence of retinal and choroidal tissue</strong> in the affected area, creating a <strong>large congenital defect</strong>, not small punched-out scars.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Toxoplasmosis</strong> causes <strong>punched-out lesions</strong> in the retina due to retinochoroiditis.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Congenital rubella, posterior staphyloma, and choroidal coloboma DO NOT</strong> cause punched-out lesions.</li>\r\n</ul>",
