      "solution": "<p>PUT YOUR DROPS IN THE RIGHT WAY - aim for the outer corner of your eye. You can pull down your lower lid to create a little pocket for the drops to go into. If you're having trouble, try lying down - get gravity on your side! After the drop goes in, keep your eye closed for about thirty seconds to help it absorb properly. If you blink excessively, the drop will not get absorbed. If you place your index finger along the inner corner of your eye after putting the drops in, this closes off the tear duct and keeps the drop in the eye longer. Effectiveness of the drop will be enhanced and side effects will be reduced - the drop will stay in your eye instead of going to the rest of your body.</p>\r\n<p>DON'T DOUBLE UP ON DROPS - there is no need to put more than one drop in your eye. One drop is more than can fit into your eye, so a second drop will just run down your cheek.</p>\r\n<p>SPACE OUT YOUR DROPS - when you are taking multiple drops, wait 5-10 minutes between each medication. Otherwise, you will just be rinsing the first drop out with the second drop and you will reduce the effectiveness of your medications.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Follow these steps to safely apply eye ointment:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Wash your hands. You'll need to touch your eye to apply the ointment. Wash your hands thoroughly before getting started. Or, you can use a clean pair of medical gloves.</p>\r\n<p>Warm up the tube. Close your hand around the tube to warm up the ointment inside.</p>\r\n<p>Remove the cap from the tube. Place the cap on a clean surface. Once the tube is open, avoid touching the tip with anything.</p>\r\n<p>Tilt your head back. You may want to stand in front of a mirror so you can see your eye. Make sure your upper lid is raised.</p>\r\n<p>Position the tube. Hold the tube with your dominant hand. The ointment should be very close to your eye, with the tip pointing toward it. Don't let the tip touch your eye.</p>\r\n<p>Pull down your bottom eyelid. Use your pointer finger to pull your eyelid down without touching the inside of your eye. The red part under your bottom eyelid should form a small pocket for the ointment.</p>\r\n<p>Gently squeeze the tube. Without letting the tip of the tube touch your eye, squeeze a line of ointment into the pocket under your eye. Twist the tube to help the ointment break off from the tip and fall into your lower eyelid.</p>\r\n<p>Close your eyes. Let both eyelids close, and leave them closed for 1 minute. The ointment should melt with your body heat. While your eyes are closed, look up to help the ointment spread to the rest of your eye.</p>\r\n<p>Clean the tip of the tube. Use a clean tissue or baby wipe to prevent the spread of germs.</p>\r\n<p>Wash your hands. After you've finished, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>\r\n<p>If you're applying eye ointment to a baby or young child, it's often easier to have your child lie down. You can wrap your child in a towel or blanket to limit their movement. You'll need to hold your child's upper eyelid while repeating the steps above.</p>\r\n<p>It's important to use antibiotic eye ointments for as long as your healthcare provider has directed. You'll need to finish the treatment course, even if your symptoms have improved.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.grineyecare.com/blog/8-rules-for-using-eye\">https://www.grineyecare.com/blog/8-rules-for-using-eye</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Post-refractive eyes pose a challenge to vergence-based IOL calculations because the anterior corneal power is altered by the procedure. The increased discordance between anterior and posterior corneal curvatures then leads to ELP calculation errors when the measured anterior keratometry values are input into IOL formulas without modification. Hyperopic surprise is the norm in these cases unless accommodations are made to account for the history of refractive surgery. Factors that impact calculations include the type of corneal refractive surgery done, the availability of preoperative keratometry or refractive data, can affect the prediction of the IOL formula, and inclusion of various keratometry measurements, such as simulated-K value (Sim-K), central corneal keratometry, or topography-based corneal keratometry.46,47 Many different formulas have been proposed to address the varying combinations of the above scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>For radial keratotomy (RK), an incisional refractive surgery, there is no clear consensus on the optimal method of obtaining biometry data or the best IOL formula. It has been suggested that using mainly the central measurements of corneal power (eg, central 3.0 mm) can yield more accurate results than using wider radius measurements.46,48 This method of estimating postrefractive corneal power resulted in fairly accurate IOL calculation when used with Double-K applied to Holladay 1. In a recent study of 52 post-RK eyes, the accuracy of 7 IOL formulas was compared, including Barrett True K (based on Barrett Universal II) with preoperative history, Barrett True K with partial history, Barrett True K with no history, Double K Holladay 1, Potvin-Hill and Haigis.47 Of note, the authors specifically used the RK algorithm of the Barrett True K formula. The Barrett True K with preoperative refractive history had the lowest median absolute error. Additionally, if no history was available, the Barrett True K without history still performed better than Double K Holladay, Potvin-Hill, and Haigis.</p>\r\n<p>For laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK)/photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) eyes, several different methods of IOL calculation have been published, differing in the type of biometry data used or the correction factors related to amount of refractive change from the laser procedure. The Masket formula uses SRK/T or Hoffer Q for myopic or hyperopic patients, respectively. Then, the resulting IOL power is adjusted by knowing the surgically induced refractive correction.49 The Maloney method incorporates the preoperative anterior and posterior, and post-LASIK, or PRK anterior corneal power is added to calculate the adjusted post-refractive corneal power. This method can be used if preoperative information is not available by using a mean posterior corneal power. In one study, the Maloney method had small variance in IOL power prediction but tended to overestimate the lens power.50 The Shammas formula adjusts the postrefractive corneal power by the postrefractive keratometry and has been shown to yield accurate results even in eyes without historical data.51-53 The Haigis-L formula is another formula that does not require historical keratometry data, in part because it relies more on the ACD, which should not change with refractive surgery. The Haigis-L does have corrections for whether the refractive surgery was for hyperopic or myopic eyes. The Barrett True K formula can also be used for post-LASIK/PRK and can be used with or without historical keratometry data. A 2016 study demonstrated that the Barrett True K formula had a smaller absolute error and variance in prediction error and was compared with the Shammas, Haigis-L, Maloney, and Masket.52</p>\r\n<p>The American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) calculator (https://iolcalc.ascrs.org) has become a valuable resource for suggesting IOL powers based on multiple postrefractive calculations (ie, adjusted Atlas, Masket, modified-Masket, Wang-Koch-Maloney, Shammas, Haigis-L, Galilei) for all postrefractive surgery patients. The typical result is a range of IOL powers. The authors of this review article prefer to choose a higher-power lens from among this range to decrease the likelihood of a hyperopic outcome. There is no clear consensus on the best formula to use for post-RK or post-LASIK/PRK eyes, but the Barrett True K formula holds promise for being a reliable formula. The Asia-Pacific Association for Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (APACRS) website (http://calc.apacrs.org/Barrett_True_K_Universal_2105/) has an online calculator. As larger number of postrefractive patients are studied and newer technology, such as ray-tracing, are incorporated into IOL algorithms, there can be established guidelines on which formulas to use in postrefractive patients to achieve accurate and consistent cataract results.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Option A SRK-1</strong> - The SRK-1 formula is outdated and does not incorporate modern considerations for effective lens position (ELP) or adjustments for post-refractive surgery corneas, making it unsuitable for LASIK-treated eyes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option B SRK II</strong> - While an improvement over SRK-1, SRK II still primarily relies on anterior keratometry values and does not account for the altered anterior-to-posterior corneal curvature ratio after refractive surgery, leading to potential errors in IOL power estimation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D Hoffer Q</strong> - Although the Hoffer Q formula is useful for shorter axial lengths, it still depends on anterior corneal curvature measurements, which are inaccurate after LASIK. It is not specifically designed for post-refractive surgery cases like the Haigis formula.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Haigis (Haigis-L) is best</strong> for post-LASIK IOL power calculation as it considers anterior chamber depth and axial length.</li>\r\n<li>Traditional formulas like <strong>SRK-1, SRK II, and Hoffer Q</strong> are unreliable due to altered corneal curvature.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Other options</strong> like Barrett True-K and Shammas can also be useful.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/apjoo/Fulltext/2020/06000/Update_on_Intraocular_Lens_Formulas_and.4.aspx\">https://journals.lww.com/apjoo/Fulltext/2020/06000/Update_on_Intraocular_Lens_Formulas_and.4.aspx</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>In optics, the numerical aperture (NA) of an optical system is a dimensionless number that characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light. By incorporating index of refraction in its definition, NA has the property that it is constant for a beam as it goes from one material to another, provided there is no refractive power at the interface. The exact definition of the term varies slightly between different areas of optics. Numerical aperture is commonly used in microscopy to describe the acceptance cone of an objective (and hence its light-gathering ability and resolution), and in fiber optics, in which it describes the range of angles within which light that is incident on the fiber will be transmitted along it.</p>\n<p>In microscopy, NA is important because it indicates the resolving power of a lens. The size of the finest detail that can be resolved (the resolution) is proportional to <strong>&lambda;/2NA</strong>, where &lambda; is the wavelength of the light. A lens with a larger numerical aperture will be able to visualize finer details than a lens with a smaller numerical aperture. Assuming quality (diffraction-limited) optics, lenses with larger numerical apertures collect more light and will generally provide a brighter image, but will provide shallower depth of field.</p>\n<p>Numerical aperture is used to define the \"pit size\" in optical disc formats.</p>\n<p>Increasing the magnification and the numerical aperture of the objective reduces the working distance, i.e. the distance between front lens and specimen.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Increased magnification</strong> - While NA is related to image clarity, magnification depends more on focal length and optical design, not just NA.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Increased contrast</strong> - Contrast is influenced by staining, illumination, and optical coatings rather than NA.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: Increased field</strong> - A higher NA typically reduces the depth of field and field of view instead of increasing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Higher NA improves resolution</strong> by capturing finer details.</li>\n<li>It does <strong>not significantly affect magnification, contrast, or field of view</strong>.</li>\n<li>Increased NA also <strong>reduces working distance</strong> and depth of field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_aperture\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_aperture</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>To rule out SO palsy, The three-step test, also known as the Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test or the Parks-Helveston three-step test, is a diagnostic test used to identify which muscle is paretic in the case of an acquired hypertropia. This method uses the cover-uncover test, with or without the Maddox rod to measure the amount of deviation in different head positions. It was first described by Bielschowsky in 1935 and later popularized by Marshall M. Parks. This test is most useful in diagnosing superior oblique palsies in clinical practice.</p>\n<p>The three-step test may also be used to diagnose the less common inferior oblique or vertical rectus muscle palsy and can be used in differentiating DVD from other vertical strabismus. It is designed for the diagnosis of a single paretic vertical muscle and is unreliable when there are multiple paretic muscles or in restrictive strabismus. This test may also help in identifying if a superior rectus palsy is true or simulated in a patient with an inhibitional palsy of the contralateral antagonist.</p>\n<p>The first step in the three-step test is to determine which eye is hypertropic in primary position.</p>\n<p>The second step is to determine whether the hypertropia increases on right or left gaze.</p>\n<p>The third step is determination if the hypertropia increases upon left head tilt or right head tilt. For this test, the ophthalmologist or orthoptist uses prisms to quantify the hypertropia in primary position, side gazes, and head tilts. Alternatively, it can be helpful to quantify smaller deviations using prisms and a Maddox rod or red filter</p>\n<p>Superior rectus palsy is a disorder associated with dysfunction of the cranial nerve 3rd (oculomotor nerve), which is responsible for causing contraction of the superior rectus muscle's to perform the primary action of elevating the eye, causing the cornea to roll superiorly (i.e., turn upward).</p>\n<p>The inability of an eye to turn upward results in convergent strabismus or esotropia of which the primary symptom is diplopia (commonly known as double vision) in which the two images appear side-by-side.</p>\n<p>Contraction of superior rectus causes the eye to simultaneously move in several planes; elevation in the transverse plane, adduction in the vertical plane and internal rotation (intorsion) in the anteroposterior plane. These contrasting movements are achieved because the muscle fibers course obliquely; at a 23 degrees angle with the median plane of the eye.</p>\n<p>However, when shifting the gaze upwards, the eyeball can elevate without the movements of adduction and internal rotation. That's because superior rectus usually contracts together with the inferior oblique muscle, whose fibers and pull are oriented in a way to oppose the adduction and internal rotation produced by the superior rectus and decrease them to a minimum. Thus, the end result is elevation of the eyeball.</p>\n<p>Being connected with the levator palpebrae superioris via check ligament, superior rectus contraction is also associated with the elevation of the upper eyelid.</p>\n<p>Superior rectus palsy is a disorder associated with dysfunction of the cranial nerve 3rd (oculomotor nerve), which is responsible for causing contraction of the superior rectus muscle's to perform the primary action of elevating the eye, causing the cornea to roll superiorly (i.e., turn upward).</p>\n<p>The inability of an eye to turn upward results in convergent strabismus or esotropia of which the primary symptom is diplopia (commonly known as double vision) in which the two images appear side-by-side.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Right Superior Oblique (RSO) Palsy:</strong> Would cause right hypertropia, not hypotropia.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Left Superior Oblique (LSO) Palsy:</strong> Would cause left hypertropia, not right hypotropia.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C: Right Inferior Oblique (RIO) Palsy:</strong> Would cause right hypertropia, not hypotropia.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Right superior rectus palsy presents with right hypotropia, worsened in right gaze and right head tilt, diagnosed via the three-step test.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/superior-rectus-muscle\">https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/superior-rectus-muscle</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Visual disturbances are a common side-effect of many antiepileptic drugs. Non-specific retino- and neurotoxic visual abnormalities, that are often reported with over-dosage and prolonged AED use, include diplopia, blurred vision and nystagmus. Some anticonvulsants are associated with specific visual problems that may be related to the mechanistic properties of the drug, and occur even when the drugs are administered within the recommended daily dose. Vigabatrin, a GABA-transaminase inhibitor, has been associated with bilateral concentric visual field loss, electrophysiological changes, central visual function deficits including reduced contrast sensitivity and abnormal colour perception, and morphological alterations of the fundus and retina. Topiramate, a drug that enhances GABAergic transmission, has been associated with cases of acute closed angle glaucoma, while tiagabine, a GABA uptake inhibitor, has been investigated for a potential GABAergic effect on the visual field. Only mild neurotoxic effects have been identified for patients treated with gabapentin, a drug designed as a cyclic analogue of GABA but exhibiting an unknown mechanism while carbamazepine, an inhibitor of voltage-dependent sodium channels, has been linked with abnormal colour perception and reduced contrast sensitivity. The following review outlines the visual disturbances associated with some of the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants. For each drug, the ocular site of potential damage and the likely mechanism responsible for the adverse visual effects is described.</p>\n<p><strong>Vigabatrin</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Visual field loss</strong></p>\n<p>Vigabatrin (&gamma;-vinyl GABA) elicits an antiepileptic effect by binding irreversibly to GABA-transaminase17, thereby increasing GABA levels and enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Vigabatrin has been targeted largely at the management of partial seizures and infantile spasms and was used until the late 1990s when isolated reports of concentric peripheral visual field loss and visual electrophysiological abnormalities began to emerge.</p>\n<p>Vigabatrin-associated visual field loss has been identified with both kinetic and static perimetry and is unique, characteristically presenting as bilateral concentric nasal constriction with temporal and central sparing18, an example of which is shown in. This distinct visual field abnormality is unusual as binasal visual field loss attributable to other causes is rare; optic neuritis, including the toxic tobacco form, can occasionally yield bilateral visual defects19, however, these are readily distinguishable from vigabatrin-related defects as they include cecocentral scotoma. Recent estimates of vigabatrin-associated visual field loss suggest that approximately 30% of epilepsy patients receiving the anticonvulsant at normal therapeutic levels present with abnormalities18., 20., 21., although this figure varies with some authors reporting higher prevalences22., 23., 24., 25., and others reporting slightly lower prevalences26., 27., 28.. Gender differences have been revealed in some studies, suggesting that men receiving vigabatrin are more susceptible to visual field constriction than women18., 27., 29., however, this is not a consistent finding21. The vast majority of vigabatrin-associated visual field constriction cases are asymptomatic18., 20., 21., 23.. In clinical ophthalmology, patients with visual field defects often remain asymptomatic until the defect impinges on, or close to, fixation; this is particularly likely in the case of binasal defects where the preserved temporal visual field in each eye enables patients to retain good mobility.</p>\n<p>Longitudinal investigations of vigabatrin-associated visual field loss have reported the defects to be permanent30., 31., 32., persisting even after patients are withdrawn from the drug27., 33.. The majority of patients are withdrawn from vigabatrin with the advent of visual field loss, however in a 1-year follow-up of patients with definite visual defects who continued to take vigabatrin, no evidence of progressive loss was found on repeated testing34. A few isolated cases of visual field improvement following cessation of vigabatrin have been described in children24., 35., however, these findings are rare and may well be attributable to learning effects.</p>\n<p>Several studies have questioned whether visual field damage correlates with vigabatrin cumulative dose with many reporting a significant relationship26., 28., 31., 32., 36., 37., 38., and others failing to demonstrate any correlation21., 27., 39.. The significance of drug interactions arising from adjunctive therapy has also been addressed. In a summary of a series of vigabatrin-related investigations Sorri21 reported no significant difference between the visual field defects of epilepsy patients receiving vigabatrin as monotherapy compared to those receiving it as add-on therapy. However, a study that compared two groups of epilepsy patients treated with vigabatrin and additional therapy of carbamazepine or sodium valproate, identified more severe visual field constriction in the latter group40. Sodium valproate influences the GABAergic system and it is possible that the combined effect of two anticonvulsants that influence GABA may be more detrimental to vision than vigabatrin in combination with a none GABAergic acting AED such as carbamazepine.</p>\n<p>The reason why only some vigabatrin-treated individuals present with visual field disruption while others remain unaffected is unclear. Hisama et al.41 suggested that GABA toxicity, or the effect of a metabolite in combination with a predisposing genotype, may be responsible. Thus far, a genetic mutation has not been identified, however a common polymorphism has been cloned which may be suggestive of genetic involvement41. An alternate explanation may be offered by altered ocular haemodynamics; decreased retinal and pulsatile ocular blood flow has been described in patients with epilepsy compared to normal healthy volunteers42., 43.. This finding appears to be further exacerbated in vigabatrin-treated epilepsy patients compared with those treated with other AEDs42 and it is conceivable that pre-existing ischaemia or a GABA-mediated vascular effect may be contributory to visual disruption44.</p>\n<p><strong>Colour perception</strong></p>\n<p>The short-wavelength (blue) sensitive cones are highly sensitive to acquired colour deficiencies and disruption to these cells can produce short-wavelength (tritan) defects. Toxic injury to the medium-wavelength (green) sensitive cones and long-wavelength (red) sensitive cones is less common, however, damage to these pathways can result in medium-wavelength (deutan) or long-wavelength (protan) defects, respectively. Numerous investigational methods exist for the measurement of colour perception that vary substantially in their depth of exploration. While Ishihara and other standard psuedoisochromatic plates yield relatively simple interpretations of colour vision, the more comprehensive Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100-hue test provides a detailed assessment of chromatic function at the fovea. In addition to enabling the separation of individuals into classes of superior, average and low colour discrimination, the FM 100-hue test also facilitates the measurement of zones, or axes, of colour confusion in colour defective patients.</p>\n<p>Abnormal colour perception has been demonstrated with Ishihara plates, other standard pseudoisochromatic plates, and the FM 100-hue in some patients treated with vigabatrin45., 46., 47.. Nousiainen et al.47 reported acquired colour vision disturbances in epilepsy patients treated with vigabatrin-monotherapy that predominated in the tritanoptic axis and were associated with the temporal extent of visual field loss. A later study, which investigated the effect of a single dose of vigabatrin on normal healthy volunteers using colour visual evoked potential tests together with colour perimetry, described a selective tritanoptic visual impairment consistent with GABAergic inhibition at the retinal level48. This important study of normal healthy subjects confirms the existence of vigabatrin-mediated colour disturbances that are entirely drug-induced and not related to the epilepsy disease process; however, whether the effect was short-lived or ongoing was not reported48.</p>\n<p>Steinhoff et al.4 employed a battery of clinical and psychophysical tests to assess visual perception in normal healthy volunteers who had received a single AED dose. The results for vigabatrin were somewhat conflicting: no observable change in the D15 colour vision test was noted, however, increased post-adaptation, increment and transient tritanopia thresholds did occur consistent with augmentation of GABA properties. The authors concluded that the observed changes were a function of neurophysiological alterations related to the specific mechanistic effect of vigabatrin, and not simply a neurotoxic effect. In a related study, the same battery of tests was applied to a group of epilepsy patients chronically treated with a mixture of vigabatrin and carbamazepine49; similar findings were reported, however, the existence of similar changes for other non-GABAergic acting drugs led to difficulty distinguishing between mechanistic and general neurotoxic effects.</p>\n<p>In a separate investigation of colour discrimination using the FM 100-hue test in epilepsy patients who had undergone add-on treatment with vigabatrin, 33% of patients exhibited below average colour discrimination and in each case the zone of colour confusion was unresolved39. This finding suggested a diffuse, or generalised, colour perception deficit consistent with toxic damage affecting all chromatic pathways equally, and may have been the product of complex drug interactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option B. Ethosuximide</strong> - Used primarily for absence seizures, ethosuximide does not typically cause significant visual field defects. Its common side effects include nausea, dizziness, and ataxia.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C. Levetiracetam</strong> - This broad-spectrum anticonvulsant is not linked to visual field loss. It is more commonly associated with behavioral side effects, such as irritability and mood changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D. Phenobarbitone</strong> - While it can cause <strong>nystagmus and diplopia</strong>, phenobarbitone does not lead to bilateral concentric visual field loss. Its side effects are more related to sedation and cognitive impairment.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Vigabatrin is <strong>uniquely associated</strong> with irreversible bilateral concentric visual field loss due to retinal toxicity. Regular <strong>visual field monitoring</strong> is recommended for patients on long-term therapy to detect early signs of vision loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059131103000827\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1059131103000827</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>The cornea has unmyelinated nerve endings sensitive to touch, temperature and chemicals; a touch of the cornea causes an involuntary reflex to close the eyelid. Because transparency is of prime importance, the healthy cornea does not have or need blood vessels within it. Instead, oxygen dissolves in tears and then diffuses throughout the cornea to keep it healthy. Similarly, nutrients are transported via diffusion from the tear fluid through the outside surface and the aqueous humour through the inside surface. Nutrients also come via neurotrophins supplied by the nerves of the cornea. In humans, the cornea has a diameter of about 11.5 mm and a thickness of 0.5-0.6 mm in the center and 0.6-0.8 mm at the periphery. Transparency, avascularity, the presence of immature resident immune cells, and immunologic privilege makes the cornea a very special tissue.</p>\n<p>The most abundant soluble protein in mammalian cornea is albumin.</p>\n<p>The human cornea borders with the sclera at the corneal limbus. In lampreys, the cornea is solely an extension of the sclera, and is separate from the skin above it, but in more advanced vertebrates it is always fused with the skin to form a single structure, albeit one composed of multiple layers. In fish, and aquatic vertebrates in general, the cornea plays no role in focusing light, since it has virtually the same refractive index as water.</p>\n<p><strong>Microanatomy</strong></p>\n<p>Vertical section of human cornea from near the margin. (Waldeyer.) Magnified. 1: Epithelium. 2: Anterior elastic lamina. 3: substantia propria. 4: Posterior elastic lamina (Descemet's membrane). 5: Endothelium of the anterior chamber. a: Oblique fibers in the anterior layer of the substantia propria. b: Lamellae, the fibers of which are cut across, producing a dotted appearance. c: Corneal corpuscles appearing fusiform in section. d: Lamellae, the fibers of which are cut longitudinally. e: Transition to the sclera, with more distinct fibrillation, and surmounted by a thicker epithelium. f: Small blood vessels cut across near the margin of the cornea.</p>\n<p><strong>Corneal cross-section imaged by an SD-OCT</strong></p>\n<p>The human cornea has five layers (possibly six, if the Dua's layer is included). Corneas of other primates have five known layers. The corneas of cats, dogs, wolves, and other carnivores only have four. From the anterior to posterior the layers of the human cornea are:</p>\n<p>Corneal epithelium: an exceedingly thin multicellular epithelial tissue layer (non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium) of fast-growing and easily regenerated cells, kept moist with tears. Irregularity or edema of the corneal epithelium disrupts the smoothness of the air/tear-film interface, the most significant component of the total refractive power of the eye, thereby reducing visual acuity. Corneal epithelium is continuous with the conjunctival epithelium, and is composed of about 6 layers of cells which are shed constantly on the exposed layer and are regenerated by multiplication in the basal layer.</p>\n<p>Bowman's layer (also known as the anterior limiting membrane): when discussed in lieu of a subepithelial basement membrane, Bowman's Layer is a tough layer composed of collagen (mainly type I collagen fibrils), laminin, nidogen, perlecan and other HSPGs that protects the corneal stroma. When discussed as a separate entity from the subepithelial basement membrane, Bowman's Layer can be described as an acellular, condensed region of the apical stroma, composed primarily of randomly organized yet tightly woven collagen fibrils. These fibrils interact with and attach onto each other. This layer is eight to 14 micrometres (&mu;m) thick and is absent or very thin in non-primates.</p>\n<p>Corneal stroma (also substantia propria): a thick, transparent middle layer, consisting of regularly arranged collagen fibers along with sparsely distributed interconnected keratocytes, which are the cells for general repair and maintenance. They are parallel and are superimposed like book pages. The corneal stroma consists of approximately 200 layers of mainly type I collagen fibrils. Each layer is 1.5-2.5 &mu;m. Up to 90% of the corneal thickness is composed of stroma. There are 2 theories of how transparency in the cornea comes about:</p>\n<p>The lattice arrangements of the collagen fibrils in the stroma. The light scatter by individual fibrils is cancelled by destructive interference from the scattered light from other individual fibrils.</p>\n<p>The spacing of the neighboring collagen fibrils in the stroma must be &lt; 200 nm for there to be transparency. (Goldman and Benedek)</p>\n<p>Descemet's membrane (also posterior limiting membrane): a thin acellular layer that serves as the modified basement membrane of the corneal endothelium, from which the cells are derived. This layer is composed mainly of collagen type IV fibrils, less rigid than collagen type I fibrils, and is around 5-20 &mu;m thick, depending on the subject's age. Just anterior to Descemet's membrane, a very thin and strong layer, Dua's layer, 15 microns thick and able to withstand 1.5 to 2 bars of pressure.</p>\n<p>Corneal endothelium: a simple squamous or low cuboidal monolayer, approx 5 &mu;m thick, of mitochondria-rich cells. These cells are responsible for regulating fluid and solute transport between the aqueous and corneal stromal compartments. (The term endothelium is a misnomer here. The corneal endothelium is bathed by aqueous humor, not by blood or lymph, and has a very different origin, function, and appearance from vascular endothelia). Unlike the corneal epithelium, the cells of the endothelium do not regenerate. Instead, they stretch to compensate for dead cells which reduces the overall cell density of the endothelium, which affects fluid regulation. If the endothelium can no longer maintain a proper fluid balance, stromal swelling due to excess fluids and subsequent loss of transparency will occur and this may cause corneal edema and interference with the transparency of the cornea and thus impairing the image formed. Iris pigment cells deposited on the corneal endothelium can sometimes be washed into a distinct vertical pattern by the aqueous currents - this is known as Krukenberg's Spindle.</p>\n<p><strong>Nerve supply</strong></p>\n<p>The cornea is one of the most sensitive tissues of the body, as it is densely innervated with sensory nerve fibres via the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve by way of 70-80 long ciliary nerves. Research suggests the density of pain receptors in the cornea is 300-600 times greater than skin and 20-40 times greater than dental pulp, making any injury to the structure excruciatingly painful.</p>\n<p>The ciliary nerves run under the endothelium and exit the eye through holes in the sclera apart from the optic nerve (which transmits only optic signals). The nerves enter the cornea via three levels; scleral, episcleral and conjunctival. Most of the bundles give rise by subdivision to a network in the stroma, from which fibres supply the different regions. The three networks are, midstromal, subepithelial/sub-basal, and epithelial. The receptive fields of each nerve ending are very large, and may overlap.</p>\n<p>Corneal nerves of the subepithelial layer terminate near the superficial epithelial layer of the cornea in a logarithmic spiral pattern. The density of epithelial nerves decreases with age, especially after the seventh decade</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option B. Limbus has stem cells - True.</strong> The limbus contains <strong>limbal stem cells</strong>, which play a crucial role in regenerating the corneal epithelium. Damage to these stem cells can lead to corneal opacity and vision loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C.
