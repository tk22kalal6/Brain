The illness begins insidiously with fever, malaise, sweats, <strong>lymphadenopathy</strong>, splenomegaly, and sometimes hepatitis. While generalised symptoms usually resolve in weeks to months, localised lesions may persist.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Malaria (Option C): </strong>Malaria typically presents with fever and flu-like illness, with Plasmodium falciparum infections being the most severe and potentially fatal. Clinical features include <strong>periodic paroxysms of chills</strong>, <strong>high fever</strong>, and sweating, often accompanied by headache, nausea, and vomiting, with severe cases leading to complications such as cerebral involvement, jaundice, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and renal damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Enteric fever (Option D): </strong>Enteric fever caused by Salmonella typhi presents after an incubation of 10-14 days with fever, malaise, headache, myalgia, constipation, and sometimes bradycardia. <strong>Rose spots</strong>, though uncommon, are characteristic cutaneous findings. In the pre-antibiotic era, complications like intestinal haemorrhage and perforation were common with high mortality.</p>",

Complications include empyema, meningitis, endocarditis, and septic arthritis.
