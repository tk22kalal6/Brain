      "solution": "<ul>\n<li>In the image, a neuromuscular monitor is attached to the ulnar nerve for peripheral nerve stimulation of adductor pollicis muscle.</li>\n<li>Neuromuscular monitoring uses:\n<ol>\n<li>Improve quality of intubation</li>\n<li>Assess depth of block during surgery</li>\n<li>Identify residual neuromuscular block</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Peripheral nerve stimulation is done to test the function of neuromuscular junction, a peripheral nerve is stimulated electrically, and the response of the muscle is assessed.</li>\n<li>Most common nerve and muscle combination used-Ulnar nerve and adductor policis muscle 2<sup>nd</sup> most common is facial nerve and orbicularis oculi muscle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ulnar:</strong> The image shows a <strong>neuromuscular monitor</strong> attached to the <strong>ulnar nerve</strong> for monitoring anesthesia. <strong>Neuromuscular monitoring</strong> is typically done using <strong>peripheral nerve stimulation</strong> to assess the function of the neuromuscular junction. In this case, the ulnar nerve is commonly used, and the most commonly monitored muscle is the <strong>adductor pollicis muscle</strong>. This muscle is located in the hand and is responsible for thumb adduction. Monitoring the ulnar nerve allows for the assessment of the depth of anesthesia and the detection of any residual neuromuscular block after surgery.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Answer Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>(B) <strong>Median:</strong> The <strong>median nerve</strong> is not typically used in standard neuromuscular monitoring. It innervates muscles in the forearm and hand, but the ulnar nerve and adductor pollicis muscle are preferred for monitoring.</li>\n<li>(C) <strong>Radial:</strong> The <strong>radial nerve</strong> can be used for neuromuscular monitoring, but it is less commonly used than the ulnar nerve. The radial nerve innervates muscles in the forearm and hand.</li>\n<li>(D) <strong>Metacarpal:</strong> The <strong>metacarpal</strong> is a bone in the hand and is not related to the use of neuromuscular monitoring for anesthesia.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>ulnar nerve</strong> is most commonly used in <strong>neuromuscular monitoring</strong>, specifically to stimulate the <strong>adductor pollicis muscle</strong>. This combination helps assess the depth of anesthesia and detect residual neuromuscular block during and after surgery.</p>",

      "solution": "<ul>\n<li>The given image is of an NRBM, which can deliver upto 100% O<sub>2</sub> theoretically to a spontaneously breathing patient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nonrebreathing face mask (NRBM):</strong> The image shows a <strong>nonrebreathing face mask (NRBM)</strong>, which is commonly used for patients with <strong>severe respiratory distress</strong>, including those with <strong>COVID-19</strong>. The NRBM allows for the delivery of <strong>high concentrations of oxygen</strong> (up to 100%) to <strong>spontaneously breathing patients</strong>. It has a one-way valve system that prevents the patient from rebreathing exhaled air, ensuring that they receive fresh oxygen with minimal contamination. This makes it particularly useful in managing patients with respiratory failure or hypoxia.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Answer Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>(A) <strong>Venturi mask:</strong> A <strong>Venturi mask</strong> delivers a <strong>precise concentration of oxygen</strong> by using a system of colored adapters that allow for specific oxygen flow rates. It is useful for patients who require controlled oxygen delivery but is not typically used for high-concentration oxygen like the NRBM.</li>\n<li>(B) <strong>Hudson Mask:</strong> The <strong>Hudson mask</strong> is a simple face mask that delivers <strong>low-flow oxygen</strong> but does not provide the high concentrations of oxygen seen with an NRBM.</li>\n<li>(C) <strong>Nebulizer mask:</strong> A <strong>nebulizer mask</strong> is used to administer <strong>aerosolized medications</strong> (such as bronchodilators) but is not specifically designed for high-concentration oxygen delivery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>nonrebreathing face mask (NRBM)</strong> is an essential piece of equipment used for providing high-concentration oxygen to <strong>spontaneously breathing</strong> patients, especially in <strong>respiratory distress</strong>, including those with <strong>COVID-19</strong>.</p>",
