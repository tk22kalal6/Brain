      "solution": "<p><strong>Suxamethonium (Succinylcholine)</strong>: This drug is a depolarizing muscle relaxant commonly used in anesthesia. It can lead to a life-threatening condition known as <strong>malignant hyperthermia</strong> (MH) when used in combination with <strong>halothane</strong>anesthesia. MH is characterized by <strong>hyperthermia, muscle rigidity</strong>, and <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>. It results from an abnormal calcium release in muscle cells, and <strong>suxamethonium</strong> is one of the primary triggers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Answer Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(A) <strong>D-curare</strong>: Curare is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, but it does not cause malignant hyperthermia. It is less likely to cause muscle rigidity and hyperthermia in the presence of halothane.</li>\r\n<li>(C) <strong>Cisatracurium</strong>: This is also a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, and like other non-depolarizing agents, it does not trigger malignant hyperthermia.</li>\r\n<li>(D) <strong>Rocuronium</strong>: Another non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, rocuronium does not cause malignant hyperthermia. Non-depolarizing agents do not lead to the hyperthermic crisis seen with suxamethonium.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:<br /> Suxamethonium (Succinylcholine)</strong>, when used with <strong>halothane</strong>, can trigger <strong>malignant hyperthermia</strong>, which is characterized by <strong>hyperthermia</strong> and <strong>muscle rigidity</strong>.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>End tidal CO2 concentration</strong>: The best method to confirm the correct placement of an endotracheal (ET) tube is by monitoring <strong>end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2)</strong>. When the ET tube is correctly placed in the trachea, carbon dioxide from exhalation is detected. A positive reading of <strong>ETCO2</strong> indicates that the tube is in the correct position in the trachea (not the esophagus), as the lungs participate in gas exchange. This is the most reliable and quick method.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Answer Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(A) <strong>X-ray of chest</strong>: While an X-ray can confirm the position of the ET tube, it is not the most immediate or practical method in the operating room. It also involves exposure to radiation, and it is typically used as a confirmatory measure after initial assessment.</li>\r\n<li>(B) <strong>Auscultation</strong>: Auscultation of breath sounds can help identify whether the ET tube is in the trachea or esophagus, but it is not the most reliable method, as it can be difficult to distinguish sounds if the tube is misplaced or if there is asymmetric lung ventilation.</li>\r\n<li>(D) <strong>Chest rise</strong>: While observing chest rise can suggest the tube is in the trachea, it is not a definitive method for confirming placement. <strong>End tidal CO2</strong> is more accurate and reliable for confirming correct placement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:<br /> </strong>The most accurate and reliable way to confirm <strong>endotracheal tube</strong> placement is by monitoring <strong>end-tidal CO2</strong>. This ensures the tube is correctly placed in the <strong>trachea</strong>, allowing for proper ventilation.</p>",
