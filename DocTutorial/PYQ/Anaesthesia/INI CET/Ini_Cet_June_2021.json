The <strong>arrow</strong> is pointing to the phase of the capnograph where the CO<sub>2</sub> is being exhaled.

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li>Non rebreather masks have traditionally been known to deliver the highest concentration(up to 95%) in spontaneously breathing patients.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A <strong>non-rebreather mask (NRM)</strong> can deliver the highest fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) in spontaneously breathing patients, typically up to <strong>95%</strong>. It achieves this by using a one-way valve that prevents exhaled air from entering the mask, while the patient can breathe in oxygen from the reservoir bag, which is filled with high concentrations of oxygen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>A (Venturi mask): </strong>The <strong>Venturi mask</strong> is used to deliver a precise amount of oxygen by using a color-coded adapter. It is not designed for the highest FiO<sub>2</sub> but rather for controlled oxygen delivery.</li>\r\n<li><strong>C (Hudson mask): </strong>The <strong>Hudson mask</strong> is a simple face mask that delivers oxygen at a lower concentration, typically around 40-60%.</li>\r\n<li><strong>D (Nasal cannula): </strong>The <strong>nasal cannula</strong> provides a lower FiO<sub>2</sub>, usually ranging from 24% to 44%, depending on the flow rate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The <strong>non-rebreather mask (B)</strong> delivers the highest possible concentration of oxygen among the given options, making it ideal for emergency situations or patients requiring high oxygen supplementation.</p>",

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li>Local anesthetics function by blocking voltage gated sodium channels.</li>\r\n<li>Recent studies show that local anesthetics also block potassium, chloride and calcium channels.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Local anesthetics work by <strong>blocking voltage-gated sodium channels.</strong> This inhibits the influx of sodium ions into the nerve cell during depolarization, thereby preventing the propagation of action potentials and blocking the transmission of nerve signals. This is the primary mechanism by which local anesthetics provide their numbing effect.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>B (Decreasing resting membrane potential): </strong>Local anesthetics do not primarily work by decreasing the resting membrane potential. Instead, they inhibit the depolarization of the nerve cell, which prevents nerve conduction.</li>\r\n<li><strong>C (Activating sodium channel): </strong>Local anesthetics do the opposite by <strong>blocking</strong> sodium channels, not activating them.</li>\r\n<li><strong>D (Inhibiting nicotine receptor): </strong>Local anesthetics do not primarily affect nicotine receptors. This option pertains more to the action of certain drugs like neuromuscular blockers, not local anesthetics.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Local anesthetics primarily block <strong>sodium channels</strong>, which prevents nerve conduction and leads to their anesthetic effect.</p>",
