      "solution": "<p>Supraglottic airway device (SAD) or extraglottic airway device, is a medical device that maintains upper airway patency during anesthesia or unconscious situation. It also allows for limited intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV), offers some degree of protection against the aspiration of gastric contents, and can be used easily especially because it can be inserted atraumatically by a low-skilled practitioner</p>\r\n<p>There are different types and shapes of LMAs; however, almost all of them are categorized as either first and second generation LMAs, and recently invented the third generation LMAs.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>First Generation SGA:</strong> Simple breathing tube, usually with some form of mask or opening at the larynx. Examples: Classic LMA, LMA-Unique, SureSeal LM, Cobra PLA, Laryngeal Tube Airway.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Second Generation SGA:</strong> In general, it has provision for gastric drainage, better sealing through a posterior inflatable cuff that improved protection against aspiration, in addition to integral bite block. Examples: Combi-tube, Pro-seal LMA, LMA-Supreme, I-Gel, LTS-D, Air-Q, Aura-Gain, Protector, LMA Gastro.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Third Generation SGA:</strong> Has dynamic sealing mechanism plus double suction ports, in addition to the characteristic of the second Generation. Examples: Baska, Elisha, and 3G LM.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice B) Ambu LMA - Incorrect</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ambu LMA (AuraOnce, AuraFlex, AuraGain) includes both <strong>first- and second-generation</strong> devices, but the generic term \"Ambu LMA\" does not specifically denote a second-generation LMA. AuraGain, for example, is a second-generation LMA, while AuraOnce is a first-generation one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice C) Intubating LMA (ILMA) - Incorrect</strong></p>\r\n<p>Also known as the <strong>LMA Fastrach</strong>, this is a specialized <strong>first-generation LMA</strong> designed to aid <strong>endotracheal intubation</strong>, particularly in difficult airway scenarios. It lacks a gastric drainage port, making it unsuitable as a second-generation device.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice D) Classic LMA - Incorrect</strong></p>\r\n<p>The <strong>Classic LMA</strong> is the <strong>first-generation</strong> prototype of all LMAs. It consists of a simple breathing tube and mask without features like a gastric drainage port or an improved sealing mechanism.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<p>LMA ProSeal is a <strong>second-generation LMA</strong> due to its <strong>gastric drainage tube, improved airway sealing, and integral bite block</strong>, enhancing airway protection compared to first-generation LMAs.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>To perform chest compressions in the unresponsive or pulseless patient, the xiphoid process is located, and the <strong>heel of the rescuer's hand is placed over the lower half of the sternum.</strong> The other hand is placed over the hand on the sternum with the fingers either interlaced or extended, but off the chest.</p>\r\n<p>The rescuer's <strong>shoulders should be positioned directly over the hands with the elbows locked into position and arms extended so that the weight of the upper body is used for compressions.</strong></p>\r\n<p>With a straight downward thrust, <strong>the sternum is depressed approximately 2 inches (5 cm) in adults and1 to 1 1/2 inches (2-4 cm) in children</strong> and then allowed to return to its normal position. For an infant, compressions 1/2 to 1 inches (1 1/2-2 1/2 cm) in depth are made with the middle and ring fingers on the sternum one finger-breadth below the nipple line.
