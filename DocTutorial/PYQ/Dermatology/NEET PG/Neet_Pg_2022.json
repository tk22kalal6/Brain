      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li>Telogen effluvium is a form of nonscarring alopecia characterized by diffuse, often acute hair shedding.</li>\r\n<li>Normally, 85% of a healthy person's hair is in the anagen (growth) phase, and 15% is in the telogen (resting) phase. Telogen effluvium occurs when a significant stressor triggers a large number of anagen hairs to abruptly shift to the telogen phase, causing increased shedding.</li>\r\n<li>Common triggers include acute febrile illnesses, severe infections, major surgery, severe trauma, and hormonal changes such as those postpartum.</li>\r\n<li>In this case, the patient's history of COVID-19, an illness that can serve as a significant stressor, is a likely cause. The shedding typically starts 3-4 months after the trigger and may last less than six months.</li>\r\n<li>Telogen effluvium is a self-limited condition, meaning it often resolves on its own without the need for specific treatment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Answers</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong> Anagen effluvium</strong>: This type of hair loss is characterized by a rapid shedding of hair from the anagen phase, often due to chemotherapy or other forms of significant damage to the hair follicle. It doesn't typically follow the course seen with telogen effluvium.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Androgenetic alopecia</strong>: This is a genetic condition causing gradual, patterned hair thinning, often seen in both men and women. It is not typically linked to a specific event like COVID-19.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Trichotillomania</strong>: This is a psychological disorder where an individual pulls out their own hair. It does not result from physiological stressors like COVID-19 and has distinct behavioral characteristics.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Telogen effluvium is commonly triggered by physiological stress such as severe illness (like COVID-19) and leads to diffuse hair shedding 3-4 months after the event. It is usually self-limiting and resolves within six months.</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)</strong> is the most common <strong>skin malignancy</strong>, often occurring in sun-exposed areas.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clinical appearance</strong>: BCC typically presents as a <strong>pearly white, dome-shaped papule</strong> with <strong>prominent telangiectatic surface vessels</strong>. It may also appear as a <strong>shiny, well-defined plaque</strong> with <strong>rolled-up borders</strong> and a <strong>central erosion</strong>, which can <strong>bleed</strong> upon touch or scratching.</li>\r\n<li>BCC is generally <strong>painless</strong> and can appear as a <strong>small nodule</strong> or growth, often on the <strong>medial canthus</strong> (inner corner of the eye).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Pigmented BCC</strong> can sometimes appear darker due to the presence of <strong>melanin</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>It does not have a <strong>premalignant lesion</strong> and is directly related to <strong>sun exposure</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Answers</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong> Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)</strong>: SCC typically appears as a <strong>firm, smooth, or hyperkeratotic</strong> papule or plaque, often with central <strong>ulceration</strong>. It is not usually associated with the <strong>pearly</strong> appearance of BCC.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Melanoma</strong>: Melanoma generally appears as an <strong>irregularly shaped, multicolored lesion</strong>, and is associated with <strong>rapid growth</strong>, <strong>bleeding</strong>, or <strong>ulceration</strong>, but does not match the typical characteristics of BCC.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Mycosis fungoides</strong>: Mycosis fungoides is a form of <strong>cutaneous T-cell lymphoma</strong> and presents as <strong>erythematous, scaly patches</strong>, not a small nodule like BCC.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Basal cell carcinoma</strong> is the most common <strong>skin cancer</strong> and often presents as a <strong>pearly, dome-shaped nodule</strong> with <strong>rolled borders</strong> and a <strong>central erosion</strong>.
