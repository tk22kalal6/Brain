      "solution": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Choice C: Clofazimine:<br /> </strong>Clofazimine is the drug known to cause skin pigmentation. It can cause a darkening or red- brownish discoloration of the skin, which can be seen in patients undergoing long-term treatment for leprosy. This pigmentation is a well-documented side effect and is reversible once the drug is stopped.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Side effects of Clofazimine-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brown red Hyperpigmentation</li>\n<li>Ichthyosis</li>\n<li>Gastrointestinal disturbances</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation : </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Choice A: Dapsone:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Dapsone is commonly used to treat leprosy and other conditions like dermatitis herpetiformis. It does not typically cause skin pigmentation changes. However, it can cause other side effects such as hemolysis.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Choice B: Rifampicin:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Rifampicin is another drug used to treat leprosy and tuberculosis. It has many side effects, including liver toxicity and gastrointestinal disturbances, but skin pigmentation is not a typical one. It may cause a reddish-orange discoloration of bodily fluids, such as urine, but not skin pigmentation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Choice D: Prednisolone:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Prednisolone is a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation and treat autoimmune diseases. It does not typically cause skin pigmentation. However, it can cause other skin-related side effects such as thinning of the skin, bruising, and delayed wound healing, but not pigmentation changes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Clofazimine (Option C) is the leprosy drug that is most commonly associated with skin pigmentation changes, particularly a darkening of the skin. This side effect is reversible once the treatment is discontinued.</strong></p>",

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Choice B) Segmental:</strong> <strong>Segmental vitiligo</strong> is characterized by depigmentation that occurs in a localized area, often along a specific dermatome (an area of the skin supplied by sensory nerve fibers). Segmental vitiligo tends to remain stable and non-progressive after an initial phase of active spreading, making it the most stable form of vitiligo compared to others. It occurs in childhood. It typically does not affect other areas once it has stabilized.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation: </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Choice A) Focal:</strong> Focal vitiligo involves a limited area of depigmentation. Focal vitiligo can expand over time, and it does not always stay localized, so it is not typically known for becoming stable in the long term.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice C) Acrofacial:</strong> Acrofacial vitiligo affects the face and extremities, particularly the fingers, toes, and face. It can also show progressive depigmentation over time.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice D) Mixed:</strong> Mixed vitiligo refers to a combination of different forms, often with both focal and segmental areas of depigmentation. Because it involves multiple patterns of vitiligo, it may not remain stable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The most stable and non-progressive form of vitiligo is <strong>segmental vitiligo</strong>. This type of vitiligo generally follows a predictable pattern, often confined to a specific area and does not usually expand after an initial period of activity.</p>",

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Choice D) Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2):</strong> <strong>HSV-2</strong> is the most likely cause. The painful vesicular lesions in the mother are characteristic of genital herpes, and HSV-2 can be transmitted to the baby during delivery.

While VZV can cause rashes and potentially affect newborns if the mother has an active infection around the time of delivery.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice B) Enterovirus 70</strong> is associated with a form of viral conjunctivitis called \"acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis\" but it does not typically cause painful vesicular lesions on the genitalia or the described presentation of meningitis and rashes in a newborn.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice C) Streptococcus:</strong> Streptococcal infections, particularly group B Streptococcus, can cause infections in newborns, including meningitis, sepsis, and rashes. The multinucleated giant cells observed in the lesion scrapings point to a viral infection, not a bacterial one.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway :</strong></p>\r\n<p>The most likely cause of this neonatal infection is <strong>Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2)</strong>, which can cause genital herpes in the mother and be transmitted to the baby during delivery. HSV-2 infection in newborns can lead to severe complications such as fever, meningitis, and widespread rashes, often resulting in rapid deterioration and death. The multinucleated giant cells seen in lesion scrapings are indicative of HSV infection, making this the correct diagnosis.
