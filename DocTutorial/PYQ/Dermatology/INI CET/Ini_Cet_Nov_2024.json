      "solution": "<p><strong>Choice B. Ulcers are seen over dorsum of the penis<br /> </strong>This statement is <strong>false</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>In Behcet's disease, genital ulcers typically appear on the <strong>scrotum or the glans penis</strong> (not the dorsum of the penis). These ulcers are painful and recurrent, but they are not typically localized to the dorsum of the penis, making this the incorrect statement.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation : </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice A. Bilateral panuveitis<br /> </strong>Behcet's disease commonly involves inflammation of the uveal tract (uveitis), and it can cause panuveitis (inflammation of the entire uveal tract) in both eyes. This can be bilateral, affecting both eyes, and is one of the classic manifestations of Behcet's disease.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice C. More associated with Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis<br /> </strong>Behcet's disease has a higher association with Crohn's disease compared to ulcerative colitis. Both conditions are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but Behcet's is more frequently linked with Crohn's disease. This statement is true.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice D. Pathergy test is positive<br /> </strong>The pathergy test is a diagnostic test used to help identify Behcet's disease. A positive result occurs when a sterile needle is inserted into the skin, and a papule or pustule forms at the site within 24-48 hours.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The <strong>false</strong> statement is <strong>B</strong>, as genital ulcers in Behcet's disease are more commonly seen on the scrotum or glans penis, not the dorsum of the penis. The other statements regarding panuveitis, the association with Crohn's disease, and the pathergy test are accurate in the context of Behcet's disease.</p>",
