      "solution": "<p>The <strong>correct answer is A</strong>: <strong>Cotard's syndrome</strong>. This syndrome, often seen in <strong>severe depression</strong> or <strong>psychotic depression</strong>, is characterized by a <strong>delusion of negation</strong>, where individuals believe that they are dead, nonexistent, or have lost parts of their body. The patient's statement, \"I lost my head. I am dead,\"aligns with <strong>Cotard's syndrome</strong>, as it reflects a feeling of <strong>total loss of existence</strong> or <strong>death</strong>. This syndrome can result in <strong>psychotic depression</strong>, where the patient may also refuse to eat, as seen in the question.</p>\n<h3><strong>Incorrect Options Explanation:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>(B) Hypochondriacal delusion:</strong> This is <strong>incorrect</strong>. <strong>Hypochondriacal delusion</strong> is a type of somatic delusion where the individual falsely believes they have a serious illness or medical condition, despite medical evidence to the contrary. Examples include delusions of infestation or believing they have a fatal disease. The boy's statement does not suggest a fear of illness but rather an existential crisis, making this option wrong.</li>\n<li><strong>(C) Nihilistic delusion:</strong> This is <strong>incorrect</strong>. <strong>Nihilistic delusion</strong> involves the belief that one's self, others, or the world does not exist, or is about to cease to exist. While there is some overlap between <strong>Cotard's syndrome</strong> and <strong>nihilistic delusions</strong> (both involve a loss of self or existence), <strong>Cotard's syndrome</strong> specifically involves the belief of being dead, which fits the scenario more accurately than nihilistic delusion.</li>\n<li><strong>(D) Bizarre delusion:</strong> This is <strong>incorrect</strong>. A <strong>bizarre delusion</strong> is a type of delusion where the content is so implausible or impossible that it cannot be based on reality. An example would be a person believing that aliens are sucking their blood through rays. The patient's belief in being dead is not <strong>impossible</strong> or <strong>implausible</strong> but rather a <strong>severe depressive delusion</strong>, thus making this option incorrect.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cotard's syndrome</strong> involves delusions of <strong>nonexistence</strong> or being <strong>dead</strong>, typically seen in severe <strong>depression</strong> or <strong>psychotic depression</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Nihilistic delusion</strong> involves the belief that the world or one's self does not exist, but <strong>Cotard's syndrome </strong>specifically includes the <strong>delusion of being dead</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Hypochondriacal delusion</strong> refers to false beliefs about physical illness, and <strong>bizarre delusions</strong> are highly implausible or impossible beliefs, neither of which fit this case.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> STEPs psychiatry.</p>",
