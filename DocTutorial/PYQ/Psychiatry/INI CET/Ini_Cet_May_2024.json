      "solution": "<p><strong>Rapid cycling</strong> in bipolar disorder is actually <strong>more common in females</strong> than in males. Studies show that approximately <strong>72% of cases</strong> of rapid cycling occur in women, making it significantly more prevalent in females.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. Can be associated with hypothyroidism<br /> </strong>There is a known connection between <strong>hypothyroidism</strong> and bipolar disorder, particularly in individuals with rapid cycling. <strong>Thyroid dysfunction</strong> can influence mood regulation and contribute to the occurrence of rapid cycling.</p>\n<p><strong>B. Can be triggered by antidepressant therapy<br /> Antidepressant therapy</strong> has the potential to induce <strong>rapid cycling</strong> in individuals with bipolar disorder. This is especially true when antidepressants are used without adequate mood stabilizers.</p>\n<p><strong>C.Can be more than 4 episodes of bipolar in a year<br /> Rapid cycling</strong> is specifically defined as having <strong>four or more mood episodes</strong> (mania, hypomania, or depression) within a 12-month period.
