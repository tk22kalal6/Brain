      "solution": "<p>The clinical presentation of <strong>altered sensorium</strong> and <strong>pinpoint pupils</strong> strongly suggests <strong>opioid intoxication</strong>. Opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and prescription painkillers, are known to cause <strong>miosis</strong> (constriction of the pupils), which is often described as <strong>pinpoint pupils</strong>. Other common signs of opioid intoxication include <strong>altered mental status</strong>, <strong>respiratory depression</strong>, and <strong>sedation</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.Datura</strong></p>\n<p>Datura is a plant that contains <strong>anticholinergic</strong> compounds, and its intoxication typically presents with <strong>dilated pupils</strong>, <strong>dry skin</strong>, <strong>flushed face</strong>, <strong>delirium</strong>, and <strong>hallucinations</strong>. It does not cause <strong>pinpoint pupils</strong>. Therefore, Datura intoxication is not likely in this case.</p>\n<p><strong>C.Cocaine</strong></p>\n<p>Cocaine intoxication usually leads to <strong>pupil dilation (mydriasis)</strong>, <strong>increased heart rate</strong>, <strong>euphoria</strong>, <strong>agitation</strong>, and <strong>hyperactivity</strong>, rather than <strong>pinpoint pupils</strong>. The combination of altered sensorium and pinpoint pupils is not characteristic of cocaine intoxication.</p>\n<p><strong>D.Amphetamine</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to cocaine, <strong>amphetamine</strong> intoxication also causes <strong>pupil dilation (mydriasis)</strong>, <strong>agitation</strong>, <strong>hyperactivity</strong>, and <strong>euphoria</strong>, not pinpoint pupils.

      "solution": "<p>During pregnancy, the <strong>total body water</strong> increases, which can lead to a <strong>lower concentration of lithium</strong> in the blood. Therefore, an <strong>increase in the dose</strong> of lithium is often required to maintain the therapeutic plasma levels, especially as the pregnancy progresses. Monitoring of <strong>lithium plasma levels</strong> is essential, and adjustments are made to ensure that the woman remains within her therapeutic range. <strong>NICE guidelines</strong> recommend checking lithium plasma levels every 4 weeks until 36 weeks of pregnancy and weekly thereafter to ensure efficacy and safety.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>B.Decrease dose</strong></p>\n<p>Decreasing the dose is not recommended during pregnancy unless there are signs of toxicity or adverse effects. <strong>Lithium levels tend to decrease</strong> during pregnancy due to increased fluid volume, so a <strong>reduction in dose</strong> could lead to suboptimal therapeutic levels, increasing the risk of a mood episode.</p>\n<p><strong>C.Stop the drug and let her be drug-free</strong></p>\n<p>Stopping <strong>lithium</strong> is not advised, especially in the third trimester.
