It is characterized by <strong>severe memory impairment</strong>, particularly <strong>anterograde amnesia</strong> (inability to form new memories) and <strong>confabulation</strong> (fabrication of stories to fill in memory gaps). However, <strong>Korsakoff syndrome</strong> is more associated with chronic memory deficits rather than the acute symptoms described in the scenario (ataxia, cranial nerve involvement, nystagmus).</li>\n<li><strong> C.Delirium tremens</strong>: Delirium tremens (DT) is an acute and severe form of <strong>alcohol withdrawal</strong>. It typically presents with symptoms such as <strong>tremors</strong>, <strong>confusion</strong>, <strong>hallucinations</strong>, <strong>delirium</strong>, and <strong>autonomic instability</strong> (e.g., elevated heart rate, blood pressure).

      "solution": "<p><strong>The squeeze technique</strong> is a non-pharmacological approach used to treat premature ejaculation. It involves the partner squeezing the tip or base of the penis just before ejaculation to interrupt the process. This action helps reduce arousal and delay ejaculation.

CBT focuses on identifying and modifying thought patterns and behaviours that contribute to psychological distress and dysfunction.</li>\n<li><strong> C.Exposure and response prevention</strong>: This therapeutic approach is commonly used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and related conditions. It involves exposing the patient to anxiety-provoking situations while preventing the usual compulsive response. It is not a standard treatment for premature ejaculation.</li>\n<li><strong>D.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Formal Thought Disorder:</strong> Disturbances in structure and organization of thinking. Most commonly seen in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.</p>\n<p>This is an example of <strong>formal thought disorder</strong>. It occurs when a person's thoughts move from one topic to another without a clear or logical connection. This can make their speech disorganized and difficult to follow. In the example provided, the individual starts with a thought about going to Bangalore but then abruptly shifts to a completely unrelated topic, such as Ramesh being smart. <strong>Derailment</strong> is common in <strong>schizophrenia</strong> and other psychotic disorders, where the structure of thought is impaired.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples for common formal thought disorder:</strong></p>\n<p>&Oslash;<strong>Loosening of Association:</strong> There is no association between two different thoughts or ideas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Q</strong>- What is your name?</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>-<em>I am peon in no one's life become easy.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&Oslash;<strong>Derailment</strong>- one thought slides into another.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>I am going to Bangalore.

They are characteristic of <strong>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</strong>, not formal thought disorders. Obsessions are more related to the content of thought, not the organization or structure of it.</li>\n<li><strong> C.Thought insertion</strong>: <strong>Thought insertion</strong> is a <strong>positive symptom</strong> of <strong>schizophrenia</strong> or other psychotic disorders. It refers to the belief that one's thoughts are being placed into their mind by an external force, which is a <strong>delusion</strong>. While it involves abnormal thinking, it is not a formal thought disorder. It pertains more to the content of the thoughts rather than the structure or organization.</li>\n<li><strong>D. Delusion</strong>: <strong>Delusions</strong> are false beliefs that are held with strong conviction despite evidence to the contrary. These can include beliefs such as thinking one has special powers or is being persecuted. Delusions represent a disturbance in the <strong>content</strong> of thought, not the formal structure of thinking. While delusions are often seen in psychosis, they are not classified as formal thought disorders.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Formal thought disorders</strong> involve disruptions in the structure and organization of thought, as seen in conditions like schizophrenia. <strong>Derailment</strong> is a classic example of this, where thoughts move from one topic to another without a logical connection.</li>\n<li>Other symptoms like <strong>obsessions</strong> and <strong>delusions</strong> relate more to the <strong>content</strong> of thought, not its <strong>organization</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/202502110194f44b-fbd2-7a4f-bee6-103cdc3cd6b3.jpg\">",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Exhibitionism</strong> is a type of paraphilia in which an individual gains sexual excitement from exposing their genitals to others, often in public settings or situations where it is inappropriate. In this case, the man sitting naked on his balcony where there are many people in the garden is an example of exhibitionism. The behavior involves exposing oneself to others without their consent, which is the central feature of this disorder.</p>\n<h3><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A. Sadism</strong>: <strong>Sadism</strong> refers to gaining sexual pleasure from inflicting pain, suffering, or humiliation on another person. The scenario does not involve the infliction of pain or suffering but rather the act of exposure for arousal, so it is not sadism.</li>\n<li><strong> B.Frotteurism</strong>: <strong>Frotteurism</strong> involves touching or rubbing against a non-consenting person for sexual pleasure. It typically happens in crowded settings, like public transport, where the person may secretly rub against others. This is different from exhibitionism, as it involves physical contact rather than exposure.</li>\n<li><strong>D. Scoptophilia</strong>: <strong>Scoptophilia</strong> refers to gaining sexual arousal from watching others without their knowledge, often associated with voyeurism. While this could involve a situation where someone is watching others, the behavior in the scenario is about exposing oneself to others, which fits exhibitionism, not scoptophilia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Exhibitionism</strong> involves exposing one's body, often in inappropriate settings, to others for sexual arousal.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Cocaine intoxication is known to stimulate the central nervous system and cause various physiological effects. The symptoms typically seen during cocaine intoxication include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Hyperthermia</strong>: Cocaine use can increase body temperature due to its stimulant effects on the central nervous system.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Agitation</strong>: Cocaine is a stimulant, which can lead to agitation, restlessness, and hyperactivity.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Myocardial infarction</strong>: Cocaine use can cause vasoconstriction, which increases the risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack), especially in individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Why Bradycardia is Incorrect:</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Bradycardia</strong> (slow heart rate) is <strong>not</strong> typically seen in cocaine intoxication. Instead, <strong>tachycardia</strong> (rapid heart rate) is common. Cocaine stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Cocaine intoxication</strong> often leads to <strong>tachycardia</strong>, <strong>agitation</strong>, <strong>hyperthermia</strong>, and <strong>myocardial infarction</strong> due to its stimulant effects.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bradycardia</strong> is not typically a feature of cocaine intoxication; instead, it is associated with conditions like <strong>opioid toxicity</strong> or <strong>vagal stimulation</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>",
