      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li>The symptoms presented in the scenario-overfamiliarity, flight of ideas, elevated mood, increased sexual desire, and pseudo-hallucinations-are characteristic of a <strong>manic episode</strong>. Mania is typically seen in <strong>bipolar disorder</strong> and is marked by an <strong>elevated mood</strong>, <strong>increased energy</strong>, <strong>grandiosity</strong>, <strong>flight of ideas</strong>, <strong>increased sociability</strong>(overfamiliarity), <strong>decreased need for sleep</strong>, and sometimes <strong>pseudo-hallucinations</strong> (sensations that feel like hallucinations but without true external stimuli).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Incorrect Options Explanations:</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong> Schizomania</strong>: This is not a recognized psychiatric diagnosis. The combination of symptoms described-overfamiliarity, flight of ideas, elevated mood, increased sexual desire, and pseudo-hallucinations-points towards a <strong>manic episode</strong>, not a psychotic or schizophrenic disorder.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Hypomania</strong>: <strong>Hypomania</strong> is a milder form of <strong>mania</strong>. It does not typically involve the more severe symptoms like <strong>overfamiliarity</strong> or <strong>pseudo-hallucinations</strong>. Hypomanic episodes are usually characterized by an elevated mood and increased activity, but they do not cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning, which would likely be seen in mania.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Cyclothymia</strong>: <strong>Cyclothymia</strong> is a <strong>chronic mood disorder</strong> involving periods of hypomania and depression. It does not cause the more severe symptoms of mania, such as <strong>overfamiliarity</strong>, <strong>flight of ideas</strong>, or <strong>increased sexual desire</strong>. Cyclothymic episodes are less intense and more stable compared to manic episodes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Mania</strong> is characterized by symptoms such as overfamiliarity, flight of ideas, elevated mood, increased sexual desire, and pseudo-hallucinations.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hypomania</strong> is a milder form of mania and typically lacks the intensity of symptoms seen in manic episodes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cyclothymia</strong> involves a chronic fluctuation between mild hypomanic and depressive episodes but lacks the severity of mania.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Schizomania</strong> is not a valid diagnosis in psychiatric literature.</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>The symptoms described in the scenario, such as<em>irritability, disorientation, paranoid delusions, visual hallucinations and altered sensorium,</em> are characteristic of delirium tremens. Delirium tremens (DT) is a <strong>severe form of alcohol withdrawal</strong>&nbsp;that typically occurs in individuals with a history of heavy and prolonged alcohol use. It usually <strong>develops within 2 to 4 days after stopping alcohol</strong> consumption and is considered a medical emergency due to its potentially life-threatening complications.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong> Alcohol withdrawal seizure-</strong> Alcohol withdrawal seizures are seizures that can occur in individuals <em>who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol intake</em>. While seizures can be part of alcohol withdrawal, the other symptoms described in the scenario are more indicative of delirium tremens.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Wernicke's encephalopathy-</strong> Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurological disorder caused by <em>thiamine(vitamin B1) deficiency,</em>often associated with alcohol use disorder. It can present with a triad of symptoms, including <em>confusion, ataxia (lack of coordination) and eye movement abnormalities</em>. However, the symptoms described in the scenario go beyond the typical triad and are more consistent with delirium tremens.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Korsakoff's psychosis-</strong>Korsakoff's psychosis is a <strong>chronic memory disorder</strong>caused by thiamine deficiency and often <strong>occurs as a result of Wernicke's encephalopathy</strong>. While it can cause memory deficits, it is not associated with the acute and severe symptoms described in the scenario. Delirium tremens is a more likely diagnosis given the acute presentation of symptoms after alcohol cessation.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Delirium tremens (DT)</strong> is an acute, severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can present with <strong>visual hallucinations</strong>, <strong>paranoid delusions</strong>, <strong>disorientation</strong>, and <strong>altered sensorium</strong>, typically developing 2 to 4 days after alcohol cessation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Alcohol withdrawal seizures</strong> are part of withdrawal but are more likely to occur within the first 24-48 hours and do not typically involve hallucinations or delusions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Wernicke's encephalopathy</strong> involves <strong>confusion</strong>, <strong>ataxia</strong>, and <strong>eye movement abnormalities</strong>, not the extensive psychiatric symptoms seen in DT.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Korsakoff's psychosis</strong> is a <strong>chronic</strong> memory disorder that occurs after Wernicke's encephalopathy and is not associated with acute withdrawal symptoms like delirium or hallucinations.</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>The symptom of <strong>feeling insects crawling under the skin</strong>, also known as <strong>formication</strong>, is a common side effect of <strong>cocaine</strong> use. <strong>Formication</strong> is a type of tactile hallucination where the person feels sensations that are not actually present. Cocaine use can lead to intense psychological effects, including paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations, with formication being a particularly well-documented phenomenon in chronic users.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Incorrect Options Explanations:</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong> Cannabis</strong>: While <strong>cannabis</strong> use can cause <strong>paranoia</strong> or <strong>anxiety</strong> in some individuals, it is not typically associated with <strong>formication</strong>. Cannabis primarily affects the <strong>endocannabinoid system</strong>, and its effects are usually related to altered perception, mood changes, and increased appetite rather than tactile hallucinations like formication.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Amphetamine</strong>: <strong>Amphetamines</strong> can cause a variety of psychological symptoms, including <strong>paranoia</strong>, <strong>agitation</strong>, and <strong>hallucinations</strong>. However, <strong>formication</strong> is more commonly seen with <strong>cocaine</strong> than amphetamines, although it can still occur in high doses or with prolonged use of amphetamines.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Tobacco</strong>: <strong>Tobacco</strong> use, or nicotine in particular, is not typically associated with <strong>formication</strong>. Nicotine affects the <strong>nicotinic receptors</strong> in the brain and can cause stimulation or relaxation, but it does not generally lead to the tactile hallucinations described in this case.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Formication</strong> (the sensation of insects crawling under the skin) is commonly associated with <strong>cocaine</strong> use, especially in cases of chronic abuse or overdose.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Amphetamines</strong> can also cause hallucinations, but <strong>formication</strong> is more commonly linked to <strong>cocaine</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cannabis</strong> and <strong>tobacco</strong> are not typically associated with <strong>formication</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>",

Symptoms include mood swings, irritability, tearfulness, and anxiety. The condition typically resolves within a few days to a week. The most appropriate treatment for postpartum blues is <strong>emotional support and education</strong>, which can help the new mother understand the normal course of the condition, reduce feelings of isolation, and provide coping strategies. This supportive approach is often enough to manage postpartum blues without the need for medication.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Incorrect Options Explanations:</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong> Lithium</strong>: <strong>Lithium</strong> is a medication primarily used to treat <strong>bipolar disorder</strong> and is not typically recommended for <strong>postpartum blues</strong>. Postpartum blues is a mild, self-limiting condition that generally does not require pharmacological treatment like lithium. Lithium may be used for more severe mood disorders, such as <strong>postpartum depression</strong> or <strong>bipolar disorder</strong>, but is not first-line for postpartum blues.</li>\r\n<li><strong> Fluoxetine</strong>: <strong>Fluoxetine</strong> is an <strong>SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor)</strong> commonly used to treat <strong>depression</strong> and <strong>anxiety disorders</strong>. While it is used to treat <strong>postpartum depression</strong>, it is not necessary for the treatment of <strong>postpartum blues</strong>, as the latter is typically mild and resolves with time and emotional support. Pharmacologic treatment like fluoxetine may be used for more severe cases like postpartum depression but is not recommended for postpartum blues.</li>\r\n<li><strong> CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)</strong>: While <strong>CBT</strong> is a very effective treatment for <strong>depression</strong>, <strong>anxiety</strong>, and other mood disorders, it is not typically necessary for <strong>postpartum blues</strong>, which is a mild and temporary condition.

      "solution": "<p>This drug is an <strong>anticholinergic agent</strong> that is commonly used to treat <strong>Parkinson's-like symptoms</strong>, particularly those induced by antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotic drugs, especially first-generation antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol), can block dopamine receptors, leading to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) like rigidity, tremors, and bradykinesia, which resemble Parkinson's disease symptoms. <strong>Trihexyphenidyl</strong> works by blocking the action of acetylcholine in the brain, helping to restore the balance between acetylcholine and dopamine and alleviating these symptoms.</p>\n<h3><strong>Incorrect Options Explanations:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong> A.Escitalopram</strong>: This is a <strong>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</strong>, primarily used for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. It has no effect on Parkinson's-like symptoms induced by antipsychotic drugs and is not helpful in treating extrapyramidal symptoms.</li>\n<li><strong> B.Ropinirole</strong>: Ropinirole is a <strong>dopamine agonist</strong> used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome. While it works by stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain, it is not typically used to treat Parkinson's-like symptoms caused by antipsychotic drugs. In fact, using dopaminergic drugs in these cases may worsen the symptoms.</li>\n<li><strong> D.Entacapone</strong>: This drug is a <strong>COMT inhibitor</strong> used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It helps to increase dopamine levels in the brain by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down dopamine. However, it is not used to treat Parkinson's-like symptoms caused by antipsychotic medications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trihexyphenidyl</strong> is the most effective drug for treating Parkinson's-like symptoms caused by antipsychotic medications, as it addresses the imbalance between acetylcholine and dopamine.</li>\n<li><strong>Anticholinergic medications</strong> like trihexyphenidyl are commonly used to manage <strong>extrapyramidal symptoms</strong>caused by antipsychotic drugs, while dopaminergic drugs (like ropinirole or entacapone) are not suitable for this purpose.</li>\n</ul>",
