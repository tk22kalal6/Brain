This reduces serum and intraprostatic DHT concentration thereby causing involution of prostatic epithelium thus slowing the progression of BPH.

The two main drugs in this category are <strong>finasteride</strong> and <strong>dutasteride</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mechanism of Action</strong></p>\r\n<p>Both finasteride and dutasteride work by inhibiting the enzyme <strong>5-alpha reductase</strong>, which converts <strong>testosterone</strong> to <strong>dihydrotestosterone (DHT)</strong>. DHT is a potent androgen that plays a key role in the development of prostate tissue and hair follicle miniaturization. By blocking the formation of DHT, these drugs reduce its effects, leading to decreased prostate size in BPH and reduced hair loss in androgenic alopecia. <strong>This leads to decreased levels of DHT in the body.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Finasteride</strong> selectively inhibits <strong>type II 5-alpha reductase</strong>, which is mainly found in the prostate and hair follicles.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Dutasteride</strong> inhibits both <strong>type I and type II 5-alpha reductase</strong>, providing a more comprehensive reduction in DHT levels throughout the body.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Clinical Uses</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH):</strong> Both finasteride and dutasteride are used to treat BPH by reducing prostate size, improving urinary flow, and alleviating symptoms like urinary retention and frequency.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Male Pattern Baldness (Androgenic Alopecia):</strong> Finasteride is specifically approved for this condition. It helps reduce hair loss and may promote hair regrowth by lowering DHT levels in the scalp.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Adverse Effects</strong></p>\r\n<p>The common side effects of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are mainly related to their impact on androgen levels. These include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Sexual dysfunction</strong>, such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory issues, due to reduced DHT levels.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Gynecomastia</strong>, or the enlargement of breast tissue, which can occur as a hormonal side effect.</li>\r\n<li>There is a potential risk of <strong>high-grade prostate cancer</strong>, although this is rare. Regular monitoring is recommended during treatment.</li>\r\n</ul>",

It is a Jarisch Herxheimer (Arthus) type of reaction due to release of antigens from the killed bacilli, and may be mild, severe or life-threatening, i.e. erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Temporary discontinuation of dapsone is recommended only in severe cases. Clofazimine (200 mg daily) is effective in controlling the reaction (except the severe one), probably because of its antiinflammatory property. For severe reactions, prednisolone 40-60 mg/day is started immediately and continued till the reaction subsides. The dose is then tapered over 2-3 months.</p>\r\n<p>Thalidomide It is an anti inflammatory, cytokine (TNF&alpha;,ILs, interferon) modulating drug with anxiolytic, antiemetic property. Thalidomide can be used in ENL as an alternative to prednisolone.</p>\r\n<p>Reversal reaction: This is seen in TT and BL cases, and is a manifestation of delayed hypersensitivity to <em>M. leprae</em> antigens. Cutaneous ulceration, multiple nerve involvement with swollen, painful and tender nerves occur suddenly even after completion of therapy.

      "solution": "<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors: <em>James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo</em> received Nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation. Normally, there are certain checkpoints, so that immune cells (like T-cells) do not attack self antigens. Certain receptors like PD-1 (programmed death receptors) or CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein) are present on T-cells. When ligands on other cells (PDL-1 or CD-80/86 respectively) bind to these receptors, T-cells are inhibited. Same method is utilized by some cancer cells to evade destruction from T-cells. These tumor cells overexpress the ligands like PDL-1 and inhibit T-cells. Monoclonal antibodies targeting these interactions result in disinhibition of these brakes and thus, T-cells can destroy cancer cells.</p>\r\n<p>(a) PD-1 and PDL-1 inhibitors</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab and Cemiplimab are monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 receptors on T-cells.</li>\r\n<li>Atezolizumab, Avelumab and Durvalumab are monoclonal antibodies against PDL-1 present on cancer cells.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>(b) CTLA-4 Inhibitor:</p>\r\n<p>Normally CD-80 or CD-86 present on antigen presenting cells bind to CD-28 present on T-cells. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a CD-28 homologue expressed on T-cells. Binding of this with CD-80/86 molecules inhibit the T-cells. Ipilimumab acts as CTLA-4 inhibitor resulting in T-cell activation and destruction of cancer cells. It is approved for treatment of malignant melanoma.</p>\r\n<p>List of immune checkpoint inhibitors and their indications:</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/20250421f635ba69-c0f7-414c-b539-1f9059336bcd.jpg\">",
