After condensation of acetyl-CoA with oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle within mitochondria, the citrate produced can be translocated into the extramitochondrial compartment via the tricarboxylate transporter, where in the presence of CoA and ATP, it undergoes cleavage to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by ATP-citrate lyase, which increases in activity in the well-fed state.</p>\r\n<p>Option A: Reaction that converts malate to pyruvate catalyzed by the NADP malate dehydrogenase(malic enzyme) also produces NADPH in cytosol.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: The oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway are the chief source of the hydrogen required for the synthesis of fatty acids.

      "solution": "<p>Option A: <strong>Above patient having beriberi associated with heart failure(wet beriberi) which occurs due to Vitamin B1(Thiamine) deficiency.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Vitamin B1(Thiamine) deficiency can result in three distinct syndromes: a chronic peripheral neuritis, beriberi, which may or may not be associated with heart failure and edema; acute pernicious(fulminating) beriberi(Shoshin beriberi), in which heart failure and metabolic abnormalities predominate, without peripheral neuritis; and Wernicke encephalopathy with Korsakoff psychosis, which is associated especially with alcohol and narcotic abuse. The role of thiamin diphosphate in pyruvate dehydrogenase means that in deficiency there is impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. In subjects on a relatively high carbohydrate diet, this results in increased plasma concentrations of lactate and pyruvate, which may cause life-threatening lactic acidosis.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy.</p>\r\n<p>Proline and lysine hydroxylases are required for the postsynthetic modification of procollagen to collagen. Both this enzyme requires vitamin C. So signs of vitamin C deficiency include skin changes, fragility of blood capillaries, gum decay, tooth loss and bone fracture, which can be attributed to impaired collagen synthesis(leading to delayed wound healing) and psychological changes that can be attributed to impaired synthesis of catecholamines.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Although Vitamin B2(riboflavin) is centrally involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and deficiency occurs in many countries, it is not fatal, because there is very efficient conservation of tissue riboflavin. Riboflavin released by the catabolism of enzymes is rapidly incorporated into newly synthesized enzymes. Deficiency is characterized by cheilosis, desquamation and inflammation of the tongue and seborrheic dermatitis. Riboflavin nutritional status is assessed by measurement of the activation of erythrocyte glutathione reductase by FAD added in vitro.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Although clinical deficiency disease is rare, there is evidence that a significant proportion of the population has marginal vitamin B6 status. Moderate deficiency results in abnormalities of tryptophan and methionine metabolism. Increased sensitivity to steroid hormone action may be important in the development of hormone-dependent cancer of the breast, uterus, and prostate and vitamin B6 status may affect the prognosis. The most widely used method of assessing vitamin B6 status is by the activation of erythrocyte transaminases by pyridoxal phosphate added in vitro, expressed as the activation coefficient. Measurement of plasma concentrations of the vitamin is also used.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Option A: Aspartate is an amino acid, involved in the urea cycle.</p>\r\n<p>Argininosuccinate synthetase links aspartate and citrulline via the amino group of aspartate and provides the second nitrogen of urea.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Cleavage of argininosuccinate is catalyzed by argininosuccinate lyase in the urea cycle. The reaction proceeds with retention of all three nitrogens in arginine and release of the aspartate skeleton as fumarate. Subsequent addition of water to fumarate forms l-malate, whose subsequent NAD+-dependent oxidation forms oxaloacetate. These two reactions are analogous to reactions of the citric acid cycle, but are catalyzed by cytosolic fumarase and malate dehydrogenase. Transamination of oxaloacetate by glutamate aminotransferase then reforms aspartate. The carbon skeleton of aspartate-fumarate thus acts as a carrier of the nitrogen of glutamate into a precursor of urea.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Alanine is an amino acid, not involved in urea cycle or kreb&rsquo;s cycle.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Cleavage of argininosuccinate is catalyzed by argininosuccinate lyase in the urea cycle.
