      "solution": "<p>Above image showing xerophthalmia, which occurs due to vitamin A deficiency.</p>\r\n<p>Option A: Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy. Proline and lysine hydroxylases are required for the postsynthetic modification of procollagen to collagen. Both this enzyme requires vitamin C. So signs of vitamin C deficiency include skin changes, fragility of blood capillaries, gum decay, tooth loss and bone fracture, which can be attributed to impaired collagen synthesis(leading to delayed wound healing) and psychological changes that can be attributed to impaired synthesis of catecholamines.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Vitamin A deficiency is the most important preventable cause of blindness. The earliest sign of deficiency is a loss of sensitivity to green light, followed by impairment to adapt to dim light, then night blindness, an inability to see in the dark.</p>\r\n<p>More prolonged deficiency leads to xerophthalmia: keratinization of the cornea and blindness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Vitamin B deficiency leads to various clinical manifestations, not involving the eye.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: In experimental animals, vitamin E deficiency results in resorption of fetuses and testicular atrophy. Dietary deficiency of vitamin E in human beings is unknown, although patients with severe fat malabsorption, cystic fibrosis and some forms of chronic liver disease suffer deficiency because they are unable to absorb or transport the vitamin, leading to nerve and muscle membrane damage. Premature infants are born with inadequate reserves of the vitamin. The erythrocyte membranes are abnormally fragile as a result of lipid peroxidation, leading to hemolytic anemia.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Option A: Histone is the most abundant chromatin protein, involved in DNA packaging.</p>\r\n<p>Histones are a small family of closely related basic proteins. H1 histones are the ones least tightly bound to chromatin and are, therefore, easily removed with a salt solution, after which chromatin becomes more soluble. The organizational unit of this soluble chromatin is the nucleosome. Nucleosomes contain four major types of histones: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The sequence and structures of all four histones, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, the so-called core histones that form the nucleosome, have been highly conserved between species, although variants of the histones exist and are used for specialized purposes. This extreme conservation implies that the function of histones is identical in all eukaryotes and that the entire molecule is involved quite specifically in carrying out this function. The carboxyl terminal two-thirds of the histone molecules are hydrophobic, while their amino terminal thirds are particularly rich in basic amino acids.</p>\r\n<p>The histones interact with each other in very specific ways. H3 and H4 form a tetramer containing two molecules of each(H3-H4)2, while H2A and H2B form dimers H2A- H2B). Under physiologic conditions, these histone oligomers associate to form the histone octamer of the composition(H3-H4)2-(H2A-H2B)2.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/2025041198c08d6a-3c54-4d8c-b4dd-8c27bdb17df3.jpg\">\r\n<p>Option B: Glycoprotein is not involved in DNA packing.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Nucleic acids are DNA &amp; RNA.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Adenine is a Nitrogen base present in nucleic acid.</p>",

This enzyme is involved in HMP shunt.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: In red blood cells, the pentose phosphate pathway is the sole source of NADPH for the reduction of oxidized glutathione catalyzed by glutathione reductase, a flavoprotein containing flavin adenine dinucleotide(FAD). Reduced glutathione removes H2O2 in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme that contains the selenium analog of cysteine at the active site.

      "solution": "<p>Option A: Acyl carrier protein(ACP) has a similar function to that of CoA in the &beta;-oxidation pathway. It contains the vitamin pantothenic acid in the form of 4&prime;-phosphopantetheine. During fatty acid synthesis, initially a priming molecule of acetyl-CoA combines with a cysteine -SH group, while malonyl-CoA combines with the adjacent -SH on the 4&prime;-phosphopantetheine of ACP of the other monomer.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/20250411d43c45ed-a3ba-4a9c-8fb5-b12bbbbd50fe.jpg\">\r\n<p>Option B: Long-chain fatty acids cross the inner mitochondrial membrane as carnitine derivatives. Carnitine(&beta;-hydroxy-&gamma;-trimethylammonium butyrate), is widely distributed and is particularly abundant in muscle. Long-chain acyl-CoA(or FFA) cannot penetrate the inner membrane of mitochondria. In the presence of carnitine, however, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, transfers the long-chain acyl group from CoA to carnitine, forming acylcarnitine and releasing CoA. Acylcarnitine is able to penetrate the inner membrane and gain access to the &beta;-oxidation system of enzymes via the inner membrane exchange transporter carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. The transporter binds acylcarnitine and transports it across the membrane in exchange for carnitine. The acyl group is then transferred to CoA so that acyl-CoA is reformed and carnitine is liberated. This reaction is catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-II, which is located on the inside of the inner membrane.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/2025041197044c8d-b0db-4d33-9356-d58ec067fcc6.jpg\">\r\n<p>Option C: Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase(LCAT) enzyme is found in plasma, catalyzes the transfer of a fatty acid residue from the 2 position of lecithin to cholesterol to form cholesteryl ester and lysolecithin and is considered to be responsible for much of the cholesteryl ester in plasma lipoproteins.</p>\r\n<p>Lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase(LCAT) activity is associated with HDL containing apo A-I. As cholesterol in HDL becomes esterified, it creates a concentration gradient and draws in cholesterol from tissues and from other lipoproteins, thus enabling HDL to function in reverse cholesterol transport.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Albumin transport various ligands, including bilirubin, free fatty acids, ions [Ca2+], metals[eg, Cu2+, Zn2+], metheme, steroids, other hormones and a variety of drugs.</p>",
