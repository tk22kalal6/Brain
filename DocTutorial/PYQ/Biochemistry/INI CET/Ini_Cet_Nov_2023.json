This syndrome has been traced to defects in mismatch repair. Human and other eukaryotic cells have several proteins analogous to the bacterial MutL and MutS proteins. Defects in at least five different mismatch repair genes can give rise to HNPCC. The most prevalent are defects in the hMLH1 (human MutL homolog 1) and hMSH2 (human MutS homolog 2) genes. In individuals with HNPCC, cancer generally develops at an early age, with colon cancers being most common.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Most human breast cancer occurs in women with no known predisposition. However, about 10% of cases are associated with inherited defects in two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Human BRCA1 and BRCA2 are large proteins that interact with a wide range of other proteins involved in transcription, chromosome maintenance, DNA repair, and control of the cell cycle. BRCA2 has been implicated in the recombinational DNA repair of double-strand breaks. However, the precise molecular function of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in these various cellular processes is not yet clear. Women with defects in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have a greater than 80% chance of developing breast cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: KU70 is a protein that identify DSBs in genomic DNA (sensors).</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Gene encoding ATP is not involved in dsDNA repair mechanism.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Hybridoma technology involves the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by fusing a specific antibody-producing B cell (from an immunized animal) with a myeloma cell (a cancerous plasma cell). The resulting hybrid cell, called a hybridoma, has the capability to continuously produce large quantities of a specific monoclonal antibody.</p>\r\n<p>Hybridoma technology needs HAT medium, HAT medium, also known as Hypoxanthine-Aminopterin-Thymidine medium, is a selective growth medium used in hybridoma technology and cell culture techniques, particularly in the production of monoclonal antibodies. Here's a breakdown of its components and purpose:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Components of HAT Medium</strong>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Hypoxanthine</strong>: can enter salvage pathway.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Aminopterin</strong>: A folic acid analogue that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, thereby blocking de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Thymidine</strong>: A nucleoside that can bypass the inhibition caused by aminopterin by providing a source of thymidine nucleotides, can enter salvage pathway.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>So, HAT medium inhibits the de novo synthesis of purines. So, only salvage pathway is operated</p>\r\n<p>the purine salvage pathway supports hybridoma technology by providing a means for hybridoma cells to recycle and utilize purine bases for nucleotide synthesis. This pathway ensures that hybridoma cells have an adequate supply of nucleotides necessary for the continuous production of monoclonal antibodies</p>\r\n<p>Now,</p>\r\n<p>3 type of cells are present in the HAT medium</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>B cell antibodies- limited lifespan so can grow but limited life</li>\r\n<li>Myeloma/ Cancer cells- can&rsquo;t grow in HAT medium because it grows only with deno synthesis</li>\r\n<li>Monoclonal antibodies- can grow in HAT medium because can operate salvage pathway</li>\r\n</ol>",
