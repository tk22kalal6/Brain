There is no role for BRCA testing in the daughter of a cervical cancer patient.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Screen for PTEN mutation (Option C): </strong>PTEN mutations are associated with Cowden syndrome, which increases the risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers, not cervical cancer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Perform cervical biopsy (Option D):</strong> A cervical biopsy is a diagnostic tool, not a screening method.
