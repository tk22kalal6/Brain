The nerve of Wrisberg arises from the facial nerve in the geniculate ganglion. The tympanic branch supplies sensory innervation to the tympanic membrane and the middle ear. The lesser petrosal nerve supplies parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland.</li>\n<li><strong>Vidian nerve:</strong>This is a branch of the trigeminal nerve that supplies sensation to the pterygopalatine fossa.

Vagus is a parasympathetic nerve and stimulation of it gives rise to hypotension and bradycardia.</p>",
