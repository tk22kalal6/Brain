      "solution": "<p><strong>Adenoid facies</strong>: It refers to the facial appearance of individuals with chronic adenoid hypertrophy. It is characterized by an<strong> open-mouthed expression, elongated face, high arched palate, and prominent incisors.</strong> Chronic adenoid hypertrophy can result in nasal obstruction, mouth breathing, and changes in facial structure, leading to the characteristic appearance known as adenoid facies.</p>\n<p>B. Goldenhar syndrome: Goldenhar syndrome, also known as oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS), is a congenital condition characterized by facial and ear anomalies, vertebral defects, and eye abnormalities. It typically involves asymmetry of the face, but it is not represented by the image shown.</p>\n<p>C. Horse face deformity is a term used to describe a facial appearance that is characterized by a long face, a high forehead, and a prominent nose. It is not caused by adenoid hypertrophy.</p>\n<p>D. Frog face deformity is a term used to describe a facial appearance that is characterized by a short face, a depressed nasal bridge, and a receding chin. It is not caused by adenoid hypertrophy.</p>",
