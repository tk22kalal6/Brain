      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The given pedigree chart shows <strong>mitochondrial inheritance,</strong> and among the given options, <strong>Kearns-Sayre syndrome</strong> follows this pattern of inheritance.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Each mitochondrion contains multiple copies of its own <strong>circular chromosome</strong> that encodes tRNAs, rRNAs, and proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation.</li>\r\n<li>Because sperm contribute negligible cytoplasmic components to the zygote, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is <strong>inherited exclusively through the maternal line.</strong></li>\r\n<li>All children of affected mothers inherit the disorder, while affected fathers do not transmit it to their offspring.</li>\r\n<li>Mutations in mitochondrial DNA impair <strong>oxidative phosphorylation</strong>, reducing ATP production, generating free radicals, and triggering apoptosis, affecting high-energy-demand tissues such as <strong>skeletal muscle</strong>, heart, and neurons.</li>\r\n<li>Skeletal muscle involvement may present as weakness, elevated creatine kinase, or rhabdomyolysis, often with extraocular muscle weakness such as <strong>chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Pathologically, muscle fibres may show subsarcolemmal aggregates of abnormal mitochondria in the form of <strong>ragged red fibres,</strong> as shown below or loss of specific mitochondrial enzyme activities.<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/2025091008445959-d8bb-42ca-a52d-22371b460964.png\"></li>\r\n<li>A key feature of mitochondrial disorders is <strong>heteroplasmy</strong>: While mitochondrial DNA replicates independently of nuclear DNA, different cells and tissues can carry <strong>varying proportions</strong> of mutant and wild-type mitochondria, leading to wide variation in when and how disease manifests.</li>\r\n<li>Single mutations can cause mild isolated symptoms in one person and severe multisystem disease, such as <strong>mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)</strong> in another.</li>\r\n<li>They can result from point mutations or deletions in mitochondrial DNA, as in Kearns-Sayre syndrome, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres, or <strong>Leber hereditary optic neuropathy</strong>, and may also arise from nuclear gene mutations affecting mitochondrial proteins.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Achondroplasia (Option A): </strong>Achondroplasia follows an <strong>autosomal dominant </strong>inheritance pattern. Autosomal dominant disorders occur when the mutation is present in a single allele, so at least <strong>one parent of the affected individual</strong> is usually affected, and the condition can be transmitted by <strong>either sex</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Williams syndrome (Option C): </strong>Typically arises from a <strong>7q11.23 deletion</strong> and is marked by <strong>supravalvular aortic stenosis</strong>, hypercalcemia, and orofacial features.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Prader-Willi syndrome (Option D):</strong> Prader-Willi syndrome arises due to <strong>genomic imprinting</strong>. Genomic imprinting is an<strong> epigenetic process</strong> where certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, meaning one parental allele (maternal or paternal) is selectively inactivated through mechanisms like <strong>DNA methylatio</strong>n and histone modification.</p>",

The most frequent is <strong>C2 deficiency</strong>, followed by C4 or C1q deficiencies, which impair the classical pathway and are linked to increased bacterial or viral infections, though many remain asymptomatic due to compensation by the alternative pathway. These deficiencies can sometimes manifest as<strong> SLE-like autoimmune disease</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>C3 deficiency, critical for both classical and alternative pathways, leads to severe, recurrent bacterial infections and<strong> immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis</strong> due to impaired immune complex clearance.</li>\r\n<li>Deficiency of C1 inhibitor causes <strong>hereditary angioedema</strong>, characterised by episodic swelling of skin, mucosa, and internal tissues due to unregulated kallikrein activation and bradykinin production, sometimes leading to life-threatening airway or gastrointestinal involvement. <strong>(Option D ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n<li>Other regulatory protein deficiencies contribute to disorders such as <strong>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</strong>, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and age-related macular degeneration.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Myeloperoxidase deficiency (Option A): </strong>Myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency is the most frequent neutrophil defect, inherited as an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> condition.

Immunophenotypically, the neoplastic cells express high levels of cyclin D1, CD19, and CD20, along with surface Ig (usually IgM and IgD with &kappa; or &lambda; light chains), and are <strong>CD5 positive </strong>but <strong>CD23 negative.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>t(8;14) (Option D): </strong>The commonest translocation seen in <strong>Burkitt&rsquo;s lymphoma</strong> is t(8;14), but t(2;8) and t(8;22) are also seen.

It is linked to conditions such as ischemia, toxin exposure, infections, and trauma. It is not a caspase-mediated process. <strong>(Option B ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n<li>The process involves denaturation of proteins, <strong>loss of membrane integrity</strong>, and <strong>enzymatic digestion of cellular components</strong>, resulting in leakage of intracellular contents and inflammation.</li>\r\n<li>The distinguishing features between apoptosis and necrosis are summarised in the table given below.<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/20250910a762c9f8-d0f1-4802-90c2-3b54d1631642.png\"></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other less common forms of cell death include necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Necroptosis</strong> is a hybrid process sharing features of both necrosis and apoptosis. Like necrosis, it involves loss of ATP, <strong>swelling of organelles</strong>, ROS generation, lysosomal enzyme release, and plasma membrane rupture, but it is triggered by <strong>programmed signalling pathways</strong> similar to apoptosis.</li>\r\n<li>It is <strong>caspase-independent</strong> and often initiated through TNFR1 activation, leading to <strong>RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL</strong> signalling, MLKL phosphorylation, and membrane disruption. It plays roles in both physiological processes (e.g., bone growth plate formation) and pathological conditions (e.g., steatohepatitis, pancreatitis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, neurodegenerative diseases).<strong> (Option A ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Pyroptosis</strong> is a cell death pathway linked to infection and inflammation, triggered when intracellular receptors detect microbial products and activate the inflammasome. This leads to<strong> caspase-1 activation</strong>, cleavage of IL-1 precursors, and<strong> release of IL-1</strong>, promoting inflammation and fever. It also results in cell death through caspase-4 and -5 activation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ferroptosis</strong> is caused by excessive iron-dependent<strong> lipid peroxidation</strong> when antioxidant defences fail. It leads to membrane damage and cell death, with ultrastructural changes including reduced mitochondrial cristae and rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane. While its physiological role is debated, it has been linked to cancer, neurodegeneration, and stroke. <strong>(Option D ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n</ul>",

The resulting <strong>colour change </strong>upon substrate addition reflects the amount of antibody bound.

The membrane is incubated with patient serum, and if antibodies are present, they bind to the corresponding proteins. These are then visualised using an <strong>enzyme-labelled secondary antibody</strong> and substrate, producing a detectable colour band. This method is commonly applied as a confirmatory test for infections such as HCV and Lyme disease.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Immunohistochemistry (Option D): </strong>Immunohistochemistry uses specific antibodies to identify <strong>cellular products</strong> or <strong>markers</strong>, aiding in the diagnosis and management of malignancies.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma</strong> of the oral cavity is associated with<strong> human papillomavirus</strong>.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) </strong>constitutes up to 80% of SCCs in this region, most commonly involving the tonsils, base of tongue, and pharynx, and is frequently associated with oncogenic <strong>human papillomavirus (HPV)</strong>, particularly HPV-16.</li>\r\n<li>The incidence of HPV-associated SCC of the oropharynx has more than doubled in recent decades, and these tumours often arise in the <strong>reticulated epithelium</strong> of the tonsillar crypts, presenting as nonkeratinizing,<strong> basaloid cell proliferations</strong> in nests and cords accompanied by sheets of lymphocytes, as shown below.<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/202509105a22dfda-f38f-4394-9dc1-40495a13ddb4.png\"></li>\r\n<li>Clinically, HPV-associated SCCs may lack obvious mucosal lesions but are notable for significant <strong>cervical lymphadenopathy</strong>, and <strong>p16 protein overexpression</strong> is a useful marker for diagnosis, with PCR or in situ hybridization serving as confirmatory tests.</li>\r\n<li>In contrast, <strong>keratinizing SCCs</strong>, more often linked to <strong>smoking </strong>and <strong>alcohol</strong>, usually originate as dysplastic lesions that may progress to full-thickness dysplasia (carcinoma in situ) before invading the underlying stroma.</li>\r\n<li>They can vary from well-differentiated to anaplastic forms, and histologic differentiation does not correlate with behaviour. These tumours tend to infiltrate locally before metastasising, with cervical lymph nodes as common sites for local spread, and lungs, liver, and bones as frequent sites for distant metastases.</li>\r\n<li>Long-term outcomes are generally better in HPV-positive cases.</li>\r\n<li>A significant concern in SCC of the oropharynx is <strong>field cancerization</strong>, where patients, particularly those with classic SCC, face a high risk of developing new primary tumours due to widespread <strong>mucosal carcinogen exposure</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Epstein&ndash;Barr virus (Option A): Hairy leukoplakia</strong> is an EBV-associated oral lesion typically seen on the <strong>lateral border of the tongue</strong> in immunocompromised individuals, notably those with HIV, but also in cases of cancer therapy, transplant-related immunosuppression, and advanced age. It appears as white, confluent,&nbsp; <strong>hyperkeratotic patches</strong> that cannot be scraped off, with histology showing hyperparakeratosis, acanthosis with balloon cells, and detectable EBV RNA and proteins in lesional cells. Malignancies associated with EBV include nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and other B-cell lymphomas.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cytomegalovirus (Option B): </strong>In immunocompetent individuals beyond the neonatal stage, CMV infection most often presents as an<strong> infectious mononucleosis syndrome</strong>, characterised by fever, atypical lymphocytosis, lymph node enlargement, and hepatitis with hepatomegaly and abnormal liver function test results.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Herpes simplex virus (Option C): </strong>Oral herpes, most often due to HSV-1, commonly presents in children as <strong>acute gingivostomatitis </strong>and in adults as <strong>acute pharyngitis</strong>, with<strong> vesicles</strong> and ulcerations that may be accompanied by fever, lymphadenopathy, and anorexia. Lesions range from small vesicles to large bullae containing clear fluid, which rupture to form painful shallow ulcers. Histology shows intracellular and intercellular oedema with intranuclear viral inclusions or multinucleated giant cells, demonstrable by the Tzanck test.</p>",
