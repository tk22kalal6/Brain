Radical surgical treatment might be considered in younger (&lt;70 years) men with this form of the disease and/or with a family history, although, even in this group, some men will elect to pursue a conservative course (active surveillance) when counselled about risks versus benefts (impotence/ incontinence).</li>\n<li>Intermediate-risk: disease. In younger (&lt;70 years), ftter men, this may be treated by radical prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy. Active monitoring remains an option, particularly for more elderly patients towards the lower end of the risk spectrum. In elderly patients with outfow obstruction, transurethral resection with or without hormone therapy is indicated. The beneft of radical treatment over a conservative approach is likely to be about 25%, given that progression to metastatic disease is of this order of magnitude after 10 years.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>High-risk disease: These patients are at signifcant risk of disease progression. They need multimodal therapy. Early androgen ablation is favoured if close follow-up is not possible. For the sexually active, a careful conservative approach with the adoption of androgen ablation when symptoms arise is reasonable. Androgen ablation coupled with radiotherapy, perhaps with surgery (radical prostatectomy plus salvage radiotherapy) as part of a multimodal approach, is standard treatment for younger men with T3 disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Metastatic disease: Once metastases have developed, the outlook is poor. For patients with symptoms, there is no dilemma; androgen ablation will provide symptomatic relief in over two-thirds of patients. For patients with asymptomatic metastases, the timing of treatment is less clear. Systemic chemotherapy with docetaxel should be considered in younger, ftter men.</li>\n</ul>",
