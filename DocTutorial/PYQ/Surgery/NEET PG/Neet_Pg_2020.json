Interestingly, up to 30% of patients who die of non-thyroid disease have deposits of PTC in autopsy studies, suggesting that many patients live with this disease undetected. Nonetheless, when PTC is diagnosed most patients will be offered treatment. The disease is known for its <strong>propensity for lymph node metastases. </strong></p>\r\n<p>These are more <strong>common in younger patients</strong>, in whom they do not affect the otherwise excellent survival. This finding is in contrast to most malignancies, where the finding of metastatic disease confers a poor outcome. One contentious finding in patients with PTC is a high rate of occult micrometastases (as high as 40% of N0 patients in the central neck). Despite the presence of metastases, few patients progress to have clinically meaningful disease and the role of elective nodal surgery is in question. Distant metastases are uncommon in PTC.</p>\r\n<p>Recently, increasing interest has focused on 'papillary microcarcinoma'. <strong>This term is used to describe a PTC that is &lt;10 mm</strong> in size. These <strong>lesions are common</strong> (detected in about 10% of benign thyroid resections) and not associated with adverse outcomes, including recurrence or non-survival. As such, management and follow-up of patients with these lesions of doubtful clinical significance is controversial.</p>",

Lymphedema caused by cancer treatment may not occur until months or years after treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\n<p>The lymphatic system is a network of vessels that carry protein-rich lymph fluid throughout the body. It's part of your immune system. Lymph nodes act as filters and contain cells that fight infection and cancer.</p>\n<p>The lymph fluid is pushed through the lymph vessels by muscle contractions as you move through the tasks of your day and small pumps in the wall of the lymph vessels. Lymphedema occurs when the lymph vessels are not able to adequately drain lymph fluid, usually from an arm or leg.</p>\n<p>The most common causes of lymphedema include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cancer.</strong> If cancer cells block lymph vessels, lymphedema may result. For instance, a tumor growing near a lymph node or lymph vessel could enlarge enough to block the flow of the lymph fluid.</li>\n<li><strong>Radiation treatment for cancer.</strong>Radiation can cause scarring and inflammation of lymph nodes or lymph vessels.</li>\n<li><strong>Surgery.</strong>In cancer surgery, lymph nodes are often removed to see if the disease has spread. However, this doesn't always result in lymphedema.</li>\n<li><strong>Parasites.</strong>In developing countries in the tropics, the most common cause of lymphedema is infection with threadlike worms that clog the lymph nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Less commonly, lymphedema results from inherited conditions in which the lymphatic system doesn't develop properly.</p>\n<p>Reference : https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphedema/symptoms-causes/syc-20374682.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong><em>Tension pneumothorax </em></strong></p>\r\n<p>A tension pneumothorax develops when a 'one-way valve' air leak occurs either from the lung or through the chest wall. Air is sucked into the thoracic cavity without any means of escape, <strong>completely collapsing and then compressing the affected lung</strong>. The mediastinum is displaced to the opposite side, <strong>decreasing venous return </strong>and compressing the opposite lung. The most common causes are penetrating chest trauma, blunt chest trauma with a parenchymal lung injury and air leak that did not spontaneously close, iatrogenic lung injury (e.g. due to central venepuncture) and mechanical positive-pressure ventilation.</p>\r\n<p>The clinical presentation is dramatic. The patient is increasingly restless with tachypnoea, dyspnoea and distended neck veins (similar to pericardial tamponade). Clinical examination may reveal tracheal deviation; this is a late finding and is not necessary to clinically confirm diagnosis. There will also be hyper-resonance and <strong>decreased or absent breath sounds over the affected hemithorax. </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis</strong> and treatment should never be delayed by waiting for radiological confirmation. Always treat it with a high index of suspicion of being present .</p>\r\n<p><strong>Treatment consists of immediate decompression</strong>. This was historically taught by rapid insertion of a large-bore cannula into the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line of the affected side, followed by <strong>insertion of a chest tube</strong> through the fifth intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. However, current teaching advocates undertaking decompression in the safe triangle- defined posteriorly by latissimus dorsi, anteriorly by the lateral border of pectoralis major and inferiorly by a line perpendicular to the nipple going to the back, just anterior to the mid-axillary line -or, in extremis, a finger thoracostomy at the same location.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/2025022201952de2-0094-7058-85e4-707eeda75b28.jpg\">",

At the same time, relaxation of the LOS allows esophageal emptying.</li>\r\n<li>The <strong>mismatch in excitatory and inhibitory activity results in the failure of LOS relaxation and absent peristalsis</strong>. With time, the esophagus dilated and contractions disappeared, so that the esophagus empties mainly by the hydrostatic pressure of its contents. This is nearly always incomplete, leaving residual food and fluid.</li>\r\n<li>The air-fluid level in the stomach evidenced on radiography taken in the erect position in normal individuals is frequently absent, as no bolus with its accompanying air passes through the LOS.</li>\r\n<li>The <strong>esophagus becomes progressively more tortuous and dilated (megaesophagus)</strong>; persistent retention of oesophagitis due to fermentation of food residues may predispose to the increased incidence of carcinoma of the esophagus.</li>\r\n</ul>",
