N1 refers to 1-3 axillary lymph nodes, but this case has matted nodes in Level I and II, which makes N2 more appropriate.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice C: T4aN1M0 - </strong>T4a refers to invasion of the chest wall, but in this case, the tumor involves the pectoralis major (muscle), which is a hallmark of T3. N1 would be incorrect here as the patient has matted nodes in Levels I and II, corresponding to N2.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice D: T2N1M1 - </strong>T2 refers to tumors &gt;2 cm but &le;5 cm, but the tumor in this case is larger than 5 cm, making T2 incorrect.

Although there is no strict definition of the procedure, it commonly refers to the removal of a localised abnormal parathyroid gland through an incision less than 3 cm in length. The term encompasses open approaches (central and lateral incisions) and video-assisted and radio-guided parathyroidectomies.</p>\r\n<p>The need to convert from a focused to a cervical exploration may be guided by the use of intraoperative PTH measurements. Routine use is, however, controversial owing to high false-positive and false-negative rates. The basic concept is that the half-life of circulating PTH is 3-5 minutes and there should therefore be a significant drop detected in the plasma PTH following resection of a single adenoma. If no such drop is detected, then multigland disease may be suspected and conversion to a bilateral neck exploration should be considered. The Miami criteria were developed to determine the extent of resection. A drop in the PTH into the normal range and to less than half the maximum preoperative PTH at 10 minutes appears to accurately predict single-gland disease.</p>\r\n<p>The use of sestamibi (2-methoxy-2-methylpropylisonitrile [MIBI]) for parathyroid localisation was first described in 1989 and is now regarded as the most accurate and reliable method for imaging the parathyroid glands. It is safe and reproducible and, while it has a sensitivity and specificity similar to ultrasonography, it may image glands in ectopic positions better. Sestamibi accumulates in mitochondria and therefore washes out at differential rates depending on the number of mitochondria within individual tissues. Parathyroid adenomas often have a high concentration of oxyphilic cells with high mitochondrial content. These retain tracer, and adenomas are therefore associated with a slow washout when compared with the thyroid gland. There are three different protocols for sestamibi scanning: single-isotope dual-phase scan, dual-isotope subtraction imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The sensitivity and specifcity of sestamibi, regardless of the protocol used, are 79% and 90%, respectively. False positives are rare but may arise from some solid thyroid nodules, such as H&uuml;rthle cell nodules, that are associated with high oxyphilic content. These can be reduced by the addition of a thyroid-specific radioactive tracer, such as <sup>99</sup>Tc-pertechnetate and subsequent subtraction images</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Choice A: Normal DEXA scan rules out need for surgery - </strong>A normal DEXA scan does not rule out the need for surgery. The primary indication for surgery in hyperparathyroidism is symptomatic hypercalcemia, not bone mineral density.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice C: No surgery required, only surveillance - </strong>Surgery is indicated for symptomatic hyperparathyroidism or for conditions like hypercalcemia that may result in complications (e.g., kidney stones, osteoporosis). Surveillance is not adequate for this patient's condition given the hypercalcemia and raised PTH.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice D: Creatinine clearance &gt; 80 ml/min mandates surgery = </strong>Creatinine clearance is not a criterion that mandates surgery. Surgery is based on symptomatic hypercalcemia and other factors, such as the presence of complications (e.g., kidney stones, fractures) rather than just creatinine clearance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway - SESTAMIBI followed by focused parathyroidectomy</strong> is the correct approach for managing a parathyroid adenoma in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Reoperation for recurrent nodular goitre is more difcult and hazardous and, for this reason, an increasing number of thyroid surgeons favour total thyroidectomy in younger patients. However, when the first operation comprises unilateral lobectomy alone for asymmetric goitre, reoperation and completion total thyroidectomy is straightforward if required for progression of nodularity in the remaining lobe. Total lobectomy and total thyroidectomy have the additional advantage of being therapeutic for incidental carcinomas</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Choice B: Total thyroidectomy with modified radical neck dissection - </strong>A modified radical neck dissection is not necessary in this case since there is no lymph node involvement, as confirmed by the FNAC. The neck dissection is typically reserved for cases with evidence of lymph node metastasis.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice C: Hemi-thyroidectomy - </strong>Hemi-thyroidectomy, or lobectomy, is not ideal in this case due to the patient's history of irradiation and the nature of the papillary carcinoma, which may present in both lobes. A total thyroidectomy provides more definitive management and decreases the risk of recurrence.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice D: Hemi-thyroidectomy with modified radical neck dissection - </strong>As mentioned, hemi-thyroidectomy alone is not sufficient for this patient's papillary carcinoma. Additionally, modified radical neck dissection is not needed since there is no lymph node involvement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway - Total thyroidectomy</strong> is the appropriate management for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid in a patient with a history of irradiation, providing a more definitive approach with reduced recurrence risk.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The diagnosis of PPGL is confirmed by elevated catecholamine metabolites (metanephrines) in plasma and/or raised 24-hour urinary excretion of fractionated metanephrines. Metanephrines are produced as a result of intratumour conversion of catecholamines by the enzyme catecholamine- <em>O</em>-methyltransferase. Measurement of plasma and urinary metanephrines is more sensitive (99% and 97%, respectively) than plasma and urinary catecholamine measurement (86% and 84%, respectively).

These symptoms may be short-lived and the voice may return to normal within a few weeks as the muscles in the opposite vocal fold compensate and move it across the midline to meet the paralysed vocal fold, which usually lies in the paramedian position. Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy is an occasional and serious complication of total thyroidectomy.</p>\r\n<p>On anaesthetic reversal, acute dyspnoea occurs as a result of the paramedian position of both vocal folds, which reduce the airway to 2-3 mm and which tend to get sucked together on inspiration.

      "solution": "<p>Progressive dysphagia is the most common symptom, related to increasing luminal obstruction by cancer. Early symptoms may include a mild hold-up sensation that, if ignored, will progress from dysphagia to a solid, soft and eventually to a liquid diet. There may often be anorexia, weight loss, odynophagia and regurgitation symptoms. Hoarseness may indicate involvement of either recurrent laryngeal nerve. Aspiration and choking symptoms may be related not only to tumour obstruction but also to the presence of an oesophagus-airway fistula. Choking and cough on drinking water are typical of fistulation and associated haemoptysis is common. Blood loss is less common for squamous cell cancer than adenocarcinoma. Chronic blood loss can lead to iron deficiency anemia. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding can occur, though it is rarely severe, except for aorto-oesophageal fistula, which usually presents with a smaller sentinel bleed followed by massive bleeding that is invariably fatal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Choice A: Dysphagia more to liquids followed by solids - </strong>Dysphagia to liquids occurring before solids is less characteristic of esophageal cancer. This pattern is more commonly seen in conditions like achalasia, where the esophagus fails to properly move food down, and the dysfunction is more prominent with liquids initially.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice B: Odynophagia - </strong>Odynophagia, or painful swallowing, can occur in esophageal cancer but is not the most common presentation. It tends to develop later in the disease process and is more associated with ulcers or advanced tumor involvement.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice D: Retrosternal chest pain - </strong>While retrosternal chest pain can occur, it is not the most common initial symptom of esophageal cancer. Chest pain might be more associated with other causes, such as reflux or tumor involvement affecting nearby structures, but dysphagia remains the hallmark symptom.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway - Dysphagia of solids followed by liquids</strong> is the typical progression in esophageal cancer as the tumor gradually obstructs the esophagus, initially affecting solid food and later affecting liquids.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Zenker's diverticulum is a false pulsion diverticulum as it protrudes posteriorly above the cricopharyngeal sphincter through the natural weak point (the dehiscence of Killian) between the oblique and horizontal fibres of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor. The pathophysiology is believed to involve loss of coordination between pharyngeal contraction and opening of the upper sphincter. When the diverticulum is small, symptoms largely reflect desynchronisation of swallowing with predominantly pharyngeal dysphagia. As the pouch enlarges, it tends to fill with food on eating, and the fundus descends into the mediastinum. Regurgitation of trapped food can occur and lead to aspiration. Another symptom is halitosis. Conventional surgical treatment involves an open left cervical incision (most diverticula point towards the left side) with diverticulectomy and cricopharyngeus myotomy. Another option is diverticular suspension, whereby the diverticulum is dissected and inverted with its apex pointing cranially. This will stop food from entering the pouch. The absence of a suture line lessens the chance of a postoperative leak. A cricopharyngeus myotomy is also an integral part of the surgery. Newer techniques include transoral introduction of a linear stapler to divide the septum in between the diverticulum and the true oesophageal lumen. This creates a common channel, and the myotomy is in effect performed by the stapler transection.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Choice A: Carcinoma Esophagus - </strong>While esophageal cancer may present with dysphagia, it does not typically cause foul-smelling breath unless there is an associated infection or aspiration. Additionally, the barium swallow findings would show irregularities or strictures, not the characteristic diverticulum seen in Zenker's.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice B: Achalasia cardia - </strong>Achalasia is characterized by difficulty swallowing, but it is typically associated with a smooth, gradual dilation of the esophagus and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. Foul-smelling breath may be present due to food stasis, but the barium swallow would show a \"bird's beak\" appearance, which differs from the diverticular formation seen in Zenker's.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice D: Tracheoesophageal fistula - </strong>Tracheoesophageal fistula often presents with aspiration, choking, and respiratory symptoms, not the isolated dysphagia and halitosis seen with Zenker's diverticulum. Barium swallow would reveal a communication between the trachea and esophagus, which is not characteristic of Zenker's.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway - Zenker's diverticulum</strong> typically presents with <strong>dysphagia</strong>, <strong>halitosis</strong>, and regurgitation of food.

Vitamin B12 supplementation after total gastrectomy is essential. Rarely, vitamin B12 deficiency may occur after lesser forms of gastrectomy.

Rarely, a thoracoabdominal incision may be necessary for a massive spleen that is adherent to the diaphragm. Passage of a nasogastric tube following induction of the anaesthetic enables the stomach to be emptied. In elective splenectomy, the gastrosplenic ligament is opened and the short gastric vessels are divided. The splenic vessels at the superior border of the pancreas are suture ligated. Division of the posterior leaf of the lienorenal ligament with long curved scissors on the posterior surface of the spleen helps to rotate and deliver the spleen medially into the laparotomy wound along with the tail and body of the pancreas. The posterior surface of the spleen is exposed and the spleen rotated medially along with the tail and body of the pancreas.

      "solution": "<p>Pain is usually experienced first in the epigastrium but may be localised to either upper quadrant or felt diffusely throughout the abdomen. There is radiation to the back in about 50% of patients, and some patients may gain relief by sitting or leaning forwards. The suddenness of onset may simulate a perforated peptic ulcer, while biliary colic or acute cholecystitis can be mimicked if the pain is maximal in the right upper quadrant. Radiation to the chest can simulate myocardial infarction, pneumonia or pleuritic pain. In fact, acute pancreatitis can mimic most causes of the acute abdomen and should seldom be discounted in differential diagnosis. Typically, the diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical presentation and an elevated serum amylase level. A serum amylase level three times above normal is indicative of the disease. A normal serum amylase level does not exclude acute pancreatitis, particularly if there is delay in presentation. The serum lipase level provides a more sensitive and specific test than amylase</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Choice A: Serum amylase remains elevated even after 30 days of resolution of acute pancreatitis - </strong>This is <strong>incorrect</strong> because serum amylase levels typically return to normal within a few days after the resolution of acute pancreatitis. Elevated amylase beyond this period is unusual and should raise suspicion for other conditions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice C: &gt;75% patients present with hypercalcemia - </strong>This is <strong>incorrect</strong> because hypercalcemia is not a common feature of acute pancreatitis. In fact, acute pancreatitis may sometimes be associated with <strong>hypocalcemia</strong>, especially in severe cases.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice D: Increase in level of serum lipase is directly proportional to the severity - </strong>This is <strong>incorrect</strong> because while serum lipase levels are a useful diagnostic tool, their level does not always correlate directly with the severity of pancreatitis. Other clinical parameters like imaging findings and clinical signs are more reliable for assessing severity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway - Serum lipase</strong> is more specific for diagnosing <strong>acute pancreatitis</strong> compared to serum amylase, and its elevated levels are more directly linked to the condition itself.</p>",

Sympathetic PGLs usually secrete catecholamines.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway - Medullary thyroid cancer</strong> is associated with <strong>calcitonin</strong>, <strong>Hepatoblastoma</strong> with <strong>AFP</strong>, <strong>Choriocarcinoma</strong> with <strong>Beta HCG</strong>, and <strong>Pheochromocytoma</strong> with <strong>catecholamines</strong>.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Clean wounds with a good blood supply heal by primary intention and so closure simply requires accurate apposition of the wound edges. However, if a wound is left open, it heals by secondary intention through the formation of granulation tissue, which is tissue composed of capillaries, fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. Wound contraction and epithelialisation assist in ultimate healing, but the process may take several weeks or months. Delayed primary closure or tertiary intention is utilised when there is a high probability of the wound being infected. The wound is left open for a few days and if the infective process is resolved then the wound is closed to heal by primary intention. Skin grafting is another form of tertiary intention healing</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Choice A: Primary intention - Primary intention</strong> occurs when the wound is closed immediately with accurate apposition of the wound edges, without significant risk of infection, which is not the case in this scenario as the wound was left open initially.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice B: Secondary intention - Secondary intention</strong> occurs when a wound is left open and heals by the formation of granulation tissue, wound contraction, and epithelialization.

      "solution": "<p>ERAS is evidence based on the strong scientific rationale for avoiding unmodulated exposure to stress, prolonged fasting and excessive administration of intravenous (saline) fluids. ERAS principles are now applied by protocol to many types of major surgery, bringing considerable benefit in terms of improved outcomes. Reductions in length of hospital stay after surgery of 30-50% are common, with associated savings in healthcare costs. ERAS depends on a multimodal approach where the combined effects of several interventions achieve significant benefits. &beta;-blockers are associated with improved short- and long-term survival after major surgery, perhaps by modulating the effects of the hyperadrenergic state induced by surgical stress. Equally, in \"open\" surgery the use of epidural analgesia to reduce pain, block the cortisol stress response and attenuate postoperative insulin resistance may, via effects on the body's protein economy, favourably affect many of the patient-centred outcomes that are important to postoperative recovery</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Choice B: Epidural anesthesia is recommended in laparoscopic surgery for pain control - </strong>Epidural anesthesia is often used for pain control in <strong>open surgery</strong> and is beneficial for managing pain and reducing the stress response, but it may not always be necessary for laparoscopic surgery, which typically involves less invasive procedures and pain.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice C: Reduction in hospital stay by 2-3 weeks - </strong>ERAS protocols have been shown to reduce hospital stays by <strong>30-50%</strong> in some cases, which corresponds to a reduction in length of stay by about 2-3 days, not weeks.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Choice D: Beta blockers are given after major surgery under general anesthesia to improve outcomes - Beta blockers</strong> are given in ERAS protocols to improve outcomes by <strong>modulating the hyperadrenergic state </strong>induced by surgery. This can help reduce complications and improve short- and long-term survival.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway - Prolonged fasting is unnecessary</strong> in ERAS protocols, which focus on early feeding and minimizing unnecessary stressors for improved recovery.</p>",
