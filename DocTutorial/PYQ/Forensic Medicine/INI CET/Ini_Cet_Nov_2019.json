      "solution": "<p><strong>Common Cobra (A-2):</strong></p>\r\n<p>The common cobra, also known as Naja naja, is a highly venomous snake commonly found in South Asia. It is easily recognizable by its hood, which displays an \"eye\" pattern when expanded.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Common Krait (B-1):</strong></p>\r\n<p>The common krait (Bungarus caeruleus) is one of the deadliest snakes in the Indian subcontinent. It has a glossy black or bluish-black body with thin white bands. It is nocturnal and known for its potent neurotoxic venom.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Russell's Viper (C-3):</strong></p>\r\n<p>Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) is known for its aggressive nature and high venom yield. It is brownish with distinct circular or oval patches arranged in rows. Its bite causes severe bleeding and organ failure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Python (D-5):</strong></p>\r\n<p>Pythons are non-venomous snakes known for their ability to constrict prey. They are large, with patterns suited for camouflage, and are generally found in forests and grasslands.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Saw-scaled Viper (E-4):</strong></p>\r\n<p>The saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus) is a small but highly venomous snake. It gets its name from the rasping sound produced by rubbing its body scales. Its venom leads to coagulation disorders and severe pain.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rule Out Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (a):</strong></p>\r\n<p>Incorrect because B-1 (Common Krait) and C-3 (Russell's Viper) are mismatched.</p>\r\n<p>The common cobra is correctly matched (A-2), but the krait and viper are placed wrongly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (b):</strong></p>\r\n<p>Incorrect as B-3 (Russell's Viper) and D-4 (Saw-scaled Viper) are mismatched.</p>\r\n<p>While some matches are correct, the placements of krait and viper are not.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (d):</strong></p>\r\n<p>Incorrect because A-2 (Common Cobra) is correctly placed, but B-4 (Saw-scaled Viper) and D-3 (Russell's Viper) are mismatched.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Always identify the snake based on unique features like hood (cobra), bands (krait), patches (Russell's viper), or sound (saw-scaled viper).</p>\r\n<p>Pythons are non-venomous and distinguishable by their large size and constriction behavior.</p>\r\n<p>Familiarity with venomous and non-venomous snakes is crucial for medical and wildlife studies.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Definition of Bullet Wipe:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Bullet wipe refers to the dark ring or residue deposited around the entry wound caused by a projectile. This is formed due to soot, grease, lead, or other residues from the gun barrel that adhere to the bullet as it exits the firearm.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mechanism of Formation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>When a bullet passes through the barrel of the gun, it collects soot, lubricant, or traces of metals such as lead or copper.</p>\r\n<p>As the bullet strikes the target, these residues are deposited on the edges of the entry wound, forming a thin black ring called the bullet wipe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>\r\n<p>It helps forensic experts determine the entry wound and direction of the shot.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike blackening (caused by burnt gunpowder), bullet wipe is seen even in distant-range shootings because the residue travels with the bullet and is deposited upon impact.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rule Out Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (a): </strong>Blackening around the wound of entry:</p>\r\n<p>Incorrect, as blackening is caused by burnt gunpowder from close-range shots and is not related to bullet wipe. Blackening is a feature of tattooing or soot deposition.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (c): </strong>Gutter fracture of the skull caused by a bullet:</p>\r\n<p>Incorrect, as gutter fractures are caused by bullets grazing the skull, leading to bone fractures. This has no connection to the residue or bullet wipe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (d): </strong>Tattooing around the wound of entry:</p>\r\n<p>Incorrect, as tattooing is caused by unburnt or partially burnt gunpowder particles embedding into the skin. Tattooing is a hallmark of close-range firing and is not the same as bullet wipe, which occurs due to barrel residue.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Bullet wipe is caused by residue from the barrel and appears as a black ring around the entry wound.</p>\r\n<p>It occurs in both close-range and distant gunshot wounds.</p>\r\n<p>Blackening and tattooing are distinct features of close-range firing, while bullet wipe is independent of firing distance.</p>\r\n<p>Forensic features like bullet wipe, blackening, and tattooing help determine the range, trajectory, and type of firearm used.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Definition of Deliriant Toxins:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Deliriant toxins are substances that cause confusion, hallucinations, and a disturbed mental state (delirium). These toxins affect the central nervous system (CNS) and disrupt normal mental functioning.</p>\r\n<p><strong>About Erythroxylum Coca:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Erythroxylum coca is the plant from which cocaine is derived. Cocaine is a powerful stimulant and psychoactive substance.</p>\r\n<p>While primarily a stimulant, cocaine in high doses or prolonged use can cause delirium, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion, thus fitting the category of deliriant effects.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mechanism of Action:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Cocaine inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, leading to elevated levels of these neurotransmitters.</p>\r\n<p>Overstimulation of the CNS may lead to toxic delirium characterized by confusion, agitation, and hallucinations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rule Out Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (a): Atropa belladonna:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Atropa belladonna contains tropane alkaloids (e.g., atropine, scopolamine) that cause deliriant effects, but this plant is primarily associated with anticholinergic toxicity rather than the deliriant effects seen with Erythroxylum coca.</p>\r\n<p>The question specifies Erythroxylum coca as the answer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (b): Cannabis:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Cannabis produces cannabinoids like THC, which can cause psychoactive effects such as euphoria, sedation, or mild hallucinations, but it is not categorized as a deliriant.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (c): Datura:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Datura contains deliriant tropane alkaloids, but its primary use and effects are classified as anticholinergic rather than stimulant-induced delirium. The specific answer given is Erythroxylum coca.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Erythroxylum coca is the source of cocaine, a stimulant that can cause deliriant-like effects in high doses.</p>\r\n<p>While several plants like Atropa belladonna and Datura also produce deliriant toxins, their primary mode of action differs from that of cocaine.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to differentiate between stimulant-induced delirium (e.g., cocaine) and anticholinergic delirium (e.g., atropine or scopolamine from Datura).</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Autopsy Techniques Overview:</p>\r\n<p>Different autopsy techniques are named after pathologists and describe specific methods of removing and examining internal organs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rokitansky's Method:</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the Rokitansky method, the organs are examined in situ, meaning they are studied within the body cavity without removing them.</p>\r\n<p>This method is less invasive and primarily involves dissection and inspection of organs while still in their anatomical position.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Methods (Incorrectly Matched):</strong></p>\r\n<p>Virchow's Method: Organs are removed individually for examination, not \"en masse.\"</p>\r\n<p>Ghon's Method: Organs are removed en bloc (in groups), such as thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic organs together.</p>\r\n<p>Letulle's Method: Organs are removed en masse (as a single block) and then dissected outside the body.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rule Out Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (b): </strong>Virchow's - En masse:</p>\r\n<p>Incorrect. Virchow's method involves removing and examining organs one at a time, not en masse.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (c): </strong>Ghon's - En bloc:</p>\r\n<p>Incorrect. Ghon's method involves removing organs en bloc in regional groups (e.g., thoracic or abdominal groups), but this is mismatched here.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option (d): </strong>Lettulle's - Organ by organ:</p>\r\n<p>Incorrect. Lettulle's method involves removing all organs en masse as a single block and dissecting them later, not organ by organ.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Rokitansky's method focuses on in situ examination of organs without removing them.</p>\r\n<p>Other methods:</p>\r\n<p>Virchow: Individual removal of organs.</p>\r\n<p>Ghon: Group removal of organs (en bloc).</p>\r\n<p>Lettulle: Removal of all organs together (en masse).</p>\r\n<p>These techniques are chosen based on the specific goals of the autopsy and the circumstances surrounding the case.</p>",
