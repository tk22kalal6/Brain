      "solution": "<p>Gastric lavage is typically contraindicated in cases of caustic poisoning (e.g., sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and kerosene) due to the risk of further injury to the esophagus, stomach, and airways. However, in phenol poisoning, gastric lavage can be performed, though with caution.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Phenol is a strongly corrosive substance, but it is a lipid-soluble poison. Gastric lavage can help remove phenol from the stomach, especially if performed within a short window after ingestion. Phenol is absorbed rapidly, and early intervention can reduce its systemic toxicity.</li>\r\n<li>Why is it contraindicated in other cases?</li>\r\n<li>Sulfuric acid and nitric acid: These are strong acids, and gastric lavage can cause further chemical burns in the gastrointestinal tract.</li>\r\n<li>Kerosene: Kerosene is a hydrocarbon that poses a risk of aspiration. Performing gastric lavage may cause the substance to be inhaled, leading to chemical pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs due to the aspiration of foreign substances).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Rule Out:</strong></p>\r\n<p>b) Sulphuric acid: Gastric lavage is contraindicated as it can worsen chemical burns and esophageal perforation.</p>\r\n<p>c) Kerosene: Gastric lavage can lead to aspiration and chemical pneumonitis, making it inappropriate.</p>\r\n<p>d) Nitric acid: Similar to sulfuric acid, gastric lavage can exacerbate the caustic injury.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Phenol poisoning is one of the few instances where gastric lavage can be considered, although it must be done carefully and under medical supervision.</li>\r\n<li>Strong acids (like sulfuric and nitric acid) and hydrocarbons (like kerosene) generally make gastric lavage contraindicated due to the risks of caustic injury and aspiration.</li>\r\n</ol>",
