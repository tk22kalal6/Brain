      "solution": "<p>Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive imaging technique that is highly effective for visualizing the biliary and pancreatic ducts, including the detection of choledocholithiasis, which is the presence of stones in the bile duct. <strong>MRCP has largely replaced ERCP as the diagnostic gold standard for choledocholithiasis due to its similar sensitivity (90-94%) and specificity (95-99%),</strong> without the risks associated with ionizing radiation, intravenous contrast, or the complications inherent in ERCP.</p>\r\n<p>MRCP provides clear images that can help identify the number, size, and location of bile duct stones. It's particularly useful when strong or moderate signs of common bile duct stones are present.</p>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAY- MRCP is recommended for patients with symptoms suggestive of biliary obstruction, such as jaundice or pancreatitis, and when there is a need to evaluate the anatomy of the biliary tree preoperatively</strong>.
