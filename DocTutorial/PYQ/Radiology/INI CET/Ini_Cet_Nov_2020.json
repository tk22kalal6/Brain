Changes occur in both the synovial along with ligamentous (superior and posterior) parts of the sacroiliac joints.</p>\r\n<p>The earliest radiographic findings occur in the subchondral cortex which appears blurred or lost. <br /> Later, small (rat-bite) erosions appear which are worse along the iliac aspect of the joint. These cause widening of the joint space with hazy margins. This is followed by larger erosions, subjacent sclerosis and joint space narrowing as irregular new bone bridges the joint space with eventual ankylosis and resolution of the sclerosis.</p>\r\n<p>The modified New York criteria is used for grading of sacroiliitis and was established in 1994.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spine</strong>: Spinal involvement classically starts at the dorsolumbar or lumbosacral junction.<br /> Erosions initially occur at the vertebral margins at the site of attachment of the outer fibers of the annulus fibrosus (<strong>Romanus lesions</strong>) with adjacent sclerosis (<strong>shiny corner sign</strong>).</p>\r\n<p>Healing of these erosions or laying down of bone beneath the anterior longitudinal ligament causes \"<strong>squaring\" of the vertebral bodies,</strong> best appreciated on lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine. <br /> Exuberant new bone formation may even cause anterior convexity of the vertebral body (barrel-shaped vertebrae).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ossifications may be seen in the interspinous ligaments and facet joints causing the dagger and tram-track signs respectively</strong>. <br /> Facet joint ankylosis is the major factor causing loss of spinal mobility.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/2025020768ad82a5-24b3-4370-a129-613f9dd06cef.jpg\">\r\n<p><strong>Dagger sign</strong></p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/20250207fd10079e-fd21-4a7e-a06d-ff06ebcd80c1.jpg\">\r\n<p><strong>Tram Track/Trolley sign</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAY- Radiological findings in Ankylosing Spondylitis. </strong></p>\r\n<p>Calcification of anterior longitudinal ligament.</p>\r\n<p>Calcification of intervertebral disc giving rise to bamboo spine//Tram track sign/Trolley sign.</p>\r\n<p>Calcification of interspinous ligament- dagger sign</p>\r\n<p>On MRI -lesions seen in the anterior part of intervertebral disc [Andersson lesion ].</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> AIIMS-MAMC-PGI'S Comprehensive textbook of diagnostic radiology page no 2830</p>",
