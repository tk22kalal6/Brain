      "solution": "<p>Depolarization is due to the influx of Na+ through voltage-gated channels.</p>\r\n<p>When threshold stimulus is applied to the cell membrane at the point of stimulation the permeability of the membrane for Na+ ions increases. At the beginning the rise of permeability for Na+ is slow till it reaches the firing level.When the membrane depolarizes, the Na+ channels start opening up. The opening of the Na+ channels (m gates) depolarizes the membrane, further leading to the opening of a greater number of Na+ channels due to positive feedback mechanisms. As the concentration gradient and electrical gradient of this ion are directed inward, there occurs a rapid influx of Na+ ions into the cell.</p>\r\n<p>Repolarization is due to efflux of K+ through voltage-gated channels.</p>\r\n<p>Repolarization occurs due to decrease in Na+ influx and increase in K+ efflux through the voltage-gated K+ channels which open later than Na+ channels but remain activated for prolonged periods.</p>\r\n<p>Hyperpolarization is due to efflux of K+.</p>\r\n<p>The slow efflux of K+ continues even after the resting membrane potential is reached resulting in a prolonged phase of hyperpolarization</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Ca++ releases from sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>\r\n<p>One of the special features of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is that within its vesicular tubules is an excess of calcium ions in high concentration. Many of these calcium ions are released from each vesicle when an action potential occurs in the adjacent T tubule.</p>\r\n<p>When the action potential reaches the tip of T-tubule, it activates the voltage-gated channels called DHP (dihydropyridine) receptors which are located in the T-tubule membrane. When the DHP is activated by the depolarization of T-tubules, it undergoes conformational changes which result in the opening of</p>\r\n<p>RYR(Ryandonine receptor) channels which are calcium release channels. Due to opening of calcium release channels (RYR), calcium ions diffuse into the sarcoplasm surrounding the myofibrils and causing skeletal muscle contraction.</p>\r\n<p>Other options:</p>\r\n<p>Option I: Extracellular calcium are necessary in muscle contraction. When there is decrease in extracellular calcium it leads to Hypocalcaemia which leads to opening of voltage-gated sodium channels and hence sodium influx resulting in sustained depolarization which leads to tetany.</p>\r\n<p>Option II: Calcium ions are not released from mitochondria, they are released from sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>\r\n<p>Option IV: The voltage-gated calcium channels which are present on T-tubule of sarcolemma activated by depolarizing stimulus is responsible for release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum hence voltage-gated calcium channels play role in excitation-contraction coupling.</p>\r\n<p>Option V: Calcium channels on sarcoplasmic reticulum has very crucial role in excitation-contraction coupling.</p>",
