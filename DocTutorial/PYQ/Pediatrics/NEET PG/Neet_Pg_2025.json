The term 'collapse' is often used interchangeably, but should be reserved for cases of complete atelectasis. In right upper lobe atelectasis, the minor and major fissures shift, and the lobe <strong>flattens against the mediastinum</strong>, creating a triangular shadow on imaging. A juxtaphrenic peak, a sharply defined triangular opacity, may also be seen, often due to upward retraction of the pleura. Additionally, large hilar tumours can produce the '<strong>S sign of Golden</strong>,' a reverse S-shaped configuration of the minor fissure, which is highly indicative of pulmonary carcinoma and, though initially described for the right upper lobe, may be found in atelectasis of any lobe. It is shown below.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/202509101c370afb-d54b-4190-82af-d0aa45c288f6.png\">\r\n<p><strong>Right upper lobe abscess (Option B): </strong>Lung abscesses typically present as <strong>fluid-filled cavities </strong>with thick walls and peripheral enhancement, often showing an air-fluid level as shown below.
