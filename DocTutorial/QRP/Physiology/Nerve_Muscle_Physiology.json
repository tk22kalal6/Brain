This is due to the <strong>regenerative nature</strong> of action potentials, which are constantly renewed as they travel.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Saltatory conduction</strong> in myelinated neurons allows faster transmission by jumping between the <strong>nodes of Ranvier</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>In unmyelinated neurons, the <strong>action potential propagates continuously</strong>, but still over the entire membrane.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Why Not Other Options:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>A.

The dystrophin gene is one of the largest in the body and mutations can occur at many different sites in it. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a serious form of dystrophy in which the dystrophin protein is absent from muscle. It is X-linked recessive disorder and usually fatal by the age of 30. Most common cause of death is respiratory failure. Patients with DMD will show malignant hyperthermia after anasthesia. Partial mutation of dystrophin gene leads to Beckers muscular dystrophy.

It is due to destruction of lower motor neurons present in the anterior horn of spinal cord by the poliovirus, resulting in paralysis of skeletal muscles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option A: Tetanus: Tetanus</strong> is caused by the neurotoxin produced by the bacterium <em>Clostridium tetani</em>. Tetanus causes muscle spasms and rigidity due to the toxin affecting the motor neurons, but it does not specifically destroy anterior horn cells.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option C: Rabies:</strong> Rabies affects the central nervous system and can cause various neurological symptoms, but it does not specifically lead to flaccid paralysis from anterior horn cell destruction. The paralysis associated with rabies is not limited to a specific limb.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Botulism:</strong> Botulism leads to muscle weakness and paralysis due to the blockade of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, but it does not involve the destruction of anterior horn cells</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/2024121699fab2f8-648c-407a-bb02-ca05dea36ae5.jpg\">\r\n<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Poliomyelitis</strong> specifically results in the destruction of anterior horn cells, causing flaccid paralysis.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/202412166472974d-b486-4894-806e-0bc012572d80.jpg\">",
