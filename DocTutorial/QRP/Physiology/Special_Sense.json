      "solution": "<p><strong>Optic Neuritis:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Characterized by a <strong>swollen optic disc</strong> with <strong>blurred margins</strong>, often indicating inflammation of the optic nerve, commonly associated with demyelinating conditions like <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Sudden vision loss is common in young patients, and symptoms may include <strong>pain with eye movement</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Why Not Other Options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>A) Papilledema:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Swelling of the optic disc due to increased intracranial pressure.</li>\r\n<li>It usually affects <strong>both eyes</strong> and is associated with symptoms like <strong>headaches</strong> and <strong>transient visual obscurations</strong>, not with sudden unilateral vision loss.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>C) Glaucoma:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Involves damage to the optic nerve due to <strong>increased intraocular pressure</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Progresses slowly, typically leading to <strong>peripheral vision loss</strong>, not acute vision loss. In acute angle-closure glaucoma, additional symptoms like <strong>eye pain and nausea</strong> are present, which are not noted here.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>D) Retinal Detachment:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Presents with symptoms like <strong>flashes of light, floaters</strong>, and a <strong>curtain-like shadow</strong> over the visual field.</li>\r\n<li>While it can lead to sudden vision loss, it does not cause a swollen optic disc, which is pivotal for diagnosis in this case.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A <strong>swollen optic disc with blurred margins</strong> and <strong>sudden vision loss</strong> in a young patient is indicative of <strong>optic neuritis</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Recognizing optic neuritis is crucial for early intervention, especially in cases associated with demyelinating diseases.</li>\r\n</ul>",
