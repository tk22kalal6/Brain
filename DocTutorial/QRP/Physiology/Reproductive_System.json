      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Primary hypogonadism</strong>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: The testes fail to produce sufficient testosterone despite elevated LH levels due to dysfunction in Leydig cells, which are responsible for testosterone synthesis.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Lab Findings</strong>: Elevated LH indicates the pituitary gland is signalling the testes to produce testosterone, while normal FSH suggests spermatogenesis may not be severely impaired, reflecting intact Sertoli cell function.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Absence of Symptoms</strong>: The lack of gynecomastia or ambiguous genitalia implies the testes are structurally normal and functioning properly in terms of producing male sex characteristics.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Potential Causes</strong>: Primary hypogonadism can be caused by conditions such as Klinefelter syndrome, testicular injury, or genetic disorders affecting testicular function.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>B) Secondary hypogonadism:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This condition would involve low testosterone alongside low or inappropriately normal LH and FSH levels, indicating a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus.
