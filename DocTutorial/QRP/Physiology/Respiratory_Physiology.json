Therefore, they are not the primary target of ibuprofen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Arachidonic Acid Release from the Membrane:</strong> This step involves phospholipase A2 and is not directly inhibited by NSAIDs, which primarily act on the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway to block prostaglandin synthesis.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/20241219d90f8648-c6f8-43b0-94bf-33a5b4c57237.jpg\">\r\n<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ibuprofen reduces inflammation by blocking prostaglandin synthesis, which is a key anti-inflammatory mechanism of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p>",
