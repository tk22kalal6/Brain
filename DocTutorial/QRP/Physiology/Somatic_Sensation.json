      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Contralateral loss of pain and temperature</strong> occurs because the <strong>spinothalamic tract</strong> crosses to the opposite side at the spinal cord level. This means damage on one side results in loss of these sensations on the opposite side of the body, below the lesion.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Corticosteroids</strong> are effective in reducing inflammation if administered early, as they suppress immune cells and reduce capillary permeability, preventing further damage from swelling and inflammation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ipsilateral loss of fine touch, vibration, and proprioception</strong> occurs due to damage to the <strong>fasciculus gracilis or fasciculus cuneatus</strong> (dorsal column), which ascends without crossing until it reaches the medulla. This leads to loss of stereognosis on the same side of the lesion.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ipsilateral weakness and spasticity</strong> arise from damage to the <strong>corticospinal tract</strong> (a motor pathway) that affects the same side of the body.
