Enterokinase contains 41% polysaccharide, and this high polysaccharide content apparently prevents it from being digested itself before it can exert its effect. Trypsin converts chymotrypsinogen into chymotrypsin and other proenzymes into active enzymes. Trypsin can also activate trypsinogen therefore, once some trypsin is formed, there is an autocatalytic chain reaction. Enterokinase deficiency occurs as a congenital abnormality and leads to protein malnutrition.

If the flow of bile out of the liver is completely blocked, substances normally excreted in the bile, such as cholesterol, accumulate in the bloodstream. The interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids also induces the liver to synthesize bile acids at a greater rate. Some of these bile acids can be excreted by the kidney, and thus represent a mechanism for indirect excretion of at least a portion of cholesterol. However, retained biliary constituents may also cause liver toxicity.
