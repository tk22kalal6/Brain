Given the sample size of <strong>150 participants</strong>, there is a higher likelihood of finding a true effect if it exists. This helps to ensure that the observed difference in body weight change is not a result of random variability.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Assumptions of the Test</strong>: The two-sample t-test assumes that:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The two groups are <strong>independent</strong> (the participants in one group do not influence those in the other).</li>\r\n<li>The homogeneity of variance exists (the variances of the two groups are approximately equal).</li>\r\n<li>The data follows a <strong>normal distribution</strong>. Although the sample sizes are moderate, which increases robustness to these assumptions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clinical Significance</strong>: Beyond statistical significance, the mean difference of <strong>-3.5 kg</strong> may also have clinical implications for weight management strategies. Understanding whether this weight change is meaningful in a real-world context is essential for practical applications.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Confidence Intervals</strong>: In addition to the p-value, researchers might calculate a <strong>confidence interval (CI)</strong> for the mean difference in weight change. A <strong>95% CI</strong> around the mean difference would provide a range within which we can be <strong>95% confident</strong> the true mean difference lies. This adds more depth to understanding the effect size and reliability of the findings.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Type I and Type II Errors</strong>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Type I Error (&alpha;)</strong>: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (false positive). Given the low p-value, the risk of committing a Type I error is minimized but not eliminated.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Type II Error (&beta;)</strong>: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (false negative). Sufficient power reduces the likelihood of this error.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Why not other options:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Incorrect because the difference is indeed statistically significant with a p-value of <strong>0.01</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Incorrect because the p-value quantifies the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as -3.5 kg, not the probability of that specific difference occurring.</li>\r\n<li>Incorrect since the p-value applies to the group mean difference, not individual observations, making this statement misleading.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The p-value is the probability of obtaining a result (ie, sample estimate) at least as large as the one observed when the population value claimed in the null hypothesis is assumed to be true.
