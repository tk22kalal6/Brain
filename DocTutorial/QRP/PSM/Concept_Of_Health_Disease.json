Calculated by multiplying the number of incident cases of disease by the average duration and applying a severity weight.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>DALY Formula</strong>: DALY = YLL + YLD. This formula allows for a comprehensive understanding of both mortality and morbidity within a population.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Purpose and Application</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>DALYs provide insight into the burden of disease and health conditions, facilitating comparisons between different health issues and populations.</li>\n<li>The concept originated from research by <strong>Harvard University</strong> for the <strong>World Bank</strong> in 1990 and was adopted by the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> in 2000, enhancing its global application in public health assessments.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Standard Life Expectancy</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Japanese life expectancy statistics</strong> are often used as a benchmark, given Japan's high life expectancy, providing a standard for measuring premature death and YLL across populations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Social Weighting</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>DALY calculations incorporate social weighting, which assigns different values to years of life lost based on age. This reflects societal preferences for productivity, often valuing years lived as a young adult more highly than those spent in childhood or old age.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why Not Others:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>B (Number of deaths multiplied by the average age of the population)</strong>: This does not account for standard life expectancy and misrepresents the concept of YLL.</li>\n<li><strong>C (Number of deaths divided by the standard life expectancy at the age of death)</strong>: Incorrectly applies division, rather than multiplication, in calculating YLL.</li>\n<li><strong>D (Number of deaths divided by the average age of the population)</strong>: Fails to represent the relationship between deaths and standard life expectancy, leading to inaccurate YLL calculation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> Years of Life Lost (YLL) is calculated by multiplying the <strong>number of deaths</strong> by the <strong>standard life expectancy at the age of death</strong>, providing critical insight into the impact of premature mortality on public health. The concept is a core component of <strong>DALYs</strong>, which combines both premature death and disability to assess overall health burden.</p>",
