      "solution": "<p>It is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the <strong><em>GLA</em> gene</strong>. This gene is responsible for producing an enzyme called <strong>alpha-galactosidase A</strong>, which plays a critical role in breaking down a fat molecule called <strong>globotriaosylceramide (Gb3 or GL-3)</strong> in the body. When the enzyme is deficient or absent, Gb3 accumulates in cells, particularly in the blood vessels, kidneys, heart, and nervous system, leading to various symptoms and complications.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Features and Symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Pain and Burning Sensations:</strong> A hallmark of Fabry's disease is chronic pain and <strong>burning sensations</strong>, often in the <strong>hands and feet</strong>, due to nerve involvement. These symptoms can worsen with physical activity, stress, or temperature changes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Skin Lesions: Angiokeratomas, small dark red to blue-black skin spots</strong>, often appear on the lower part of the body, especially around the groin and thighs.<br /><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/2024122463c68047-7b2f-43d7-bb3e-fc6e43cb5bda.jpg\"></li>\r\n<li><strong>Eye Issues:</strong> Corneal clouding, a type of <strong>opacification of the cornea,</strong> may occur but typically does not affect vision.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Kidney Dysfunction:</strong> Progressive kidney damage can lead to chronic kidney disease and, eventually, kidney failure if untreated.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Heart Problems:</strong> Cardiac complications, such as left ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the heart muscle), arrhythmias, and heart failure, are common as the disease progresses.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Gastrointestinal Issues:</strong> Some individuals experience abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea, especially after meals.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hearing Loss:</strong> Fabry's disease can also lead to sensorineural hearing loss.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS: All lysosomal disorders are 'autosomal recessive' except for Hunter's syndrome and Fabry's disease, which are X-linked recessive.</strong> Thus, Hunter's syndrome and Fabry's disease affect only male.</p>",
