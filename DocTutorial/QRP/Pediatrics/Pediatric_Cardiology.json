These rapid, chaotic rhythms can disrupt the heart&rsquo;s ability to pump blood and may lead to sudden cardiac arrest.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ischemia</strong>: The thickened heart muscle may outgrow its blood supply, leading to ischemia <strong>(inadequate oxygenation of the muscle tissue).</strong> This can further increase the risk of dangerous arrhythmias.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Diastolic Dysfunction</strong>: HOCM often leads to diastolic dysfunction, where the heart cannot relax adequately between beats.

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Delta waves are a slurring of the initial upstroke of QRS complex</strong>. The PR interval in this ECG is 80ms. The lower limit of normal in the resting ECG is 100ms. These are typical ECG features of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. It is a disorder of cardiac conduction, one of the pre-excitation syndromes.</li>\r\n<li>It is inherited as <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> and is due to the mutation of <strong>PRKAG2 gene</strong> on chromosome 7.</li>\r\n<li>Many children with WPW syndrome are asymptomatic. The most common presentation are episodes of <strong>dizziness, palpitations and breathlessness.</strong> Other clinical features include blackouts and fainting episodes. Cardiac arrest and sudden death is rare.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS:</strong> Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart condition characterized by an <strong>extra electrical pathway (accessory pathway) between the atria and ventricles</strong>, which can cause episodes of rapid heart rate (tachycardia). This extra pathway can allow electrical signals to bypass the normal conduction route, leading to re-entrant tachycardia or even more dangerous arrhythmias.</p>",
