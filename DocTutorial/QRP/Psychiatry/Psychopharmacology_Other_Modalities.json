Rarely, a \"pill-rolling\" tremor occurs.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Acute Dystonia</strong>: Characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, including oculogyric crises, tongue protrusion, and laryngopharyngeal dystonias.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Akathisia</strong>: A state of restlessness with symptoms like pacing, jitteriness, and an inability to stay still.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)</strong>: A life-threatening condition marked by fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, and altered mental status.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Tardive Dyskinesia</strong>: Involuntary, irregular movements (especially perioral) that occur after long-term use of antipsychotics.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Neuroleptic-Induced Parkinsonism</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Includes muscle rigidity, shuffling gait, stooped posture, and tremors. The tremor is often coarse and similar to essential tremor.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Epidemiology</strong>: More common in elderly patients and women, typically occurring 5-90 days after starting treatment with high-potency antipsychotics like haloperidol.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Etiology</strong>: Caused by dopamine receptor blockade in the basal ganglia, specifically the nigrostriatal pathway.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Treatment</strong>: Anticholinergic medications like benztropine (Cogentin), amantadine (Symmetrel), or diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Treatment may continue for weeks, especially in elderly patients.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Incorrect: Acute Dystonia</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Sudden, painful muscle contractions resulting in abnormal postures such as <strong>oculogyric crises, tongue protrusion, torticollis, and laryngeal dystonias.</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Epidemiology</strong>: More common in young men, especially those receiving high doses of high-potency antipsychotics.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Treatment</strong>: Intramuscular or intravenous anticholinergics (e.g., diphenhydramine) are first-line. Benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam) may also be used.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option C: Incorrect: Tardive Dyskinesia</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Involuntary, irregular movements, especially of the face (e.g., tongue movements, lip smacking, facial grimacing). Can also affect limbs and trunk.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Epidemiology</strong>: Occurs in 10-20% of patients after long-term antipsychotic use (typically more than 6 months). Women, elderly, and those with brain damage or mood disorders are at higher risk.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Course and Prognosis</strong>: Remission occurs in 5-40% of cases, but it is less likely in older patients.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Treatment</strong>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Prevention: Use of antipsychotics at the lowest effective dose.</li>\r\n<li>Switching to atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine) can reduce symptoms.</li>\r\n<li>Valbenazine is FDA-approved for treating tardive dyskinesia.</li>\r\n<li>In cases of severe tardive dyskinesia, switching medications or adding lithium, carbamazepine, or benzodiazepines may be beneficial.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>  \r\n</ul>",
