This phenomenon is known as <strong>antidepressant-induced mania</strong> and is more common with certain classes of antidepressants, like <strong>SSRIs</strong> and <strong>SNRIs.</strong> Because of this risk, antidepressants are usually combined with mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate) or atypical antipsychotics to minimize the likelihood of a manic episode</p>",
