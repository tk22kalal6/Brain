The risk of infection from the insertion procedure itself is low, and studies have shown that routine use of antibiotics before IUD insertion does not significantly reduce the already low risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Standard Practice:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Screening:</strong> It is often recommended to screen for STIs, especially in high-risk populations, and to treat any existing infections before IUD insertion.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Aseptic Technique:</strong> Using a sterile, aseptic technique (<em>no touch technique</em>)during insertion helps minimize the risk of introducing an infection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Overall, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not considered necessary for most patients before CuT insertion.</p>\r\n<p>OPTION C: The most common adverse effect of the copper IUD (CuT) is <strong>increased menstrual bleeding</strong> and <strong>cramping</strong>. Many users experience heavier and longer periods, as well as more intense menstrual cramps, especially in the first few months after insertion. <em>These symptoms often diminish over time as the body adjusts to the device.</em></p>\r\n<p>OPTION D:</p>\r\n<p><strong><u>Absolute contraindications for the insertion of a copper intrauterine device (CuT) include:</u></strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><em>Pregnancy</em>:</strong> An IUD should not be inserted if the patient is currently pregnant.</li>\r\n<li><strong><em>Current Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)</em>:</strong> Active or recent (within 3 months) PID is a contraindication due to the risk of worsening the infection.</li>\r\n<li><strong><em>Current Purulent Cervicitis or Active Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI):</em></strong> Insertion should be avoided if there is an active infection like gonorrhea or chlamydia.</li>\r\n<li><strong><em>Unexplained Vaginal Bleeding:</em></strong> Any undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding should be evaluated before IUD insertion.</li>\r\n<li><strong><em>Cervical or Uterine Malignancy</em>:</strong> Known or suspected cancer of the cervix or uterus is an absolute contraindication.</li>\r\n<li><strong><em>Distorted Uterine Cavity</em>:</strong> Uterine anomalies or fibroids that significantly distort the uterine cavity can make IUD placement difficult or increase the risk of complications.</li>\r\n<li><strong><em>Copper Allergy or Wilson's Disease:</em></strong> Patients with a known allergy to copper or with Wilson's disease (a genetic disorder affecting copper metabolism) should not use a copper IUD.</li>\r\n<li><strong><em>Recent Postpartum Sepsis:</em></strong> Insertion should be avoided in women with a history of postpartum sepsis until it is safe to proceed.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAY:</strong></p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/20241207df8cdf53-a334-49a3-98b5-8396710b0e70.jpg\">",

History of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) or Pulmonary Embolism:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> Estrogen-containing contraceptives increase the risk of blood clots, so progestin-only methods are preferred for individuals with a history of clotting disorders.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>2. Migraine with Aura:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> Estrogen can exacerbate migraines with aura, increasing the risk of stroke. Progestin-only methods are safer for those with this type of migraine.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>3. Certain Types of Cancer:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> Estrogen-sensitive cancers (e.g., breast cancer) contraindicate the use of estrogen-containing contraceptives. Progestin-only methods are used instead.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>4. Severe Hypertension:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> High blood pressure can be exacerbated by estrogen. Progestin-only methods are safer for individuals with uncontrolled or severe hypertension.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>5. Smoking Over Age 35:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> Smokers over 35 years old are at increased risk of cardiovascular events with estrogen-containing contraceptives. Progestin-only methods are recommended for this group.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>6. Postpartum Period (Especially Within 3 Weeks):</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> Estrogen-containing methods are generally avoided in the immediate postpartum period due to increased risk of thrombosis. Progestin-only methods are preferred for breastfeeding women and those recently postpartum.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>7. Liver Disease:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> Estrogen can be metabolized by the liver, and liver disease can affect its metabolism. Progestin-only methods are used to avoid complications in such cases.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>8. Uncontrolled Diabetes with Complications:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Reason:</strong> Estrogen can affect blood glucose levels and may not be suitable for individuals with diabetes and associated complications.
