Delaying treatment could lead to disease progression.</p>\r\n<p><strong>OPTION C: </strong>Surgical resection is not the first-line treatment for metastatic GTN. Chemotherapy is preferred because it treats both the primary tumor and any metastatic lesions. Surgery might be considered in very selective cases where chemotherapy fails or if there are isolated metastases that are resistant to chemotherapy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>OPTION D: </strong>Radiation therapy is not typically used for GTN, as these tumors are more effectively treated with chemotherapy. Radiation might be considered in specific cases of resistant or recurrent disease, but it is not a standard first-line treatment for lung metastasis in GTN.</p>\r\n<p>KEY TAKEAWAY:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Low risk GTN </strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>WHO score [0-6] -Methotrexate used</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>HIGH RISK GTN0</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>WHO score [&gt;/= 7]- Multidrug chemotherapy used(</strong><em>EMACO)</em></p>",
