It is highly effective and recommended for infants, children, and adults at risk.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Key Points:</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Vaccine Schedule:</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Infants:</strong> Typically administered in a series of three or four doses starting at birth, with subsequent doses given at 1-2 months and 6-18 months of age.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Adults:</strong> A series of three doses is given, with the second dose administered 1 month after the first and the third dose 6 months after the first.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Effectiveness: </strong>The vaccine is approximately 95% effective in preventing Hepatitis B infection in healthy individuals.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Administration: </strong>The vaccine is given as an intramuscular injection, typically in the deltoid muscle of the arm.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Safety: </strong>The Hepatitis B vaccine is safe and well-tolerated. Common side effects include soreness at the injection site and mild fever. Serious side effects are rare.</li>\r\n<li><strong>CDC Recommendations: </strong>The CDC recommends Hepatitis B vaccination for all infants, children, and adults who are at increased risk of HBV infection, including healthcare workers, people with chronic liver disease, and those with high-risk behaviors.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Nonresponders:</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Definition: </strong>A \"nonresponder\" is an individual who does not develop detectable antibodies to Hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) after completing the full vaccination series.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Prevalence: </strong>Approximately 5-10% of healthy adults may be nonresponders to the Hepatitis B vaccine.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Possible Causes: </strong>Nonresponse can be due to factors such as older age, obesity, immune system disorders, or specific genetic factors affecting vaccine efficacy.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Management: </strong>Nonresponders can receive additional doses of the vaccine. If they remain nonresponsive, further evaluation for underlying health issues or alternative methods of prevention and monitoring may be needed.</li>\r\n<li><strong>CDC Guidance: </strong>The CDC advises testing for anti-HBs after the completion of the vaccine series, especially for individuals at high risk of Hepatitis B. For those who remain nonresponsive, consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended to discuss further vaccination strategies or possible alternative interventions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> For more information on Hepatitis B vaccination and nonresponders, visit CDC Hepatitis B Vaccine.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> For information on Hepatitis B and its vaccine, see CDC Hepatitis B.</p>\r\n",
