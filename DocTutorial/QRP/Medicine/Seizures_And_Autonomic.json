      "solution": "<p><strong>Cardiovascular Reflexes:</strong> The autonomic nervous system controls cardiovascular reflexes, which involve both sympathetic and parasympathetic components. The <strong>parasympathetic system</strong> is primarily responsible for slowing the heart rate and regulating resting cardiovascular function.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Parasympathetic Function Test:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Heart Rate Variation with Deep Breathing:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This test assesses the <strong>parasympathetic nervous system </strong>via the vagus nerve. The heart rate normally increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration, a phenomenon known as <strong>respiratory sinus arrhythmia.</strong></li>\r\n<li>A reduced variation in heart rate during deep breathing indicates parasympathetic dysfunction.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Procedure: </strong>The patient is instructed to take slow deep breaths at a rate of 6 breaths per minute while heart rate variability is measured.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Valsalva Maneuver: </strong>This test assesses both sympathetic and parasympathetic reflexes but is not specific for parasympathetic function alone.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Tilt Table Testing: </strong>This evaluates the autonomic response to positional changes but is more focused on detecting orthostatic hypotension.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART): </strong>This evaluates the autonomic control of sweating, which involves both sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, but primarily assesses sympathetic sudomotor function.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Heart rate variation with deep breathing is the best test for evaluating parasympathetic function as it directly reflects the vagal modulation of heart rate.</p>",
