      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> <strong>Somatostatin</strong> released by <strong>D cells</strong> typically inhibits acid secretion by acting on G cells, ECL cells, and parietal cells. Chronic H. pylori infection, particularly in the antrum, often reduces somatostatin release, thereby increasing acid secretion rather than decreasing it.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> <strong>G cells</strong> in the antrum are stimulated by <strong>gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)</strong>, leading to the release of <strong>gastrin</strong>. Gastrin then stimulates <strong>ECL cells</strong> to release histamine and directly stimulates <strong>parietal cells</strong> to produce acid, both of which contribute to increased gastric acid secretion.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option 3:</strong> <strong>Inhibition of ECL cells</strong> would lead to decreased <strong>histamine release</strong>, which would reduce acid production. However, in the case of H. pylori infection, ECL cells are often stimulated by gastrin, leading to increased histamine and acid secretion.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option 4:</strong> Incorrect. <strong>Acetylcholine (ACh)</strong>, released by the vagus nerve, generally stimulates acid production by acting on <strong>parietal cells</strong>, <strong>G cells</strong>, and <strong>ECL cells</strong>. ACh does stimulate D cells to release somatostatin, but in H. pylori infection, somatostatin levels are often decreased, not increased.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/20250106cb881773-d538-470d-b53d-d4c84040104a.jpg\">\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Role of Gastrin:</strong> Gastrin is a key regulator of gastric acid secretion. It stimulates both ECL cells to release histamine and parietal cells directly, promoting acid production.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Impact of H. pylori Infection:</strong> In chronic H. pylori infection, particularly in the antrum, there is often a reduction in somatostatin release, which removes the inhibitory brake on gastrin secretion, leading to increased acid production.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Neurotransmitter Influence:</strong> Acetylcholine (ACh) and GRP from the vagus nerve play significant roles in stimulating acid secretion through their action on parietal cells, G cells, and ECL cells.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> <strong>Somatostatin receptors</strong> on parietal cells serve to inhibit acid production. Increased expression of these receptors would decrease acid secretion, which is contrary to what is typically seen in patients with H. pylori-induced hyperacidity.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> <strong>D cells</strong> release somatostatin, which normally inhibits <strong>G cells</strong> from secreting gastrin. In H. pylori infection, chronic inflammation in the antrum often leads to <strong>decreased activity of D cells</strong> and reduced somatostatin levels, thereby reducing the inhibition on gastrin release.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option 3:</strong> In chronic H. pylori infection, especially when it involves the antrum, <strong>D cell function is reduced</strong>, leading to <strong>lower levels of somatostatin</strong>. This reduction in somatostatin allows for unchecked <strong>G cell stimulation</strong>, leading to increased <strong>gastrin</strong> production. Gastrin, in turn, stimulates parietal cells directly and through ECL cells, resulting in increased acid secretion.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option 4:</strong> <strong>H. pylori</strong> does not directly stimulate parietal cells to secrete acid.
