It is characterized by demyelination, beginning with an attack on the Schwann cell surface. There is widespread myelin damage, along with <strong>macrophage activation </strong>and<strong> lymphocytic infiltration.</strong> This subtype is predominantly demyelinating, with only occasional secondary axonal damage. Patients may present with <strong>rapidly progressive weakness</strong> and sensory symptoms. Recovery is usually good, with anti-GM1 antibodies present in fewer than 50% of cases.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN):</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Correct Match:</strong> 2 - First attack at motor nodes of Ranvier; prevalent in China and Mexico.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> AMAN primarily affects <strong>children and young adults</strong> and is most commonly seen in China and Mexico, with some seasonal variation. Pathologically, AMAN involves an <strong>attack on the motor nodes of Ranvier,</strong> with activation of macrophages around these nodes. This subtype of GBS is <strong>axonal</strong> rather than demyelinating, leading to motor axonal damage. Anti-GD1a antibodies are often present. Recovery in AMAN is variable and generally faster than in other axonal subtypes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN):</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Correct Match:</strong> 4 - Affects both motor and sensory nerves with severe axonal damage.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Explanation:</strong> AMSAN is less common and more severe than AMAN, as it affects both motor and sensory nerves. Pathology reveals <strong>severe axonal damage</strong> to both sensory and motor nerves, often with slow and incomplete recovery. This subtype is closely related to AMAN, but with additional sensory involvement. AMSAN often results in residual deficits due to the extent of axonal damage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS):</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Correct Match:</strong> 1 - Anti-GQ1b antibodies, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia.</li>\r\n<li>Explanation: MFS is a variant of GBS with distinct clinical features, including <strong>ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia.</strong> It predominantly affects adults and is associated with <strong>anti-GQ1b antibodies</strong> in up to 90% of cases. The electrodiagnostic findings in MFS may be either axonal or demyelinating. Pathology shows features similar to AIDP in the few cases that have been examined.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>AIDP</strong> is the most common form of GBS in Western countries and is characterized by a demyelinating pattern with macrophage and lymphocytic infiltration.</li>\r\n<li><strong>AMAN</strong> is an axonal variant commonly seen in Asia, affecting motor neurons and associated with anti-GD1a antibodies.</li>\r\n<li><strong>AMSAN</strong> involves both motor and sensory nerves with severe axonal damage, leading to slower recovery.</li>\r\n<li><strong>MFS</strong> has unique clinical signs of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, with a strong association with anti-GQ1b antibodies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/20250106b265c619-777a-4fa6-8a8c-e8d6ad19b638.jpg\">",

The patient's symptoms of numbness and tingling in the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring finger, along with positive <strong>Tinel</strong> and <strong>Phalen signs</strong>, suggest <strong>carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS),</strong> which is caused by <strong>compression of the median nerve at the wrist.</strong> To confirm the diagnosis, <strong>electromyography (EDx) and nerve conduction studies</strong> are typically performed, as they can show slowed sensory and motor potentials across the wrist. Initial management includes <strong>conservative measures</strong> such as activity modification, wrist splints, and NSAIDs. Further interventions, such as glucocorticoid injections or surgical decompression, are considered if conservative management fails.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option B</strong> is incorrect. While cervical radiculopathy can cause similar symptoms, it typically involves pain or sensory deficits in a <strong>dermatomal pattern.</strong> The <strong>Phalen</strong> and <strong>Tinel signs</strong> are specific to carpal tunnel syndrome.
