It typically requires <strong>surgical resection</strong> if symptomatic. This patient's symptoms align more with intermittent solid food dysphagia associated with Schatzki rings.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Correct. A <strong>Schatzki Ring (B Ring)</strong> is characterized by <strong>solid food dysphagia</strong>, particularly with meats or bread (also known as \"steakhouse syndrome\").
