      "solution": "<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Option A (Tietze Syndrome)</strong> - This condition involves inflammation of the <strong>costochondral joints</strong>, typically presenting with chest wall pain and swelling, not hand or foot pain.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option B (Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy)</strong> - Primarily associated with lung disease and malignancies, this condition causes periosteal new bone formation but does not typically affect the hands and feet in the manner described here.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option C (Sickle cell disease)</strong> - <strong>Correct answer</strong>. <strong>Hand-foot syndrome</strong> or sickle cell dactylitis is common in young children with sickle cell disease. It is characterized by painful swelling of the hands and feet due to vaso-occlusive infarcts in the small bones. It is seen mainly in children under 5 years of age.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option D (Syringomyelia)</strong> - Syringomyelia primarily affects the spinal cord, causing a cape-like distribution of sensory loss and weakness.
