While it is frequently observed in PD, it is <strong>not classified as one of the four cardinal features</strong> of the disease.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cardinal Features:</strong> Parkinson's Disease is diagnosed based on four key features:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Rest tremor:</strong> A tremor that occurs at rest and typically affects one side of the body more than the other, often starting in one hand (commonly known as \"pill-rolling\" tremor).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Rigidity:</strong> Stiffness in the limbs and neck, often felt as increased resistance to passive movement, sometimes described as a \"cogwheel\" phenomenon when combined with tremor.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bradykinesia:</strong> Slowness in voluntary movement and difficulty initiating movements. This is one of the most disabling features and is required for diagnosis.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Postural instability:</strong> Impaired balance and gait, often leading to a shuffling gait and a higher risk of falls</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Correct Options:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Option A (Rest tremor):</strong> Rest tremor is one of the hallmark features of PD, typically observed in the hands and sometimes in the legs, occurring when the limb is at rest.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option C (Bradykinesia):</strong> Bradykinesia, or slowed movement, is a core diagnostic criterion and is required for PD diagnosis. It includes difficulty with repetitive movements and initiating voluntary movement.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option D (Gait dysfunction with postural instability):</strong> This includes gait disturbances like shuffling and impaired balance, which often lead to falls, especially in later stages of PD.

Autonomic failure is one of the hallmark features of MSA. Patients often present with <strong>orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and other signs of autonomic instability</strong>. This autonomic dysfunction is usually more pronounced and severe compared to other parkinsonian disorders.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Early cognitive decline: Incorrect</strong>. Cognitive decline is typically <strong>not a prominent feature</strong> in MSA, especially in the early stages. Unlike conditions like Lewy body dementia, MSA patients generally maintain cognitive function until later stages of the disease.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Marked response to levodopa: Incorrect</strong>. MSA patients typically show a <strong>poor or limited response to levodopa</strong>. While some initial improvement in parkinsonian symptoms may occur, it is usually less effective compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). This poor response can be a clue to distinguish MSA from PD.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Cortical sensory loss: Incorrect. Cortical sensory loss</strong> is a feature associated with <strong>corticobasal degeneration (CBD)</strong>, another neurodegenerative disorder. In MSA, the primary symptoms are motor and autonomic, with no significant sensory loss.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Resting tremor as a predominant symptom: Incorrect</strong>. Unlike Parkinson's disease, where <strong>resting tremor</strong> is a common and early symptom, MSA patients usually have <strong>less prominent tremor</strong>. If tremor is present, it is often of a postural or action type, rather than the classic resting tremor seen in PD.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Autonomic dysfunction</strong> (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence) is a distinguishing feature of MSA.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Poor response to levodopa</strong> and lack of early cognitive impairment help differentiate MSA from Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.</li>\r\n<li>MSA patients may exhibit <strong>parkinsonian features and cerebellar signs</strong> but lack the classic resting tremor and cortical sensory deficits.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Types of MSA:</strong> MSA-P (parkinsonian) and MSA-C (cerebellar), with both types exhibiting significant autonomic involvement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

McArdle disease affects glycogen metabolism, resulting in inadequate energy production during exercise and causing muscle weakness and myoglobinuria.</li>\r\n<li>Notes: This is the correct answer, as the findings are consistent with a glycolytic defect, particularly McArdle disease.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Option B: Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) deficiency\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: CPT deficiency also causes <strong>myoglobinuria and muscle weakness</strong> but typically presents with normal lactic acid rise after forearm exercise testing, which is not consistent with this patient's findings.</li>\r\n<li>Notes: This option is incorrect because CPT deficiency usually does not show reduced lactic acid rise on forearm exercise testing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Option C: Hypokalemic periodic paralysis\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: <strong>Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is associated with episodes of intermittent muscle weakness</strong> but does not typically present with myoglobinuria or a reduced lactic acid response.
