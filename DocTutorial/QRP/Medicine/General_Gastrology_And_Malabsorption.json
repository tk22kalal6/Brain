      "solution": "<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Option A (Cricopharyngeus muscle)</strong> - While the cricopharyngeus muscle forms part of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) and controls its relaxation during swallowing, it is not primarily responsible for opening the UES. Instead, the UES opening is facilitated by the elevation and forward movement of the hyoid bone, which stretches the UES.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option B (Geniohyoid muscle)</strong> - <strong>Correct answer</strong>. The geniohyoid muscle plays a critical role in elevating and moving the hyoid bone anteriorly. This action is essential for opening the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) by pulling it open during swallowing. Trauma to the hyoid bone, where the geniohyoid muscle attaches, can impair its function, leading to difficulty in opening the UES and resulting in dysphagia and choking sensations.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option C (Inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle)</strong> - The inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle assists in propelling food downwards through the pharynx but does not directly contribute to UES opening.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option D (Proximal portion of the cervical esophagus)</strong> - This portion is part of the esophageal tract and does not play a role in the active opening of the UES.

      "solution": "<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Option A (Acts as the primary lower esophageal sphincter)</strong> - This statement is incorrect. The primary lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is a specialized region of smooth muscle located at the distal esophagus. The right diaphragmatic crus do not act as the primary LES but plays a supportive role.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option B (Serves as an external sphincter augmenting the LES during increased intra-abdominal pressure)</strong> - <strong>Correct answer</strong>. The right diaphragmatic crus contribute to esophageal function by acting as an external component of the LES. It contracts along with the LES, especially during increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as during coughing or straining, providing additional support to prevent gastroesophageal reflux.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option C (Facilitates the opening of the upper esophageal sphincter during swallowing)</strong> - This is incorrect. The right diaphragmatic crus are located at the lower end of the esophagus and is not involved in the function of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), which is controlled by muscles at the pharynx and cervical esophagus.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option D (Coordinates peristalsis in the proximal esophagus via vagal innervation)</strong> - This is also incorrect. The right diaphragmatic crus do not coordinate peristalsis in the proximal esophagus. Peristalsis is coordinated by esophageal muscles and the vagus nerve, independent of the diaphragmatic crura.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <strong>right diaphragmatic crus</strong> act as an auxiliary external sphincter, enhancing the LES function, especially under conditions of increased intra-abdominal pressure.</li>\r\n<li>This action helps prevent reflux by supporting the LES mechanically.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Summary Table on Achalasia</strong></p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/202501063519c18c-3d20-478b-86c6-a0fecc6da8d6.jpg\">\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3d535v34tlady.cloudfront.net/V3/NEETPGMCQ/2025010691b90bcd-99ed-4bb7-b76f-2a9d14bdd6f1.jpg\">\r\n",

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Option 1: Lactose Intolerance</strong> - Incorrect. <strong>Lactose intolerance</strong> is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme <strong>lactase</strong>, leading to difficulty digesting lactose found in milk and dairy products. However, lactose intolerance typically develops later in childhood or adulthood and does not present as congenital severe diarrhea in infancy.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option 2: Glucose Galactose Malabsorption</strong> - Correct. <strong>Glucose Galactose Malabsorption</strong> is a rare congenital disorder caused by a defect in the <strong>SGLT1 transporter</strong> gene, which prevents the absorption of both glucose and galactose, found in milk-based products and regular formula. Since apple and pear juices contain primarily <strong>fructose</strong>, which is absorbed through a different transporter (GLUT5), symptoms improve when the infant is given these juices instead of glucose or galactose-containing foods.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option 3: Fructose Malabsorption</strong> - Incorrect. <strong>Fructose malabsorption</strong> typically results in gastrointestinal symptoms after ingestion of fructose-rich foods like apples and pears. This condition is unlikely here because the infant actually tolerates fructose (from apple and pear juice) well, which would not be the case in fructose malabsorption.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option 4: Abetalipoproteinemia</strong> - Incorrect. <strong>Abetalipoproteinemia</strong> is a disorder involving fat malabsorption due to defective chylomicron formation. It presents with symptoms like steatorrhea, neurologic impairment, and acanthocytosis (abnormal red blood cells), none of which are present in this infant.

      "solution": "<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Option A (It contains long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) which are absorbed slowly and provide sustained energy)</strong> - LCTs require bile salts and pancreatic enzymes for absorption, which may be problematic in patients with malabsorption. Coconut oil primarily contains MCTs, not LCTs.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option B (It contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) which are absorbed directly into the portal circulation, bypassing the need for bile salts)</strong> - <strong>Correct answer</strong>. MCTs in coconut oil are directly absorbed into the portal vein without the need for bile salts, making them suitable for patients with malabsorption or impaired fat digestion.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option C (It contains short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which are rapidly converted into ketone bodies)</strong> - SCFAs are typically produced by gut bacteria rather than ingested directly in oils like coconut oil. Coconut oil is high in MCTs, not SCFAs.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Option D (It contains a mixture of LCTs and SCFAs which are absorbed through passive diffusion)</strong> - This is incorrect as coconut oil primarily contains MCTs, not a mixture of LCTs and SCFAs, and passive diffusion is not the primary absorption method for dietary fats.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Coconut oil</strong> is rich in <strong>MCTs</strong> that are directly absorbed into the portal circulation, making it beneficial for patients with conditions like malabsorption or pancreatic insufficiency.</li>\r\n<li>MCTs do not require bile salts for digestion and provide a quick energy source, which is helpful in specific clinical contexts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",
