The lesion began as a reddish bump above the right hand where the patient had received multiple scratches from moving thorn-covered bayberry plants. It had been subsequently diagnosed empirically as a staph infection and treated with antibiotics without improvement. At this visit, the patient is afebrile and in no significant pain.

      "solution": "<ul><li>Sporothrix schenckii. Infection with this organism causes a disease known as cutaneous or lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis. It occurs in farm or nursery workers or others handling thorny plants, baled hay, or sphagnum moss. The progression of the lesion occurs slowly with the initial lesion resembling an insect bite and progression to nodules and open ulcers. Diagnosis can be made by finding characteristic fungal forms in cultures from the lesions. The distinctive arrangement of the conidia on the conidiophore and the characteristic thermal dimorphism (i.e., mold at 25&deg;C and yeast at 37&deg;C) are consistent with S. schenckii. The fungus is described as a geophilic species, and traumatic inoculation into the subcutaneous layer is the means by which a person becomes infected. None of the other fungal diseases listed manifest similar symptoms, nor do their fungal etiologies show fungal structures as described in this case. Acremonium spp. are causes of eumycotic mycetoma, a fungal disease found in the tropics. B. dermatitidis is an endemic, dimorphic fungus found in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys and causes a pulmonary disease that can be accompanied by skin lesions. C. tropicalis is an opportunistic fungus that causes a variety of diseases.</li></ul>",

      "solution": "<p>'Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an inborn error of fructose metabolism caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aldolase B. It is an autosomal recessive condition. Individuals affected with HFI are asymptomatic until they ingest fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol. If fructose is ingested, the enzymatic block at aldolase B causes an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. This accumulation has downstream effects on gluconeogenesis and regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Symptoms of HFI include vomiting, hypoglycemia, jaundice, hemorrhage, hepatomegaly, hyperuricemia and potentially kidney failure'.</p><p>Hence, typically, a patient of hereditary fructose intolerance remains asymptomatic till the time of 'weaning'.

Fructokinase(sometimes called ketohexokinase) is the first enzyme involved in the degradation of fructose to fructose - 1 - phosphate in the liver. This defective degradation does not cause any clinical symptoms.</li><li>Fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase deficiency - presents in first 4 days of life with severe hyperventilation, profound lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia. Later on, episodes of irritability, somnolescence and coma, apneic spells, dyspnea and tachycardia and muscular hypotonia develop. The patient has such episodes after ingestion of large amount of fructose, especially after periods of fasting. Such episodes decrease with age and patient generally have normal somatic and psychomotor development. Hence failure to thrive is less common as compare to HFI.

The patient has antibodies that react with cardiolipin, a phospholipid antigen used for the serologic diagnosis of syphilis. These so-called antiphospholipid antibodies are directed against phospholipid-protein complexes such as &beta;2-glycoprotein I and thrombin and are sometimes called <em>lupus anticoagulant </em>because they are present in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune states. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and repeated miscarriages. In vitro, these antibodies inhibit coagulation by interfering with the assembly of phospholipid complexes, and a &ldquo;mixing study&rdquo; with normal serum will not correct the PTT (which primarily measures factors II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII and fibrinogen in the &ldquo;intrinsic pathway&rdquo; of in vitro coagulation). In vivo, the antibodies induce a hypercoagulable state by unknown mechanisms. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is an acute consumptive coagulopathy characterized by elevated PT and PTT, and decreased platelet count. The PT and PTT are normal in patients with factor V (Leiden) mutation. Hypercholesterolemia promotes atherosclerosis over many years, and the risk of arterial thrombosis increases</p>",
