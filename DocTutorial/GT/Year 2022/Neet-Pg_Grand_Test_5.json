Once this layer peels off, underlying skin disorder is usually revealed. Two most common types of skin disorders presenting as collodion at birth are non-bullous congenital erythroderma and Lamellar ichthyosis</p><p>Due to mechanical compression, the parchment-like membrane in collodion babies may distort the features of the face and the extremities. The ears can appear malformed, the eyelids can be everted (ectropion), and the lips can be everted, giving a 'fish mouth' appearance (eclabium) Due to the impairment of the skin barrier function, collodion babies are at risk for a number of complications, including hypernatremic dehydration, hypothermia, skin infections, fissures, conjunctivitis, sepsis, dehydration.</p>",
