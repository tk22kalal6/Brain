      "solution": "<p>This patient would be classified as probably NYHA grade III heart failure (dyspnoeic at rest). With the persisting symptoms despite 80mg of furosemide, guidelines would initially suggest the addition of an ACE inhibitor. Although there has been a mild decline in his urea and electrolytes since the introduction of therapy this would not be a contra-indication to the use of ACEs. There is no evidence that increasing a dose of digoxin above 62.5 micrograms in a patient in sinus rhythm would have any added benefit. Although &beta;-blockers would be of further benefit in this patient, it is important first to establish him on ACEi and then introduce &beta;-blockers like carvedilol, metoprolol or bisoprolol in a small dose and gradually increase.</p><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Principles, 20th edition, ch:253 pg:1773,1774</p>",

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN &ndash; Lyell syndrome) is a severe variant of SJS. SJS/TEN patients tend to be young adults, though other groups may be affected. The condition involves a cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity reaction, usually related to drug exposure. A wide range of medications have been incriminated, including antibiotics (especially sulfonamides and trimethoprim), analgesics including paracetamol (acetaminophen), cold remedies and anticonvulsants. Infections due to microorganisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and herpes simplex virus, and some cancers have also been implicated.

In patients with Cushing's disease, the cortisol falls by more than 50% of the basal value, though it should be noted that 10% of patients with Cushing's disease fail to suppress. Unfortunately, there is considerable overlap between basal ACTH levels in pituitary- and non-pituitary-dependant Cushing's syndrome, so that this is not a reliable test. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is the gold-standard test to establish a diagnosis of pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome. This sampling is usually done in conjunction with corticotrophin-releasing hormone. Whilst a low dose dexamethasone test is the usual first screening investigation, it doesn't add incrementally to our knowledge versus the high dose alternative, as we are already aware of the raised midnight cortisol.</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0;\"src=\"https://d1mobye7msb5bl.cloudfront.net/QuizApr2022/08052022GRANDTEST1/85E.png\"><br><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition Ch:379 Pg:2726</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Uveitis, wound dehiscence and wound leak are early (within first few days to 4 weeks) post-operative complications of cataract surgery. Cystoid macular edema, secondary glaucoma, posterior capsular opacification and retinal detachment are the late (after 1 month to years) post-operative complications of cataract surgery.</p><p>Rupture of the posterior lens capsule</p><p>Capsular rupture may be accompanied by vitreous loss, posterior migration of lens material and, rarely, expulsive haemorrhage. Sequelae to vitreous loss, particularly if inappropriately managed, include CMO, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, updrawn pupil, uveitis, vitreous touch, vitreous wick syndrome, glaucoma and posterior dislocation of the IOL.</p><ul><li>Signs Sudden deepening or shallowing of the anterior chamber and momentary pupillary dilatation.</li><li>The nucleus falls away and cannot be approached by the phaco tip.</li><li>Vitreous aspirated into the phaco tip often manifests with a marked slowing of aspiration.</li><li>The torn capsule or vitreous gel may be directly visible.</li></ul><ul><li>Management depends on the magnitude of the tear, the size and type of any residual lens material, and the presence or absence of vitreous prolapse.</li><li> Dispersive viscoelastic such as Viscoat may be injected (see above). If a complete or nearly complete nucleus remains, conversion to extracapsular extraction may be considered. A vitrector can be employed at this point (see below) to remove vitreous entangled with nuclear fragments. </li><li>The incision may be enlarged, if necessary, and a lens glide (Sheets) may be passed behind lens fragments to cover the capsular defect, although it is important to confirm that vitreous has first been displaced or removed and will not be put under traction. </li><li>Residual nuclear fragments are carefully removed by phaco using a low bottle height and low AFR, or, if large, by viscoexpression after extending the main wound. </li><li>Once nuclear remnants have been removed, a common approach is to re-plug the tear with dispersive OVD, gently filling the anterior chamber with a cohesive viscoelastic and using a manual aspiration cannula with the irrigation off to carefully aspirate residual cortex, topping up the AC with viscoelastic as necessary.</li></ul><p>All vitreous is then removed from the AC and the wound with a vitrector, including deep to the capsular tear. A bimanual technique, with separate cutting and infusion instruments, is viewed as superior by many, as vitreous is not pushed away from the cutter; the position of the infusion cannula is kept high and that of the cutter low. The main practical difficulty is visualization of the vitreous gel, and this can be enhanced by the instillation of trypan blue or 0.1 ml of 40 mg/ml triamcinolone (shaken well before use). The infusion bottle height should be sufficient to keep the anterior chamber maintained without intermittent shallowing.</p><ul><li>A small posterior capsular tear may allow careful in-the-bag implantation of a posterior chamber (PC) IOL; it may be possible to convert a small tear into a posterior capsulorrhexis, preventing inadvertent enlargement of the dehiscence. </li><li>Even a large tear will usually allow ciliary sulcus placement of a three-piece (but not a one-piece) PC IOL. The centre of the haptic loops should be placed at 90&deg; to a peripheral tear. If possible, after placing the IOL in the sulcus the optic should be captured within an intact capsulorrhexis of slightly smaller diameter by depressing each side of the optic beneath the capsulorrhexis in turn. With capsulorrhexis capture, the originally planned IOL power, or possibly 0.5 D less, can be used; without capture, the power is reduced by 0.5&ndash;1.0 D. </li><li>Acetylcholine solution is used to constrict the pupil following implantation of a PC IOL or prior to inserting an AC IOL. </li><li>Insufficient capsular support may necessitate implantation of an AC IOL; a prior iridectomy is needed to prevent pupillary block. AC IOLs are associated with a higher risk than PC IOLs of complications including bullous keratopathy, hyphaema, iris tuck and pupillary irregularities. An iris-attached anterior (see Fig. 7.10A) or posterior chamber IOL or a sclerally secured posterior chamber IOL are alternatives. </li><li>A suture should be used to secure the wound following capsular rupture, even if this seems adequately self-sealed. <br /> Posterior loss of lens fragments <br /> Dislocation of fragments of lens material into the vitreous cavity after zonular dehiscence or posterior capsule rupture is rare but potentially serious as it may result in glaucoma, chronic </li></ul><p>uveitis, retinal detachment or chronic CMO. Initially, any uveitis or raised IOP must be treated. It may be reasonable to adopt a conservative approach for small (less than a quadrant) fragments, but pars plana vitrectomy will virtually always be required for larger pieces.</p><p>Posterior dislocation of IOL</p><p>Dislocation of an IOL into the vitreous cavity is rare; loss can occur via a posterior capsular dehiscence, or in an eye with fragile zonular attachments (e.g. pseudoexfoliation) the entire capsular bag may dislocate. Complications include vitreous haemorrhage, retinal detachment, uveitis and chronic CMO. Treatment involves pars plana vitrectomy with IOL removal, repositioning or exchange depending on the extent of capsular support.</p><p>Suprachoroidal haemorrhage</p><p>A suprachoroidal haemorrhage involves a bleed into the supra- choroidal space from a ruptured posterior ciliary artery. If sufficiently severe it may result in extrusion of intraocular contents (expulsive haemorrhage). It is a dreaded complication, but extremely rare (0.04%) with phacoemulsification. Contributing factors include advanced age, glaucoma, increased axial length, systemic cardiovascular disease, vitreous loss and conversion from phacoemulsification to ECCE. A high intraoperative index of suspicion is critical, and if there is any suggestion of a suprachoroidal haemorrhage the operation should be terminated and the incision sutured immediately.</p><ul><li>Signs Progressive shallowing of the AC, increased IOP and prolapse of the iris.</li><li>Vitreous extrusion, loss or partial obscuration of the red reflex and the appearance of a dark mound behind the pupil.</li><li>In severe cases, posterior segment contents may be extruded into the AC and through the incision. </li><li>Immediate treatment involves filling of the AC with a cohesive viscoelastic and sutured closure of the incision. Unless significant glaucomatous damage is present, leaving a substantial quantity of viscoelastic in the eye has been advocated, in order to raise the IOP and tamponade the bleeding vessel; balloon (e.g. Honan) compression to a pressure of 50 mmHg has also been suggested, perhaps for up to 30 minutes. It may be helpful to keep the patient in a sitting rather than lying position. The diagnosis should be confirmed at the slit lamp as soon as possible. IOP-lowering medication such as oral acetazolamide is given to address the pressure spike. Intraoperative posterior sclerotomy is not recommended. Postoperatively, topical and systemic steroids should be used aggressively to reduce intraocular inflammation, with standard postoperative antibiotic treatment and IOP management as indicated. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided for analgesia, and any antiplatelet or anticoagulant discontinued short-term, provided this is safe. </li><li>Subsequent treatment, if spontaneous absorption fails to occur, consists of drainage of large haemorrhages. This can be performed 7&ndash;14 days later, by which time liquefaction of blood clot has taken place. The visual prognosis for large haemorrhages is highly variable; prolonged chorioretinal apposition (&gt;14 days) has a worse prognosis. Pars plana vitrectomy may be considered when the retina appears adherent or detached, though even apposed &lsquo;kissing&rsquo; haemorrhages may resolve spontaneously without apparent retinal problems. If appropriate, completion of cataract surgery may be considered after a further 1&ndash;2 weeks.</li></ul><p>Ref: Parson&rsquo;s Diseases of the eyes 22<sup>nd</sup> edition, Ch.18 The lens pg 285</p><p>Ref : Kanski&rsquo;s Clinical Ophthalmology: A systemic Approach, 8th edition pg 285</p>",

Posterior subcapsular opacity lies just in front of the posterior capsule and has a granular or plaque-like appearance on oblique slit lamp bio microscopy, but typically appears black and vacuolated on retro illumination; the vacuoles are swollen migratory lens epithelial cells (bladder or Wedl), similar to those commonly seen postoperatively in posterior capsular opacification. Due to its location at the nodal point of the eye, a posterior subcapsular opacity often has a particularly profound effect on vision. Patients are characteristically troubled by glare, for instance from the headlights of oncoming cars, and symptoms are increased by miosis, such as occurs during near visual activity and in bright sunlight.</p><p>Nuclear sclerotic cataract</p><p>Nuclear cataract is an exaggeration of normal ageing change. It is often associated with myopia due to an increase in the refractive index of the nucleus, resulting in some elderly patients being able to read without spectacles again (&lsquo;second sight of the aged&rsquo;); in contrast, in the healthy ageing eye (and in occasional cases of cortical and subcapsular cataract) there is mild hypermetropic shift. Nuclear sclerotic cataract is characterized by a yellowish hue due to the deposition of urochrome pigment, and is best assessed with an oblique slit lamp beam. When advanced, the nucleus appears brown or even black, the latter being typical of marked post-vitrectomy opacity.</p><p>Cortical cataract</p><p>Cortical cataract may involve the anterior, posterior or equatorial cortex.

      "solution": "<p>The clinical features and the picture of this patient are characteristic of Acromegaly.</p><p>It occurs if an acidophilic tumor occurs after adolescence-that is, after the epiphyses of the long bones have fused with the shafts-the person cannot grow taller, but the bones can become thicker and the soft tissues can continue to grow. This condition, is known as acromegaly. Enlargement is especially marked in the bones of the hands and feet and in the membranous bones, including the cranium, nose, bosses on the forehead, supraorbital ridges, lower jawbone, and portions of the vertebrae, because their growth does not cease at adolescence. Consequently, the lower jaw protrudes forward, sometimes as much as half an inch, the forehead slants forward because of excess development of the supraorbital ridges, the nose increases to as much as twice normal size, the feet require size 14 or larger shoes, and the fingers become extremely thickened so that the hands are almost twice normal size. In addition to these effects, changes in the vertebrae ordinarily cause a hunched back, which is known clinically as kyphosis. Finally, many soft tissue organs, such as the tongue, the liver, and especially the kidneys, become greatly enlarged.</p><p>About 30 to 40 percent of the anterior pituitary cells are somatotropes that secrete growth hormone, and about 20 percent are corticotropes that secrete ACTH. Each of the other cell types accounts for only 3 to 5 percent of the total; nevertheless, they secrete powerful hormones for controlling thyroid function, sexual functions, and milk secretion by the breasts.</p><p>Somatotropes stain strongly with acid dyes and are therefore called acidophils. Thus, pituitary tumors that secrete large quantities of human growth hormone are called acidophilic tumors.</p><p>Ref: Ganong&rsquo;s Review of Medical Physiology 25<sup>th</sup> Edition; Page No.903 and 904 ; -Figure 75-8</p>",
