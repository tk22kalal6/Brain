      "solution": "<p>Barrett metaplasia is the most serious complication of GERD. It has a strong association with the subsequent development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The incidence of these lesions has increased, not decreased, in the era of potent acid suppression.</p><p>Barrett metaplasia is endoscopically recognized by tongues of reddish mucosa extending proximally from the gastroesophageal junction or histopathologically identified by the finding of specialized columnar metaplasia. Barrett metaplasia can progress to adenocarcinoma through the intermediate stages of low- and high-grade dysplasia. Due to this risk, areas of Barrett metaplasia, and especially any included areas of mucosal irregularity should be extensively biopsied. No high-level evidence confirms that aggressive antisecretory therapy or antireflux surgery causes regression of Barrett's esophagus or prevents adenocarcinoma. Although the management of Barrett's esophagus remains controversial, the finding of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, particularly high-grade dysplasia, mandates further intervention. In addition to the high rate of progression to adenocarcinoma, there is also a high prevalence of unrecognized coexisting cancer with high-grade dysplasia. Nonetheless, treatment remains controversial.</p><p>Esophagectomy, intensive endoscopic surveillance, and mucosal ablation have all been advocated. Currently, esophagectomy is the gold standard treatment for high-grade dysplasia in an otherwise healthy patient with minimal surgical risk. However, esophagectomy has mortality ranging from 3%-10%, along with substantial morbidity. As a result of these factors and the increasing evidence of the effectiveness of endoscopic therapy with purpose-built radiofrequency ablation devices, many now favor this therapy as a preferable management strategy.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition, Chapter 316</p>",

In the presence of lactose, a metabolite of lactose called allolactose binds to the repressor protein resulting in a conformational change that removes the repressor from the lac operator. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the lac genes. In the absence of lactose, the repressor binds tightly to the lac operator preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes.

The patient must be well motivated, clinically stable with good nutrition, and adhere to the preventative measures advised postoperatively. Preoperative management of the pressure sore involves adequate debridement, and the use of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) may help to provide a suitable wound for surgical closure (see below). The aim is to fill the dead space and to provide durable sensate skin. Large skin flaps that include muscle are best and, occasionally, an intact sensory innervated area can be included (e.g. extensor fascia lata flap with a lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh). If possible, use a flap that can be advanced further if there is recurrence and that does not interfere with the planning of neighboring flaps that may be used in the future.</p><p>Reference: love and bailey 27<sup>th</sup> edition page 30</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The patient with subacute thyroiditis usually presents with a painful and enlarged thyroid, sometimes accompanied by a fever. There may be features of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism, depending on the phase of the illness. Malaise and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may precede the thyroid-related features by several weeks. In other patients, the onset is acute, severe, and without obvious antecedent. The patient typically complains of a sore throat, and examination reveals a small goiter that is exquisitely tender. Pain is often referred to as the jaw or ear. Complete resolution is the usual outcome, but late-onset permanent hypothyroidism occurs in 15% of cases, particularly in those with coincidental thyroid autoimmunity. A prolonged course over many months, with one or more relapses, occurs in a small percentage of patients</p><p>Relatively large doses of aspirin (e.g., 600 mg every 4-6 h) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are sufficient to control symptoms in many cases. If this treatment is inadequate, or if the patient has marked local or systemic symptoms, glucocorticoids should be given. The usual starting dose is 15-40 mg of prednisone, depending on severity. The dose is gradually tapered over 6-8 weeks, in response to the improvement in symptoms and the ESR. If a relapse occurs during glucocorticoid withdrawal, the dosage should be increased and then withdrawn more gradually. Thyroid function should be monitored every 2-4 weeks using TSH and unbound T4 levels. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis improve spontaneously but may be ameliorated by &beta;-adrenergic blockers; antithyroid drugs play no role in the treatment of the thyrotoxic phase. Levothyroxine replacement may be needed if the hypothyroid phase is prolonged, but doses should be low enough (50-100 &mu;g daily) to allow TSH-mediated recovery</p><p>Reference:<em>Jameson J, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Loscalzo J. eds.

      "solution": "<p>The finding shown in Figure is characteristic of clubbing.</p><p>Clubbing occurs in the distal portions of the digits and is characterized by the widening of the fingertips, the convexity of the nail contour, and the loss of the normal 15-degree angle between the proximal nail and cuticle. Clinically, it can be sometimes difficult to ascertain whether clubbing is present. One approach to the diagnosis of clubbing is to measure the diameter of the finger at the base of the nail and at the tip of the finger in all 10 fingers. For each finger, a ratio between the base of the nail and the tip of the finger is determined. If the sum of all 10 fingers is greater than 1, then clubbing is felt to be present. A simpler approach is to have an individual place the dorsal surfaces of the distal fourth digits from each hand together. In a normal individual, there should be a diamond-shaped space between the digits. When an individual has clubbing, this space is obliterated. Clubbing most commonly occurs in advanced lung disease, especially bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and interstitial lung diseases like sarcoidosis or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Clubbing was originally described in individuals with empyema and can occur in chronic lung infections, including lung abscesses, tuberculosis, or fungal infections.</p><p>Pulmonary vascular lesions and lung cancer also are associated with clubbing. However, the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease does not cause clubbing. However, the causes of clubbing are not limited to the pulmonary system alone. Clubbing can be a benign familial condition and is also associated with a variety of other disorders, including cyanotic congenital heart disease, subacute bacterial endocarditis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and cancer of the esophagus, liver, small bowel, and large bowel. In untreated hyperthyroidism, clubbing can occur in association with periostitis in a condition called thyroid acropachy. Although these numerous clinical associations have been described for many centuries, the cause of clubbing remains unknown.</p><p>( Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition, chapter 367)</p>",

      "solution": "<p>On average, humans have ~ 9 large circumvallate (also termed vallate; L. vallum = rampart surrounded by a moat) papillae across the junction of the anterior two-thirds and the posterior third of the tongue. Each papilla contains, on average, ~ 250 taste buds, although large individual differences are present. The foliate (L. folium = leaf) papillae, which consist of ridges between adjacent folds along the posterior part of the margin of the tongue, number less than a dozen on each side. Although estimates vary, the average number of taste buds per foliate papilla is probably around 100 in adults. Fungiform (L. fungi = mushroom) papillae, located over the surface of the anterior part of the tongue, vary considerably in size and shape, some being short and cuboidal and others tall with mushroom-like heads. The typical adult tongue contains several hundred fungiform papillae, although not all harbor taste buds. Of individual fungiform papillae that do contain taste buds, the number of buds ranges from 1 to 18 on those located on the tongue tip and 1 to 9 on those located mid-lingually. The filiform (L. filum = thread) papillae are the most numerous papillae on the tongue but do not harbor taste buds.</p><p>Ref: Ballenger's otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery 16th edition chapter no 27 Olfaction and Gustation page no 577</p>",

It can cause suppuration in wounds and around implanted prostheses. Some strains are resistant to many common antibiotics (especially methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, MRSA) and so are difficult to treat. MRSA can be found in the nose of asymptomatic carriers amongst both patients and hospital workers, a potential source of infection after surgery. In parts of northern Europe, the prevalence of MRSA infections has been kept at very low levels using search and destroy methods, which use screening techniques to look for MRSA inpatients before they come into the hospital for elective surgery so that any carriers can be treated before their admission for surgery. Local policies on the management of MRSA depend on the prevalence of MRSA, the type of hospital, the clinical specialty, and the availability of facilities. Widespread swabbing, ward closures, isolation of patients, and disinfection of wards by deep cleaning all have to be carefully considered.</p><p>Staphylococcal infections are usually suppurative and localized. Most hospital <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>strains are now b-lactamase producers and so are resistant to penicillin, but many strains remain sensitive to flucloxacillin, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, and some cephalosporins. There are several novel and innovative antibiotics becoming available that have high activity against resistant strains. Some have the advantage of good oral activity (linezolid), some have a wide spectrum (teicoplanin), and some have good activity in bacteremia (daptomycin) but all are relatively expensive, and some have side effects involving marrow, hepatic and renal toxicity. Their use is justified but needs to be controlled by tight local policies and guidelines that involve clinical microbiologists.</p><p><em>Staphylococcus epidermidis </em>(previously <em>Staphylococcus albus</em>), also known as coagulase-negative staphylococcus, was regarded as a non-pathogenic commensal organism commonly found on the skin but is now recognized as a major threat in vascular and orthopaedic prosthetic surgery and in indwelling vascular cannulas/catheters. The bacteria form biofilms that adhere to prosthetic surfaces and limit the effectiveness of antibiotics.</p><p>Reference: love and bailey 27<sup>th</sup> edition page 44</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Disease Entity</p><p>Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a rare disease due to genetically-determined abnormalities in the trabecular meshwork and anterior chamber angle resulting in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), without other ocular or systemic developmental anomalies. Other terms have been used previously to describe this entity, including trabeculodysgenesis, goniodysgenesis, and primary infantile glaucoma, however, the term PCG replaces these in the 2013 International Classification of Childhood Glaucoma.[2] There are three variants based on the age of presentation as follows:</p><p>A Newborn onset (0-1 month)</p><p>B infantile-onset (&gt;1-24 months)</p><p>C late-onset or late-recognized (&gt;24 months)</p><p>D spontaneously arrested cases (very rare, classic findings of eye stretching including Haab striae with normal IOP; must follow as glaucoma suspects nonetheless)</p><p>PCG commonly presents between the ages of 3-9 months, but the most severe form is the newborn onset. Elevated IOP is associated with the classic 'triad' of symptoms (photophobia, epiphora, and blepharospasm), which occurs due to rapid expansion of the child's eye causing buphthalmos (Greek = 'ox eye'), corneal enlargement, horizontal or oblique breaks in Descemet membrane (Haab striae) and subsequent corneal edema and opacification. If Haab striae and buphthalmos are seen without elevated IOP, optic nerve cupping, or corneal edema, then the patient has spontaneously arrested PCG. [2]</p><p>The prognosis for children with PCG is quite variable, with some achieving the good vision, while others go blind. While PCG accounts for less than 0.01% of all patients with eye diseases, it has been blamed for 5% of childhood blindness worldwide.[3] Vision loss is secondary to corneal scarring or optic nerve damage, and often amblyopia in asymmetric or unilateral cases. Surgical management is the primary treatment modality. If IOP is controlled, vision in the better eye ultimately can be 20/60 or better.[4][5]</p><p>Disease Overview and Definition</p><p>PCG is the most common form of primary childhood glaucoma and is one, of two primary childhood glaucomas, that presents in children younger than 4 years of age (the other primary childhood glaucoma being juvenile open-angle glaucoma). PCG and other childhood glaucomas presenting in infancy may present with one or more of the classic triad of epiphora, photophobia, and blepharospasm; however, if ocular or systemic abnormalities, either congenital or acquired, are also present, then PCG can be ruled out, and secondary childhood glaucomas need to be considered (i.e. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, aniridia, Peters anomaly, persistent fetal vasculature, oculodermal melanocytosis, posterior polymorphous dystrophy, microphthalmos, microcornea, ectopia lentis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, Lowe syndrome, neurofibromatosis, trauma, inflammation, steroid-induced, tumors, retinopathy of prematurity, glaucoma following cataract surgery).</p><p>Due to the elasticity of the eye in young children, the 2013 International Classification System for Childhood Glaucoma defined childhood glaucoma as irreversible or reversible damage to the whole eye (not just the optic nerve as glaucoma is defined for adults). Thus, additional important clinical signs in PCG, besides elevated IOP and optic nerve cupping, are corneal enlargement and clouding, Haab striae, and buphthalmos. Not all signs are always present, however, and other parts of the eye also stretch with elevated IOP. Diagnosis of PCG can be delayed if corneas remain clear, despite being enlarged, and bilateral PCG can be missed if signs and symptoms are mild in one eye. Irreversible vision loss results if elevated IOP is untreated or uncontrolled in PCG. Optic nerve damage occurs, and focal corneal edema overlying Haab striae, which can be single or multiple, can lead to permanent corneal scarring and opacification. This corneal scarring can obscure the visual axis or cause astigmatism with or without refractive amblyopia. Amblyopia may also develop due to optic nerve damage, anisometropia, strabismus, or a combination.</p><p>Symptoms</p><p>Patients with PCG experience one or more of the 'clinical triad' of symptoms including epiphora, photophobia, and blepharospasm. This triad of symptoms is classically associated with PCG due to the corneal edema that results from the elevated IOP and causes irritation. Reduced vision can also occur from corneal edema/opacification or progressive myopia and/or astigmatism. Amblyopia can further worsen vision.</p><p>Signs</p><p>The main clinical signs of PCG include elevated IOP &gt;21 mmHg, corneal edema and/or enlargement of the eye with buphthalmos, and Haab striae. The IOP at presentation is usually between 30-40 mmHg, though it can be outside this range. [39] IOP in the low-20s mmHg is acceptable if the optic nerve is healthy and the patient's eye growth is within normal limits, but may not be if there are other more severe signs of PCG. </p><p>With IOP in the 30-40s mmHg, the cornea becomes cloudy due to diffuse and/or focal edema. As in adult eyes, the endothelial cell layer cannot pump fluid out of the cornea in an eye with elevated IOP. In young children however, there is the additional insult of corneal stretching from the high IOP causing not only enlargement of the cornea, but Descemet breaks, leading to 'striae,' which are areas of bare stroma bordered by two separated edges of Descemet membrane that become ridges due to deposition of hyaline.[8] These are called Haab striae and are associated with acute overlying focal corneal edema when the IOP is high. They occur in about 25% of PCG eyes presenting at birth, and more than 60% of PCG eyes are identified at 6 months of age.[40] There may be single or multiple and are oriented horizontally or obliquely. After normalization of IOP, corneal edema may clear; however, Haab striae remain and may be associated with corneal scarring. The poorly controlled cases of PCG may end up with dense stromal opacification even after IOP is controlled.</p><p>A newborn's cornea is typically 9.5-10.5 mm in diameter and increases to 10.0-11.5 mm by age 1.[41] Any diameter above 12.0 mm before 1 year of age suggests an abnormality, especially if there is an asymmetry between the two eyes. If the diameter is greater than 13 mm at any age, glaucoma suspicion should be high. Along with corneal stretching in the setting of elevated IOP, there is stretching of the scleral wall and all tissues within the eye leading to buphthalmos. Corneal enlargement stops around age 3 years, while the sclera can continue to stretch up to age 10 years of age.[8]</p><p>Other signs related to eye distension include abnormally deep anterior chamber, myopia (mainly due to elongation and enlargement of the eye), astigmatism (from Haab striae and corneal stretching), anisometropia (almost always present in unilateral PCG), optic nerve cupping.</p><p>The optic nerve cupping in very young children may be seen solely due to optic canal stretching and posterior bowing of the lamina cribrosa without a decrease in the neuroretinal rim.[42][43] When the IOP is normalized, there can be a notable reversal of cupping. While cupping may resolve, retinal nerve fiber layer damage, if present, is permanent. In older children and those with advanced glaucoma, cupping occurs due to neuroretinal rim tissue loss, especially at the vertical disk poles.[8]</p><p>Any asymmetry between the eyes in the aforementioned signs should raise suspicion of glaucoma. Lastly, amblyopia, either deprivation or both, may also be present with the other signs mentioned above.</p><p>Ref: Parson 22/e</p>",

This decreases the availability of H+ to exchange with luminal Na+ through the Na+-H+ antiporter. Inhibition of brush border CAse (type IV) retards dehydration of H2CO3 in the tubular fluid so that less CO2 diffuses back into the cells. The net effect is the inhibition of HCO3 (and accompanying Na+) reabsorption in PT. However, the resulting alkaline diuresis is only mild (maximal fractional Na+ loss 5%), because part of the Na+ (but not HCO3) rejected in the PT is reabsorbed at the high capacity TAL segment.</p><p>Secretion of H+ by the intercalated cells of DT and CD is also interfered. Though H+ is secreted at this site by an H+-ATPase, it is generated in the cell by CAse mediated reaction. As such, this is a subsidiary site of action of CAse inhibitors. When CAse inhibitors are given, the distal Na+ exchange takes place only with K+ which is lost in excess. For the same degree of natriuresis CAse inhibitors cause the most marked kaliuresis compared to other diuretics. The urine produced under acetazolamide action is alkaline and rich in HCO3 which is matched by both Na+ and K+.</p><p>Source- Essentials of Medical Pharmacology by K D Tripathi, 8th Edition, Page No. 633</p>",

For example, the first possibility is that statin A and statin B are equivalent, that is to say on average they will have the same effect. This possibility is known as the null hypothesis. The other possibility is that there is a difference between statin A and statin B, which is to say that on average one will be better than the other. This possibility is known as the alternative hypothesis.</p><p>In this study, we see that the group taking statin A does better than the other group, but we do not know if that difference is due to the drugs or whether the difference is due to random chance. Therefore, to decide whether there is a real difference in the drugs, we ask 'What is the likelihood that we would have gotten this result just by random chance if the two drugs are the same(the null hypothesis) ?'. The answer to this question is known as the p-value, which is defined as the likelihood of getting this result or a more extreme result if the null hypothesis is true. The smaller this number, the less likely it is that the result was due to chance alone. Therefore in this case a p-value of 0.052 means that there is only a 5.2% chance that this reduction of 11 or a greater reduction would be seen even if the drugs are the same.</p><p>Source:</p><p>Textbook of Preventive &amp; Social Medicine, by K.

Blurring and indistinctness of grey-white matter (GM-WM) interfaces can be seen in 50-70% of cases within the first 3 hours following occlusion. Loss of the insular cortex ('insular ribbon' sign) and decreased density of the basal ganglia ('disappearing basal ganglia' sign) are the most common findings.
