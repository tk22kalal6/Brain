In many instances, the appendix had been removed because of symptoms of subacute or recurrent appendicitis. The tumour can occur in any part of the appendix, but it is frequently found in the distal third. The neoplasm feels moderately hard and, on sectioning the appendix, it can be seen as a yellow tumour between the intact mucosa and the peritoneum. Microscopically, the tumour cells are small, arranged in small nests within the muscle and have a characteristic pattern using immune histochemical stain for chromogranin B.

The condition may be precipitated by abrupt cessation of antithyroid medications, infection, thyroid or nonthyroid surgery, and trauma in patients with untreated thyrotoxicosis. Occasionally, thyroid storm may result from amiodarone administration or exposure to iodinated contrast agents or following RAI therapy. This condition was previously associated with high mortality rates but can be appropriately managed in an intensive care unit setting. &beta;-Blockers are given to reduce peripheral T4 to T3 conversion and decrease the hyperthyroid symptoms. Oxygen supplementation and hemodynamic support should be instituted. Nonaspirin compounds can be used to treat pyrexia, and Lugol's iodine or sodium ipodate (intravenously) should be administered to decrease iodine uptake and thyroid hormone secretion. PTU therapy blocks the formation of new thyroid hormone and reduces peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Corticosteroids often are helpful to prevent adrenal exhaustion and block hepatic thyroid hormone conversion.</p><p><strong>Reference</strong>: Bailey &amp; Love's Short Practice of Surgery - 28th Edition - Page no 1638</p>",

Each titin molecule has a molecular weight of about 3 million, which makes it one of the largest protein molecules in the body. Also, because it is filamentous, it is very springy. These springy titin molecules act as a framework that holds the myosin and actin filaments in place so that the contractile machinery of the sarcomere will work. One end of the titin molecule is elastic and is attached to the Z disk, acting as a spring and changing length as the sarcomere contracts and relaxes. The other part of the titin molecule tethers it to the myosin thick filament.</p><p>Reference: Guyton's textbook of Medical Physiology, 10th Edition, page number 73</p>",

Most commonly, the predominant neoplastic cells are so-called 'centrocytes', cells slightly larger than resting lymphocytes that have angular 'cleaved' nuclei with prominent indentations and linear infoldings. The nuclear chromatin is coarse and condensed, and nucleoli are indistinct. These centrocytes are mixed with variable numbers of centroblasts, larger cells with vesicular chromatin, several nucleoli, and modest amounts of cytoplasm. In most tumors, centroblasts are a minor component of the overall cellularity, mitoses are infrequent, and single necrotic cells (cells undergoing apoptosis) are not seen. These features help to distinguish follicular lymphoma from follicular hyperplasia, in which mitoses and apoptosis are prominent.

It passes forward and medially above levator ani and reaches superolateral part of base of bladder and further pierces the musculature to open into the urinary bladder.</p><p>Posterior superior iliac spine cannot act as a landmark to locate ureter on Abdominal Xray (NOT B).
