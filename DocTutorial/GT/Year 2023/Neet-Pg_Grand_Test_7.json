      "solution": "<p>The presentation of pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae is similar to that seen in community-acquired pneumonia. Patients may have a cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, and shortness of breath. The sputum produced by those infected by Klebsiella is described as 'currant jelly.' (the sputum produced by those with S. pneumoniae is described as 'blood-tinged' or 'rust-colored'). The reason for this is that K. pneumoniae results in significant inflammation and necrosis of the surrounding tissue.</p><p>Klebsiella pneumonia usually affects the upper lobes but can involve the lower lobes as well</p><p>Host factors that predispose to colonization and infection are as follow:</p><ul><li>Admission to an intensive care ward</li><li>Prolonged use of invasive devices</li><li>Poor infection control strategies</li><li>Immunocompromised especially alcoholics and diabetics</li><li>Prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics</li></ul><p>On Xray, cavitary pneumonia and a <strong>bulging fissure sign</strong>is seen. Often there can be extensive lobar opacification with air bronchograms. A helpful feature that may help to distinguish from pneumococcal pneumonia is that Klebsiella pneumonia develops cavitation in 30-50% of cases (in comparison, cavitation is rare in pneumococcal pneumonia). This occurs early and progresses quickly.

It most commonly manifests as hypotension (SBP less than 90 mmHg or MAP less than 65 mmHg).</p><p>There are mainly four broad categories of shock -</p><ul><li><strong>Distributive Shock</strong> - characterized by peripheral vasodilatation. Types of distributive shock include:<ul><li><strong>Septic Shock</strong> - Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from dysregulated host response to infection. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis with severe circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities resulting in tissue hypoperfusion manifested as hypotension which requires vasopressor therapy and elevated lactate levels (more than 2 mmol/L)</li><li><strong>Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome</strong> - SIRS is a clinical syndrome of the vigorous inflammatory response caused by either infectious or noninfectious causes. Infectious causes include pathogens such as gram-positive (most common) and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, viral infections (e.g., respiratory viruses), parasitic (e.g., malaria), rickettsial infections. Noninfectious causes of SIRS include but are not limited to pancreatitis, burns, fat embolism, air embolism, and amniotic fluid embolism</li><li><strong>Anaphylactic Shock</strong> - Anaphylactic shock is a clinical syndrome of severe hypersensitivity reaction mediated by immunoglobulin E (Ig-E), resulting in cardiovascular collapse and respiratory distress due to bronchospasm. The immediate hypersensitivity reactions can occur within seconds to minutes after the presentation of the inciting antigen. Common allergens include drugs (e.g., antibiotics, NSAIDs), food, insect stings, and latex.</li><li><strong>Neurogenic Shock</strong> - Neurogenic shock can occur in the setting of trauma to the spinal cord or the brain. The underlying mechanism is the disruption of the autonomic pathway resulting in decreased vascular resistance and changes in vagal tone.</li><li><strong>Endocrine Shock</strong> - Due to underlying endocrine etiologies such as adrenal failure (Addisonian crisis) and myxedema.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hypovolemic Shock - </strong>Hypovolemic shock is characterized by decreased intravascular volume and increased systemic venous assistance (compensatory the mechanism to maintain perfusion in the early stages of shock). In the later stages of shock due to progressive volume depletion, cardiac output also decreases and manifests as hypotension. Hypovolemic shock divides into two broad subtypes<ul><li><strong>Hemorrhagic</strong> hypovolemic shock -</li><li><strong>Gastrointestinal bleed</strong> (both upper and lower gastrointestinal bleed (e.g., variceal bleed, portal hypertensive gastropathy bleed, peptic ulcer, diverticulosis) trauma</li><li><strong>Vascular</strong> etiologies (e.g., aortoenteric fistula, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, tumor eroding into a major blood vessel)</li><li>Spontaneous bleeding in the setting of <strong>anticoagulant</strong> use (in the setting of supratherapeutic INR from drug interactions)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Non-hemorrhagic</strong> hypovolemic shock -&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>GI losses</strong> - the setting of vomiting, diarrhea, NG suction, or drains.</li><li><strong>Renal losses</strong> - medication-induced diuresis, endocrine disorders such as hypoaldosteronism.</li><li><strong>Skin</strong> losses/insensible losses - burns, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis, heatstroke, pyrexia.</li><li><strong>Third-space</strong> loss - in the setting of pancreatitis, cirrhosis, intestinal obstruction, trauma.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cardiogenic Shock</strong> - Due to intracardiac causes leading to decreased cardiac output and systemic hypoperfusion. Different subtypes of etiologies contributing to cardiogenic shock include:<ul><li><strong>Cardiomyopathies</strong> - include acute myocardial infarction affecting more than 40% of the left ventricle, acute myocardial infarction in the setting of multi-vessel coronary artery disease, right ventricular myocardial infarction, fulminant dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest (due to myocardial stunning), myocarditis.</li><li><strong>Arrhythmias</strong> - both tachy- and bradyarrhythmias</li><li><strong>Mechanical</strong> - severe aortic insufficiency, severe mitral insufficiency, rupture of papillary muscles, or chordae tendineae trauma rupture of ventricular free wall aneurysm.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Obstructive Shock - </strong>Mostly due to extracardiac causes leading to a decrease in the left ventricular cardiac output<ul><li><strong>Pulmonary vascular</strong> - due to impaired blood flow from the right heart to the left heart. Examples include hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism, severe pulmonary hypertension.</li><li><strong>Mechanical</strong> - impaired filling of the right heart or due to decreased venous return to the right heart due to extrinsic compression. Examples include tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Reference:&nbsp;</strong>Shock</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531492/#:~:text=There%20are%20broadly%20four%20types,cardiogenic%2C%20hypovolemic%2C%20and%20obstructive\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531492/#:~:text=There%20are%20 broadly%20four%20 types,cardiogenic%2C%20 hypovolemic%2C%20and%20 obstructive</a>)</p>",

It occurs as a result of a <strong>floppy</strong> portion of the larynx that has not yet developed the strength to provide rigid support of the airway.</p><p>During inspiration, negative pressure is created through the larynx, which results in a collapse of these structures into the airway and a nar- rower breathing passage. The <strong>partial obstruction</strong> is the source of the noise with breathing.</p><p>The hallmark sign includes a <strong>high pitched or squeaky</strong> intermittent sound noted mostly on inspiration. It is usually more prominent when the infant is lying on his/her back, crying, feeding, excited or has a cold. This is usually first noticed in the <strong>first few weeks of life</strong>. It may worsen over the first few months and become louder. This is because as the baby grows, the inspiratory force is greater, which causes greater collapse of the laryngeal structures into the airway. This is usually at its worst at 3-6 months and then gradually improves as the rigidity of the cartilage improves. Most children are symptom free <strong>by 12 months</strong>.</p><p><strong>Reference. - </strong>Diseases of Ear, Nose and Throat and Head and Neck Surgery, P L Dhingra, 8th edition</p>",

This type presents with contralateral hemiparesis of the face, arm, and leg. Mild dysarthria may be present with the absence of sensory symptoms. These are the <strong>most common</strong> lacunar syndromes. They account for 45% of cases of lacunar strokes. Cortical signs like aphasia, cognitive deficit, or visual symptoms are always absent.

It accounts for 7% of cases of lacunar strokes. The sensations affected are pain, temperature, touch, pressure, vision, hearing, and taste. A common form of <strong>thalamic lacunar stroke</strong> is known as <strong>Dejerine Roussy syndrome</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dysarthria</strong> - <strong>clumsy hand syndrome</strong> involves the <strong>pons or internal capsule</strong> and presents with dysarthria and problems pronouncing words due to voice box muscle weakness, including tongue, larynx, and other facial muscle weakness.

Adjustment of LT4 dosage is made in 12.5- or 25-&mu;g increments if the TSH is high; decrements of the same magnitude should be made if the TSH is suppressed.</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/LBNEETPG/QuizSep2023/GTVII30092023/200E.jpg\"><br><p>Carbimazole and propranolol are used in treatment of hyperthyroidism.</p> <p><strong>Reference:</strong> Harrison 21st edition page 2936</p>",
