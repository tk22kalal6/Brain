For example, in mumps, communicability appears to reach its height about 48 hours before the onset of swelling of the salivary glands. With person-to-person transmission of infection, the interval between cases is determined by the generation time. Further difference is that the term &ldquo;incubation period&rdquo; can only be applied to infections that result in manifest disease, where as &ldquo;generation time&rdquo; refers to transmissions of infection, whether clinical or subclinical.</p> <p>Reference: Park&rsquo;s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 26th edition, page no 108</p>",

Interestingly, repetitive stimulation of the motor nerve in LEMS facilitates the accumulation of Ca2+ in the nerve terminal and increases acetylcholine release, leading to an increase in muscle strength.

      "solution": "<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a rhythm disturbance of the atria that results in irregular, chaotic, ventricular waveforms. This chaotic activity can lead to reduced cardiac output from a loss of coordinated atrial contractions and a rapid ventricular rate, both of which may limit diastolic filling and stroke volume of the ventricles. Atrial fibrillation may be chronic or paroxysmal, lasting minutes to days. On the ECG, fibrillatory waves are seen and accompanied by an irregular QRS pattern. The main ED treatment for atrial fibrillation is rate control. This can be accomplished by many agents, but the agent most commonly used is diltiazem, a CCB with excellent AV nodal blocking effects.</p> <ol> <li>If the patient was unstable, he should be immediately cardioverted.

It may be idiopathic or develop in the context of previous brain insults, including subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), head injury, meningitis and tumour. The CSF pressure at lumbar puncture is typically normal, but it is believed that reduced brain compliance in this condition results in transient spikes of ICP that contribute to clinical deterioration. Patients typically present with the triad of gait disturbance, incontinence and cognitive decline. Ventriculomegaly is evident on imaging, but this can also be the result of cortical atrophy due to other dementia pathologies. Diagnosis typically depends on lumbar infusion and/or drainage studies to demonstrate altered compliance and/or clinical improvement associated with CSF drainage.

The tubes are incubated for 48 hours. From the number of tubes showing acid and gas, an estimate of the MPN of coliform organisms in 100 ml of the sample water can be obtained from statistical tables.

It occurs in most patients but is often not significant; patients rarely mention it unless it is excessive. Common presentations are sweating and flushing in the preauricular region during meals. Minor's starch iodine test identifies the region affected. In it iodine is painted in the preauricular region, dried and covered with starch. Salivary stimulation causes sweating, which turns the starch blue. Frey's syndrome can be reduced either by raising a thick fap with all subcutaneous fat over the parotid or by interposition of tissue, such as a sternocleidomastoid fap, temporalis fascia, allo- dermal tissue or autologous fat between the skin and the surgical bed.</p> <p>Reference: Bailey &amp; Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Page no 848</p>",
