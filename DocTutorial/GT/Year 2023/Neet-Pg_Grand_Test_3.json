Bradycardia occurs.</li><li>Blood vessels: No direct cholinergic supply is present in blood vessels but cholinergic receptors (M3) are present on endothelium of blood vessels. Stimulation of these receptors causes release of NO from endothelium resulting in vasodilation. Additional mechanism of vasodilation is inhibitory action of ACh on noradrenaline release from tonically active vasoconstrictor nerve endings.</li><li>Eye: Cholinergic system stimulates sphincter pupillae (circular muscle of eye) and thus results in miosis (M3). ACh also causes contraction of ciliary muscle of the eye and thus accommodation is possible. Anticholinergic drugs result in mydriasis and loss of accommodation (blurred vision).</li><li>Glands: Cholinergic system stimulates the secretion of glands and results in the increased salivation, lacrimation as well as sweating (M3). On the other hand anticholinergic drugs will result in dry mouth, dry eyes and difficulty in swallowing (due to decreased saliva).</li><li>Urinary bladder: Cholinergic drugs stimulate detrusor and relax the trigone (sphincter) of urinary bladder resulting in increased micturition (M3). Anticholinergic drugs may result in urinary retention.</li><li>Gastrointestinal tract: Hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach (M1 and M3) is stimulated by the parasympathetic system and thus increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease. Peristalsis of GIT is increased and sphincters are relaxed by the cholinergic drugs. Anticholinergic drugs can be used as spasmolytic agents for intestinal colic.</li><li>Bronchus: Cholinergic system causes bronchoconstriction (M3) and anticholinergic drugs may lead to bronchodilation.</li></ul><p>Reference: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology by KD Tripathi, 8<sup>th</sup> edition, page no 114</p>",

It refers to the absence of direct light reflex on the affected side (say right eye) and absence of consensual light reflex on the normal side (i.e., left eye). This indicates lesions of the optic nerve or retina on the affected side (i.e., right eye), leading to complete blindness. In diffuse illumination both pupils are of equal size.</li><li>Efferent pathway defects. Absence of both direct and consensual light reflex on the affected side (say right eye) and presence of both direct and consensual light reflex on the normal side (i.e., left eye) indicates efferent pathway defect (sphincter paralysis). Near reflex is also absent on the affected side. Its causes include: effect of parasympatholytic drugs (e.g., atropine, homatropine), internal ophthalmoplegia, and third nerve paralysis.</li><li>Wernicke's hemianopic pupil. It indicates lesion of the optic tract. In this condition light reflex (ipsilateral direct and contralateral consensual) is absent when light is thrown on the temporal half of the retina of the affected side and nasal half of the opposite side; while it is present when the light is thrown on the nasal half of the affected side and temporal half of the opposite side.</li><li>Marcus Gunn pupil.

Here the pupil is slightly small in size and reaction to near reflex is present but light reflex is absent, i.e., there is light near dissociation (to remember, the acronym ARP may stand for 'accommodation reflex present'). Both pupils are involved and dilate poorly with mydriatics. It is caused by a lesion (usually neurosyphilis) in the region of the tectum.</li><li>The Adie's tonic pupil. In this condition reaction to light is absent and the near reflex is very slow and tonic. The affected pupil is larger (anisocoria). Its exact cause is not known. It is usually unilateral, associated with absent knee jerk and occurs more often in young women. Adie's pupil constricts with weak pilocarpine (0.125%) drops, while normal pupil does not.</li></ol><p>Reference: Kanski clinical Ophthalmology, 9th edition, page no.780</p>",

If CIN III is confirmed on colposcopy, the preferred treatment is LEEP. LEEP can be done in a single step or in two steps. In young females, it is recommended to do colposcopy first to confirm CIN III, and then do LEEP. In older females, LEEP can be done directly during colposcopy without confirming CIN III histologically.</p><p>Cryosurgery is not recommended for the treatment of CIN 3 because it has a higher rate of disease persistence and does not allow for histological examination to exclude occult invasive cancer.</p><p>Hysterectomy is no longer the preferred treatment for CIN 3 in all age groups. LEEP is now the procedure of choice for managing CIN 2/CIN 3 in all age groups.</p><p>Reference: Dutta's Textbook of Gynecology, 8th edition, page 366.</p>",
