Many people move within the country for employment, education, or other reasons.</li><li>Implementing a De Jure system allows the census to capture the entire population, including those who might be away from their usual place of residence during the census period.</li><li>It ensures that individuals are not excluded from the census count merely because they are temporarily absent, thus providing a more accurate representation of the population.</li></ul></li></ul><p>(a) <strong>Why Not De Facto System:</strong></p><ul><li>In a De Facto system, individuals are counted based on their physical presence at the time of the census.</li><li>This method may not be suitable for countries like India due to its high levels of internal migration.

This method helps capture the entire population, including those temporarily absent, thereby providing a more accurate representation of India's diverse populace.</p>",

The muscles responsible for dorsiflexion are primarily located in the anterior compartment of the leg.

It runs along the front of the leg and is responsible for lifting the foot upward.</li><li>Extensor digitorum longus: This muscle also contributes to dorsiflexion. It extends the toes and assists in lifting the foot.</li><li>Extensor hallucis longus: This muscle is involved in dorsiflexion and extends the big toe.</li><li>Peroneus longus: This muscle is not a primary dorsiflexor.

      "solution": "<p>(b) Undertaken among persons who have very early symptoms of a disease: This option suggests that screening is conducted among individuals who already have early symptoms of a disease. However, screening is typically performed on asymptomatic individuals or those who have risk factors for a particular condition but have not yet developed symptoms. The goal is to identify diseases before symptoms manifest, enabling early intervention and improved prognosis. Therefore, screening is not usually undertaken among individuals with early symptoms of a disease.</p><p><strong>Why other options are not correct:</strong></p><p>(a) Search for unrecognised diseases: Screening is primarily aimed at detecting diseases or risk factors in individuals who do not exhibit symptoms. By identifying diseases at an early stage, interventions can be initiated to prevent or mitigate the progression of the disease, leading to better health outcomes. Therefore, searching for unrecognized diseases is a key component of screening.</p><p>(c) Undertaken by means of tests which can be rapidly applied: One of the practical considerations in screening is the ability to administer tests quickly and efficiently to a large population. Rapid applicability of tests allows for timely identification of individuals who may require further evaluation or intervention. Therefore, utilizing tests that can be rapidly applied is an important aspect of screening.</p><p>(d) Undertaken to sort out those who probably have the disease from those who do not have: Screening tests are designed to distinguish between individuals who are likely to have the disease (screen-positive) and those who are unlikely to have the disease (screen-negative). By identifying individuals who probably have the disease, screening facilitates the referral of these individuals for further diagnostic evaluation and appropriate management. Similarly, identifying individuals who probably do not have the disease helps to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and reduce healthcare costs. Therefore, sorting individuals based on their likelihood of having the disease is a fundamental objective of screening.</p><p>In summary, while options (a), (c), and (d) align with the principles of screening, option (b) is not consistent with the concept of screening as it suggests testing individuals who already have early symptoms of a disease, which is typically not the case in screening programs.</p>",

The deviation score of an element is found by subtracting the distribution's mean from the element. A deviation score is symbolised by the letter x (as opposed to X, which symbolises an element); so the formula for deviation scores is as follows: xXX =&minus; For example, in a distribution with a mean of 16, an element of 23 would have a deviation score of (23 2 16) 5 7. On the same distribution, an element of 11 would have a deviation score of (11 2 16) 5 25. When calculating deviation scores for all the elements in a distribution, the results can be verified by checking that the sum of the deviation scores for all the elements is zero, that is, &Sigma;x 5 0. The variance of a distribution is the mean of the squares of all the deviation scores in the distribution. The variance is therefore obtained by</p><ul><li>finding the deviation score (x) for each element,</li><li>squaring each of these deviation scores (thus eliminating minus signs), and then</li><li>obtaining their mean in the usual way-by adding them all up and then dividing the total by their number</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27<sup>th</sup> Edition.</p>",
