Abscess formation typically occurs at two key stages:</p><ol><li><strong>First month postpartum </strong>due to inexperience or improper breastfeeding.</li><li><strong>During weaning </strong>caused by <strong>engorgement </strong>and <strong>nipple trauma </strong>from the baby's teeth.</li></ol><p>If left untreated, <strong>acute mastitis </strong>in breastfeeding women often progresses from <strong>generalized cellulitis </strong>to <strong>abscess formation. </strong>Cellulitis initially presents with erythema, pain, and swelling. If not addressed, it can progress to an abscess, which is typically <strong>fluctuant</strong>. However, in the case of a <strong>deep-seated abscess</strong>, <strong>fluctuation may be absent</strong>. Associated symptoms include fever, malaise, difficulty feeding, and tender axillary lymph nodes.</p><p><strong>Ultrasonography </strong>is essential for diagnosis, revealing <strong>increased echogenicity </strong>(cellulitis) and a <strong>hypoechoic collection </strong>(pus) with floating debris, indicating <strong>liquefaction necrosis</strong>.</p><p>In such cases, the most appropriate management step is <strong>ultrasound-guided drainage </strong>to accurately drain the abscess, especially in deep-seated abscesses where fluctuation may not be palpable.</p><p><strong>Option A</strong>: A breast <strong>support garment</strong>, <strong>cold compression </strong>on the breast (Not warm), and analgesia aid in symptomatic relief. During the cellulitic stage, the patient should be treated with anti-staphylococcal <strong>antibiotics </strong>such as <strong>cloxacillin</strong>, flucloxacillin, or erythromycin. <strong>Breastfeeding </strong>should be actively <strong>continued </strong>from both breasts with frequent emptying of the affected breast.</p><p><strong>Option B</strong>: Contrary to the practice of incision and drainage, ultrasound-guided drainage in a breast abscess gives an excellent cosmetic result, does not hamper breastfeeding, and can be done as a day-care procedure with a high success rate.</p><p><strong>Option C</strong>: This option is <strong>correct</strong>. In abscesses &gt;3 cm in diameter or those containing more than 30 mL of pus (assessed on ultrasonography), a vacuum suction catheter is inserted under ultrasound guidance to drain the pus</p><p><strong>Option D</strong>: Most of the cases of breast cancer are <strong>painless</strong>. Hence this option is not correct. <strong>Key Takeaway Point: </strong></p><p>Treatment requires <strong>antibiotics </strong>and <strong>frequent emptying of the breast. </strong>True abscesses require drainage. <strong>Initial </strong>attempts at drainage should include <strong>needle aspiration</strong>; surgical incision and drainage should be reserved for abscesses that do not resolve after aspiration and treatment with antibiotics. In such cases, <strong>abscesses </strong>are generally <strong>multiloculated</strong>.</p><p>Ultrasound evaluation can assist in characterizing a breast abscess and help to guide needle aspiration.</p><p><strong>Antibiotics should be continued for 14 days. </strong></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Bailey and Love 28th Ed - Page 927</strong></li><li><strong>Sabiston Textbook of Surgery 21st Ed - Page 826</strong></li></ol>",

Although calcium is important for bone health, its serum concentration may not reflect bone density or the presence of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, which cannot be assessed by serum calcium alone.</p><p><strong>B) Bone biopsy</strong><br /> <strong>Explanation:</strong><br /> A bone biopsy is a more invasive procedure and is generally not used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. It may be helpful in diagnosing other bone disorders or conditions that mimic osteoporosis, but it is not the standard method for diagnosing osteoporosis.</p><p><strong>C) Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan</strong><br /> <strong>Explanation:</strong><br /> The DEXA scan is the gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis. It measures bone mineral density (BMD), and a T-score of -2.5 or lower indicates osteoporosis. DEXA is non-invasive, quick, and has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting low bone density and assessing fracture risk.</p><p><strong>D) X-ray of the spine</strong><br /> <strong>Explanation:</strong><br /> While X-rays can reveal fractures and significant bone loss, they are not sensitive enough for early diagnosis of osteoporosis. X-rays typically show changes only after significant bone loss has occurred, so they are not useful for detecting osteoporosis in its early stages.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Williams Gynaecology 3<sup>rd</sup> edition, Chapter 21 Menopausal transition, Page no. 479-480</p>",

It controls the conversion of <strong>fructose-6-phosphate</strong> to <strong>fructose-1,6-bisphosphate</strong>, which is a key regulatory step in the glycolytic pathway. PFK-1 activity is tightly regulated by various metabolites and hormones to ensure that energy production is balanced with the cell's needs.</p><p><strong>Option A) ATP</strong> is a major product of glycolysis and an indicator of the cell's energy status.

Infusion of fluids though a metal cannula into the bone marrow and thence, via a system of non-collapsible veins, into the general circulation. Used in emergencies when intravenous access is not readily available. Previously reserved for the resuscitation of infants and children; adult needles and insertion devices are now also routinely available. The upper tibia (anteromedial surface 1-3 cm below the tibial tuberosity) and proximal humerus are the most common sites chosen. A manual needle and trocar kit may be used to pierce the thin bony cortex, advancement continuing until a loss of resistance is felt. Alternatively, a battery-powered drill may be used. Easy injection of saline without obvious subcutaneous infiltration suggests correct placement. Aspiration of marrow is not always possible, but if successful, samples can be used for cross-matching. All standard drugs may be given by this route; they should be flushed through with 5-10 ml saline to ensure they reach the circulation. Fluids should be given under pressure to overcome venous resistance. Osteomyelitis is the major complication and can be minimised by sterile technique and by reverting to conventional venous cannulation following resuscitation. Compartment syndrome has been reported.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Anaesthesia and Intensive care A-Z, Page 318.</p>",
