      "solution": "<p><strong>Phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1)</strong> is a crucial enzyme in the regulation of <strong>glycolysis</strong>. It controls the conversion of <strong>fructose-6-phosphate</strong> to <strong>fructose-1,6-bisphosphate</strong>, which is a key regulatory step in the glycolytic pathway. PFK-1 activity is tightly regulated by various metabolites and hormones to ensure that energy production is balanced with the cell's needs.</p><p><strong>Option A) ATP</strong> is a major product of glycolysis and an indicator of the cell's energy status. When ATP levels are high, there is less need for energy production, so <strong>ATP inhibits PFK-1</strong> to prevent further breakdown of glucose.</p><p><strong>Option B) Glucagon</strong> is a hormone released during low blood sugar levels. It signals the liver to produce glucose via <strong>gluconeogenesis</strong> and inhibits glycolysis.</p><p><strong>Glucagon indirectly inhibits PFK-1</strong> by decreasing the levels of <strong>fructose-2,6-bisphosphate</strong>, which is an activator of PFK-1. Thus, glucagon has an indirect inhibitory effect on PFK-1.</p><p><strong>Option C) Citrate</strong> is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). When cellular energy levels are high (indicating abundant ATP), citrate accumulates and inhibits <strong>PFK-1</strong>, signaling to decrease rate of glycolysis.</p><p><strong>Option D) Aspartate</strong> is an amino acid that does not directly regulate PFK-1 activity. In contrast to ATP, citrate, and glucagon, <strong>aspartate does not inhibit PFK-1</strong>.</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"width:50%;height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizMay2025/INICETGTII03052025/100E1.jpg\">",

Amastigotes are the diagnostic form found in human tissues, including skin or internal organs, depending on the leishmaniasis form.</li><li>Option D: This is incorrect. In visceral leishmaniasis, the infective form is the promastigote (transmitted by the sandfly), while the amastigote is the diagnostic stage found in human tissues.</li></ul><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"width:50%;height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizMay2025/INICETGTII03052025/144E1.jpg\">",

Abscess formation typically occurs at two key stages:</p><ol><li><strong>First month postpartum</strong> due to inexperience or improper breastfeeding.</li><li><strong>During weaning</strong> caused by <strong>engorgement</strong> and <strong>nipple trauma</strong> from the baby's teeth.</li></ol><p>If left untreated, <strong>acute mastitis</strong> in breastfeeding women often progresses from <strong>generalized cellulitis</strong> to <strong>abscess formation.</strong> Cellulitis initially presents with erythema, pain, and swelling. If not addressed, it can progress to an abscess, which is typically <strong>fluctuant</strong>. However, in the case of a <strong>deep-seated abscess</strong>, <strong>fluctuation may be absent</strong>. Associated symptoms include fever, malaise, difficulty feeding, and tender axillary lymph nodes.</p><p><strong>Ultrasonography</strong> is essential for diagnosis, revealing <strong>increased echogenicity</strong> (cellulitis) and a <strong>hypoechoic collection</strong> (pus) with floating debris, indicating <strong>liquefaction necrosis</strong>.</p><p>In such cases, the most appropriate management step is <strong>ultrasound-guided drainage</strong> to accurately drain the abscess, especially in deep-seated abscesses where fluctuation may not be palpable.</p><p><strong>Option A</strong>: A breast <strong>support garment</strong>, <strong>cold compression </strong>on the breast (Not warm), and analgesia aid in symptomatic relief. During the cellulitic stage, the patient should be treated with anti-staphylococcal <strong>antibiotics </strong>such as <strong>cloxacillin</strong>, flucloxacillin, or erythromycin. <strong>Breastfeeding </strong>should be actively <strong>continued </strong>from both breasts with frequent emptying of the affected breast.</p><p><strong>Option B</strong>: Contrary to the practice of incision and drainage, ultrasound-guided drainage in a breast abscess gives an excellent cosmetic result, does not hamper breastfeeding, and can be done as a day-care procedure with a high success rate.</p><p><strong>Option C</strong>: This option is <strong>correct</strong>. In abscesses &gt;3 cm in diameter or those containing more than 30 mL of pus (assessed on ultrasonography), a vacuum suction catheter is inserted under ultrasound guidance to drain the pus</p><p><strong>Option D</strong>: Most of the cases of breast cancer are <strong>painless</strong>. Hence this option is not correct.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaway Point:</strong></p><p>Treatment requires <strong>antibiotics </strong>and <strong>frequent emptying of the breast.</strong> True abscesses require drainage. <strong>Initial </strong>attempts at drainage should include <strong>needle aspiration</strong>; surgical incision and drainage should be reserved for abscesses that do not resolve after aspiration and treatment with antibiotics. In such cases, <strong>abscesses </strong>are generally <strong>multiloculated</strong>.</p><p>Ultrasound evaluation can assist in characterizing a breast abscess and help to guide needle aspiration.</p><p><strong>Antibiotics should be continued for 14 days.</strong></p>",
