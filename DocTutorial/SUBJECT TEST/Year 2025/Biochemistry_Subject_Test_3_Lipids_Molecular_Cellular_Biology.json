This acetyl-CoA is used for ketogenesis (providing fuel for the brain) and to allosterically activate pyruvate carboxylase, a key step in gluconeogenesis. A defect in &beta;-oxidation cripples both ketone production and glucose synthesis, leading to severe hypoglycemia.</li><li><strong>Hypoketosis:</strong> The absence of ketone bodies despite hypoglycemia and a fasting state is the hallmark finding. It proves that the liver cannot effectively break down fatty acids to produce acetyl-CoA, which is the substrate for ketone body synthesis.</li><li><strong>High Plasma Long-Chain Fatty Acids:</strong> Hormones released during fasting (glucagon, epinephrine) stimulate lipolysis in adipose tissue, releasing fatty acids into the blood. The high plasma levels indicate that these fatty acids are being mobilized but cannot be utilized by tissues like the liver and muscle. They subsequently accumulate in the liver, causing hepatomegaly.<br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"width:50%;height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizOct2025/BiochemSWTIII14102025/4E.png\"></li></ol><p><strong>Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I)</strong> is the enzyme responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix, which is the rate-limiting step of &beta;-oxidation.

A deficiency would also cause hypoketotic hypoglycemia. However, &beta;-oxidation would still be functional, and the accumulation of long-chain fatty acids is typically not as pronounced as in a CPT I defect. While a possible differential, the CPT I defect is the most classic cause for the entire picture, as it blocks the whole long-chain fatty acid oxidation pathway at its entry point.</p><p><strong>Glucose-6-phosphatase (Option D):</strong> A deficiency in this enzyme causes <strong>Von Gierke disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type I)</strong>. It also presents with severe fasting hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly. However, in this condition, fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis pathways are intact and are actually upregulated to compensate for the lack of glucose.

Its role comes much later. In the form of N<sup>5</sup>, N<sup>10</sup>-methylene-THF, it acts as a one-carbon donor for the enzyme <strong>thymidylate synthase</strong>. This enzyme catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) at the C5 position to form deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). Therefore, THF provides the methyl group that is attached<em> to</em> the ring, but it does not contribute atoms within the ring structure. This makes it the correct exception.</p><p><strong>De Novo Pyrimidine Synthesis:</strong> The pyrimidine ring is first assembled as orotate, which is then attached to a ribose phosphate sugar to form a nucleotide. The initial and rate-limiting step is the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and CO2 by the cytosolic enzyme Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase II.</p><ul><li><strong>Thymidylate Synthase:</strong> This is the enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). This reaction is unique as it involves the oxidation of THF to dihydrofolate (DHF).</li><li><strong>Folate Cycle:</strong> For DNA synthesis to continue, the DHF produced must be recycled back to THF by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). This regeneration is vital for maintaining the pool of THF coenzymes needed for both thymine and purine synthesis.</li><li><strong>Clinical Significance:</strong> This pathway is a primary target for anticancer drugs. For example, 5-fluorouracil inhibits thymidylate synthase, while methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. Both actions ultimately block the production of dTMP, thereby halting DNA replication in rapidly dividing cancer cells.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li>The pyrimidine ring is built from three simple precursors: Aspartate, Glutamine, and Bicarbonate (CO&#8322;).</li><li>Thymine is 5-methyluracil.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis </strong>(DKA) is a state of absolute or relative insulin deficiency, leading to a profound metabolic shift from carbohydrate metabolism to fat metabolism. The lack of insulin and the excess of counter-regulatory hormones (like glucagon) stimulate rampant lipolysis, releasing large quantities of free fatty acids into the circulation.</p><ul><li><strong>Massive Beta-Oxidation:</strong> These fatty acids are taken up by the liver and undergo extensive beta-oxidation in the mitochondria. Each round of beta-oxidation generates<strong> one molecule of FADH<sub>2 </sub></strong>and <strong>one molecule of NADH</strong>. The resulting acetyl-CoA is produced in such vast quantities that it overwhelms the capacity of the Krebs cycle.</li><li><strong>Redox Imbalance:</strong> The massive and continuous production of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> from beta-oxidation floods the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The rate of re-oxidation of these reduced coenzymes to NAD<sup>+</sup> and FAD cannot keep up with their rate of production.</li><li><strong>Increased NADH / NAD<sup>+</sup> Ratio:</strong> This leads to a significant accumulation of NADH relative to NAD<sup>+</sup>, thereby markedly increasing the NADH / NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. This altered redox state has several downstream consequences, including the inhibition of enzymes that require NAD<sup>+</sup> (like pyruvate dehydrogenase) and the shunting of excess acetyl-CoA towards<strong> ketogenesis, </strong>which is the source of the ketoacidosis. The high NADH/NAD+ ratio also favors the reduction of acetoacetate to beta-hydroxybutyrate, the predominant ketone body in DKA.</li></ul><p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p><p><strong>NAD<sup>+</sup> / NADH (Option A):</strong> This ratio is the inverse of the correct answer.

Each cycle of beta-oxidation produces FADH<sub>2</sub>, and its accumulation would lower the FAD / FADH<sub>2</sub> ratio. While this ratio also changes, the most profound and widely cited shift in the redox state during DKA is the increase in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> couple.</p><p><strong>ATP / ADP (Option D):</strong> While beta-oxidation generates reducing equivalents that can be used for ATP synthesis, the overall metabolic chaos, cellular stress, dehydration, and potential mitochondrial dysfunction can impair efficient ATP production.

Its methyl group at the beta-carbon position prevents it from being metabolized by the standard beta-oxidation pathway. Instead, it must first undergo <strong>alpha-oxidation</strong> in peroxisomes. The first and rate-limiting step of this process is the conversion of phytanoyl-CoA to 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme <strong>phytanoyl-CoA. </strong></li><li><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> In Refsum disease, a deficiency of this enzyme leads to a block in alpha-oxidation. Consequently, phytanic acid cannot be broken down and accumulates to toxic levels in plasma and various tissues, including nerve tissue and the retina, leading to the characteristic neurological and ophthalmological symptoms. Over 90% of cases of Refsum disease are caused by mutations in the <strong>PHYH gene</strong>, which codes for this enzyme.</li></ul><p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p><p><strong>Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Option A):</strong> This is a family of enzymes (e.g., SCAD, MCAD, VLCAD) that catalyze the first step of <strong>mitochondrial beta-oxidation </strong>for short-, medium-, or long-chain fatty acids, respectively. Deficiencies in these enzymes, such as MCAD deficiency, lead to an inability to break down regular fatty acids, resulting in hypoketotic hypoglycemia, lethargy, and hepatomegaly, especially during fasting or illness. This condition does not involve the accumulation of phytanic acid.</p><p><strong>HMG-CoA synthase (Option C):</strong> This enzyme plays a key role in two separate pathways. The mitochondrial isoform is essential for <strong>ketogenesis</strong> in the liver, while the cytosolic isoform is involved in the <strong>synthesis of cholesterol</strong>. A deficiency in the mitochondrial enzyme would impair ketone body production, while a defect in the cytosolic enzyme would affect cholesterol synthesis. Neither is related to phytanic acid metabolism.</p><p><strong>Succinyl-CoA: acetoacetate transferase (SCOT) (Option D):</strong> This mitochondrial enzyme is crucial for the <strong>utilization of ketone bodies by extrahepatic tissues </strong>(like the brain, heart, and muscle). It transfers a CoA group from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate, allowing ketone bodies to be converted back into acetyl-CoA for energy production. A deficiency in SCOT leads to severe ketoacidosis because ketone bodies are produced by the liver but cannot be used by peripheral tissues. This disorder does not affect phytanic acid levels.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Refsum disease </strong>is a peroxisomal disorder caused by the accumulation of dietary phytanic acid.</li><li>The characteristic <strong>clinical features</strong> include retinitis pigmentosa, anosmia, sensory neuropathy, and ichthyosis.</li><li>The underlying enzymatic defect is in the<strong> alpha-oxidation</strong> pathway, most commonly a deficiency of <strong>phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase</strong>.</li><li>Standard <strong>beta-oxidation</strong> enzymes<strong> (like acyl-CoA dehydrogenase)</strong> and enzymes of <strong>ketone body </strong>metabolism<strong> (like HMG-CoA synthase and SCOT)</strong> are not involved in this pathology.</li></ul>",

In the fed state, high insulin levels promote the synthesis and activity of LPL to clear triglycerides from the blood and facilitate fat storage. <strong>HSL is inhibited by insulin</strong>. High insulin levels signal an energy-abundant state, so mobilizing stored fat is unnecessary. Insulin promotes the dephosphorylation and inactivation of HSL. Conversely, hormones like epinephrine and glucagon activate HSL during fasting.</p><p><strong>Both are present in plasma (Option D):</strong> This statement is incorrect. <strong>LPL </strong>functions at the<strong> capillary wall,</strong> technically outside the cells but not freely circulating in the plasma in its active form.

The outcome of the edit is determined by which of the cell's two major DSB repair pathways is used. For precise editing, <strong>Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)</strong> is required.</p><ul><li><strong>Mechanism of HDR:</strong> HDR is a high-fidelity repair mechanism that uses a homologous DNA sequence as a template to accurately repair a break. In the context of CRISPR editing, scientists can provide an exogenous donor DNA template that contains the desired sequence (e.g., the corrected version of a gene). The cell's repair machinery uses this template to fill in the gap at the DSB, perfectly incorporating the desired change into the genome. This allows for the precise insertion, deletion, or substitution of nucleotides.</li><li><strong>Application in Precise Editing:</strong> Because HDR uses a template, it is the pathway of choice when the goal is to make specific, controlled changes, such as correcting a point mutation or inserting a new gene cassette (a process often called a <strong>\"knock-in\"</strong>)<strong>.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p><p><strong>Nucleotide excision repair (NER) (Option A):</strong> This pathway is responsible for repairing bulky, helix-distorting DNA lesions, such as those caused by UV radiation (e.g., thymine dimers).

NER is not the primary pathway for repairing double-strand breaks.</p><p><strong>Base excision repair (BER) (Option B):</strong> This mechanism corrects damage to <strong>single nucleotide bases,</strong> such as deamination or oxidation. It involves removing the single damaged base, followed by cutting the DNA backbone and inserting the correct nucleotide.

While several genetic defects can cause SCID, the most common form is <strong>X-linked SCID</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>IL2RG Gene Mutation (X-linked SCID):</strong> This form accounts for approximately 50-60% of all SCID cases. The IL2RG gene encodes the common gamma chain <strong>(&gamma;c),</strong> a critical protein subunit shared by the receptors for several interleukins, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. The <strong>IL-7</strong> receptor is absolutely essential for the development of <strong>T cells </strong>and<strong> NK cells</strong>. A defect in the common gamma chain blocks signaling through these crucial receptors, leading to a profound failure of T cell and NK cell maturation. B cells are present in number but are non-functional due to the lack of T cell help. Because the gene is on the X chromosome, the condition almost exclusively affects males, which aligns with the provided clinical history of an affected maternal uncle.</li></ul><p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p><p><strong>ADA deficiency(Option A):</strong> Deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) is the <strong>second most</strong> common cause of SCID, accounting for about 15% of cases. ADA is a housekeeping enzyme involved in purine metabolism. Its absence leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites <strong>(deoxyadenosine and its derivatives)</strong> that are particularly harmful to developing lymphocytes. Unlike X-SCID, this defect results in a deficiency of T cells, B cells, and NK cells. It is inherited in <strong>an autosomal recessive pattern.</strong></p><p><strong>RAG1 mutation(Option C):</strong> Mutations in the Recombination-Activating Genes (RAG1 or RAG2) cause <strong>an autosomal recessive</strong> form of SCID. A complete loss of RAG function leads to a SCID phenotype characterized by the absence of both mature T and B cells (T- B- NK+). This accounts for a smaller fraction of SCID cases compared to X-SCID.</p><p><strong>JAK3 mutation(option D):</strong> Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) is an intracellular signaling molecule that specifically associates with the common <strong>gamma chain</strong>. When a cytokine binds to a &gamma;c-containing receptor, JAK3 is activated and initiates the downstream signaling cascade. Therefore, a mutation in the JAK3 gene produces the exact same clinical and immunological phenotype as X-SCID <strong>(T- B+ NK-).</strong> However, it is inherited in <strong>an autosomal recessive</strong> manner and is a much rarer cause of SCID than mutations in the IL2RG gene itself.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li>The most common form of SCID is <strong>X-linked SCID</strong>, caused by mutations in the <strong>IL2RG</strong> gene, accounting for about <strong>half of</strong> all cases.</li><li>The IL2RG gene product, the common gamma chain, is essential <strong>for T cell and NK cell development.</strong></li><li>The classic immunophenotype for X-SCID is <strong>T-B+ NK-.</strong></li><li><strong>ADA deficiency</strong> is the second most common cause and affects all lymphocyte lineages (T-, B-, NK-).</li><li><strong>RAG and JAK3</strong> mutations are rarer, <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> causes of SCID.</li></ul>",

The pathway is as follows:</p><ol><li>&beta;-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized back to acetoacetate by &beta;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase.</li><li><strong>Acetoacetate is activated to acetoacetyl-CoA.</strong> This critical step is catalyzed by thiophorase, which transfers a CoA group from succinyl-CoA to acetoacetate.</li><li>Acetoacetyl-CoA is then cleaved into two molecules of acetyl-CoA by the enzyme thiolase.</li><li>The resulting acetyl-CoA molecules enter the TCA cycle to be oxidized for energy.<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"width:50%;height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizOct2025/BiochemSWTIII14102025/25E.png\"></li></ol><p>The absence of thiophorase in the liver prevents the activation of acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA, thereby making it impossible for the liver to break down the ketone bodies it produces.

This enzyme is involved in both the synthesis (condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules to form acetoacetyl-CoA) and breakdown (cleavage of acetoacetyl-CoA into two acetyl-CoA molecules) of ketone body precursors. Therefore, its presence is not the reason the liver cannot use ketone bodies.</p><p><strong>&beta;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (Option C): </strong>The liver also possesses &beta;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Heteroplasmy</strong> is the presence of a mixed population of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) within a single cell or individual. This means some mitochondria carry a pathogenic mutation, while others have normal, wild-type mtDNA. This phenomenon is the primary reason for the <strong>variable expression</strong> of mitochondrial diseases.</p><p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong></p><p>Each cell contains hundreds to thousands of mitochondria, and during cell division, these mitochondria are randomly distributed to the daughter cells. The clinical severity of a mitochondrial disorder depends on two main factors:</p><ol><li><strong>The percentage of mutant mtDNA:</strong> The proportion of mutant to wild-type mtDNA is often called the \"mutant load.\"</li><li><strong>The tissue distribution:</strong> Different tissues may have different mutant loads due to random segregation.</li></ol><p>There is a <strong>\"threshold effect,\"</strong> meaning that clinical symptoms only manifest when the proportion of mutant mtDNA in a given tissue exceeds a critical level, impairing the cell's ability to produce sufficient ATP. This threshold varies for different tissues depending on their energy demands (e.g., the brain and muscle have very high energy needs and are more sensitive).</p><p>This random segregation and threshold effect lead to a wide spectrum of clinical presentations. Patients with the same mtDNA mutation can have vastly different symptoms, severity, and age of onset, a phenomenon known as variable expressivity.</p><p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p><p><strong>Maternal inheritance (Option A):</strong> While mitochondrial diseases are characterized by maternal inheritance (since mitochondria and their DNA are inherited almost exclusively from the egg cell), heteroplasmy does not explain this mode of inheritance. Rather, heteroplasmy is a feature within the pattern of maternal inheritance that explains the clinical variability.</p><p><strong>Recessive inheritance (Option C):</strong> This is a pattern of Mendelian inheritance that applies to genes located on the nuclear chromosomes. It is fundamentally different from the non-Mendelian, maternal inheritance pattern of mitochondrial DNA.</p><p><strong>Chromosomal non-disjunction (Option D):</strong> This is an error in the segregation of nuclear chromosomes during meiosis or mitosis, leading to an abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidy), such as in Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). This process is unrelated to the genetics of mitochondria.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li>Heteroplasmy refers to the co-existence of mutant and wild-type mitochondrial DNA in the same cell.</li><li>The random segregation of mitochondria during cell division leads to varying proportions of mutant mtDNA in different tissues.</li><li>Due to a \"threshold effect,\" the variability in mutant load across tissues and individuals is the primary cause of the variable expression and incomplete penetrance seen in mitochondrial diseases.</li></ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The <strong>purine salvage pathway</strong> is a crucial metabolic route for recycling purine bases (adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine) that are released from the breakdown of nucleic acids. This pathway is energetically far less demanding than<strong> de novo </strong>synthesis. The central molecule required for this process is <strong>5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p><p>The salvage pathway involves single-step reactions catalyzed by phosphoribosyltransferase enzymes. These enzymes attach a pre-formed purine base directly to the activated ribose-5-phosphate moiety provided by PRPP, forming a purine nucleotide and releasing pyrophosphate (PPi).</p><p>The key reactions are:</p><ol><li><strong>Hypoxanthine + PRPP &rarr; IMP + PPi</strong> (catalyzed by HGPRT)</li><li><strong>Guanine + PRPP &rarr; GMP + PPi</strong> (catalyzed by HGPRT)</li><li><strong>Adenine + PRPP &rarr; AMP + PPi</strong> (catalyzed by APRT)</li></ol><p>As shown, PRPP is the essential co-substrate that provides the sugar-phosphate backbone for the new nucleotide.</p><p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p><p><strong>ATP only (Option A): </strong>ATP is not directly consumed in the salvage reactions themselves. However, ATP is required to synthesize PRPP from Ribose-5-Phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by PRPP synthetase. The question asks what the salvage pathway uses, and the direct reactant is PRPP.</p><p><strong>Both PRPP and amino acids (Option C):</strong> Amino acids (specifically glycine, aspartate, and glutamine) are the fundamental building blocks used in the de novo synthesis of the purine ring. The salvage pathway, by its definition, bypasses this complex process by reusing existing purine rings, and therefore does not use amino acids.</p><p><strong>GTP only (Option D):</strong> GTP is a purine nucleotide, often a product of the salvage pathway (via GMP). It also serves as an energy source for the synthesis of AMP from IMP in the de novo pathway, but it is not a substrate for the main salvage reactions.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li>Purine salvage pathways recycle pre-formed purine bases to nucleotides in a single step.</li><li>The essential substrate that provides the activated ribose-phosphate group is <strong>PRPP</strong>.</li><li>The key enzymes are Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase <strong>(HGPRT)</strong> and Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase <strong>(APRT).</strong></li><li>This pathway is distinct from <strong>de novo synthesis</strong>, which builds the purine ring from amino acids, CO&#8322;, and formate derivatives.</li></ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)</strong> is a cytogenetic technique used to detect and localize a specific DNA sequence on a chromosome. It is particularly effective for identifying chromosomal abnormalities such as <strong>microdeletions</strong> or microduplications, which are too small to be seen on a standard karyotype.</p><p><strong>DiGeorge syndrome</strong> (also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome) is a classic example of a microdeletion syndrome. It is caused by the deletion of a small segment of the long arm of chromosome 22. FISH is a primary diagnostic tool for this condition. A fluorescently labeled DNA probe that is complementary to the 22q11.2 region is applied to the patient's chromosomes. In a healthy individual, two fluorescent signals will be seen (one on each copy of chromosome 22). In a patient with DiGeorge syndrome, only one signal will be present, confirming the deletion on the other chromosome.</p><p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p><p><strong>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) (Option A): </strong>This disease is caused by mutations in the DMD gene. While about 60-70% of cases are due to large deletions or duplications that can be detected by FISH or similar techniques like MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification), the remaining cases are caused by point mutations or small frameshift mutations, which cannot be detected by FISH. Therefore, while FISH can be used in some cases, it is not a comprehensive diagnostic tool for all patients</p><p><strong>Sickle Cell Disease (Option C):</strong> This is a monogenic disorder caused by a specific point mutation (a single nucleotide substitution) in the beta-globin gene (HBB). A single base change is far too small to be detected by FISH. Diagnosis requires molecular techniques like DNA sequencing or PCR-based methods.</p><p><strong>Tay-Sachs Disease (Option D): </strong>This is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the HEXA gene. The vast majority of these mutations are point mutations or small insertions/deletions within the gene. Like sickle cell disease, these changes are not detectable by FISH and require gene sequencing or enzyme activity assays for diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li>FISH is a powerful cytogenetic technique for visualizing chromosomal abnormalities, especially microdeletions and microduplications.</li><li>DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a characteristic microdeletion (22q11.2) and is a prime example of a condition diagnosed using FISH.</li><li>FISH cannot detect single-gene point mutations or small insertions/deletions, which are the causes of diseases like Sickle Cell Disease and Tay-Sachs Disease.</li></ul>",
