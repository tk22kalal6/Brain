This buildup disrupts multiple cellular processes:<ul><li><strong>Metabolic effects:</strong> Galactose is diverted into alternate pathways, including conversion to <strong>galactitol</strong> via <strong>aldose reductase</strong>.</li><li><strong>Hepatic impact:</strong> Accumulated galactose-1-phosphate inhibits enzymes like <strong>galactokinase</strong> and <strong>glycogen phosphorylase</strong>, leading to <strong>hypoglycemia</strong> and <strong>liver dysfunction</strong>.</li><li><strong>Bilirubin metabolism:</strong> There's impaired uptake and conjugation of bilirubin, resulting in <strong>increased unconjugated bilirubin levels</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Clinical Features:</strong><ul><li><strong>Systemic signs:</strong> Hypoglycemia, jaundice, hepatomegaly, vomiting, and lethargy</li><li><strong>Complications:</strong> Mental retardation, cataracts (due to dulcitol), renal tubular damage, aminoaciduria</li><li><strong>Diagnostic clues:</strong> Positive Benedict's test (reducing sugar in urine), galactosuria, elevated serum galactose</li><li><strong>Potential outcomes if untreated:</strong> coli sepsis, Fanconi syndrome, growth failure, hepatocellular injury, and bleeding diathesis</li></ul></li><li><strong>Management:</strong> Elimination of <strong>galactose and lactose</strong> from the diet is essential.

However, it is not central to the core defect causing systemic manifestations in galactosemia.</p><p><strong>Galactokinase (Option B): </strong>Galactokinase deficiencyis less likely in this case due to the severe systemic symptoms (vomiting, jaundice, liver dysfunction, and hypoglycemia), which are hallmark features of GALT deficiency rather than galactokinase deficiency.</p><p><strong>UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (Option D): </strong>Though part of galactose metabolism, deficiency in this enzyme is rare and typically less severe unless it involves the generalized form.
