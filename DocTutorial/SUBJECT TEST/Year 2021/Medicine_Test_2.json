Once thought to be a single disease entity, it is now known to be an iron-storage disorder with genetic heterogeneity but with a final common metabolic pathway resulting in the inappropriately high cellular release of iron.</p><p>This leads to an increase in intestinal iron absorption and the deposition of excess iron in parenchymal cells with eventual tissue damage and organ failure. Thus, the term <em>hemochromatosis</em> now refers to a group of genetic diseases that predispose to iron overload, potentially leading to fibrosis and organ failure.</p><p>Cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, cardiomyopathy, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are the major clinical manifestations.</p><p>Excessive skin pigmentation is present in patients with advanced disease. The characteristic metallic or slate-gray hue is sometimes referred to as <em>bronzing</em> and results from increased melanin and iron in the dermis. Pigmentation usually is diffuse and generalized.</p><p><em>Diabetes mellitus</em> occurs in ~65% of patients with advanced disease and is more likely to develop in those with a family history of diabetes, suggesting that direct damage to the pancreatic islets by iron deposition occurs in combination with other risk factors.</p><p>Cardiac arrhythmias include premature supraventricular beats, paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and varying degrees of atrioventricular block.</p><p><em>Hypogonadism</em> occurs in both sexes and may antedate other clinical features. Manifestations include loss of libido, impotence, amenorrhea, testicular atrophy, gynecomastia, and sparse body hair. These changes are primarily the result of decreased production of gonadotropins due to impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary function by iron deposition.</p><p>Ref.Harrison&rsquo;s 21<sup>st</sup> edition of Principles of Internal medicine Page No.3233</p>",
