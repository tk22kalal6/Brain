They typically occur in an unacclimated individual who is at rest after vigorous exertion in a humid, hot environment.</p><p>In contrast, cramps that occur in athletes during exercise last longer, are relieved by stretching and massage, and resolve spontaneously.The typical patient with heat cramps is usually profusely diaphoretic and has been replacing fluid losses with copious water or other hypotonic fluids. Roofers, firefighters, military personnel, athletes, steel workers, and field workers are commonly affected. Other predisposing factors include insufficient sodium intake before intense activity in the heat and lack of heat acclimatization, resulting in sweat with a high salt concentration.</p><p><strong>HEAT EXHAUSTION</strong></p><p>The physiologic hallmarks of heat exhaustion&mdash;in contrast to heatstroke&mdash;are the maintenance of thermoregulatory control and CNS function. The core temperature is usually elevated but is generally &lt;40.5&deg;C (&lt;105&deg;F). The two physiologic precipitants are water depletion and sodium depletion, which often occur in combination. Laborers, athletes, and elderly individuals exerting themselves in hot environ[1]ments, without adequate fluid intake, tend to develop <em>water-depletion heat exhaustion</em>. Persons working in the heat frequently consume only two-thirds of their net water loss and are voluntarily dehydrated. In contrast, <em>salt-depletion heat exhaustion</em> occurs more slowly in unacclimated persons who have been consuming large quantities of hypotonic solutions.</p><p><strong>HEATSTROKE</strong></p><p>The clinical manifestations of heatstroke reflect a total loss of thermoregulatory function. Typical vital-sign abnormalities include tachypnea, various tachycardias, hypotension, and a widened pulse pressure. Although there is no single specific diagnostic test, the historical and physical triad of exposure to a heat stress, CNS dysfunction, and a core temperature &gt;40.5&deg;C helps establish the preliminary diagnosis.

Tenofovir potently inhibits HBV replication. Clinically significant resistance to tenofovir has not been observed with up to 7 years of therapy. It is available in two prodrug forms, TDF and TAF. Both formulations of tenofovir are approved by the FDA for the treatment of both HIV infection and HBV infection and are renally excreted. Because of structural similarities among TDF, adefovir, and cidofovir (the latter two drugs can cause proximal renal tubular toxicity), TDF carries a warning for renal toxicity, including Fanconi syndrome and diabetes insipidus, but these risks have not been found in large clinical trials of hepatitis B treatment. Rather, a small decline (by ~5 mg/dL) has been noted in the glomerular filtration rate over 2 years of TDF therapy. A mild decline in bone mineral density has been observed after 5 years of TDF treatment, but the clinical significance of this change is unknown and the risk of fracture remained low. Routine monitoring of renal function during TDF therapy is indicated, and dose frequency should be reduced in chronic kidney disease. TAF has greater stability than TDF, with higher drug concentrations within hepatocytes and less systemic exposure. A comparative study revealed that, while TAF carries the same risks, the magnitude of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and bone mineral density was 25&ndash;30% of that observed with TDF.</p><p>Ref.Harrision&rsquo;s 21<sup>st</sup> edition Principles of Internal medicine Page No.355</p>",

Hypokalemic distal RTA is most commonly due to a secretory defect, with reduced H+-ATPase activity and decreased ability to acidify the urine. For example, hereditary defects in subunits of H+-ATPase are associated with profound hypokalemia in addition to acidosis and hypercalciuria. Pathophysiology of the associated hypokalemia is multifactorial due to the loss of electrogenic H+ secretion (with enhanced K+ secretion to maintain electroneutrality in the distal nephron), loss of H+-K+-ATPase activity, and increases in aldosterone. Sjogren's syndrome is perhaps the most common cause of hypokalemic distal RTA in adults; the associated hypokalemia can be truly profound, often resulting in marked weakness and respiratory arrest.<\\/p><p>Ref.Harrision&rsquo;s 21<sup>st</sup> edition Principles of Internal medicine Page No.364, 2789</p>",
