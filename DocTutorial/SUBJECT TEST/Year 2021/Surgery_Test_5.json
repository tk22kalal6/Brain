Pulsatile doppler signals in the lower pressure distal vasculature, such as the plantar arch and digital vessels, should be documented hourly. The loss of pulsatile doppler signals is consistent with an increase in tissue pressure if intravascular volume is adequate. Although lesser voltages may cause local destructive injuries without systemic sequelae, patients exposed to higher voltage (&gt; 1000 volts), present with a combination of deep tissue injuries secondary to the passage of current, locally destructive entrance and exit wounds, and other local and systemic effects. Compartmental pressure elevation, secondary to edema of injured muscle, can result in additional ischemic injury if compartments are not promptly released by fasciotomy.</p>",

The absence or progressive diminution of pulsatile flow in the posterior tibial artery in the lower limb or the palmar arch arteries in the upper limb indicates a need for escharotomy. Delayed capillary refilling, cyanosis of the digits, and progressively severe paresthesias, particularly deep tissue pain, are all clinical signs that may indicate vascular compromise and should be monitored if an ultrasonic flowmeter is not available. Persistent deep tissue pain and progressively severe paresthesias are the most reliable of the nonspecific clinical signs. A muscle compartment pressure that exceeds 30 mm. Hg, which is greater than normal capillary pressure, has also been used as an indication for escharotomy in burn patients. Edema and coolness to the touch of distal unburned tissue commonly accompany thermal injury and are not useful in assessing the need for escharotomy.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Early wound management is characterized by early excision of areas of devitalized tissue, with the exception of deep wounds of the palms, soles, genitals, and face. Staged excision of deep partial-thickness or full-thickness burns occurs between 3 and 7 days after the injury. There are several proven advantages to early excision including decreased hospital stay and lower cost. This is especially true of burns encompassing &gt;30-40% total body surface area. In conjunction with early excision, topical antimicrobials such as silver sulfadiazine are extremely important in delaying colonization of the newly excised or fresh burn wounds. Permanent coverage through split-thickness skin grafting usually occurs more than 1 wk after injury. Skin autograft requires a vascular bed and therefore cannot be placed over eschar. Meticulous attention to deep circumferential burns is crucial in the management of burn patients. Progressive tissue edema may lead to progressive vascular and neurologic compromise. Because the blood supply is the initial system affected, frequent assessment of flow is vital, with longitudinal escharotomy performed at the first sign of vascular compromise. A low threshold should be maintained in performing an escharotomy in the setting of severely burned limbs.</p>",

Therefore, these lesions are more common in the southern United States and in occupational groups who work out of doors. Because of its greater sun expo-sure, the lower lip is the site of more than 90% of such lesions. Persistent hyperkeratosis precedes 35-40% of these lesions. The incidence of metastases increases with the size of the lesion, and spread is usually via lymphatics to the ipsilateral submental node. Contralateral nodal metastases are rare unless the lesion crosses the midline. Approximately 10-15% of all patients have metastases at the time of diagnosis. These lip tumors are very responsive to radiotherapy, which works well for small to medium-sized lesions. Large lesions treated with radiotherapy usually require surgical reconstruction. Radiotherapy should not be used in patients who will have ongoing sun exposure to the area because radiation therapy sensitizes the tissues to solar trauma.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Clefts of the lip and palate occur relatively frequently (1 in 750 live births); they may be unilateral or bilateral and can vary from a small notch to a complete cleft of the lip and palate. Most clefts occur as isolated anomalies, but occasionally they are associated with neurologic, orthopedic, or cardiac anomalies. A frequently recommended protocol for management is lip repair in the first 3 mo of life and palate repair at 12 to 18 mo. Other cosmetic procedures can be performed late in childhood and adolescence. Palate repair after 2 years of age is associated with a high incidence of speech impairment, often requiring speech therapy; repair in the early months of life can lead to a hazardous loss of blood that is poorly tolerated by the infant. Repair of the lip usually should be accomplished as soon as the infant is sufficiently stabilized to tolerate anesthesia with reasonable safety. Ten to twelve weeks is often recommended as the time for lip repair. At this age, the affected baby usually can be converted to dropper or cup feedings in the postoperative period, which thereby facilitates healing of the lip by reducing the need for suckling with the freshly wounded tissues.</p>",
