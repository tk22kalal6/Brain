Till 1920, India was in this stage.</strong></p><p><strong>Second stage (Early expanding): The death rate begins to decline while the birth rate remains unchanged. As the birth rates remain high, the population starts to grow rapidly.</strong></p><p><strong>Third stage (Late expanding)- Death rate declines still further and birth rate tends to fall, but population tends to grow as birth rate supersedes the death rates, but rates of population growth decelerates.</strong></p><p><strong>Fourth stage (Low stationary)- This stage is characterized by low birth and low death rate with the result that the population becomes stationary. Most industrialized countries have gone through a demographic transition from a high birth and high death rates to low birth and low death rates.</strong></p><p><strong>Fifth stage (Declining): Population begins to decline because birth rate is lower than death rate.</strong></p>",
