The second type of leukemia, myelogenous leukemia, begins by cancerous production of young myelogenous cells in the bone marrow and then spreads throughout the body so that white blood cells are produced in many extramedullary tissues-especially in the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Usually, the more undifferentiated the cell, the more acute is the leukemia, often leading to death within a few months if untreated. With some of the more differentiated cells, the process can be chronic, sometimes developing slowly over 10 to 20 years.

      "solution": "<p>When a coumarin, such as warfarin, is given to a patient, the amounts of active prothrombin and Factors VII, IX, and X, all formed by the liver, begin to fall. Warfarin causes this effect by inhibiting the enzyme, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKOR c1). As discussed previously, this enzyme converts the inactive, oxidized form of vitamin K to its active, reduced form. By inhibiting VKOR c1, warfarin decreases the available active form of vitamin K in the tissues. When this occurs, the coagulation factors are no longer carboxylated and are biologically inactive. Over several days the body stores of the active coagulation factors degrade and are replaced by inactive factors. Although the coagulation factors continue to be produced, they have greatly decreased coagulant activity. The international normalized ratio (INR) was devised as a way to standardize measurements of prothrombin time. For each batch of tissue factor, the manufacturer assigns an international sensitivity index (ISI), which indicates the activity of the tissue factor with a standardized sample. The ISI usually varies between 1.0 and 2.0. The INR is the ratio of the person&rsquo;s prothrombin time to a normal control sample raised to the power of the ISI:</p><p>The normal range for INR in a healthy person is 0.9 to 1.3. A high INR level (e.g., 4 or 5) indicates a high risk of bleeding, whereas a low INR (e.g., 0.5) suggests that there is a chance of having a clot. Patients on warfarin therapy usually have an INR of 2.0 to 3.0.</p><p>(Ref. Guyton and Hall 12<sup>th</sup> edition page.461).</p>",

They are synthesized in the ovaries mainly from <strong>cholesterol</strong> derived from the blood but also to a slight extent from acetyl coenzyme A, multiple molecules of which can combine to form the appropriate steroid nucleus. During synthesis, mainly progesterone and androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) are synthesized first; then, during the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle, before these two initial hormones can leave the ovaries, almost all the androgens and much of the progesterone are converted into estrogens by the enzyme aromatase in the granulosa cells. Because the theca cells lack the aromatase, they cannot convert androgens to estrogens. However, androgens diffuse out of the theca cells into the adjacent granulosa cells, where they are converted to estrogens by aromatase, the activity of which is stimulated by FSH (Figure 81-7). During the luteal phase of the cycle, far too much progesterone is formed for all of it to be converted, which accounts for the large secretion of progesterone into the circulating blood at this time. Also, about one-fifteenth as much testosterone is secreted into the plasma of the female by the ovaries as is secreted into the plasma of the male by the testes.</p><p>Option D is incorrect as aldosterone is implied in regulating sodium and water balance of the body and option B is incorrect since retinol is involved in the visual cycle of the eye.</p><p>(Ref.

The intensity increases when the eye bulb is directed in the same direction as the fast phase or when fixation is hampered by darkness or eye closure. Nystagmus in which the fast phase changes direction according to the direction of gaze, i.e. gaze (paretic) nystagmus, can be congenital, but is often a result of paralysis of the eye muscles, of infection, intoxication or, if asymmetric in amplitude, of an acoustic neurinoma. Fixation nystagmus, miner's nystagmus, and nystagmus latens, is called optic nystagmus, and is thought to be caused by defects in the fixation mechanism. The main characteristic is that it changes direction if one or both eyes are closed and often interferes with the vestibular nystagmus. In the diagnosis of dizzy patients with optic nystagmus, the examination of the vestibular system must be carried out with other methods than nystagmus recordings.</p><p>Ref : ganong review of medical physiology 25<sup>th</sup> edition PG212</p>",

This causes a local depolarization that in turn leads to opening of voltage-gated sodium channels. This initiates an action potential at the membrane.</li><li>The action potential travels along the muscle fiber membrane in the same way that action potentials travel along nerve fiber membranes.</li><li>The action potential depolarizes the muscle membrane, and much of the action potential electricity flows through the center of the muscle fiber. Here it causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release large quantities of calcium ions that have been stored within this reticulum.</li><li>The calcium ions initiate attractive forces between the actin and myosin filaments, causing them to slide alongside each other, which is the contractile process.</li><li>After a fraction of a second, the calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by a Ca++ membrane pump and remain stored in the reticulum until a new muscle action potential comes along; this removal of calcium ions from the myofibrils causes the muscle contraction to cease. We now describe the molecular machinery of the muscle contractile process.</li></ol><p>Ref : Guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 th edition PG73</p>",
