However, the condition usually presents early in life, even at the age of one day, because of difficulty breathing (A). Intralobar sequestration is a mass of pulmonary parenchyma, also not connected to the bronchi, which is most commonly found in the lower lobes and causes recurring episodes of pneu- monia. The X-ray supports an intralobar pulmonary sequestration (B). Given the past history of episodes of pneumonia, a simple lobar pneumonia is unlikely (C).

These so-called antiphospholipid antibodies are directed against phospholipid-protein complexes such as &beta;2-glycoprotein I and thrombin and are sometimes called <em>lupus anticoagulant </em>because they are present in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune states. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and repeated miscarriages. In vitro, these antibodies inhibit coagulation by interfering with the assembly of phospholipid complexes, and a &ldquo;mixing study&rdquo; with normal serum will not correct the PTT (which primarily measures factors II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII and fibrinogen in the &ldquo;intrinsic pathway&rdquo; of in vitro coagulation). In vivo, the antibodies induce a hypercoagulable state by unknown mechanisms. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is an acute consumptive coagulopathy characterized by elevated PT and PTT, and decreased platelet count.

The decoy protein osteoprotegerin (OPG) can bind RANK ligand to reduce its binding to RANK and reduce the nuclear factor kappa B transcription factor and diminish osteoclast activity. The WNT/&beta;-catenin pathway can increase OPG production to tip the balance in favor of bone formation. Bone morphogenetic proteins oppose fibroblast growth factors to decrease chondrocyte proliferation. Matrix metalloproteinases generated from osteoclasts promote bone resorption.</p>",
