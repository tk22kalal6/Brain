ED&amp;C remains the most commonly employed method for superficial, minimally invasive nodular BCCs and low-risk tumors (e.g., a small tumor of a less aggressive subtype in a favorable location). Wide local excision with standard margins is usually selected for invasive, ill-defined, and more aggressive subtypes of tumors, or for cosmetic reasons. MMS, a specialized type of surgical excision that provides the best method for tumor removal while preserving uninvolved tissue, is associated with cure rates &gt;98%. It is the preferred modality for lesions that are recurrent, in high-risk or cosmetically sensitive locations (including recurrent tumors in these locations), and in which maximal tissue conservation is critical (e.g., the eyelids, lips, ears, nose, and digits).

In addition, the wavelengths beyond 700 nm in the infrared spectrum primarily emit heat and under certain circumstances may exacerbate the pathologic effects of energy in the UV and visible spectra.</li><li>The UV spectrum reaching the earth represents &lt;10% of total incident solar energy and is arbitrarily divided into two major segments, UV-B and UV-A, comprising the wavelengths from 290-400 nm. UV-B consists of wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm. This portion of the photobiologic action spectrum is the most efficient in producing redness or erythema in human skin and hence is sometimes known as the 'sunburn spectrum'. UV-A represents those wavelengths between 320 and 400 nm and is ~1000-fold less efficient in producing skin redness than is UV-B.</li><li>The wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm are visible to the human eye.</li><li>Ultraviolet light, natural or artificial, is an effective therapy for many patients with widespread psoriasis. Ultraviolet B (UV-B) light, narrowband UV-B, and ultraviolet A (UV-A) spectrum with either oral or topical psoralens (PUVA) are also extremely effective. The long-term use of UV light may be associated with an increased incidence of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer. UV light therapy is contraindicated in patients receiving cyclosporine and should be used with great care in all immunocompromised patients due to an increased risk of developing skin cancers.</li></ul><p>Exposure to a tumor initiator such as UV-B is believed to be a necessary but not sufficient step in the malignant process, since initiated skin cells not exposed to tumor promoters do not generally develop tumors. The second stage in tumor development is promotion, a multistep process whereby chronic exposure to sunlight evokes epigenetic changes that culminate in the clonal expansion of initiated cells and cause the development, over many years, of premalignant growths known as actinic keratoses, a minority of which may progress to form skin cancer. Based on extensive studies it seems clear that UV-B is a complete carcinogen, meaning that it can act as both a tumor initiator and a promoter.</p>",

The Clark level, which defines melanomas on the basis of the layer of skin to which a melanoma has invaded, does not add significant prognostic information and has minimal influence on treatment decisions. The anatomic site of the primary is also prognostic; favorable sites are the forearm and leg (excluding the feet), and unfavorable sites include the scalp, hands, feet, and mucous membranes. In general, women with stage I or II disease have better survival than men, perhaps in part because of earlier diagnosis; women frequently have melanomas on the lower leg, where self-recognition is more likely and the prognosis is better. The effect of age is not straightforward. Older individuals, especially men over 60, have worse prognoses, a finding that has been explained in part by a tendency toward later diagnosis (and thus thicker tumors) and in part by a higher proportion of acral melanomas in men. However, there is a greater risk of lymph node metastasis in young patients. Other important adverse factors recognized via the staging classification include high mitotic rate, the presence of ulceration, microsatellite lesions and/or in-transit metastases, evidence of nodal involvement, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and presence and site of distant metastases</p>",

They often become more extensive at puberty and then remain unchanged. Firm, discrete, red-brown, telangiectatic papules, 1-10 mm in diameter, extend from the nasolabial furrows to the cheeks and chin, and are occasionally found in the ears. They may be numerous and conspicuous, and very rarely may form large cauliflower-like masses. In many cases they are easily overlooked, being confined to a small area on each side of the nose or the chin.</li><li>Periungual fibromas (Koenen's tumours) appear at or after puberty as smooth, firm, flesh-coloured excrescences emerging from the nail folds. They are usually 5-10 mm in length, but may be very large. This can be the only clin-ically evident abnormality.</li><li>The shagreen patch is an irregularly thickened, slightly elevated, soft, skin-coloured plaque, usually in the LS region.</li><li>White ovoid or ash-leaf-shaped macules 1-3 cm in length, most easily detectable by examination under Wood's light, are frequently present on the trunk or limbs. They are a valuable physical sign, as they may be found at birth or in early infancy, some years before other signs of the disease develop, and may suggest the correct diagnosis in infants with convulsions. However, it is import- ant to appreciate that hypopigmented macules are seen in 2-3 per 1000 of apparently normal newborn babies and therefore alone their presence is not indicative of TSC.</li></ol><p>Other cutaneous manifestations include firm fibromatous plaques, especially on the forehead and scalp, soft pedunculated fibromas around the neck and axillae, and poliosis.</p>",

In three of these types superficial spreading melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, and acral lentiginous melanoma the lesion has a period of superficial (so-called radial) growth during which it increases in size but does not penetrate deeply.

The fourth type nodular melanoma does not have a recognizable radial growth phase and usually presents as a deeply invasive lesion that is capable of early metastasis.
