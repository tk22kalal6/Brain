      "solution": "<p>It is likely that this man has <strong><strong>a macroprolactinoma</strong></strong>, characterised by the markedly raised prolactin level and the symptoms of tiredness and lack of sexual interest. Symptoms of macroprolactinoma include galactorrhoea and amenorrhoea in women, and hypogonadism and impotence in men. Macroprolactinomas may also be associated with headaches, visual field defects and generalised hypopituitarism. In this case, the presence of visual disturbance and midline shift seen on the CT necessitate early surgery. Surgery via the trans-sphenoidal route is the treatment of choice; very large tumours may occasionally have to be removed via an open transfrontal approach. Patients should also be assessed prior to surgery for hypocortisolism, and appropriate replacement therapy with corticosteroids begun if necessary. Removal of adenoma is preferable to complete hypophysectomy, as other pituitary functions may recover after adenomectomy</p><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition Ch:373 Pg:2677</p>",

Pizotifen is a reasonable first-line agent (5 HT2 receptor antagonist), but she is worried about her weight (pizotifen causes weight gain); and ergotamine is not commonly used for acute treatment nowadays. Methysergide is associated with pleural and retroperitoneal fibrosis, and is avoided in all but the most intractable cases. Regular analgesics predispose patients to the development of chronic daily headache, particularly those that contain opiates (like co-proxamol). This is very much the danger in the situation described, because her headaches are common and disabling and could lead to the use of large amounts of analgesia. The correct answer is B - amitriptyline is a reasonable first-choice prophylactic, and treatment with a triptan for the acute attack is justified in this patient because simple analgesia has failed. The tricyclic antidepressants may cause weight gain in some but the risk of this is lower than with pizotifen so it seems a reasonable choice in this case.</p><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition Ch:422 Pg:3096-3102</p>",

      "solution": "<p>As the optic discs appear normal, it may be tempting to pass off the alleged blurring as factitious. However, in retrobulbar neuritis it is said that 'the patient sees nothing and the doctor sees nothing'. As the inflammation is behind the optic nerve head (hence retrobulbar), as opposed to optic neuritis, the optic nerve head or optic disc appears normal. Optic nerve function, however, is affected in the same way in patients with optic and retrobulbar neuritis. Thus visual acuity will be reduced to a very variable degree, and an afferent pupillary defect will be apparent during the 'swinging flashlight test'. Colour vision will be reduced to a greater extent than might be predicted from visual acuity. Red desaturation - ie when red looks paler to one eye than the other - is a sensitive sign of optic nerve dysfunction. Visual field defects will occur (typically a central scotoma, but the type of defect varies). Retrobulbar neuritis has the same systemic implications as optic neuritis, in that an episode of optic or retrobulbar neuritis can contribute to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, if other neurological episodes separated in time and site occur. Holmes-Adie pupil is an idiopathic condition, typically affecting young women, presenting with an enlarged pupil that is poorly reactive to light and accommodation. Absent ankle jerks are a frequent association. A Holmes-Adie pupil causes no harm, except blurring vision when reading in some patients.</p><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition Pg:222</p>",

ADH is increased in heart failure causing further limitation of free water excretion. Together with the increased thirst in patients with advanced heart failure, this leads to a hyponatraemic state that is a particularly ominous prognostic sign in heart failure. Hyponatraemia in liver disease is typically due to a combination of reduced renal clearance of free water and administration of excessive free water in the form of dextrose solutions. Mineralocorticoid deficiency causes increased urinary clearance of sodium with volume contraction and increased ADH, which reduces free water excretion. The clinical features of hyponatraemia generally manifest when the serum sodium concentration falls to 120 mmol/l or less. Paraproteinaemia causes false hyponatraemia due to displacement of more fluid in the serum, which gives false readings.</p><p>Reference: Harrison&rsquo;s Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition Pg:298, 2689, 2070</p>",

Numerous occupations entail potentially significant exposure, e.g. miners, welders, storage battery workers. Pottery workers are particularly heavily exposed.

Lead interferes with a variety of red cell enzymes leading to red cell abnormalities which include punctuate basophilic stippling and clover leaf morphology. The peripheral neuropathy, which is seen in adult patients, is almost always exclusively motor. Interstitial nephritis is the characteristic lesion in the kidneys.
