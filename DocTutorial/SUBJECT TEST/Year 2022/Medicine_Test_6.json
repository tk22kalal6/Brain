A 'steroid cataract' is typically posterior subcapsular in appearance, and causes constant and gradually progressive blur. Steroids can raise blood glucose levels.</p><p>Fluctuating blood sugar levels can cause osmotic swelling of the lens in the eye, resulting in fluctuations in vision. However, diabetic retinopathy will not affect vision unless maculopathy occurs (oedematous, exudative, ischaemic or mixed) or vitreous haemorrhage occurs. Occasionally, topical or systemic steroid use results in raised intraocular pressure, with subsequent progressive damage to the optic nerve and peripheral vision (secondary open angle glaucoma). However, any visual symptoms to peripheral visual field loss would not be intermittent. (The rise in intraocular pressure usually reverses when steroid treatment is stopped. Any damage to the optic nerve and visual field, however, would not be reversible).</p><p>Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with dry eyes. Tear-film integrity on the corneal surface is required both for comfort and to provide an optically smooth surface for refraction. Therefore in dry eye, when the tear film cannot provide adequate wetting of the corneal surface between blinks, grittiness and intermittent blur occurs. A reflex response to irritation of the corneal surface is epiphora, or watering. Symptoms will be worse when tear-film evaporation is greater, for example in windy or in warm dry (air-conditioned air) environments, or when the blink rate declines as is likely when concentrating on computer work.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition Ch:351 Pg:2536, 2537</p>",

The causal mechanism is unknown. Although it may present as asymptomatic papilloedema, most patients complain of headache with or without nausea and vomiting. Bilateral papilloedema, the cardinal feature, is almost invariably present and may be associated with haemorrhages, exudates or both. Visual loss, the only serious complication of BIH, may occur early in the course of the disease. The lumbar spinal fluid pressure is usually elevated, frequently above 300 mm CSF, hence the name intracranial hypertension. Diplopia, caused by unilateral or bilateral abducens nerve palsy, may develop as a false localizing sign. Disorders associated with BIH include the following: Endocrine: Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome, obesity, steroid therapy/withdrawal Drugs: Nalidixic acid, phenytoin, tetracycline, vitamin A Haematological disorders: cryoglobulinaemia, iron deficiency anaemia.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition Pg:186, 2702</p>",

With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the prevalence of KS and other opportunistic infections and malignancies has significantly dropped over the past 2 years. It remains to be determined whether the incidence of KS will increase again as more patients fail antiretroviral therapy. Reports have documented that KS is ten times more common in homosexual and bisexual men than in heterosexual men infected with HIV. AIDS-related KS remains relatively uncommon among heterosexual intravenous drug abusers, women and those acquiring HIV infections through blood products, suggesting a sexually transmitted agent has a causative role. The importance of an altered immune system in the pathogenesis of KS is underscored by its 400 times increased risk in organ transplant patients. As KS is not evenly distributed between all HIV risk groups and is rare among patients with congenital immune deficiencies, it is unlikely that immunosuppression is the sole aetiological factor. Several lines of epidemiological evidence suggest that the agent or agents involved in the pathogenesis of KS are sexually transmitted, these may include human herpes virus 8. Although AIDS-associated KS may involve any organ, mucocutaneous disease is the most common initial manifestation.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition Pg:1448-1449</p>",

Hyperparathyroidism is another important cause of osteoporosis. It is associated with hypercalcaemia and low serum phosphate level.

These gastrinomas generate high serum gastrin levels, leading to hypersecretion of gastric acid and consequent duodenal and jejunal ulcers. Gastrinoma should be considered in all patients with recurrent or refractory ulcer disease, ulcers associated with gastric hypertrophy, ulcers in the distal duodenum or jejunum, ulcers in association with diarrhoea, kidney stones, hypercalcemia, or pituitary disease, or a strong family history of duodenal ulcer disease or endocrine tumours. Glucagonoma syndrome (diabetes mellitus, weight loss and anaemia) is due to hormone-secreting pancreatic tumour. Peptic ulcer is not a recognised feature of the disorder.

      "solution": "<p>Dipyridamole is a weak antiplatelet agent that acts by increasing the cellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). It inhibits the phosphodiesterase enzyme which converts cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to inactive 5'AMP. Elevated levels of cAMP and cGMP inhibit activation and aggregation of platelets. Aspirin is a potent inhibitor of platelet cyclo-oxygenase. This is an enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TxA2), a strong platelet agonist. Because the platelet has no protein synthetic apparatus the effects of aspirin are irreversible and last for the life of the platelet (8-10 days). The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel like ticlopidine, results from antagonism of a platelet ADP receptor, P2T, resulting in inhibition of platelet activation. This antagonism is non-competitive, irreversible, and results in50-70% inhibition of fibrinogen binding. Regardless of the mechanism of activation, the final common pathway for platelet aggregation is the cross-linking of platelets through fibrinogen. Abciximab is a humanized monoclonal antibody. It is a selective GPIIb-IIIa receptor antagonist.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 20th edition Pg:846-847, 3088</p>",
