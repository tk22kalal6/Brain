Upon bringing him to the ER, his ECG was performed, which was consistent with STEMI. His troponin levels were within normal limits. Thus, stable angina was suspected and angiography was done. It revealed 80% occlusion in Left Ascending Artery (LAD). The cardiologist recommended him to undergo an angioplasty and for a drug coated stent to be placed to prevent re-occlusion. The stent was coated with a drug called sirolimus. What is the mechanism of action of this drug?</span></p>",
