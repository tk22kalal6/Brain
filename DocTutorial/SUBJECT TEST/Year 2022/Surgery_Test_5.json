      "solution": "<p>Type A</p><p>Type A are the most common fractures and are completely stable. They result from lateral compression, which causes compression fractures of the pubic rami or compression fracture of the sacrum posteriorly.</p><p>Type B These fractures are partially stable, and there is disruption of the anterior pelvis and partial disruption of the posterior pelvis. The pelvis can open and close 'like a book', but because the sacroiliac ligaments remain intact, there is no vertical displacement. Internal or external stabilisation is required. Blood loss can be significant.</p><p>Type C This fracture is completely unstable. Both anterior pelvis and the entire posterior pelvic complexes are disrupted and the disrupted pelvic bones are free to displace horizontally and vertically. In both type B and type C pelvic injuries, there is a high risk of associated abdominal injuries (bowel perforation or mesenteric laceration) and rupture of the diaphragm.</p><p>Reference: Rooks bailey 27<sup>th</sup>edition, page number 377</p>",
