Extracts of normal mammalian tissues (e.g., cardiolipin from beef heart) react with antibodies in serum samples from patients with syphilis. These antibodies, which are a mixture of IgG and IgM, are called 'reagin' antibodies. Flocculation tests (e.g., Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] and rapid plasma reagin [RPR] tests) detect the presence of these antibodies. These tests are positive in most cases of primary syphilis and are almost always positive in secondary syphilis. The titre of these nonspecific antibodies decreases with effective treatment, in contrast to the specific antibodies, which are positive for life. False-positive reactions occur in infections such as leprosy, hepatitis B, and infectious mononucleosis and in various autoimmune diseases. Therefore, positive results have to be confirmed by specific tests.</p>",
