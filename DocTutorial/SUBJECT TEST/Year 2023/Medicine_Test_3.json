      "solution": "<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization publish guidelines for recommended vaccinations prior to travel to countries around the world. Immunizations for travel fall into three broad categories: routine (childhood/adult immunizations and boosters that are important regardless of travel), required (immunizations that are mandated by international regulations for entry into certain areas or for border crossings), and recommended (immunizations that are desirable because of travel-related risks). Yellow fever is endemic in much of sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Requirements for yellow fever immunization are among the most common entry rules encountered by travelers. Some endemic countries require proof of immunization for all international arrivals. Other countries, including many nonendemic countries that are prone to epidemics, require proof of immunization for arriving travelers who have recently (i.e., within 10 days prior to arrival) traveled to endemic countries. Transit stops for &ge;12 hours in an endemic country also can result in a requirement for proof of immunization. The United States has no requirement regarding yellow fever immunization for travelers entering the country. Country-specific recommendations and requirements for yellow fever immunization are available from the CDC Travelers' Health website.</p><p>Meningococcal vaccination is not required for entry into countries in sub-Saharan Africa. However, protection against meningitis is required for entry into Saudi Arabia during the Hajj. Hepatitis A is one of the most common vaccine-preventable infections of travellers and is therefore strongly recommended, but it is not required prior to travel. Vaccination for typhoid fever is also recommended but not required. Prior to travel, it is certainly recommended that an individual be up to date on all routine vaccinations, including measles, diphtheria, and polio. Influenza is perhaps the most common preventable illness in travelers, and the influenza vaccine should be administered per routine guidelines.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21<sup>st</sup> edition (Chap. 124) pg.993</p>",

Pneumococci are spherical gram-positive bacteria of the genus Streptococcus. Within this genus, cell division occurs along a single axis, and bacteria grow in chains or pairs, hence the name Streptococcus, from the Greek streptos, meaning 'twisted,' and kokkos, meaning 'berry.' At least 22 streptococcal species are recognized and are divided further into groups based on their hemolytic properties. S. pneumoniae belongs to the &alpha;-hemolytic group that characteristically produces a greenish color on blood agar because of the reduction of iron in hemoglobin. The bacteria are fastidious and grow best in 5% CO2 but require a source of catalase (e.g., blood) for growth on agar plates, where they develop mucoid (smooth/shiny) colonies. Pneumococci without a capsule produce colonies with a rough surface. Unlike that of other &alpha;-hemolytic streptococci, their growth is inhibited in the presence of optochin (ethylhydrocupreine hydrochloride), and they are bile soluble. In common with other gram-positive bacteria, pneumococci have a cell membrane beneath a cell wall, which in turn is covered by a polysaccharide capsule. Pneumococci are divided into serogroups or serotypes based on capsular polysaccharide structure, as distinguished with rabbit polyclonal antisera; capsules swell in the presence of specific antiserum (the quellung reaction). The staphylococcal organisms grow not in chains, but in clusters.

The proximal tubule uses both cellular and paracellular transport mechanisms. The apical membrane of proximal tubular cells has an expanded surface area available for reabsorptive work created by a dense array of microvilli called the brush border, and leaky tight junctions enable high-capacity fluid reabsorption. Approximately 15-25% of filtered NaCl is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, mainly by the thick ascending limb. The distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs ~5% of the filtered NaCl. This segment is composed of a tight epithelium with little water permeability. The collecting duct modulates the final composition of urine. The two major divisions, the cortical collecting duct and inner medullary collecting duct, contribute to reabsorbing ~4-5% of filtered Na+ and are important for hormonal regulation of salt and water balance.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21<sup>st</sup> edition (Chap.309) pg.2290</p>",

Because the patient has weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome is less likely, and increased dietary fiber is unlikely to be useful. Finally, the patient's symptoms may be consistent with celiac disease. Antibodies to gliadin, endomysium, and tissue transglutaminase can be easily measured in peripheral blood.

      "solution": "<p>In the vast majority of patients with Guillain-Barr&eacute; (GBS), treatment should be initiated as soon after diagnosis as possible. Each day counts; ~2 weeks after the first motor symptoms, it is not known whether immunotherapy is still effective. If the patient has already reached the plateau stage, then treatment probably is no longer indicated, unless the patient has severe motor weakness and one cannot exclude the possibility that an immunologic attack is still ongoing. Either high-dose IVIg or plasmapheresis can be initiated, as they are equally effective for typical GBS. A combination of the two therapies is not significantly better than either alone. IVIg is often the initial therapy chosen because of its ease of administration and good safety record. Anecdotal data have also suggested that IVIg may be preferable to plasma exchange (PE) for the acute motor axonal neuropathy and Miller Fisher syndrome variants of GBS. IVIg is administered as five daily infusions for a total dose of 2 g/kg body weight. There is some evidence that GBS autoantibodies are neutralized by anti-idiotypic antibodies present in IVIg preparations, perhaps accounting for the therapeutic effect. A course of plasmapheresis usually consists of ~40-50 mL/kg PE four to five times over 7-10 days. Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials indicates that treatment reduces the need for mechanical ventilation by nearly half (from 27 to 14% with PE) and increases the likelihood of full recovery at 1 year (from 55 to 68%). Functionally significant improvement may occur toward the end of the first week of treatment or may be delayed for several weeks. The lack of noticeable improvement following a course of IVIg or PE is not an indication to treat with the alternate treatment. However, there are occasional patients who are treated early in the course of GBS and improve, who then relapse within a month. Brief retreatment with the original therapy is usually effective in such cases. Glucocorticoids have not been found to be effective in GBS. Occasional patients with very mild forms of GBS, especially those who appear to have already reached a plateau when initially seen, may be managed conservatively without IVIg or PE</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21<sup>st</sup> edition,(Chap. 447).pg no: 3504.</p>",

Thrombolysis can be used for acute pulmonary emboli causing circulatory collapse and there is emerging evidence to support this treatment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved systemically administered fibrinolytic regimen is 100 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) prescribed as a continuous peripheral intravenous infusion over 2 h. The sooner thrombolysis is administered, the more effective it is. However, this approach can be used for at least 14 days after the PE has occurred. A popular off-label dosing regimen is 50 mg of TPA administered over 2 h. This lower dose may be associated with fewer bleeding complications.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21<sup>st</sup> edition,Ch:279, Pg:2099, 2100</p>",

The general principles of asthma management and its goals are unchanged. Avoidance of triggers, especially smoking environments, is critical in view of the risk of loss of control and, in the case of smoking, its clear effects on risk of development of asthma in the child. There is extensive experience suggesting the safety of inhaled albuterol, beclomethasone, budesonide, and fluticasone, with reassuring information on formoterol and salmeterol in pregnancy. Animal studies have not suggested toxicity for montelukast, zafirlukast, omalizumab, and ipratropium. Antibodies cross the placenta, and there are few human data on the safety of IL-5-active drugs or anti-IL-4R&alpha;. Chronic use of OCS has been associated with neonatal adrenal insufficiency, preeclampsia, low birth weight, and a slight increase in the frequency of cleft palate. However, it is clear that poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy carries greater risk to the fetus and mother than these effects. There should be no hesitancy in administering routine pharmacotherapy for acute exacerbations. Initiation of allergen immunotherapy or omalizumab during pregnancy is not recommended.

Respiration waxes and wanes in a crescendo-decrescendo pattern. Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a type of central sleep apnea often associated with heart failure or other low cardiac output states. Pathophysiologically, this occurs because the baseline carbon dioxide during wakefulness is below the apneic threshold during sleep. Thus, at sleep onset, a central apneic event occurs allowing carbon dioxide to rise. When this rise in carbon dioxide is detected centrally, there is an exaggerated respiratory response that leads to hyperpnea and hyperventilation, driving the carbon dioxide levels below the apneic threshold again, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of apnea and hyperpnea. It occurs more commonly in individuals with heart failure or atrial fibrillation due to a delay in circulation time. This prolonged circulation delay between the pulmonary capillaries and the central carbon dioxide-sensing chemoreceptors contributes to these ongoing cycles of hyperpnea and apnea. In many individuals with Cheyne-Stokes respiration, it has been observed that the pattern of breathing may worsen over the course of the night and the fluid is redistributed centrally, further prolonging circulation time. Optimization of volume status or rhythm may improve the disordered nocturnal respiration.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21st edition (Chap. 297) pg no: 2207.</p>",

Physical findings frequently include crackles and wheezing on lung auscultation, and some patients with bronchiectasis exhibit clubbing of the digits. Mild to moderate airflow obstruction often is detected on pulmonary function tests, overlapping with that seen at presentation with other conditions, such as COPD. Acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis usually are characterized by changes in the nature of sputum production, with increased volume and purulence. However, typical signs and symptoms of lung infection, such as fever and new infiltrates, may not be present. The diagnosis usually is based on presentation with a persistent chronic cough and sputum production accompanied by consistent radiographic features. Although chest radiographs lack sensitivity, the presence of 'tram tracks' indicating dilated airways is consistent with bronchiectasis. Chest CT is more specific for bronchiectasis and is the imaging modality of choice for confirming the diagnosis. CT findings include airway dilation (detected as parallel 'tram tracks' or as the 'signet-ring sign'-a cross-sectional area of the airway with a diameter at least 1.5 times that of the adjacent vessel), lack of bronchial tapering (including the presence of tubular structures within 1 cm from the pleural surface), bronchial wall thickening in dilated airways, inspissated secretions (e.g., the 'tree-in-bud' pattern), or cysts emanating from the bronchial wall (especially pronounced in cystic bronchiectasis)</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21st edition Ch:290, Pg:2174.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The normal role of tumor-suppressor genes is to restrain cell growth, and the function of these genes is inactivated in many cancers. The three major types of somatic lesions observed in tumor-suppressor genes during tumor development are point mutations, small insertions and/or deletions known as indels, and large deletions. Point mutations or indels in the coding region of tumor-suppressor genes will frequently lead to truncated protein products or allele-specific loss of RNA expression by the process of nonsense-mediated decay. Unlike the highly recurrent point mutations that are found in critical positions of activated oncogenes, known as mutational hotspots, the point mutations that cause tumor-suppressor gene inactivation tend to be distributed throughout the open reading frame. Large deletions lead to the loss of a functional product and sometimes encompass the entire gene or even the entire chromosome arm, leading to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor DNA compared with the corresponding normal tissue DNA. Solid tumors generally contain an abnormal number of chromosomes, a state known as aneuploidy; chromosomes from aneuploid tumors exhibit structural alterations such as translocations, deletions, and amplifications. These abnormalities reflect an underlying defect in cancer cells known as chromosomal instability. While aneuploidy is a striking cellular phenotype,</p><p>chromosomal instability is manifest as only a small increase in the tendency of cells to gain, lose, or rearrange chromosomes during any given cell cycle. Point mutation (alternatively known as single nucleotide substitution) is a common mechanism of oncogene activation. The restricted pattern of mutations observed in oncogenes compared with that of tumor-suppressor genes reflects the fact that gain-of-function mutations must occur at specific sites, whereas a broad variety of mutations can lead to loss of activity. Gene silencing, an epigenetic change that leads to the loss of gene expression, occurs in conjunction with hypermethylation of the promoter and histone deacetylation, and is another mechanism of tumor-suppressor gene inactivation. An epigenetic modification refers to a covalent modification of chromatin, heritable by cell progeny that may involve DNA but does not involve a change in the DNA sequence.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21st edition (Chap. 71, pg no: 501)</p>",

However, some tumors produce or elicit the production of markers that can be measured in the serum or urine, and in a particular patient, rising and falling levels of the marker are usually associated with increasing or decreasing tumor burden, respectively. Some clinically useful tumor markers are shown in Table below. Tumor markers are not in themselves specific enough to permit a diagnosis of malignancy to be made, but once a malignancy has been diagnosed and shown to be associated with elevated levels of a tumor marker, the marker can be used to assess response to treatment. Monoclonal immunoglobulin would be the best tumor marker to assess for response in this patient with multiple myeloma. The complete blood count and its components are not used as tumor markers; neither is lactate dehydrogenase for multiple myeloma.

      "solution": "<p>Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder. The disease is driven by the BCR-ABL1 chimeric gene product, that codes for a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, resulting from a reciprocal balanced translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2), known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). Before the era of selective BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the median survival in CML was 3-7 years, and the 10-year survival rate was 30% or less. Introduced into standard CML therapy in 2000, TKIs have revolutionized the treatment, natural history, and prognosis of CML. Today, the estimated 10-year survival rate with imatinib mesylate, the first BCR-ABL1 TKI approved, is 85%. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), a curative approach but one that involves more risks, is now more often offered as second- or third-line therapy after failure of TKIs. There are no familial associations in CML. CML is not a frequent secondary leukemia following therapy of other cancers with alkylating agents and/or radiation. Exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g., nuclear accidents, radiation treatment for ankylosing spondylitis or cervical cancer) has increased the risk of CML, which peaks at 5-10 years after exposure and is dose related. Most patients with CML (90%) present in the indolent or chronic phase. Depending on the timing of diagnosis, patients are often asymptomatic (if the diagnosis is discovered during health care screening tests). Common symptoms, when present, are manifestations of anemia and splenomegaly. These may include fatigue, malaise, weight loss (if high leukemia burden), or early satiety and left upper quadrant pain or masses (from splenomegaly).</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21st edition Chap. 105, pg no: 819-828</p>",

Up to 50% of patients with allergic rhinitis manifest asthma, whereas 70-80% of individuals with asthma and 80% of individuals with chronic bilateral sinusitis experience allergic rhinitis. Female sex, particulate air pollution exposure, and maternal tobacco smoking increase the risk of developing allergic rhinitis over the life span. Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disease that is not associated with a history of atopy or allergic rhinitis.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21st edition (Chap. 352., pg no:2724)</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has changed dramatically in the last two decades with the development of drugs that modify the disease course of RA. Methotrexate is the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) of first choice for treatment of early RA. Other conventional DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and leflunomide. Leflunomide, an inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis, is efficacious as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate. Hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine are typically reserved for mild disease. The biologic DMARDs have dramatically improved the treatment of RA in the last decade. There are currently five anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, including infliximab, approved for use in patients with RA. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, is approved for refractory RA in combination with methotrexate. It is more efficacious in seropositive than seronegative patients. Other biologics approved for use in RA include anakinra (interleukin [IL]-1 receptor antagonist), abatacept (CD28/CD80/86 antagonist), and tocilizumab (IL-6 antagonist). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including naproxen, were formerly used as core RA therapy. However, they are now used as adjunctive treatment for symptom management. They are not considered DMARDs.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21st edition (Chap.358.Pg no:2761)</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Iodine deficiency is prevalent in many mountainous regions and in central Africa, central South America, and northern Asia. Europe remains mildly iodine deficient, and health surveys indicate that iodine intake has been falling in the United States and Australia. The World Health Organization estimates that about 2 billion people are iodine deficient, based on urinary excretion data. In areas of relative iodine deficiency, there is an increased prevalence of goiter and, when deficiency is severe, hypothyroidism and cretinism. Cretinism is characterized by mental and growth retardation and occurs when children who live in iodine-deficient regions are not treated with iodine or thyroid hormone to restore normal thyroid hormone levels during early life. These children are often born to mothers with iodine deficiency, and it is likely that maternal thyroid hormone deficiency worsens the condition. Concomitant selenium deficiency may also contribute to the neurologic manifestations of cretinism. Iodine supplementation of salt, bread, and other food substances has markedly reduced the prevalence of cretinism. Unfortunately, however, iodine deficiency remains the most common cause of preventable mental deficiency, often because of societal resistance to food additives or the cost of supplementation. In addition to overt cretinism, mild iodine deficiency can lead to subtle reduction of IQ. Oversupply of iodine, through supplements or foods enriched in iodine (e.g., shellfish, kelp), is associated with an increased incidence of autoimmune thyroid disease. The Recommended Daily Allowance is 220 &mu;g iodine per day for pregnant women and 290 &mu;g iodine per day for breastfeeding women. Because the effects of iodine deficiency are most severe in pregnant women and their babies, the American Thyroid Association has recommended that all pregnant and breastfeeding women in the United States and Canada take a prenatal multivitamin containing 150 &mu;g iodine per day.

In addition, adrenal cortical tumors, carcinoid tumors usually of the foregut, meningiomas, facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, and lipomas may also occur in some patients with MEN 1. The prevalence of MEN 1 is ~0.25% based on randomly chosen postmortem studies but is 1-18% among patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, 16-38% among patients with pancreatic islet tumors, and &lt;3% among patients with pituitary tumors. The disorder affects all age groups, with a reported age range of 5-81 years, with clinical and biochemical manifestations developing in the vast majority by the fifth decade. Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs in ~90% of patients and is the most common feature of MEN 1. Patients may have asymptomatic hypercalcemia or vague symptoms associated with hypercalcemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, malaise, or dyspepsia). Nephrolithiasis and osteitis fibrosa cystica (less commonly) may also occur. Biochemical investigations reveal hypercalcemia, usually in association with elevated circulating parathyroid hormone. The incidence of pancreatic islet cell tumors, which are neuroendocrine tumors, in patients with MEN 1 ranges from 30 to 80% in different series. Gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas) are associated with marked gastric acid production and recurrent peptic ulcerations, a combination referred to as the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Gastrinomas occur more often in patients with MEN 1 who are aged &gt;30 years.

Marijuana does not inhibit testosterone synthesis as opposed to ketoconazole, which does. Alcohol, when consumed in excess for prolonged periods, decreases testosterone, independent of liver disease or malnutrition. Systemic disease can cause primary testis dysfunction in addition to suppressing gonadotropin production. In cirrhosis, a combined testicular and pituitary abnormality leads to decreased testosterone production independent of the direct toxic effects of ethanol. The testes are sensitive to radiation damage. Doses &gt;200 mGy (20 rad) are associated with increased follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels and damage to the spermatogonia. After ~800 mGy (80 rad), oligospermia or azoospermia develops, and higher doses may obliterate the germinal epithelium. Permanent androgen deficiency in adult men is uncommon after therapeutic radiation; however, most boys given direct testicular radiation therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia have permanently low testosterone levels.

      "solution": "<p>. (Chap. 414. Pg no:3234) The therapy of hemochromatosis involves removal of the excess body iron and supportive treatment of damaged organs. Iron removal is best accomplished by weekly or twice-weekly phlebotomy of 500 mL. Although there is an initial modest decline in the volume of packed red blood cells to about 35 mL/dL, the level stabilizes after several weeks. The plasma transferrin saturation remains increased until the available iron stores are depleted. In contrast, the plasma ferritin concentration falls progressively, reflecting the gradual decrease in body-iron stores. One 500-mL unit of blood contains 200-250 mg of iron, and &ge;25 g of iron may have to be removed. Therefore, in patients with advanced disease, weekly phlebotomy may be required for 1-2 years, and it should be continued until the serum ferritin level is &le;100 &mu;g/L. Thereafter, phlebotomies are performed at appropriate intervals to maintain ferritin levels at &le;100 &mu;g/L. The</p><p>transferrin saturation fluctuates and may still be elevated but should not dictate further therapy unless it is persistently at 100% when free unbound iron may circulate. Usually one phlebotomy every 3 months will suffice. It is important, however, not to overtreat and render the patient iron deficient. Chelating agents such as deferoxamine, when given parenterally, remove 10-20 mg of iron per day, which is much less than that mobilized by once-weekly phlebotomy. Phlebotomy is also less expensive, more convenient, and safer for most patients. An effective oral iron chelating agent, deferasirox (Exjade), is now available. Alcohol consumption should be severely curtailed or eliminated because it increases the risk of cirrhosis in hereditary hemochromatosis nearly 10-fold. Dietary adjustments are unnecessary, although vitamin C and iron supplements should be avoided. The management of hepatic failure, cardiac failure, and diabetes mellitus is similar to conventional therapy for these conditions. Loss of libido and change in secondary sex characteristics are managed with testosterone replacement or gonadotropin therapy. End-stage liver disease may be an indication for liver transplantation, although results are improved if the excess iron can be removed beforehand.</p><p>Reference: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 21st edition Chap.391.Pg no: 3017</p>",
