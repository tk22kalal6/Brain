It is mostly injured by penetrating injuries but seldom in anterior dislocation of the shoulder or fracture of humerus neck. The nerve supplies coracobrachialis (vestigial), brachialis and biceps brachii. This nerve palsy is generally overlooked as it hardly causes any problems. Sensory loss is ill-defined and even though biceps and brachialis are paralyzed, elbow can still be flexed by a strong brachioradialis.</p><p>ref.fundamentals of orthopedics 1<sup>st</sup> edition page no 211.</p>",

Such cavities are formed in the femoral head and the acetabulum. Eventually, the head or the acetabulum gets partially absorbed. By the constant pull of the muscles acting on the hip, the remaining head of the femur may dislocate from the acetabulum onto the ilium, giving rise to the so-called <em>wandering acetabulum.</em></p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d19tx39t2q3u48.cloudfront.net/QuizDec2022/Orthopedics511012023/44E.png\"><p>Reference. maheshwari ortho 5<sup>th</sup> edition page no 196.</p>",

Biopsy is always taken from the margin of the lesion as the centre of lesion has necrosis and biopsy from the centre will have dead cells only and secondly from margin you can also take normal tissue to compare the affected tissue.</p><p>Reference. maheshwari ortho 5<sup>th</sup> edition page no 243</p>",
