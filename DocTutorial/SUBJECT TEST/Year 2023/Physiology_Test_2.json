The net increase in CO2 naturally results in more acidic blood. The process is reversed when the blood passes through the lung and the additional CO2 is moved from the blood to the alveoli. While it is true that CO2 is released from metabolism that occurs in the tissue (A) and that additional carbamino groups (B) including with hemoglobin (C), none of these are acidic (eg, H+ generating) and thus can be ruled out. The Cl&minus; shift (D) refers to the electroneutral exchange of HCO3&minus; with Cl&minus; across the RBC membrane; this does not alter H+ concentration and can be ruled out</p>",
