      "solution": "<p>MOOREN'S ULCER:</p> <p>Severe inflammatory peripheral ulcerative keratitis, chronic</p> <p>serpigenous or rodent ulcer</p> <p>Treatment:</p> <ol> <li>Topical corticosteroids</li> <li>Immunosuppressives with systemic steroids, e.g. cyclosporine</li> <li>Soft contact lens</li> <li>Lamellar or full thickness corneal grafting</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Wood and Kaufman noted that the two types of Mooren's ulcer they described-one type being unilateral and developing in older patients, and the other type being bilateral in younger patients-respond differently to treatment. The first type tends to heal well after a conjunctival flap procedure or lamellar keratoplasty whereas the second type is not responsive to treatment.</li> <li>Watson described three types of Mooren's ulcer, described above under \"Diagnosis\". While the unilateral form has been said to be readily treatable, other studies have suggested otherwise The suggested treatment for this form involves a trial of aggressive systemic and local immunotherapy (described below), followed by surgical removal of the corneal stroma up to Descemet's membrane.</li> <li>Corneal transplant often fails due to the recurrence of the disease or allograft rejection. Bilateral aggressive Mooren's ulceration can also be treated with aggressive local and systemic immunosuppression. Bilateral indolent Mooren's ulceration often resolves with dietary changes and treatment of any systemic infection that may be present. It can also be treated with local steroids and cyclosporine A</li> <li>The initial treatment of Mooren's ulcer consists of topical corticosteroids. Topical use of 1% or 2% Cyclosporine and interferon alfa 2 a were also suggested for the treatment of Mooren's ulcer.If corticosteroids do not control the inflammation, limbal conjunctival excision can be performed</li> <li>Excision of a 3-4 mm ring of limbal conjunctiva at least 2 clock hours adjacent to a Mooren's ulcer has been shown to be an effective treatment. Studies have shown that when less than half of the limbus is involved, the cure rate after conjunctival excision and corneal ulcer resection is performed is 51.3%. When more than half of the limbus is involved, the cure rate after the procedure decreases to 36.8%. In a 1975 study where limbal conjunctival excision was performed, 8 out of 10 eyes healed, and one developed recurring ulcers which then healed upon re-treatment. It was hypothesized that the limbal conjunctiva may contain antibodies that react with antigens in the corneal stroma in addition to enzymes that destroy the corneal stroma&mdash;therefore, excision may interrupt the disease process.</li> <li>Surgical interventions can also include lamellar keratoplasty, keratoepithelioplasty, delimiting keratotomy, and conjunctival flap and patch grafts using periosteum or fascia lata. Resection of the corneal lesion and adjacent conjunctiva combined with lamellar keratoplasty can achieve a final healing rate of 89.6%. If topical 1% cyclosporine A is added, a 95% final healing rate can be achieved.</li> <li>Cryotherapy to the conjunctiva surrounding ulcers may temporarily halt the progression of the disease, but healing may not occur until the conjunctiva is excised. Other potential local therapies include bandage contact lenses, tissue adhesive, subconjunctival heparin, and artificial tears and collagenase inhibitors. Lecinthinated superoxide dismutase has also been found to decrease epithelial defect size in patients with sterile corneal ulcers that do not respond to conventional therapy in some studies.</li> <li>Systemic immunosuppression using cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or methotrexate can be attempted if conjunctival resection yields no improvement [4][21]. Interferon alpha-2b has been used in patients who had hepatitis C and concomitant Mooren's ulceration. In more aggressive cases, oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine A, and rituximab have also been used with some success.</li> <li>A systematic review performed by Alhassan et al. found that there have not been any randomized controlled trials to compare the various treatment modalities for Mooren's ulcer. The authors recommend that studies measuring outcomes such as the percentage of area healed after treatment and speed of healing are necessary in order to ensure high-quality care for these patients.</li> <li>Complications</li> <li>Figure 7. Perforated Mooren's ulcer with iris herniation. (Reproduced from Chen et al. with permission from the British Journal of Ophthalmology.)</li> <li>In addition to iritis being occasionally associated with Mooren's ulceration, complications can include glaucoma, cataracts, and corneal perforation. Anterior uveitis occurs 6.8% of the time and can involve fine dusty keratic precipitates and posterior synechiae locally. Complicated cataracts can occur in 2.3%. The rate of perforation has varied in different studies in various geographical locations. Perforation (figure 7) occurs most often in the limbal cornea, followed by the peripheral and then central cornea.</li> <li>A study in South India described a perforation rate of 11% at the time of presentation. This rate was higher for patients under 60 years old (27%) and was more likely to occur in patients who had complete peripheral involvement of the corneal ulceration (73% of eyes with complete peripheral ulceration vs. 6% of those with partial peripheral ulceration). Other studies of Mooren's ulcer in South India described perforation rates varying from 0%to 26%. A study of 550 patients in China reported a perforation rate of 13%.</li> <li>A Nigerian study suggested that, in addition to Mooren's ulcer tending to affect more patients in their third and fourth decades of life, the perforation rate in these patients was more than one-third. This study was further supported by another study consisting of 9 patients from West Africa.</li> <li>Another complication that often occurs is post-operative recurrence. Chen and colleagues described a recurrence rate of 25.6% of the time, which can occur between 2 weeks and 15 years postoperatively with 70.2% of recurrences occurring within 2-6 months. In recurrent cases, the first recurrence often occurs in the same location as the original ulcer and the interface of the donor graft and lamellar bed. Multiple recurrences, on the other hand, can occur in originally unaffected areas of the cornea suggesting a difference between the immunological mechanisms of initial and multiple recurrences</li> </ul> <p>Reference: KANSKI'S Clinical Ophthalmology, A Systematic Approach, Ninth Edition, chapter, page number 203-208</p>",

      "solution": "<ul> <li>A Vossius ring is a result of compression of the pigmented posterior iris epithelial cells and/or pupillary ruff against the anterior lens capsule with abrupt blunt force to the eye. Rupture of the cells causes deposition of a circular line of melanin pigment on the lens capsule.</li> <li>The ring of pigment is generally the same diameter as the undilated pupil. Interestingly, when evaluating a series of injured combat soldiers who sustained injury at various times of day and night, Gunderson noted in 1945 that the rings were of fairly uniform in size despite variable pupil size at the time of injury. Although his measurement system was relatively crude (a transparent ruler held close to the cornea while looking through a direct ophthalmoscope with +8.00 sphere), the rings in all of his patients were a consistent 2.25 to 2.75 mm in diameter.</li> <li>Risk Factors</li> </ul> <p>The major risk factor for Vossius ring formation is sudden, blunt trauma to the eye.</p> <ul> <li>Differential diagnosis</li> <li>Anterior lens capsule pigment deposition can be observed in other conditions without a history of trauma and can mimic the appearance of a Vossius ring. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXS) is characterized by a defect in the LOXL-1 gene at locus 15q22, which results in deposition of fibrillar, exfoliative material on the pupillary margin, lens capsule and zonules.</li> <li>The fibrillar material can be differentiated from Vossius ring by absence of trauma by history as well as lack of pigmentation. Additionally, pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is characterized by release of pigment granules by the iris pigment epithelium. The granules distribute throughout the anterior segment including the lens surface where they can form a ring of posterior pigment peripherally known as a Scheie stripe or line. Location of the line, iris transillumination defects and increased pigment on other anterior segment structures differentiates PDS from Vossius ring.</li> <li>Uveitis is another well-known cause of pigment deposition on the lens surface. Intraocular inflammation can result in formation of posterior synechiae. With resolution of inflammation or pharmacologic mydriasis, the synechiae can leave patchy clumps and fragments of pigment on the anterior lens capsule. Uveitis can be distinguished from Vossius ring based on history and presence of other ocular signs of inflammation including cell and flare in the anterior chamber, hypopyon, keratic precipitates, presence of systemic inflammatory disease, etc.</li> </ul> <p>Reference: KANSKI'S Clinical Ophthalmology, A Systematic Approach, Ninth Edition, chapter. 9, page number. 415-419</p>",

This procedure is performed in the operating room.</li> <li>Pars plana vitrectomy with 20 gauge, 23 gauge, 25 gauge, or 27 gauge instruments involves removal of the vitreous by way of cutting the vitreous strands with a vitrectomy machine/handpiece and flattening of the retina through a direct intraocular process.</li> <li>In tractional detachments, tractional elements (usually epiretinal or subretinal membranes) must be relieved. This is typically accomplished with pars plana vitrectomy, but may be combined with scleral buckling as an adjunct.</li> <li>For serous detachments, management is nonsurgical. Any inflammatory disease or underlying mass should be identified and treated if possible.</li> </ul> <p>Reference: KANSKI'S Clinical Ophthalmology, A Systematic Approach, Nichapterh Edition, ch. 14, page number 516-519</p>",

      "solution": "<ul> <li>The electroretinogram (ERG) is a diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to a light stimulus. The ERG arises from currents generated directly by retinal neurons in combination with contributions from retinal glia. Importantly, the ERG is an objective measure of retinal function that can be recorded non-invasively under physiological conditions. ERGs are often recorded using a thin fiber electrode that is placed in contact with the cornea or an electrode that is embedded within a corneal contact lens. These electrodes permit the electrical activity generated by the retina to be recorded at the corneal surface. The ERG can be elicited by diffuse flashes or patterned stimuli. The International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) has introduced standards for the different forms of ERG recordings. The ERG has important clinical utility, in that it provides diagnostic information concerning a variety of inherited and acquired retinal disorders. Moreover, the ERG can be used to monitor disease progression and evaluate retinal toxicity due to various drugs or retained intraocular foreign bodies.</li> <li>Electroretinogram indicates the activity of retinal (esp. rods &amp;cones) function and has no role in assessing the functional integrity of the optic nerve Q. So it can't be abnormal in optic neuritis.in general, optic neuritis is a clinical diagnosis based upon the history and examination findings. Because important findings on funduscopic examination help differentiate typical from atypical cases of optic neuritis, an ophthalmologic examination should be considered an essential feature of the clinical evaluation.</li> <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast provides confirmation of the diagnosis in most cases and also provides an assessment of the risk of subsequent multiple sclerosis (MS).</li> <li>Patients with recurrent or bilateral optic neuritis and those who present with additional neurologic signs or symptoms should undergo further evaluation to determine if the optic neuritis is due to a broader neurologic disease such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease (MOGAD). (See 'Antibody testing' below.)</li> <li>Further diagnostic testing is directed toward excluding other causes of visual loss in atypical cases. (See 'Differential diagnosis' above.)</li> <li>Magnetic resonance imaging - An MRI study of the brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast provides confirmation of the diagnosis of acute demyelinating optic neuritis and important prognostic information regarding the risk of developing MS.</li> <li>Innovations in MRI technology (eg, short tau inversion recovery [STIR], fast spin echo [FSE], and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery with fat suppression techniques [FLAIR], diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) have improved imaging of the optic nerve. Optic nerve inflammation can be demonstrated in approximately 95 percent of patients with optic neuritis with gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbits (image 1) ]. The longitudinal extent of nerve involvement as seen on MRI correlates with visual impairment at presentation and with visual prognosis. Gadolinium enhancement persists for a mean of 30 days since onset.The signal abnormality in the nerve can still be seen after recovery of vision, and is also present in as many as 60 percent of patients with MS who do not have a clinical history of optic neuritis</li> <li>The brain MRI often shows white matter abnormalities characteristic of MS (image 2). Typical lesions are ovoid, periventricular, and larger than 3 mm (see \"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults\", section on 'Lesion characteristics'). The reported prevalence of white matter abnormalities varies substantially among patients with optic neuritis (23 to 75 percent) [42]. In the ONTT, almost 40 percent of patients had MRI lesions, but this trial represents a selected patient group [7]. Small case series of unselected patients have noted a higher coincidence of MRI brain lesions [31,43,44]. Individuals with white matter abnormalities are at a higher risk of developing MS. (See \"Optic neuritis: Prognosis and treatment\".)</li> <li>The yield of spinal cord imaging is low in unselected patients. Among 115 patients presenting with optic neuritis, MRI abnormalities in the spinal cord were seen in only four patients with a normal brain MRI</li> <li>Lumbar puncture - Lumbar puncture is not an essential diagnostic test in optic neuritis but should be considered in atypical cases (eg, those with bilateral presentation, &lt;15 years in age, or symptoms suggesting infection). (See \"Optic neuropathies\", section on 'Infections'.)</li> <li>Approximately 60 to 80 percent of patients with acute optic neuritis have nonspecific abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), including lymphocytes (10 to 100) and elevated protein [43].</li> <li>Other CSF findings in optic neuritis can include [47]:</li> <li>Myelin basic protein in approximately 20 percent</li> <li>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis in 20 to 36 percent</li> <li>Oligoclonal bands (OCB) in 56 to 69 percent</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The presence of OCB implies a higher risk of developing MS. However, since OCB are also associated with white matter lesions on brain MRI, their presence is not clearly of independent prognostic importance [47]. (See \"Optic neuritis: Prognosis and treatment\".)</li> <li>Other testing - When there are relevant clues to an alternative diagnosis (table 2), measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibodies, and angiotensin converting enzyme levels and serologic and CSF tests for Lyme disease and syphilis should be obtained [45,46]. (See \"Optic neuropathies\".)</li> <li>Fluorescein angiography - Fluorescein angiography is not routinely performed in the evaluation of optic neuritis and is often normal. Up to 25 percent demonstrate either dye leakage or perivenous sheathing [12]. These findings may identify patients at somewhat higher risk for developing MS.</li> <li>Visual evoked response - A delay in the P100 of the visual evoked response (VER) is the electrophysiologic manifestation of slowed conduction in the optic nerve as a result of axonal demyelination [48]. This test is not usually helpful in the diagnosis of acute optic neuritis, unless there is a suspicion that the visual loss is functional.</li> <li>Abnormalities in the VER can persist after recovery of full vision. At one year, 80 to 90 percent will be abnormal; 35 percent will return to normal at two years [28,31,32]. The VER is often employed to find evidence of previous, asymptomatic episodes of optic neuritis, but the sensitivity and specificity are imperfect [1].</li> <li>The multifocal VER is a technical advance that appears to be more sensitive and specific for identifying optic neuritis, but this technology is not generally available [1,49].</li> <li>Optical coherence tomography - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures the thickness in the retinal nerve fiber layer and detects thinning in most (85 percent) of patients with optic neuritis [48,50-53]. These abnormalities are also common in patients with MS who do not have a clinical history of optic neuritis [54]. While lower values correlate with impaired visual outcome, the utility of OCT as a prognostic tool is limited in that abnormal values do not show up until early swelling disappears. In one study, OCT was less sensitive than VER in detecting subclinical optic neuritis [55].</li> <li>A number of studies have found that a greater severity of optic nerve injury seen on OCT suggests neuromyelitis optica (NMO) rather than optic neuritis associated with MS [56-58].</li> <li>Antibody testing - Serum NMO antibody testing (both aquaporin-4 autoantibody and MOG antibody) is suggested for individuals with recurrent optic neuritis, particularly if the MRI brain is negative for any abnormal T2/FLAIR lesions outside of the affected optic nerve(s) [59].</li> <li>Patients with recurrent optic neuritis appear to be particularly at risk for NMOSD or MOGAD. This is particularly true for patients with a normal brain MRI and those with optic neuritis events in rapid succession or with a presentation of severe vision loss [60]. In one series of 51 patients with either severe or recurrent optic neuritis, six patients were seropositive for the aquaporin-4-specific serum autoantibody, a sensitive biomarker for NMO, while 10 patients were seropositive for antibodies to MOG, which has also been associated with NMO [61-64]. In other studies, seropositivity for the aquaporin-4-specific serum autoantibody was predictive of subsequent NMO among patients with recurrent optic neuritis [65,66]. MOG antibody testing is recommended for patients with recurrent optic neuritis who test negative for aquaporin-4-specific serum autoantibody.</li> <li>Other features of optic neuritis that suggest MOGAD are papillitis and bilateral, longitudinally extensive enhancement of the optic nerves (especially the anterior segments) and optic nerve sheaths on contrast-enhanced MRI.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Rare patients should be tested for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by measuring GFAP antibodies in the serum and CSF. GFAP astrocytopathy may cause optic neuritis (frequently papillitis) [67]. In addition, patients may present with encephalopathy, headache, or transverse myelitis. The MRI brain with contrast sometimes shows a unique pattern of linear radial enhancement along the perivascular vessels, perpendicular to the lateral ventricles.</li> <li>The clinical features and diagnosis of NMOSDs and MOGAD are discussed in detail separately.

Under examination the retina appears opaque and white in colour in the periphery but the blood vessels are normally seen along with \"cherry red spot\" in the foveal region. This whitening is indicative of cell damage,[3] which occurs in the retinal pigment epithelium and outer segment layer of photoreceptors.[4][5] Damage to the outer segment often results in photoreceptor death through uncertain mechanisms.[6] Usually there is no leakage of fluid and therefore it is not considered a true edema.

      "solution": "<ul> <li>Dry eye syndrome (DES), also known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), is the condition of having dry eyes. Other associated symptoms include irritation, redness, discharge, and easily fatigued eyes. Blurred vision may also occur. Symptoms range from mild and occasional to severe and continuous.] Scarring of the cornea may occur in untreated cases.</li> <li>Dry eye occurs when either the eye does not produce enough tears or when the tears evaporate too quickly. This can result from contact lens use, meibomian gland dysfunction, pregnancy, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, vitamin A deficiency, omega-3 fatty acid deficiency, LASIK surgery, and certain medications such as antihistamines, some blood pressure medication, hormone replacement therapy, and antidepressants.Chronic conjunctivitis such as from tobacco smoke exposure or infection may also lead to the condition. Diagnosis is mostly based on the symptoms, though a number of other tests may be used.</li> <li>Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Artificial tears are usually the first line of treatment. Wrap-around glasses that fit close to the face may decrease tear evaporation. Stopping or changing certain medications may help. The medication ciclosporin or steroid eye drops may be used in some cases[citation needed]. Another option is lacrimal plugs that prevent tears from draining from the surface of the eye. Dry eye syndrome occasionally makes wearing contact lenses impossible.</li> <li>Dry eye syndrome is a common eye disease. It affects 5&ndash;34% of people to some degree depending on the population looked at. Among older people it affects up to 70%.In China it affects about 17% of people.The phrase \"keratoconjunctivitis sicca\" means \"dryness of the cornea and conjunctiva\" in Latin Signs and symptoms</li> <li>Typical symptoms of dry eye syndrome are dryness, burningand a sandy-gritty eye irritation that gets worse as the day goes on. Symptoms may also be described as itchy, stinging or tired eyes. Other symptoms are pain, redness, a pulling sensation, and pressure behind the eye. There may be a feeling that something, such as a speck of dirt, is in the eye. The resultant damage to the eye's surface increases discomfort and sensitivity to bright light. Both eyes usually are affected.</li> <li>There may also be a stringy discharge from the eyes. Although it may seem contradictory, dry eye can cause the eyes to water due to irritation. One may experience excessive tearing such as if something got into the eye. These reflex tears will not necessarily make the eyes feel better since they are the watery tears that are produced in response to injury, irritation, or emotion which lack the lubricating qualities necessary to prevent dry eye.</li> <li>Because blinking coats the eye with tears, symptoms are worsened by activities in which the rate of blinking is reduced due to prolonged use of the eyes. These activities include prolonged reading, computer usage (computer vision syndrome), driving, or watching television.Symptoms increase in windy, dusty or smoky (including cigarette smoke) areas, in dry environments high altitudes including airplanes, on days with low humidity, and in areas where an air conditioner (especially in a car), fan, heater, or even a hair dryer is being used. Symptoms reduce during cool, rainy, or foggy weather and in humid places, such as in the shower.</li> <li>Most people who have dry eyes experience mild irritation with no long-term effects. However, if the condition is left untreated or becomes severe, it can produce complications that can cause eye damage, resulting in impaired vision or (rarely) in the loss of vision.</li> <li>Symptom assessment is a key component of dry eye diagnosis &ndash; to the extent that many believe dry eye syndrome to be a symptom-based disease. Several questionnaires have been developed to determine a score that would allow for a diagnosis. The McMonnies &amp; Ho dry eye questionnaire is often used in clinical studies of dry eyes.</li> </ul> <p>Causes</p> <ul> <li>Any abnormality of any one of the three layers of tears produces an unstable tear film, resulting in symptoms of dry eyes.</li> <li>Increased evaporation</li> <li>The most common cause of dry eye is increased evaporation of the tear film, typically as a result of Meibomian gland dysfunction. The meibomian glands are two sets of oil glands that line the upper and lower eyelids and secrete the oily outer layer of the tear film&mdash;the lipid layer. These glands often become clogged due to inflammation caused by blepharitis and/or rosacea, preventing an even distribution of oil. The result is an unstable lipid layer that leads to increased evaporation of the tear film.[citation needed]</li> <li>In severe cases of MGD, the meibomiam glands can atrophy and cease producing oil entirely.[citation needed]</li> <li>Low humidity</li> <li>Low humidity may cause dry eye syndrome.</li> <li>Decreased tear production</li> <li>Keratoconjunctivitis sicca can be caused by inadequate tear production from lacrimal hyposecretion. The aqueous tear layer is affected, resulting in aqueous tear deficiency (ATD).The lacrimal gland does not produce sufficient tears to keep the entire conjunctiva and cornea covered by a complete layer.This usually occurs in people who are otherwise healthy. Increased age is associated with decreased tearing.This is the most common type found in postmenopausal women.</li> <li>In many cases, aqueous deficient dry eye may have no apparent cause (idiopathic). Other causes include congenital alacrima, xerophthalmia, lacrimal gland ablation, and sensory denervation.In rare cases, it may be a symptom of collagen vascular diseases, including relapsing polychondritis, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Sj&ouml;gren syndrome and other autoimmune diseases are associated with aqueous tear deficiency. Drugs such as isotretinoin, sedatives, diuretics, tricyclic antidepressants, antihypertensives, oral contraceptives, antihistamines, nasal decongestants, beta-blockers, phenothiazines, atropine, and pain relieving opiates such as morphine can cause or worsen this condition.Infiltration of the lacrimal glands by sarcoidosis or tumors, or postradiation fibrosis of the lacrimal glands can also cause this condition.Recent attention has been paid to the composition of tears in normal or dry eye individuals. Only a small fraction of the estimated 1543 proteins in tears are differentially deficient or upregulated in dry eye, one of which is lacritin.Topical lacritin promotes tearing in rabbit preclinical studies.Also, topical treatment of eyes of dry eye mice (Aire knockout mouse model of dry eye) restored tearing, and suppressed both corneal staining and the size of inflammatory foci in lacrimal glands.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Additional causes</li> <li>Excess screen time on computers, smartphones, tablets, or other digital devices can cause dry eye. \"Humans normally blink about 15 times in one minute. However, studies show that we only blink about 5 to 7 times in a minute while using computers and other digital screen devices. Blinking is the eye's way of getting the moisture it needs on its surface.\"</li> <li>Aging is one of the most common causes of dry eyes because tear production decreases with age. Several classes of medications (both prescription and OTC) have been hypothesized as a major cause of dry eye, especially in the elderly. Particularly, anticholinergic medications that also cause dry mouth are believed to promote dry eye.Dry eye may also be caused by thermal or chemical burns, or (in epidemic cases) by adenoviruses. A number of studies have found that diabetics are at increased risk for the disease.</li> </ul>  <ul> <li>About half of all people who wear contact lenses complain of dry eyes. There are two potential connections between contact usage and dry eye. Traditionally, it was believed that soft contact lenses, which float on the tear film that covers the cornea, absorb the tears in the eyes. The connection between a loss in nerve sensitivity and tear production is also the subject of current research.</li> <li>Dry eye also occurs or becomes worse after LASIK and other refractive surgeries, in which the corneal nerves which stimulate tear secretionare cut during the creation of a corneal flap.Dry eye caused by these procedures usually resolves after several months, but it can be permanent. Persons who are thinking about refractive surgery should consider this.</li> <li>An eye injury or other problem with the eyes or eyelids, such as bulging eyes or a drooping eyelid can cause keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Disorders of the eyelid can impair the complex blinking motion required to spread tears.</li> <li>Abnormalities of the mucin tear layer caused by vitamin A deficiency, trachoma, diphtheric keratoconjunctivitis, mucocutaneous disorders and certain topical medications are also causes of keratoconjunctivitis sicca.</li> <li>Persons with keratoconjunctivitis sicca have elevated levels of tear nerve growth factor (NGF). It is possible that this eye's surface NGF plays an important role in ocular surface inflammation associated with dry eyes.</li> </ul> <p>Reference: KANSKI'S Clinical Ophthalmology, A Systematic Approach, Ninth Edition, chapter.12, page number. 324-329</p>",

      "solution": "<ul> <li>The trochlear nerve (/'traklier/),[1] (lit. pulley-like nerve) also known as the fourth cranial nerve, cranial nerve IV, or CN IV, is a cranial nerve that innervates a single muscle - the superior oblique muscle of the eye (which operates through the pulley-like trochlea). Unlike most other cranial nerves, the trochlear nerve is exclusively a motor nerve (somatic efferent nerve).</li> <li>The trochlear nerve is unique among the cranial nerves in several respects:</li> <li>It is the smallest nerve in terms of the number of axons it contains.</li> <li>It has the greatest intracranial length.</li> <li>It is the only cranial nerve that exits from the dorsal (rear) aspect of the brainstem.</li> <li>It innervates a muscle, the superior oblique muscle, on the opposite side (contralateral) from its nucleus. The trochlear nerve decussates within the brainstem before emerging on the contralateral side of the brainstem (at the level of the inferior colliculus). An injury to the trochlear nucleus in the brainstem will result in an contralateral superior oblique muscle palsy, whereas an injury to the trochlear nerve (after it has emerged from the brainstem) results in an ipsilateral superior oblique muscle palsy.</li> <li>The superior oblique muscle which the trochlear nerve innervates ends in a tendon that passes through a fibrous loop, the trochlea, located anteriorly on the medial aspect of the orbit. Trochlea means \"pulley\" in Latin; the fourth nerve is thus also named after this structure.</li> <li>Clinical significance</li> <li>Vertical diplopia</li> </ul> <p>Injury to the trochlear nerve cause weakness of downward eye movement with consequent vertical diplopia (double vision). The affected eye drifts upward relative to the normal eye, due to the unopposed actions of the remaining extraocular muscles. The patient sees two visual fields (one from each eye), separated vertically. To compensate for this, patients learn to tilt the head forward (tuck the chin in) in order to bring the fields back together&mdash;to fuse the two images into a single visual field. This accounts for the \"dejected\" appearance of patients with \"pathetic nerve\" palsies.</p> <ul> <li>Torsional diplopia</li> </ul> <p>Trochlear nerve palsy also affects torsion (rotation of the eyeball in the plane of the face). Torsion is a normal response to tilting the head sideways. The eyes automatically rotate in an equal and opposite direction, so that the orientation of the environment remains unchanged&mdash;vertical things remain vertical.</p> <p>Weakness of intorsion results in torsional diplopia, in which two different visual fields, tilted with respect to each other, are seen at the same time. To compensate for this, patients with trochlear nerve palsies tilt their heads to the opposite side, in order to fuse the two images into a single visual field.</p> <p>The characteristic appearance of patients with fourth nerve palsies (head tilted to one side, chin tucked in) suggests the diagnosis, but other causes must be ruled out. For example, torticollis can produce a similar appearance.</p> <p>Reference: KANSKI'S Clinical Ophthalmology, A Systematic Approach, Ninth Edition, chapter: 13, page number: 447-452</p>",

Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) responses are measured with an EOG test with skin-contact electrodes placed near the canthi. During a recording, the patient's eyes are exposed to standardized stimuli and the resulting signal is displayed showing the time course of the signal's amplitude (voltage). Signals are very small, and typically are measured in microvolts or nanovolts.

      "solution": "<p>Materials</p> <ul> <li>Contact lenses, other than the cosmetic variety, become almost invisible once inserted in the eye. Most corrective contact lenses come with a light \"handling tint\" that renders the lens slightly more visible on the eye. Soft contact lenses extend beyond the cornea, their rim sometimes visible against the sclera.</li> <li>Rigid lenses</li> <li>Glass lenses were never comfortable enough to gain widespread popularity. The first lenses to do so were those made from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA or Perspex/Plexiglas), now commonly referred to as \"hard\" lenses. Their main disadvantage is they do not allow oxygen to pass through to the cornea, which can cause a number of adverse, and often serious, clinical events. Starting in the late 1970s, improved rigid materials which were oxygen-permeable were developed. Contact lenses made from these materials are called rigid gas permeable lenses or 'RGPs'.</li> <li>A rigid lens is able to cover the natural shape of the cornea with a new refracting surface. This means that a spherical rigid contact lens can correct corneal astigmatism. Rigid lenses can also be made as a front-toric, back-toric, or bitoric. Rigid lenses can also correct corneas with irregular geometries, such as those with keratoconus or post surgical ectasias. In most cases, patients with keratoconus see better through rigid lenses than through glasses. Rigid lenses are more chemically inert, allowing them to be worn in more challenging environments where chemical inertia is important compared to soft lenses.[59]</li> <li>Soft lenses</li> </ul> <p>See also: List of soft contact lens materials</p> <ul> <li>Soft lenses are more flexible than rigid lenses, and can be gently rolled or folded without damaging the lens. While rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before comfort is achieved, new soft lens wearers typically report lens awareness rather than pain or discomfort.</li> <li>Hydrogel lenses rely on their water content to transmit oxygen through the lens to the cornea. As a result, higher water content lenses allowed more oxygen to the cornea. In 1998, silicone hydrogel, or Si-hy lenses became available. These materials have both the extremely high oxygen permeability of silicone and the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels. Because silicone allows more oxygen permeability than water, oxygen permeability of silicone hydrogels is not tied to the lenses' water content. Lenses have now been developed with so much oxygen permeability that they are approved for overnight wear (extended wear). Lenses approved for daily wear are also available in silicone hydrogel materials.[60]</li> <li>Disadvantages of silicone hydrogels are that they are slightly stiffer and the lens surface can be hydrophobic, thus less \"wettable\" &ndash; factors that can influence comfort of lens use. New manufacturing techniques and changes to multipurpose solutions have minimized these effects. Those new techniques are often broken down into 3 generations:[35][61]</li> <li>1st generation (plasma coating): A surface modification process called plasma coating alters the lens surface's hydrophobic nature;</li> <li>2nd generation (wetting agents): Another technique incorporates internal rewetting agents to make the lens surface hydrophilic;</li> <li>3rd generation (inherently wettable): A third process uses longer backbone polymer chains that results in less cross linking and increased wetting without surface alterations or additive agents.</li> <li>Current brands of soft lenses are either traditional hydrogel or silicone hydrogel. Because of drastic differences in oxygen permeability, replacement schedule, and other design characteristics, it is very important to follow the instructions of the eye care professional prescribing the lenses.</li> </ul> <p>Hybrid</p> <ul> <li>A small number of hybrid lenses exist. Typically these contact lenses consist of a rigid center and a soft \"skirt\". A similar technique is the \"piggybacking\" of a smaller, rigid lens on the surface of a larger, soft lens. These techniques are often chosen to give the vision correction benefits of a rigid lens and the comfort of a soft lens.[62]</li> </ul> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number: 139-142</p>",

      "solution": "<ul> <li>Astigmatism is a type of refractive error due to rotational asymmetry in the eye's refractive power. This results in distorted or blurred vision at any distance. Other symptoms can include eyestrain, headaches, and trouble driving at night.Astigmatism often occurs at birth and can change or develop later in life.If it occurs in early life and is left untreated, it may result in amblyopia.</li> <li>The cause of astigmatism is unclear; however, it is believed to be partly related to genetic factors.The underlying mechanism involves an irregular curvature of the cornea and protective reaction changes in the lens of the eye, called lens astigmatism, that has the same mechanism as spasm of accommodation.Diagnosis is by an eye examination called autorefractor keratometry (objective, allows to see lens and cornea components of astigmatism) and subjective refraction. But subjective methods are almost always inaccurate if lens astigmatism is not fully removed first with a week of eye drops.</li> <li>Three treatment options are available: glasses, contact lenses, and surgery.Glasses are the simplest. Contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision and less artifacts than even double aspheric lenses.Refractive surgery permanently changes the shape of the eye and thereby cures astigmatism.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>In Europe and Asia, astigmatism affects between 30% and 60% of adults.[4] People of all ages can be affected by astigmatism. Astigmatism was first reported by Thomas Young in 1801.</li> </ul> <p>Signs and symptoms</p> <ul> <li>Although astigmatism may be asymptomatic, higher degrees of astigmatism may cause symptoms such as blurred vision, double vision, squinting, eye strain, fatigue, or headaches.[7] Some research has pointed to the link between astigmatism and higher prevalence of migraine headaches.</li> </ul> <p>Axis of the principal meridian</p> <ul> <li>Regular astigmatism - principal meridians are perpendicular. (The steepest and flattest meridians of the eye are called principal meridians.)</li> <li>With-the-rule astigmatism - the vertical meridian is steepest (a rugby ball or American football lying on its side).</li> <li>Against-the-rule astigmatism - the horizontal meridian is steepest (a rugby ball or American football standing on its end).</li> <li>Oblique astigmatism - the steepest curve lies in between 120 and 150 degrees and 30 and 60 degrees.</li> <li>Irregular astigmatism - principal meridians are not perpendicular.</li> <li>In with-the-rule astigmatism, the eye has too much \"plus\" cylinder in the horizontal axis relative to the vertical axis (i.e., the eye is too \"steep\" along the vertical meridian relative to the horizontal meridian). Vertical beams of light focus in front (anterior) to horizontal beams of light, in the eye. This problem may be corrected using spectacles which have a \"minus\" cylinder placed on this horizontal axis. The effect of this will be that when a vertical beam of light in the distance travels towards the eye, the \"minus\" cylinder (which is placed with its axis lying horizontally - meaning in line with the patient's horizontal meridian relative to the excessively steep vertical meridian) will cause this vertical beam of light to slightly \"diverge\", or \"spread out vertically\", before it reaches the eye. This compensates for the fact that the patient's eye converges light more powerfully in the vertical meridian than the horizontal meridian. Hopefully, after this, the eye will focus all light on the same location at the retina, and the patient's vision will be less blurred.[medical citation needed]</li> <li>In against-the-rule astigmatism, a plus cylinder is added in the horizontal axis (or a minus cylinder in the vertical axis).[18]</li> <li>Axis is always recorded as an angle in degrees, between 0 and 180 degrees in a counter-clockwise direction. Both 0 and 180 degrees lie on a horizontal line at the level of the center of the pupil, and as seen by an observer, 0 lies on the right of both the eyes.[medical citation needed]</li> <li>Irregular astigmatism, which is often associated with prior ocular surgery or trauma, is also a common naturally occurring condition.[clarification needed][19] The two steep hemimeridians of the cornea, 180&deg; apart in regular astigmatism, may be separated by less than 180&deg; in irregular astigmatism (called nonorthogonal irregular astigmatism); and/or the two steep hemimeridians may be asymmetrically steep-that is, one may be significantly steeper than the other (called asymmetric irregular astigmatism). Irregular astigmatism is quantified by a vector calculation called topographic disparity.[20]</li> </ul> <p>Focus of the principal meridian</p> <ul> <li>With accommodation relaxed:</li> </ul> <p>Simple astigmatism</p> <p>Simple hyperopic astigmatism - first focal line is on the retina, while the second is located behind the retina.</p> <p>Simple myopic astigmatism - first focal line is in front of the retina, while the second is on the retina.</p> <p>Compound astigmatism</p> <p>Compound hyperopic astigmatism - both focal lines are located behind the retina.</p> <p>Compound myopic astigmatism - both focal lines are located in front of the retina.</p> <p>Mixed astigmatism - focal lines are on both sides of the retina (straddling the retina).</p> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number: 156-161</p>",

A tessellated appearance corresponding to irregular distribution of RPE atrophy and variable light reflection may be appreciated even in young patients with high myopia. When RPE attenuation surrounds the optic disc, this hypo-pigmented finding is described as peri-papillary atrophy.</li> <li>Commonly the optic disc has an oval appearance en-face and is referred to as a tilted disc. The optic nerve appears to insert into the elongated globe at an angle. The tilted appearance is characterized by temporal flattening of the disc due in part to peri-papillary scleral expansion. As a result, a hypo-pigmented myopic crescent or myopic cone is seen where sclera is directly visible. In intermediate disease, choroidal vessels will be seen more prominently beneath the atrophic RPE. However, with progressive disease the choroid itself also atrophies and the choroidal vessels may become less noticeable.</li> <li>Lacquer cracks are irregular yellow-appearing bands often seen in the posterior pole and are present in 4.2% of eyes with an axial length of at least 26.5mm.[2] These represent breaks in Bruch's membrane and may be foci of future choroidal neovascularization (CNV). It has been reported that among patients with lacquer cracks, 29.4% eventually develop CNV.

      "solution": "<p>Ans. A, B and C</p> <ul> <li>as been said \"when you see a child suffering from a severe form of vernal keratoconjunctivitis, you instantly feel the dearth in knowledge of its pathogenesis that prevents you from adequately treating the signs and symptoms that will most likely ruin his childhood.\"1 The term \"morning misery\" captures the discomfort, blepharospasm, and mucous discharge often manifesting in these patients upon awakening.2</li> <li>The first description of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) was by Arlt in 1846 when he reported 3 cases of perilimbal swelling in young patients. Nine years later, Desmarres described the limbal findings now attributed to VKC in \"slightly lymphatic children\" who were very photophobic. In 1871, von Graefe added \"pavement-like granulations of the conjunctiva\" to the clinical picture. The association with springtime (vernal means spring) reflects the seasonal increase in signs and symptoms of the condition, particularly the high prevalence in hot, arid environments; affected individuals have disease flares frequently during spring months, but can have signs and symptoms year round.</li> </ul> <p>Symptoms</p> <ul> <li>Patients with VKC generally present in early to mid-childhood. Symptoms consist predominantly of eye itching, along with tearing, discharge, irritation, redness, blepharospasm, and photophobia.7 The photophobia can be quite severe, with patients frequently presenting in dark sunglasses and hats. Their strong aversion to bright lights renders slit lamp exams challenging, if not altogether impossible.</li> </ul> <p>Signs</p> <ul> <li>Clinically, VKC can be divided into 3 subtypes: conjunctival, limbal, and mixed presentations. Disease severity seems milder in limbal VKC, leading some to suspect that it is the early presentation of a spectrum of disease.8 However, there appears to be variability in the prevalence of certain types, based on geography and atopic history, which suggests that the pathogenesis of the two types may be different.</li> <li>On external examination, the lids can be erythematous and thickened; a reactive ptosis may be present due to photosensitivity (Fig. 1). The classic finding of giant papillae (&gt; 1 mm diameter) is located most commonly on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Lid eversion must be performed in order to visualize them (Fig. 2). The tarsal conjunctiva develops a cobblestone appearance and, in active disease, can have mucus accumulation between the papillae. In the limbal form, the conjunctiva may show a fine papillary reaction. Here the predominant findings are gelatinous limbal papillae associated with epithelial infiltrates called Horner-Trantas dots (Fig. 3).</li> </ul> <p>Treatment</p> <ul> <li>The management of VKC lends itself to a stepwise sequence based on disease severity (Table 1). Symptoms of itching, burning, and irritation can be managed with cool compresses and saline rinses. Preservative-free artificial tears can be used liberally. These simple measures are reported by patients to provide significant symptomatic relief.</li> <li>Among topical medications, antihistamines (levocabastine 0.05%, emedastine 0.05%) and mast cell stabilizers (sodium cromoglycate 2%-4%, lodoxamide 0.1%) appear to provide some comfort. Interestingly, despite the major role of histamine in this disease, antihistamines alone have not proven overwhelmingly successful. For instance, topical levocabastine was found to be inferior to lodoxamide in alleviating ocular symptoms and signs such as itching, tearing, and photophobia.14 Dual-acting agents with activity against H1 receptors and mast cell degranulation (olopatadine 0.1%) have been very successful in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and are used in cases of VKC.</li> <li>Topical acetylcysteine 5%-10% has been used to reduce mucus adherence to the cornea during exacerbations. Other agents that have been tried with varying degrees of efficacy in a limited number of studies include mitomycin-C and ketorolac.15, 16</li> <li>Corticosteroids are very effective, particularly in quieting disease exacerbations. However, their side-effect profile (cataract, glaucoma, herpetic infection) renders them an unpopular selection for long-term management. Use of antihistamine/mast cell stabilizers as maintenance therapy and then pulse therapy with topical steroids during disease exacerbations is a common practice. Prednisolone, fluorometholone, and dexamethasone have been selected for this purpose. With adequate monitoring, this is acceptable. However, loteprednol &ndash; an agent with less of an effect on intraocular pressure - has been found to be just as effective as prednisolone in VKC.17</li> <li>With their ability to inhibit T-cell activation, interest in the efficacy of cyclosporine A and tacrolimus has emerged. Significant improvement has been reported using 2% formulations of cyclosporine, response was rapid but did reoccur after cessation of the drop. Use is safe in children and adverse reactions are primarily limited to stinging with installation.18 Lower strength formulations (cyclosporine 0.05%) appear to be effective, although more expensive.19 Use of topical tacrolimus has shown promise, with studies reporting impressive and rapid reduction in the size of the giant papillae. It also appeared to be more easily tolerated than cyclosporine in its side-effect profile.18</li> <li>It is rare that VKC patients require a surgical approach. Surgical removal of corneal plaque is recommended only in severe, persistent cases to allow corneal re-epithelialization. Giant papillae excision with intraoperative mitomycin-C may be considered with severe mechanical ptosis and large, coarse papillae with corneal changes.1</li> </ul> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number 327-329</p>",

It is typically due to neonatal bacterial infection, although can also be non-infectious (e.g. chemical exposure).[1] Infectious neonatal conjunctivitis is typically contracted during vaginal delivery from exposure to bacteria from the birth canal, most commonly Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.[2]</li> <li>Antibiotic ointment is typically applied to the newborn's eyes within 1 hour of birth as prevention for gonococcal ophthalmia.[3] This practice is recommended for all newborns and most hospitals in the United States are required by state law to apply eye drops or ointment soon after birth to prevent the disease.[4][5]</li> <li>If left untreated, neonatal conjunctivitis can cause blindness.</li> <li>Signs and symptoms</li> </ul> <p>Neonatal conjunctivitis by definition presents during the first month of life.

Thus, prophylaxis with a 1% silver nitrate solution is no longer in common use.[6] In most countries, neomycin and chloramphenicol eye drops are used, instead.[7][8] However, newborns can develop neonatal conjunctivitis due to reactions with chemicals in these common eye drops.[9] Additionally, a blocked tear duct may be another noninfectious cause of neonatal conjunctivitis.[citation needed]</p> <ul> <li>Infectious</li> </ul> <p>The two most common infectious causes of neonatal conjunctivitis are N. gonorrheae and Chlamydia, typically acquired from the birth canal during delivery. However, other different bacteria and viruses can be the cause, including herpes simplex virus (HSV 2), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.[citation needed]</p> <ul> <li>Ophthalmia neonatorum due to gonococci (N. gonorrhoeae) typically manifests in the first 5 days after birth and is associated with marked bilateral purulent discharge and local inflammation. In contrast, conjunctivitis secondary to infection with C. trachomatis produces conjunctivitis 3 days to 2 weeks after delivery. The discharge is usually more watery in nature (mucopurulent) and less inflamed. Babies infected with chlamydia may develop pneumonitis (chest infection) at a later stage (range 2&ndash;19 weeks after delivery). Infants with chlamydia pneumonitis should be treated with oral erythromycin for 10&ndash;14 days.</li> </ul> <p>Diagnosis is performed after taking swab from the infected conjunctivae.[citation needed]</p> <p>Prevention</p> <ul> <li>Antibiotic ointment is typically applied to the newborn's eyes within 1 hour of birth as prevention against gonococcal ophthalmia.This may be erythromycin, tetracycline, or rarely silver nitrate or Argyrol (mild silver protein).</li> </ul> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number 247-251</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Ans. Secondary cataract</p> <ul> <li>The pathophysiology of PCO is multifactorial. During routine phacoemulsification surgery, the surgeon excises a portion of the anterior capsule (capsulorrhexis), removes the cataractous lens material, and then implants a synthetic lens into the intact capsular bag. PCO occurs when residual LECs on the residual anterior capsule undergo three phenomena: proliferation, migration toward the posterior capsule, and normal and abnormal differentiation[1]. The accumulated LECs result in opacification of the intact posterior lens capsule, with resultant negative effects on vision.</li> <li>Multiple cytokines and growth factors, including transforming growth factor &beta; (TGF-&beta;), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and hepatocyte growth factor (HFG), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMOs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PCO. Exogenous hyaluronic acid (HA), a component of some viscoelastic substances used during cataract surgery, may result in increased rates of ex vivo PCO[13].</li> <li>PCO has two forms, fibrous and pearl (also referred to as proliferative). Fibrous PCO occurs due to abnormal proliferation of LECs, and presents as wrinkles and folds on the posterior capsule at the site of fusion of the anterior and posterior capsules. Histological examination reveals extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and elongated fibroblast cells[14]. Pearl PCO is responsible for the majority of PCO-related visual loss. Pearl PCO is composed of normally differentiated LECs that line the equatorial lens region.

The diagnosis of PCO is clinical, based on history and slit lamp examination of the eye.</li> </ul> <p>History and Symptoms</p> <ul> <li>Most patients present between months up to several years following uneventful cataract extraction[1]. Patients may complain of decreased vision, blurred vision, glare, light sensitivity, impaired contrast sensitivity, halos around lights, or difficulty reading.</li> </ul> <p>Signs</p> <ul> <li>If PCO involves the visual axis, patients typically present with decreased visual acuity. Slit lamp examination reveals a semi-opaque membrane with variable levels of fibrosis forming on the posterior capsule. Other notable signs include:</li> <li>Elschnig's pearls: seen in pearl-type PCO, in which clusters of residual LECs appear as round, clear \"pearls\" that shine on retro-illumination. If these accumulate on the visual axis, they can cause decreased visual acuity.</li> <li>Soemmering rings: rings of residual LECs and cortical fibers that form between the posterior capsule and the edges of the anterior capsule remnant. These are often too peripheral to cause visual symptoms, but they can cause glare and visual loss if severe.</li> </ul> <p>Capsular wrinkling</p> <p>Management</p> <ul> <li>PCO causing visual disturbance is most commonly treated in older children and adults with neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy. Rarely, it is treated with surgical capsulotomy. Although non-invasive, quick, and effective, Nd:YAG capsulotomy is not without significant risk and expense, and may not be available in large parts of the developing world. Complications are uncommon but may include retinal detachment, IOL damage, cystoid macular edema, increased intraocular pressure, iris hemorrhage, corneal edema, IOL subluxation, iritis, macular hole, corneal endothelial cell loss, and exacerbation of localized endophthalmitis Rarely, patients may develop re-opacification and require a second laser treatment. The estimated annual cost of Nd:YAG capsulotomy in the United States alone has been estimated at $250 million (for 1 million patients with PCO)</li> <li>In younger children who cannot be safely treated with Nd:YAG capsulotomy, visual axis obscuration due to PCO can be treated with pars plana vitrectomy and capsulectomy</li> <li>Various pharmacological and immunological methods to treat PCO are under investigation, but in vivo studies have not yet shown conclusive efficacy or safety of these modalities.</li> </ul> <p>Prevention</p> <ul> <li>Despite the ability to effectively treat PCO with Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy, the potential complications and significant cost of treatment makes PCO prevention an important goal. Additionally, as new, accommodating IOLs that rely on flexible and intact posterior capsules become available, the prevention of PCO formation will gain further importance. Many studies have attempted to identify interventions that delay or inhibit PCO formation.These interventions include surgical techniques, IOL design and material, and pharmacological interventions</li> </ul> <p>Surgical technique</p> <ul> <li>Several surgical techniques have been studied with the aim of decreasing the incidence of PCO. These techniques include:</li> <li>Thorough cortical clean-up with irrigation, aspiration, and/or manual polishing of the capsule. This in an attempt to remove all LECs remaining in the capsule bag, and in some studies has been shown to have a significant effect on the development of PCO.</li> <li>Hydrodissection-enhanced cortical clean-up. Hydrodissection is a technique that weakens capsular-cortical connections in order to enhance cortical clean-up.</li> <li>In-the-bag capsular fixation of the optic and haptic. This enhances the barrier effect of the IOL optic.</li> <li>Continuous circular capsulorhexis diameter slightly smaller than the IOL optic. Capsulorhexis edge on the IOL surface. This technique creates a \"shrink-wrap\" effect of the anterior capsule over the IOL optic. This sequesters the optic from the aqueous humor surrounding the capsule, preventing the potentially harmful effect of macromolecules and inflammatory mediators within the aqueous.</li> <li>Broad adhesion of the IOL to the posterior capsule. This is another form of the \"shrink-wrap effect\" in order to minimize LEC migration by creating a tight fit of the posterior capsule against the back of the IOL optic.</li> <li>Intraocular lens design and material</li> <li>A square, truncated optic edge IOL design has demonstrated decreased PCO rates and improved visual outcomes compared to a soft, round optic edge IOL design. This is thought to be due to a mechanical barrier effect of the optic edge, preventing LEC growth over the posterior capsule. At this time, it is unclear whether differences in the IOL loops (haptics) design play a role in PCO development.</li> <li>Widely used IOL materials include high water content hydrophilic acrylic, low water content hydrophobic acrylic, and hydrophobic silicone hydrogel. Although some studies have suggested that the use of hydrophobic IOL material decreases PCO formation, meta-analysis has not demonstrated such an effect.</li> </ul> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number: 264-268</p>",

      "solution": "<ul> <li>Eyelid and ocular surface microflora have been implicated as the source of infection in most cases of postoperative endophthalmitis. Because bacteria can be cultured from the ocular surface of almost any person, certain risk factors may make patients more susceptible to infection by their ocular surface microflora. Risk factors for endophthalmitis include chronic bacterial blepharitis, active conjunctivitis, infections of the lacrimal drainage system, tear drainage obstruction, contaminated eye drops, contact lens wear, prosthesis in the fellow eye, and active nonocular infections. These conditions may lead to an abnormally elevated population of ocular surface microbes or colonization of the ocular surface by atypical organisms with greater virulence than the normal microflora. Host factors that lower resistance to infection such as chronic immunosuppressive therapy and diabetes mellitus have also been reported to be significant risk factors for postoperative endophthalmitis.</li> <li>To reduce the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis, each of the factors implicated in the pathogenesis should be addressed. First, an attempt should be made to decrease or eliminate eyelid and conjunctival microflora both preoperatively and intraoperatively. This goal may be accomplished using preoperative topical antibiotics and topical antiseptic agents. Second, administering subconjunctival antibiotic at the time of surgery should be considered.</li> <li>Studies evaluating the effectiveness of preoperative administration of antibiotics and povidone-iodine have reported a significant decrease in conjunctival bacterial colony counts. Topical antibiotics were reported to be most effective in decreasing conjunctival bacterial colony counts when administered 2 h before surgery rather than one or more days before surgery. The combination of topical antibiotics and povidone-iodine was found to sterilize the conjunctiva in more than 80% of treated patients.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Subconjunctival antibiotics are commonly administered after intraocular surgery. The rationale for subconjunctival antibiotic administration at the completion of the ocular procedure is to inhibit growth of bacteria that may gain entry into the eye during the operative procedure. Studies performed evaluating the effectiveness of prophylactic subconjunctival antibiotics in reducing the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis reported conflicting results. Administering antibiotics in the irrigating fluid for cataract surgery has become a common technique for infection prophylaxis. This technique carries the risks of antibiotic toxicity, cost, and the possibility of the emergence of resistant bacteria.</li> <li>The various strategies to prevent postoperative endophthalmitis are based on current knowledge regarding the pathogenic mechanisms of postoperative endophthalmitis. Perhaps of greatest importance, the preoperative ocular examination will help to identify the high-risk patient as previously described. In these patients, eyelid and conjunctival cultures can be performed before performing intraocular surgery. Based on the culture results and the overall clinical evaluation, preoperative topical antibiotic treatment may be considered. In patients with eye diseases requiring chronic administration of topical medications, new sterile medications should be provided to the patient before and after intraocular surgery.</li> <li>On the day of cataract surgery, treating patients with prophylactic topical antibiotics that have activity against organisms commonly causing endophthalmitis can be considered. A thorough surgical prep, which includes lid margins, is performed. Instillation of 5% povidone-iodine on the conjunctiva followed by irrigation with saline is part of the surgical prep. The eyelids and eyelashes can be draped out of the surgical field with a plastic eye drape. A dry surgical field can be maintained when instruments are passed in and out of the eye. Attention to watertight wound closure is a priority, particularly in complicated surgical procedures or in reoperations that tend to have a higher incidence of postoperative wound leak. Vitreous incarceration in the wound should be eliminated by anterior vitrectomy techniques. At the conclusion of surgery, subconjunctival antibiotic injection using a combination of agents effective against the majority of causative Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms can be considered.</li> </ul> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, pqge number: 297-302</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Management</p> <ul> <li>Treat the underlying etiology as soon as possible.</li> </ul> <p>General treatment</p> <ul> <li>If the retina can be adequately visualized and the etiology of the vitreous hemorrhage can be determined, treatment of the underlying cause may be attempted, if needed.</li> <li>If the retina can be adequately visualized and the etiology of the vitreous hemorrhage can be determined, but the vitreous hemorrhage does not permit safe treatment of the underlying etiology, pars plana vitrectomy is indicated. A short period of cautious observation for vitreous clearing may be reasonable. For example, occasionally a retinal tear associated with vitreous hemorrhage can be seen with a bright indirect ophthalmoscope, but adequate uptake of laser spots to the posterior margin of the break cannot be achieved. Red laser may be tried in such cases as it has better penetration. Cryotherapy can be considered in these cases, but the dual risk of cryotherapy and vitreous hemorrhage potentially leading to proliferative vitreoretinopathy should be considered compared to the risk of pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser.</li> <li>If the retina cannot be adequately visualized in 360 degrees and the etiology of the vitreous hemorrhage is unknown, prompt pars plana vitrectomy is indicated. Again, a short period of cautious observation for vitreous clearing may be reasonable. For example, in a case of a superior retinal tear with dense vitreous hemorrhage, adequate treatment of the superior retinal tear may be achieved. However, undetected inferior retinal breaks may be present. Between office visits, retinal detachment may progress underneath vitreous hemorrhage without a change in the patient's symptoms. Therefore, if the view is not clearing briskly, pars plana vitrectomy is indicated. Neovascularization of the iris or angle in the setting of new dense vitreous hemorrhage would prompt earlier surgical intervention.</li> <li>Diabetics frequently present with vitreous hemorrhage, and in general the same principles apply as outlined above. Of note, new vitreous hemorrhage in diabetics cannot always be assumed to be secondary to diabetic retinopathy if there is an inadequate view; diabetics are susceptible to retinal tears and detachments like the general population. The severity of the fellow eye may give a clue as to the etiology of the vitreous hemorrhage, but asymmetric levels of retinopathy are relatively common. In any case, diabetic patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, new vitreous hemorrhage prohibiting adequate panretinal photocoagulation, and no history of panretinal photocoagulation benefit from pars plana vitrectomy with intra-operative panretinal photocoagulation or intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection. In this scenario, if the vitreous hemorrhage does not clear in about one month, many surgeons will perform pars plana vitrectomy. However, in the case of an established patient with known proliferative diabetic retinopathy and known panretinal photocoagulation, a new or recurrent vitreous hemorrhage is far more likely to be secondary to diabetes than a retinal tear. Longer periods of observation (3 to 6 months) before considering pars plana vitrectomy may be reasonable in these situations.</li> </ul> <p>As always, individual situations, patient wishes, and surgeon judgment are paramount.</p> <p>Medical therapy</p> <ul> <li>Patients are instructed to minimize strenuous activity, as an increase in blood pressure may disrupt the newly formed clot and cause new active bleeding. Patients are also instructed to keep their head of bed elevated to allow settling of the blood, improving their vision and permitting more complete fundoscopic examination. Bilateral patching and bedrest may facilitate settling of blood. However, the patches must be removed immediately before examination or treatment, as normal eye movements quickly disperse the hemorrhage again. For this reason and its inconvenience to patients, bilateral patching is infrequently attempted.</li> <li>Neovascularization from proliferative retinopathy, associated with diabetes or otherwise, is often treated with panretinal photocoagulation if the view is adequate. This will cause regression of neovascularization and help reduce the risk of further hemorrhage.</li> <li>Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents may be used to cause regression of neovascularization in proliferative retinopathies, particularly if there is no view to perform panretinal photocoagulation. Bhavsar et al. compared the use of ranibizumab with saline injected intravitreally for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy-associated vitreous hemorrhage in a randomized trial, and found that there seemed to be no difference in vitrectomy rates at 16 weeks between the two groups. Of note, the recent Protocol S data from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) compared the use of panretinal photocoagulation versus intravitreal ranibizumab for proliferative diabetic retinopathy; at five years, the rates of vitreous hemorrhage were similar (nearly 50%) in both groups. Additionally, there is anecdotal evidence that anti-VEGF injection may worsen tractional retinal detachment as neovascular membranes contract, so the the potential risks and benefits should be considered in this setting. Recently, the initial results from Protocol AB from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Retina Network evaluated 100 patients with vitreous hemorrhage from proliferative diabetic retinopathy initially treated with aflibercept vs. 105 patients with vitreous hemorrhage initially treated with pars plana vitrectomy with laser photocoagulation. At 24 weeks, there was no statistically difference in the primary outcome of mean visual acuity letter score between the vitrectomy and aflibercept cohorts, although the vitrectomy group showed a faster visual recovery. Approximately one-third of patients in the aflibercept cohort required vitrectomy during follow-up compared with 8% of the patients in the vitrectomy/laser cohort.</li> <li>Many surgeons use pre-operative anti-VEGF agents 1 to 7 days before pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage in diabetics, as regression of neovascular membranes reduces intra- and post-operative bleeding and dissection of tissue may become easier. Several small studies support this belief although other small studies refute it. There is concern, however, that these patients frequently fail their pre-anesthesia testing and that their surgery may be cancelled after the anti-VEGF agent has been given, potentially exacerbating tractional retinal detachment. For this reason, many surgeons wait until the patient is medically cleared for surgery before giving the anti-VEGF agent.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF agent is usually indicated when the cause of vitreous hemorrhage is neovascular age-related macular degeneration.</li> <li>The Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study showed that aspirin did not increase risk of vitreous hemorrhage, and no anticoagulant has been definitively shown to increase risk of vitreous hemorrhage. One report showed that patients taking aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin who develop an acute PVD are more likely to develop a vitreous hemorrhage, although the difference was small. Most clinicians do not recommend discontinuation of anticoagulation with the goal of resolving a vitreous hemorrhage, especially when the anticoagulation is medically indicated.</li> </ul> <p>Medical follow up</p> <ul> <li>Patients with systemic causes of vitreous hemorrhage are followed closely by an internist or endocrinologist in addition to close ophthalmology follow up.</li> </ul> <p>Surgery</p> <ul> <li>Pars plana vitrectomy is indicated for vitreous hemorrhage accompanied by retinal detachment or break seen on B-scan, nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage, many cases of intraocular foreign body, vitreous hemorrhage with iris neovascularization or associated with hemolytic or ghost-cell glaucoma. Pars plana vitrectomy is also indicated in cases of dense vitreous hemorrhage of unknown etiology. In these cases, pars plana vitrectomy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Depending on the etiology of vitreous hemorrhage, endolaser may also be placed intraoperatively.</li> <li>Some surgeons will also perform a concurrent air-fluid exchange after the vitrectomy or may even inject intravitreal anti-VEGF at the conclusion of case, but there is no substantial evidence that this prevents post-operative recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, a frustrating occurrence seen in some patients, especially diabetic patients.</li> <li>In cases of open globe injury with vitreous hemorrhage but without intraocular foreign body, most surgeons close the eyewall first and address the vitreous hemorrhage as a second stage procedure.</li> </ul> <p>Surgical follow up</p> <ul> <li>Frequency of follow up is specific to the surgical indication.</li> </ul> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number: 261-263</p>",

      "solution": "<ul> <li>Eales' disease was first described by British ophthalmologist Henry Eales in 1880.Eales&rsquo; disease is an idiopathic occlusive vasculitis involving the mid-peripheral retina that is characterized by retinal venous inflammation (periphlebitis), vascular occlusion, and subsequent retinal neovascularization. A hallmark of Eales&rsquo; disease is recurrent vitreous hemorrhage.</li> </ul> <p>Epidemiology</p> <ul> <li>Eales' disease mainly affects young males in their second decade of life.It is more prevalent in India and Middle Eastern countries with cases observed worldwide.4 In a study by Biwas et al., a male-to-female ratio of 20:1 was observed with a mean age at presentation of 29.9 years, with a range from 11&ndash; 59 years.</li> </ul> <p>Etiology</p> <ul> <li>No definite cause for Eales disease has been found to date and it is considered idiopathic.</li> </ul> <p>Pathophysiology</p> <ul> <li>Eales' disease presents with overlapping stages of retinal periphlebitis, ischemia, and neovascularization. The peripheral retinal periphlebitis related vascular occlusions cause retinal ischemia, retinal neovascularization that leads to recurrent vitreous hemorrhage. Recent research has proposed immunological, molecular biological, and biochemical mechanisms for Eales' disease with theorized roles of free radical-mediated damage and oxidative stress, human leukocyte antigens, retinal autoimmunity, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Immunologic mechanisms proposed include T-cell lymphocytic infiltration as T-cell lymphocytes has been observed in recovered epiretinal and subretinal membranes in Eales' disease patients. Presently, the etiology appears to be multifactorial and is presumed to be an immunological reaction triggered by the exposure of an exogenous agent.</li> <li>The most prevalent etiologic theory is possible hypersensitivity to tuberculoprotein that develops after exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In a retrospective study, 47.8% of epiretinal membrane samples were positive for one or more Mycobacterium species compared to 11.1% of controls from Eales' disease patients using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This finding has been observed in other studiesand the mycobacterium genome has also been recovered in vitreous fluid samples. Due to this association, Eales' disease may be a variant of tuberculosis-related vasculitis but the exact role of tuberculosis in Eales' disease has yet to be completely ascertained as Eales&rsquo; disease has also been observed in Mantoux-negative cases.</li> </ul> <p>Primary prevention</p> <ul> <li>There are no known preventative measures for Eales&rsquo; disease.</li> </ul> <p>Diagnosis</p> <ul> <li>Eales' disease is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion and requires evaluation for ocular and systemic conditions associated with retinal periphlebitis, neovascularization and recurrent vitreous hemorrhage.</li> </ul> <p>Symptoms</p> <ul> <li>Patients with Eales disease tend to be initially asymptomatic but may present unilateral or bilateral decreased vision, photopsias, and floaters.

      "solution": "<p>Ans. Occurs in premature infants due to late crying</p> <ul> <li>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), also called retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) and Terry syndrome, is a disease of the eye affecting prematurely born babies generally having received neonatal intensive care, in which oxygen therapy is used due to the premature development of their lungs.[2] It is thought to be caused by disorganized growth of retinal blood vessels which may result in scarring and retinal detachment. ROP can be mild and may resolve spontaneously, but it may lead to blindness in serious cases. Thus, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low birth-weight is an additional risk factor. Both oxygen toxicity and relative hypoxia can contribute to the development of ROP.</li> </ul> <p>Causes</p> <ul> <li>By the fourth month of pregnancy, the fetal retina has begun to develop vascularization. Such formation of blood vessels appears to be very sensitive to the amount of oxygen supplied, either naturally or artificially. In rare cases ROP has been found in some patients with a mutation in the NDP gene, which is normally associated with the more damaging Norrie disease.</li> </ul> <p>Risk factors</p> <ul> <li>Various risk factors contribute to the development of ROP. They are:</li> </ul> <p>Prematurity</p> <p>High exposure to oxygen</p> <p>Low birth weight</p> <p>Various types of infections</p> <p>Cardiac defects</p> <p>Anaemia</p> <p>Low vitamin E level</p> <p>Pathophysiology</p> <ul> <li>During development, blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards. This process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. However, in premature babies it is incomplete. If blood vessels grow normally, ROP does not occur. If the vessels grow and branch abnormally the baby develops ROP. These abnormal blood vessels may grow up from the plane of the retina and may bleed inside the eye. When the blood and abnormal vessels are reabsorbed, it may give rise to multiple band like membranes which can pull up the retina, causing detachment of the retina and eventually blindness before 6 months.[citation needed]</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Normally, maturation of the retina proceeds in utero, and at term, the medial portion (Nasal retina) of the retina is fully vascularized, while the lateral portion (Temporal retina) is only incompletely vascularized. The normal growth of the blood vessels is directed to relatively low-oxygen areas of the retina, but the vessels remain in the plane of the retina and do not grow into the vitreous humor. If excess oxygen is given, normal blood vessels degrade and cease to develop. When the excess oxygen environment is removed, the blood vessels rapidly begin forming again and grow into the vitreous humor of the eye from the retina.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The key disease element in ROP is fibrovascular proliferation. This is growth of abnormal new vessels; this may regress, but frequently progresses. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Multiple factors can determine whether the disease progresses, including overall health, birth weight, the stage of ROP at initial diagnosis, and the presence or absence of \"plus disease\". Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use reduces the rate of ROP, but may raise the risk of other hypoxia-related systemic complications, including death.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Patients with ROP, particularly those who have developed severe disease needing treatment are at greater risk for strabismus, glaucoma, cataracts and shortsightedness (myopia) later in life and should be examined yearly to help prevent or detect and treat these conditions.</li> </ul> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number: 264-269</p>",

The risk of developing amblyopia, from a condition that is known to cause amblyopia, diminshes as the child approaches 8-10 years of age. As a corollary to this, the depth of amblyopia is typically less severe the older the child is at the time of onset of the amblyogenic factor.</li> </ul> <p>General Pathology</p> <ul> <li>In cases of bilateral amblyopia, the basic pathology is a significant blurred retinal image in each eye causing a disruption of normal visual development. This disruption must occur during the critical period of visual development (the first 8-10 years of life). The depth of damage depends on the severity of the blur, the length of time of the abnormal vision, and the age of onset of the insult. The pathology involved in unilateral amblyopia can be twofold. Retinal image blur in one eye can inhibit cortical activity from one eye, preventing normal visual development. Alternatively, misaligned eyes can prevent the normal process of fusion from taking place. This can result in suppression of the deviating eye, diminishing the acuity of the eye and loss of binocularity.</li> </ul> <p>Pathophysiology</p> <ul> <li>Abnormal visual stimulation during the critical period of visual development results in brain damage. Structural and functional damage occurs in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the striate cortex cortex of the visual center in the occipital lobe in the form of atrophy of connections, loss of cross-linking between connections and loss of laterality of connections.</li> </ul> <p>Primary prevention</p> <ul> <li>The key to prevention is detection. There are numerous techniques to detect amblyopia, all with varying degrees of specificity, sensitivity, complexity and cost. These include a complete ophthalmic examination, photoscreening, visual evoked potentials, acuity charts, and tests of stereopsis and binocular function. Children who are at higher risk for amblyopia should be watched closely for early signs of this condition. In general, the quicker amblyopia is detected and addressed, the less negative effect it has on the visual system. Vision screening is advocated on the state level to screen as many children as possible for this disease prior to the age of kindergarten. Early intervention results in better overall vision. This is why the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology all support pre-kindergarten vision screening for children.</li> </ul> <p>Diagnosis</p> <ul> <li>Amblyopia should be considered as a possible diagnosis in children with asymmetric visual behavior or acuity. It can also complicate the course of children with strabismus, or unilateral ocular or adnexal pathology such as a cataract, eyelid capillary hemangioma or corneal scar. Bilateral amblyopia can also occur and should be thought of when a bilateral ocular condition occurs and despite treatment, some degree of diminsihed acuity persists. A careful history, thorough physical examination and knowledge of possible etiologies of amblyopia can help the clinician to diagnose this condition.</li> </ul> <p>History</p> <ul> <li>Parents will often bring their child to the Ophthalmologist because of the underlying cause of the amblyopia (ptosis, strabismus, leukocoria, eyelid hemangioma), without realizing that amblyopia is present. In fact, anisometropic amblyopia usually goes undetected until picked up by a vision screening. The overwhelming majority of children with unilateral amblyopia do not complain of decreased acuity because they do not notice it unless one eye is occluded. The history taking process should include any family history of vision problems (specifically amblyopia and strabismus). Parents should be asked if the child was premature, and if they have ever noted any eye misalignment. Any prior testing (ex. school or Pediatrician vision screening, neuroimaging etc.) should be noted. If any abnormality in the child's visual behavior has been noted, the duration is important. Also, some children may already have received care for amblyopia somewhere else. If this is the case, type of treatment and duration should be determined. Old records can be helpful.</li> </ul> <p>Physical examination</p> <ul> <li>Examination should consist of the following:</li> </ul> <p>Acuity testing- age appropriate. Single optotypes (without crowding bar) are not recommended as a good acuity testing technique in amblyopes because this test will tend to underestimate the degree of amblyopia (crowding phenomenon).</p> <p>Record the power of any current spectacles</p> <p>Subjective refraction if age appropriate</p> <p>Tests of stereopsis and binocular function (ex. Worth 4 dot testing)</p> <p>External examination (looking for ptosis, lid hemangioma or other lesion which could affect visual development)</p> <p>Presence of absence of an afferent pupil defect</p> <p>Anterior segment examination (looking for any media opacity, or irregularity)</p> <p>Motility and ocular alignment</p> <p>Funduscopic examination</p> <p>Cycloplegic retinoscopy</p> <p>Signs</p> <ul> <li>The presence or absence of signs of amblyopia would depend on what the underlying etiology for the amblyopia is. Deprivational amblyopia could manifest with ptosis, an eyelid hemangioma, or a cataract for example. Strabismic amblyopia may show a constant or intermittent ocular deviation. Anisometropic amblyopia often shows no obvious signs when observing the patient, but cycloplegic retinoscopy will reveal the anisometropia. On clinical examination, unilateral amblyopia will show asymmetric visual behavior or acuity testing results (although not all patients with asymmetric acuity have amblyopia). Severe cases may have a mild afferent pupillary defect. The crowding phenomenon is important to be aware of when testing visual acuity in an amblyope. The amblyopic eye of these patients will visualize individual letters better than a whole line of letters. Therefore if the visual acuity tester uses individual letters (sans crowding bar), then they may underestimate the degree of amblyopia that is present or miss it entirely. A neutral density filter significantly reduces vision in organic disease, but generally does not in pure amblyopia.</li> </ul> <p>Symptoms</p> <ul> <li>Patients with unilateral amblyopia are often asymptomatic. Occasionally, patients will complain that one eye is blurry, or younger children may report discomfort in the affected eye. Torticollis occurs infrequently. Poor depth perception or clumsiness may be noted.</li> </ul> <p>Clinical diagnosis</p> <ul> <li>In cases of unilateral amblyopia, the diagnosis requires two components. First, the patient must have a condition that can cause unilateral amblyopia. Examples would include strabismus, anisometropia, or a deprivational cause (ptosis, cataract, etc.). Second, the patient must have residual asymmetric acuity beyond the level expected from the underlying condition or that persists after treatment of the underlying condition. For example, a child with anisometropic hyperopia receives proper spectacle correction. Acuity in the more hyperopic eye improves but is still below that of the less hyperopic eye. This asymmetry of acuity represents amblyopia. In cases of bilateral amblyopia, a condition must be present during the critical years of visual development which produces constant, significant visual blur. Examples of such conditions would include bilateral vitreous hemorrhages, bilateral cataracts, bilateral corneal pathology, bilateral high hypermetropia, or bilateral high astigmatism.</li> </ul> <p>Diagnostic procedures</p> <ul> <li>A normal, comprehensive ophthalmic examination is usually all that is necessary to diagnose amblyopia. Components of this examination include (but are not limited to): acuity testing, cycloplegic refraction and retinoscopy, tests of stereopsis and binocular vision, evaluation of pupillary responses, anterior segment examination, cover-uncover and alternate-cover testing, and dilated funduscopic examination. See the Physical Examination section above.</li> </ul> <p>Laboratory test</p> <ul> <li>Laboratory testing is not a typical feature of amblyopia diagnosis. Certainly if the etiology of the amblyopia was unclear, or if vision was deteriorating despite treatment, neuroimaging would be considered.</li> </ul> <p>Differential diagnosis</p> <ul> <li>There are cases of decreased acuity in children in which amblyopia is not present. Ocular pathology or refractive error (or even improper spectacle correction) may cause decreased acuity without any superimposed amblyopia. Prechiasmal lesions or optic nerve insult can also produce unilateral decreased acuity.</li> </ul> <p>Management</p> <ul> <li>Although there is much practitioner variability in the treatment of amblyopia, the general idea is to first treat the underlying cause for the amblyopia. Examples of this treatment would include prescribing glasses for anisometropia, strabismus surgery or spectacles to eliminate strabismus, or removal of a unilateral cataract to eliminate the media opacity. In unilateral or asymmetric cases of amblyopia, if there is a residual visual deficit after the underlying etiology is present then amblyopia is said to exist. This can be addressed with occlusion therapy, pharmacologic therapy, or some other less commonly used modalities. Much of the data on the success of various treatment modalities for amblyopia through the years has come from retrospective, single site chart-review type studies. Over the last decade, there has been an explosion of amblyopia research. The need for prospective randomized trials in the treatment of amblyopia has begun to be met by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG). This is an NEI-funded network including both University-based and community-based clinicians. The power of such a group lies in its ability to conduct multiple trials in a cost-effective fashion, with simple protocols implemented as part of routine practice[3]. Patients are enrolled at multiple clinical sites in a prospective randomized fashion, with standardized visual testing protocols[4]. Important data derived from these studies is present throughout this section on amblyopia.</li> </ul> <p>General treatment</p> <ul> <li>The key to optimal treatment of amblyopia is early detection and intervention. In symmetric bilateral cases, treatment consists of addressing the etiology of the diminished vision. Often there is residual bilateral amblyopia which may improve over time[5]. In asymmetric cases or unilateral cases, active treatment with patching, pharmacologic agents, or some less commonly used modalities can often improve the residual visual deficit.</li> </ul> <p>Reference: Parsons' diseases of the eye, section 4, page number: 314-322</p>",
