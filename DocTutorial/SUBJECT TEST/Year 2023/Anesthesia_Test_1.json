Applicable in turbulent flow in flowmeters. The flow meters are always calibrated at 760 mm of Hg. If the anaesthesia machine is used in a high altitude area, where the atmospheric pressure is very low, the density of the gas decreases, but viscosity will not change. As higher flows depend on density and as per GRAHAM'S LAW FOR TURBULENT FLOW, flow is inversely proportional to square root of density i.e. FLOW &alpha; 1/&radic; density Flow will be higher than the actual flows that are set in the flow meters. The opposite will occur under hyperbaric conditions.</p><p>Option b: Henry's law states that the amount of a gas dissolved in a unit volume of a solvent is directly proportional to its partial pressure at STP. The law also predicts how much of a gas dissolves in a liquid. According to this law, the volume of gas that dissolves in a liquid is equal to its solubility coefficient times its partial pressure. V = &alpha; x PGAS</p><p>Option d: Dalton's law of partial pressures: states that in a mixture of gases the pressure exerted by each gas is same as the pressure exerted as if it alone occupied the container. It can also be defined as 'in a mixture of gases the total pressure exerted by the mixture is equal to the sum of pressures exerted by the individual gases. The pressure exerted by each of the gases is called as the partial pressure of that gas.</p><p>References: Basic physics and measurement in anesthesia by Paul davis- 5<sup>th </sup>edition, RACE 2020 Chap-1.</p>",

With a traditional flowmeter assembly, the flow control valve regulates the amount of flow that enters a tapered, transparent flow tube known as a variable orifice flowmeter or Thorpe tube. These glass tubes are narrowest at the bottom and widen at the top. A mobile indicator float inside the calibrated flow tube indicates the amount of flow passing through the associated flow control valve.</p><p>The indicator float hovers freely in an equilibrium position in the tube where the upward force resulting from gas flow equals the downward gravity force on the float at a given flow rate. The float moves to a new equilibrium position in the tube when flow is changed. These flowmeters are commonly referred to as constant-pressure flowmeters because the decrease in pressure across the float remains constant for all positions in the tube.</p><p>Option b: The float or bobbin within the flow tube is usually constructed so that it rotates to indicate that gas is flowing and that the indicator is not stuck in the tube. A stop at the top of the flowmeter tube prevents the float from occluding the outlet.</p><p>Option d: Flow through the annular space can be laminar or turbulent, depending on the gas flow rate . The characteristics of a gas that influence its flow rate through a given constriction are viscosity (laminar flow) and density (turbulent flow). Because the annular space behaves as a tube at low flow rates, laminar flow is present, and viscosity determines the gas flow rate. At high flow rates, the annular space behaves like an orifice. Turbulent gas flow is present and gas density predominantly influences the flow.</p><p>Reference: Miller's Anesthesia- 9<sup>th</sup> edition(CH-22, PG-580-582)</p>",

The technique was later modified to detect both systolic and diastolic pressure with the description of an auscultatory method of blood pressure measurement by Korotkoff in 1905. Korotkoff sounds are a complex series of audible frequencies produced by turbulent flow beyond the partially occluding cuff. Put simply, the systolic pressure is associated with the first sound heard (beginning of turbulent flow through the vessel) and diastolic pressure at the point when the sounds disappear (when vessel flow becomes laminar). Mean blood pressure cannot be measured using this technique.</p><p>A fundamental principle of the auscultatory method is its reliance on blood flow to generate Korotkoff sounds. Physiologic conditions that interfere with sound detection (e.g., severe edema, obesity, abnormal compliance of overlying tissue) or blood flow (shock, intense vasoconstriction) will frustrate manual blood pressure measurement.33-37 Furthermore, the cuff must also be snugly fitted, <strong>with a bladder that measures 40% of arm circumference and 80% of length of the upper arm, and centered over the artery</strong>. A cuff that is too large will often yield acceptable results when used for manual measurements, but <strong>a small cuff will usually yield falsely high readings.</strong></p><p>Reference: Miller's Anesthesia- 9<sup>th</sup> edition(CH-36, PG-1158).</p>",

The risk of PDPH correlates with the needle tip design, size, and bevel orientation. Pencil-point needles produce fewer headaches than similar sized cutting-point needles. The smaller the needle, the lower the risk of PDPH.</p><p>;Other risk factors for PDPH include age; <strong>younger patients</strong> are more likely to develop PDPH and BMI; patients with a <strong>BMI above 30 kg/m2 may be less likely to develop PDPH</strong>. Females may be more susceptible to PDPH. Patients with <strong>a history of PDPH or those with chronic headaches</strong> are more likely to develop a new PDPH. The choice of air or saline for detecting loss of resistance while locating the epidural space does not influence the incidence of PDPH.</p><p>The exact mechanism of PDPH is unknown. Loss of CSF through the iatrogenic dural tear seems to be the inciting factor. When the patient is upright, intracerebral CSF volume decreases. This change may cause the brain to sag toward the foramen magnum, stretching the pain-sensitive meningeal vascular covering. Alternatively, the diminished CSF volume may incite a compensatory increase in cerebral blood volume and produce a vascular headache.</p><p>Diagnosis</p><p>Most PDPHs develop 24 to 72 hours after dural puncture. Patients usually complain of frontal and occipital pain that is made worse by standing and relieved by lying flat. Severe PDPH can also cause neck, shoulder, or back pain, which may not be relieved by lying down. Visual disturbances, vertigo, and cranial nerve palsies can occur.122,123 Rarely, cortical vein thrombosis or subdural hematoma occur</p><p>TREATMENT</p><p>Once PDPH develops, most therapy is symptomatic. Bed rest will often relieve PDPH pain but does not shorten its duration.135 Neither oral nor 2325 intravenous hydration has any effect on PDPH.135 Patients with PDPH should have access to adequate analgesics. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioids can be effective. Caffeine may relieve the symptoms of PDPH but the data supporting its use are weak.

It is a chronic autoimmune disorder caused by a decrease in functional acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction resulting from their destruction or inactivation by circulating antibodies.</p><p>This accounts for the weakness and easy fatigability of these patients and their marked sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Indeed, the hallmarks of this disease are weakness and rapid exhaustion of voluntary muscles with repetitive use, followed by partial recovery with rest. Skeletal muscles innervated by cranial nerves (ocular, pharyngeal, and laryngeal muscles) are especially vulnerable, as indicated by the appearance of ptosis, diplopia, and dysphagia, which are often the initial symptoms of the disease.</p><p>Patients with myasthenia gravis often require ventilatory support after surgery. Therefore it is important to advise these patients during the preoperative interview that they may be intubated and ventilated when they awaken. Factors that may correlate with the need for mechanical ventilation during the postoperative period following transsternal thymectomy include (1) disease duration longer than 6 years, (2) presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease unrelated to myasthenia gravis, (3) a daily dose of pyridostigmine of more than 750 mg, and (4) vital capacity less than 2.9 L. These factors are less predictive of the need for ventilatory support following transcervical thymectomy, which indicates that this less invasive surgical approach produces less respiratory depression.</p><p>However, in contrast to the resistance to succinylcholine, patients with myasthenia gravis exhibit marked sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Even small doses of nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, such as those intended to block succinylcholine-induced fasciculations, can produce profound skeletal muscle weakness in some patients. In patients with mild to moderate myasthenia gravis, the potency of atracurium and vecuronium is increased at least twofold compared with the response in patients without the disease.</p><p>Reference: Stoelting anesthesia and co existing disease-7<sup>th</sup> edition</p>",

For the purpose of this discussion, electrical shocks are divided into two categories.</p><p>Macroshock refers to large amounts of current flowing through a person, which can cause harm or death</p><p>Microshock refers to very small amounts of current and applies only to the electrically susceptible patient. This is an individual who has an external conduit that is in direct contact with the heart. This can be a pacing wire or a saline-filled catheter such as a central venous or pulmonary artery catheter. In the case of the electrically susceptible patient, even minute amounts of current (microshock) may cause ventricular fibrillation.</p><p>Option c: A defibrillator is a life support equipment used for the purpose of sustaining life and whose failure to perform its primary function will lead to patient death in the absence of immediate intervention.</p><p>Defibrillator stores electrical energy in the capacitor. A Capacitor consist of two parallel conductors separated by insulator.</p><p>Option d: A basic principle of electricity is known as Ohm's law, which is represented by the equation</p><p>E = I &times; R</p><p>where E is electromotive force (in volts), I is current (in amperes), and R is resistance (in ohms). Ohm's law forms the basis for the physiologic equation BP = CO &times; SVR; that is, blood pressure (BP) is equal to the cardiac output (CO) times the systemic vascular resistance (SVR). In this case, the BP of the vascular system is analogous to voltage, the CO to current, and the SVR to the forces opposing the flow of electrons.</p><p>Reference: Clinical Anesthesia by Paul Barash( ch- 5).</p>",

In order to ensure that the correct cylinder or central pipeline supply is attached to the appropriate hanger yoke of the anesthesia machine/work station, a series of pins on the hanger yoke is made to fit into corresponding indentations (pits/holes) drilled into the cylinder valve or yoke block . This pin-index system is used on small cylinder (sizes A to E) valves and yoke blocks.</p><p>The indentations (pits/holes) on the cylinder valve/yoke block are counted 1-6 from left to right whereas pins on hanger yoke of the machine are counted 16 from right to left. There are seven positions for pins and holes</p><p>The pins are 4.75mm in diameter and 6 mm long, except for pin number 7. Pin number 7 is slightly thicker and it is placed in the center, between pin number 3 and 4. Positions of seven holes (indentations) on the cylinder valve are on the circumference of a circle of 9/16 inch (14.3 mm) radius centered on the port. The port has a diameter of 7.00 mm.</p><p>If both the pins and the indentations are not aligned, port of the cylinder would not seat against the nipple on the yoke.

      "solution": "<p>The Mapleson systems are characterized by the absence of unidirectional valves to direct gases to or from the patient. Because there is no device for absorbing CO2, the fresh gas flow must wash CO2 out of the circuit. For this reason, these systems are sometimes called carbon dioxide washout circuits or flow-controlled breathing systems.</p><p>These systems were first classified into five basic types: A through E . A sixth, the Mapleson F system, was added later.</p><p>Because there is no clear separation of inspired and expired gases, rebreathing will occur when the inspiratory flow exceeds the fresh gas flow. The composition of the inspired mixture will depend on how much rebreathing takes place.</p><p>MAGILLS/MAPLESON A</p><p>The Mapleson A (Magill) system was designed by Sir Ivan Magill in the 1930's and remains an excellent system for spontaneous ventilation. Fresh gas enters the system at the fresh gas outlet of the anesthesia machine. It consists of a reservoir bag, a corrugated hose (42, volume that of one tidal volume, about 550 mL) and an expiratory valve (Heidbrink valve) which is very close to the patient to reduce the dead space.</p><p>Best among all Mapleson's systems for spontaneous breathing.</p><p>A FGF of two and a half times the patient's minute volume is required to vent enough alveolar gas to minimize rebreathing (FGF of about 12-15 L/min) for controlled ventilation which is obviously very inefficient. In practice, the Magill circuit should not be used for positive pressure ventilation except for short periods of a few minutes at a time.</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d19tx39t2q3u48.cloudfront.net/QuizDec2022/Anaesthesia602012023/36E.png\"><br><p>MAPLESON B &amp; C</p><p>Mapleson B</p><p>The fresh gas inlet and APL valve are both located near the patient port. The reservoir bag is at the patient end of the system, separated from the fresh gas inlet by corrugated tubing.</p><p>The C system differs from B in that it does not have the corrugated tube. This system was at one time combined with a canister of sodalime to absorb CO2 (Waters' 'To and Fro' Circuit).</p><p>A fresh gas flow of 2 to 2.5 times minute volume has been recommended. Hence, they are not commonly used in anesthetic practice, although the C system is used on intensive care units.</p><p>BAIN CIRCUIT</p><p>In the Bain modification, the fresh gas supply tube runs coaxially inside the corrugated tubing and ends at the point where the fresh gas would enter if the classic Mapleson D form were used. The outer tube is clear so that the inner tube can be inspected. The outer tubing of most commercially available versions of the Bain system is narrower than conventional corrugated tubing</p><p>It differs from the other Mapleson systems in that fresh gas does not enter the system near the patient connection but enters at the other end of the system near the reservoir bag. A corrugated tubing connects the bag to the adjustable pressure limiting (APL) valve at the patient end of the system.</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d19tx39t2q3u48.cloudfront.net/QuizDec2022/Anaesthesia602012023/36E1.png\"><br><p>Ayres T piece</p><p>This was described by Phillip Ayre in 1937.

Accumulation of fat tissue in and around the chest wall and abdomen and the added effect of an increased pulmonary blood volume cause this decrease in lung compliance, which is associated with a decrease in FRC and impaired gas exchange.</p><p>Option d: In obese patients Opioid-induced ventilatory depression is a concern, a multimodal approach to postoperative pain control is usually employed. This includes use of techniques that decrease narcotic requirements. Peripheral and central nerve block with continuous infusion of local anesthetic with or without small doses of opioids is an effective method for postoperative analgesia in obese patients. Supplementation with NSAIDs, &alpha;2-receptor agonists, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, sodium channel blockers, or other nonopioid analgesics is highly recommended, since these drugs do not contribute to postoperative respiratory depression.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE(3<sup>RD</sup> EDITION).</p>",

Inflation of the cuff at the distal end of the blocker serves to block ventilation to that lung. The lumen of the blocker permits suctioning of the airway distal to the catheter tip. Depending on the clinical circumstance, oxygen can be insufflated through the catheter lumen.

      "solution": "<p>Option b: IVRA(BIER block) is useful anesthetic option for many upper or lower extremity surgeries of <strong>short duration</strong></p><p>Option c: The Bier block technique provides analgesia, muscle relaxation and a <strong>relatively bloodless field.</strong></p><p>Option d: <strong>An essential step in the overall success of the Bier block is the exsanguination of the extremity before the injection of local anesthetic</strong>. After an IV is placed on the extremity to be anesthetized, it is common practice to place a proximal double-cuffed pneumatic tourniquet on that same extremity.</p><p>The IV should be placed as close to the site of surgery or injury as possible. The dorsum of the hand is one of the more common sites for placement. Commonly, the extremity is elevated for 2-3 minutes to aid in passive venous drainage. Following this 2-3 minute period, a soft roll of gauze can be placed in the patient's hand to minimize discomfort while an Esmarch bandage is applied to exsanguinate the arm.</p><p>Once it is wrapped above the level of the pneumatic tourniquet, the proximal cuff is inflated. At this point, a local anesthetic can be injected through the IV catheter. Caution must be taken not to inject the local anesthetic too quickly or with too much force to minimize the risk of leakage of the local anesthetic beyond the tourniquet into the systemic circulation.</p><p>Once the local anesthetic (typically 40 ml of 0.5% Lidocaine) is injected, there may be visible blanching in various areas of the extremity. This blanching is thought to be due to any residual blood being forced toward the skin surface. Although this does not ensure a successful block, it is a positive indicator that analgesia will likely be adequate.</p><p>The volume of administration can vary based on the potency of the local anesthetic used. It has been common practice to use 30-50 mL of 0.5% Lidocaine without epinephrine based on initial descriptions of the technique. Although Lidocaine is the most commonly used local anesthetic, others can be used to include prilocaine, ropivacaine, and chloroprocaine.</p><p><strong>Option a: One local anesthetic that is not recommended for IVRA is bupivacaine due to its high cardiac toxicity and potential for cardiac arrest.</strong> Whichever local anesthetic is used, it should be preservative-free to minimize the risk of thrombophlebitis and free of epinephrine.</p><p>Regardless of the practitioner's technique used, the total volume and concentration used should be less than the maximum recommended dose of the local anesthetic used to avoid LAST.</p>",
