The initial part of the operation is identical to Bassini&rsquo;s. Once the hernia sac has been removed and any medial defect closed, a piece of mesh measuring 8 &times; 15 cm is placed over the posterior wall, behind the spermatic cord, and is slit to wrap around the spermatic cord at the deep inguinal ring. Loose sutures hold the mesh to the inguinal ligament and conjoint tendon.</li><li>In 1890, Edoardo <strong>Bassini</strong> described a suture repair for inguinal hernia that remained the basis of open repair for over 100 years (Figure 64.14). The surgeon enters the inguinal canal by opening its anterior wall, the external oblique aponeurosis. The spermatic cord is dissected free and the presence of a lateral or a medial hernia is confrmed. The sac of a lateral hernia is separated from the cord, opened and any contents reduced. The sac is then sutured closed at its neck and excess sac removed. If there is a medial hernia then the sac is inverted and the transversalis fascia is suture plicated. Sutures are now placed between the conjoint tendon above and the inguinal ligament below, extending from the pubic tubercle to the deep inguinal ring. The posterior wall of the inguinal canal is thus strengthened.</li><li><strong>Shouldice</strong> modification: In this operation, the transversalis fascia is opened by a central incision from the deep inguinal ring to the pubic tubercle and then closed to create a two-layered posterior wall (double breasting). The external oblique is closed in a similar fashion.</li><li><strong>Desarda</strong> has described an operation where a 1- to 2-cm strip of external oblique aponeurosis lying over the inguinal canal is isolated from the main muscle, but left attached both medially and laterally. It is then sutured to the conjoint tendon and inguinal ligament, reinforcing the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. As the abdominal muscles contract, this strip of aponeurosis tightens to add further physiological support to the posterior wall.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Bailey and Love&rsquo;s short practice of surgery 28<sup>th</sup> edition, part-11, chapter-64, page number 1069</p>",

Since then, at least 15 other enterovirus serotypes have been shown to cause HFMD, most commonly Coxsackie virus A serotypes.</li><li><strong><em>D/D- Herpangina</em></strong> is a benign clinical syndrome characterized by fever and a painful papulo-vesiculo-ulcerative <strong>oral enanthem</strong>, caused by 22 enterovirus serotypes, most commonly Coxsackie virus A serotypes.</li><li>Coxsackie virus A16 and enterovirus A71 serotypes are most frequently associated with HFMD and are responsible for the majority of large outbreaks.</li><li>Other viruses include Coxsackie virus A 5,6,7,9,10 and Coxsackie virus B 2,5 and some Echoviruses.</li><li>HFMD and herpangina usually occur during the summer and early autumn.</li><li>The viruses that cause HFMD usually are transmitted from person to person by the fecal-oral route, by contact with oral and respiratory secretions and vesicle fluid.</li><li><strong>INCUBATION PERIOD</strong>- typically is three to five days.</li><li><strong>CLINICAL FEATURES</strong>- presents with complaints of mouth or throat pain (in verbal children) or refusal to eat (in nonverbal children). Prodromal symptoms usually are absent but can include fever, fussiness, abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea.</li><li>Examination findings &mdash; The cardinal findings of HFMD are the oral enanthem and the exanthem. <strong>Oral enanthem</strong> &mdash; The oral lesions of HFMD are anterior to the faucial pillars, most commonly on the tongue and buccal mucosa less commonly in the gingivolabial groove and on the soft and hard palates; and occasionally on the uvula, lips, and tonsils.</li><li><strong>Exanthem </strong>&mdash;may be macular, maculopapular, or vesicular. The skin lesions of HFMD are non The lesions typically resolve in three to four days. The exanthem typically involves the hands (dorsum of the fingers, interdigital area, palms), feet (dorsum of the toes, lateral border of the feet, soles, heels), buttocks, legs (upper thighs), and arms.</li><li><strong>COMPLICATIONS</strong>-HFMD caused by enterovirus A71 has been associated with severe illness, complicated by central nervous system disease (rhombencephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis), pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, and heart failure.</li><li><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong>- made clinically, based upon the typical appearance and location of the oral enanthem and exanthema.</li><li><strong>CLINICAL COURSE</strong>- HFMD generally is a mild clinical syndrome. Complete resolution of symptoms and signs typically occurs within 7 to 10 days. However, complications may occur,</li><li><strong>MANAGEMENT- </strong>Mainly supportive. Children with complications may require hospitalization. No specific antiviral therapy is available for the treatment of the enteroviruses. Pain and discomfort due to fever can be managed with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Children who are unable to drink sufficiently to maintain hydration should be hospitalized for parenteral fluid therapy.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, Volume 1, 21<sup>st</sup> Edition (International Edition) page number:1692</p>",

As vitamin A deficiency progresses, the corneal and conjunctival epithelial tissues of the eye become severely altered because of a lack of sufficient RA for normal epithelial cell differentiation.</li><li>Stages in vitamin A deficiency include corneal keratinization and opacity, susceptibility to infection, and formation of dry, scaly layers of cells (xerophthalmia)</li><li>The conjunctival membrane undergoes keratinization and may develop foamy-appearing plaques (Bit&ocirc;t spots).

Management should be aimed at reducing the pain associated with meningitis or orchitis and maintaining adequate hydration.
