      "solution": "<p>Option C). <strong>Sympathetic stimulation increases aqueous humor production by activating alpha-adrenergic receptors</strong> - Incorrect. Sympathetic stimulation mainly involves <strong>beta-adrenergic receptors</strong> in the ciliary epithelium, increasing aqueous humor production. Alpha-adrenergic agonists (e.g., apraclonidine) reduce aqueous production.</p><p>Option A)<strong>. Aqueous humor is primarily produced by the non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body</strong> - This is correct. Aqueous humor is formed by the non-pigmented epithelial cells of the ciliary processes, mainly through active secretion and ultrafiltration.</p><p>Option B)<strong>. Carbonic anhydrase plays a critical role in aqueous humor formation by facilitating the production of bicarbonate ions</strong> - Correct. Carbonic anhydrase helps catalyze the reaction that forms bicarbonate ions, which drive sodium and water movement, contributing to aqueous humor formation. This is why carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide) are effective in reducing aqueous production.</p><p>Option D)<strong>. Aqueous humor flows from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber via the pupil</strong> - This is correct.

      "solution": "<ul><li>Option C<strong>). Dysfunction of the endothelial pump</strong>: Correct. <strong>Fuchs endothelial dystrophy</strong> is characterized by the progressive loss of corneal endothelial cells. These cells contain Na+/K+ ATPase pumps that actively remove excess fluid from the stroma, maintaining the cornea's relative dehydration and transparency. When these pumps fail, corneal edema occurs, leading to stromal swelling and light scattering.</li><li>Option A<strong>). Loss of tight junctions in the corneal epithelium</strong>: Incorrect. While the corneal epithelium is important for maintaining surface hydration and protecting against infections, loss of tight junctions primarily leads to surface irregularities and epithelial defects, not the stromal edema seen in Fuchs endothelial dystrophy.</li><li>Option B<strong>). Deposition of pigment in the cornea</strong>: Incorrect. Pigment deposition in the cornea, as seen in conditions like <strong>Kayser-Fleischer rings</strong>, causes visible opacities but is unrelated to the loss of transparency caused by corneal edema.</li><li>Option D<strong>).
