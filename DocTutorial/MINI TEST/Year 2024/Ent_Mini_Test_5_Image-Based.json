Hence option A is also not true.</li><li>It's management primarily includes antihistamines, and decongestant.</li><li>But if the condition does not resolve even after 3 months than <strong>Myringotomy</strong> is performed followed by <strong>placement of grommet tube</strong> or tympanostomy tube to maintain ventilation.</li></ul><p><strong>Tag 1:</strong> Ear, serous otitis media.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Disease of ear nose and throat by PL dhingra, 8<sup>th</sup> Edition, Page Number: 75, 76.</p>",
