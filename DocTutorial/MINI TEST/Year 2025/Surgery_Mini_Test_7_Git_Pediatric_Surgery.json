CT imaging can help diagnose appendicitis but is not the best choice for this case.</p><p>Option B (Intussusception; Ultrasound): Correct. The classic triad of sudden onset of abdominal pain, vomiting, and red currant jelly stools, along with the palpable sausage-shaped mass and positive Dance sign, points to intussusception. Ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic tool and shows the \"target sign\" or \"doughnut sign,\" which is highly suggestive of intussusception.</p><p>Option C (Acute gastroenteritis; Stool culture): Incorrect.

Stool culture would be used to diagnose infections but is not relevant here.</p><p>Option D (Malrotation with volvulus; Upper GI contrast study): Incorrect.

Hirschsprung disease typically presents with failure to pass meconium and abdominal distension rather than projectile vomiting and a palpable mass. Diagnosis is confirmed with a rectal biopsy, but this is not the likely diagnosis in this case.</p><p>Option C (Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis; Ultrasound): Correct. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is the most likely diagnosis, given the characteristic clinical features (projectile vomiting, palpable olive-shaped mass, visible peristalsis). Ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic tool and can confirm the diagnosis by measuring pyloric muscle thickness and channel length.</p><p>Option D (Malrotation with volvulus; Upper GI contrast study): Incorrect.

While some undescended testes may descend spontaneously in the first few months of life, waiting until the age of 2 years for surgery is generally not recommended. Early intervention is preferred to prevent complications such as infertility or testicular malignancy.</p><p>Option B (Surgical intervention [orchidopexy] before 18 months of age): Correct. The most appropriate treatment for undescended testis is surgical intervention, typically orchidopexy, to bring the testis into the scrotum. It is ideally performed before the age of 18 months to minimize the risk of infertility and other complications.</p><p>Option C (Hormonal therapy to stimulate descent): Incorrect. Hormonal therapy (e.g., human chorionic gonadotropin or GnRH) has been used in some cases, but it is less effective than surgery and is generally not the first-line treatment for undescended testes.</p><p>Option D (Immediate orchiectomy): Incorrect.

The Arc of Riolan is a collateral branch that connects the superior mesenteric artery to the inferior mesenteric artery.

It does not directly compensate for an obstruction in the inferior mesenteric artery.</p><p>Option D (Cecocolic junction): Incorrect.

Type II ulcers involve both the stomach and the duodenum, but the patient's presentation with NSAID use points to a different classification.</p><p>Option C (Type III: Prepyloric ulcer, located just before the pylorus): Incorrect. Type III ulcers are located near the pylorus, but this patient's NSAID use points more toward a Type V ulcer.</p><p>Option D (Type V: NSAIDs-induced ulcer): Correct. Type V ulcers are caused by NSAIDs and can be located in various regions, often on the lesser curvature, consistent with the patient's history of NSAID use.</p><p><strong>Modified Johnson's Classification of Gastric Ulcers</strong></p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V3/LBNEETPG/QuizJan2025/SurgMiniVI26012025/13E.jpg\"><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V3/LBNEETPG/QuizJan2025/SurgMiniVI26012025/13E1.jpg\"><p>Key Points:</p><ul><li>Type II to Type IV are associated with blood group 'O'</li><li>In Type I, IV, V<ul><li>The acid secretion is either normal or low</li><li>So, vagotomy is not performed</li></ul></li><li>In Type II, III<ul><li>There is increased acid secretion (hypersecretion)</li><li>Truncal vagotomy is routinely done</li></ul></li></ul><p>Tags:</p><p>Topic: Gastric Ulcer Classification, NSAIDs</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Sabiston textbook of surgery 21th edition page number. 1207</p>",

SCC is more commonly associated with smoking, alcohol, and ingested carcinogens, but GERD is a major risk factor for adenocarcinoma, not SCC.</p><p>Option B (Adenocarcinoma; GERD, high-fat diet, and Barrett's oesophagus): Correct. Barrett's oesophagus, which occurs due to chronic GERD, predisposes to adenocarcinoma.

Alcohol, smoking, and high-fat diet are risk factors for SCC, but not for adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Option D (Adenocarcinoma; smoking, ingested carcinogens, and Barrett's oesophagus): Incorrect.

Mallory-Weiss tear typically presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, often after vomiting, but without the signs of perforation, subcutaneous emphysema, or chest pain seen in Boerhaave syndrome.</p><p>Option B (Boerhaave syndrome; Mackler's triad): Correct. Boerhaave syndrome involves a full-thickness rupture of the oesophagus, presenting with severe chest pain, vomiting, and subcutaneous emphysema. The classic \"Mackler&rsquo;s triad\" includes vomiting, chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema, which is a key distinguishing feature from Mallory-Weiss tear.</p><p>Option C (Mallory-Weiss tear; perforation of the oesophagus): Incorrect. Mallory-Weiss tear involves a tear in the mucosal and submucosal layers of the oesophagus but does not cause perforation or the associated emphysema as seen in Boerhaave syndrome.</p><p>Option D (Boerhaave syndrome; upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage): Incorrect.
