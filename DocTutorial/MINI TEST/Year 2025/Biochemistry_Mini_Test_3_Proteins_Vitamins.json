      "solution": "<p><strong>Prion diseases</strong> are protein conformation diseases transmitted by altering the <strong>conformation, and hence the physical properties, of proteins endogenous</strong> to the host such as human <strong>prion-related protein (PrP)</strong></p><p>Prion diseases are caused by <strong>misfolded proteins (prions)</strong>, where a normal protein undergoes a conformational change into a misfolded, pathogenic form that can induce other proteins to <strong>misfold, leading to fatal neurodegeneration</strong>.</p><p>Prion diseases, are <strong>fatal neurodegenerative</strong> diseases characterized by spongiform changes, astrocytic gliomas, and neuronal loss resulting from the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates in neural cells. E.g Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans</p><p>A) <strong>Defective Translation during Synthesis</strong> - Defective translation refers to errors that occur during the process of translating mRNA into protein. While translation errors can lead to improperly formed proteins, prion diseases are not caused by translation errors but rather by the misfolding of a correctly synthesized protein. Prion diseases are related to post-synthesis changes in the protein's conformation, not errors in the initial protein production.</p><p>B) <strong>Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)</strong> It is variations at a single position in the DNA sequence. Some inherited prion diseases (like <strong>Familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</strong>) are associated with genetic mutations, including SNPs in the <strong>PRNP</strong> gene, which encodes the prion protein. However, prion diseases themselves are primarily caused by the misfolding of the prion protein rather than the presence of SNPs. The mutation increases susceptibility but is not the direct cause of the disease.</p><p>D) <strong>Infection due to Bacteria :</strong> caused by harmful bacteria invading and multiplying in the body. Prion diseases are not caused by bacteria but by abnormal protein folding. Prions are non-living infectious agents, unlike bacteria, viruses, or parasites, and do not involve an external pathogen like bacteria.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry, 32<sup>nd</sup> Edition, Chapter 5, Page number:43</p>",
