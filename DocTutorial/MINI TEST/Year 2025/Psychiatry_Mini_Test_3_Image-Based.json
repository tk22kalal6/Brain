      "solution": "<ul><li>Freud's psychosexual stages propose that personality develops through five stages: oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital. Each stage centers on erogenous zones and influences later behavior and relationships.</li></ul><ol><li>Oral Stage:<ul><li>The oral stage is the earliest developmental phase, focused on the mouth and sucking reflex, lasting about 18 months.</li><li>It involves libidinal and aggressive drives, with oral gratification linked to needs like hunger and comfort.</li><li>Successful resolution fosters trust and self-reliance, while excessive gratification or deprivation can lead to traits like optimism, narcissism, or dependency.</li><li>Pathological traits include demandingness and jealousy</li></ul></li><li>Anal Stage<ul><li>The anal stage, occurring from ages 1 to 3, involves developing control over sphincters, particularly during toilet training.</li><li>This stage intensifies aggressive and libidinal drives, leading to conflicts with parents over control.</li><li>Successful resolution fosters autonomy and independence, while maladaptive traits may include orderliness, obstinacy, and defiance.</li><li>Poor resolution can result in ambivalence and sadomasochistic tendencies, often seen in obsessive-compulsive neuroses.</li></ul></li><li>Urethral Stage<ul><li>The urethral stage, a transitional phase between the anal and phallic stages, involves pleasure in urination and control issues.</li><li>It reflects characteristics from both stages. Key traits include competitiveness and ambition, often arising from shame related to urethral control.</li><li>It plays a significant role in developing gender identity and self-competence.</li></ul></li><li>Phallic Stage<ul><li>The phallic stage occurs from ages 3 to 5, focusing sexual interest on the genital area.</li><li>Children develop unconscious fantasies about the opposite-sex parent and experience castration anxiety and guilt over masturbation.</li><li>This stage lays the groundwork for gender identity and character organization, with pathologies linked to Oedipal conflicts and internalization of parental influences.</li></ul></li><li>Latency Stage<ul><li>The latency stage, from ages 5-6 to 11-13, features a relative quiescence of sexual drives following the Oedipus complex.</li><li>During this period, children focus on skill development and peer relationships, with sexual interests subdued. The emergence of the superego aids impulse control, fostering adaptive functioning and mastery.</li><li>This stage is crucial for forming gender identity and social skills, with potential pathologies linked to either excessive or insufficient inner control.</li></ul></li><li>Genital Stage<ul><li>The genital stage, from ages 11-13 to young adulthood, marks the onset of puberty and intensified libidinal drives.</li><li>This phase revisits conflicts from previous psychosexual stages, allowing for their resolution and the formation of a mature sexual identity.</li><li>Key objectives include establishing non-incestuous relationships and integrating adult roles.</li><li>Successful resolution leads to a cohesive identity and the ability to engage meaningfully in work and relationships.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Tags:</strong></p><p><strong>Topic:</strong> Sigmund Freud, Psychosexual development</p><p><strong>Difficulty Level:</strong> Good to know</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Kaplan &amp; Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Chapter 34, Page Number: 3332</p>",
