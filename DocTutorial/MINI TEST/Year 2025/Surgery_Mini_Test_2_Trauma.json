      "solution": "<p>Option A (Serum lactate &gt;5 mmol/L): Correct. Elevated serum lactate (&gt;5 mmol/L) is a physiological indication for damage control surgery. This reflects tissue hypoxia and metabolic acidosis, signaling a decline in physiological reserve.</p> <p>Option B (Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg for &gt;60 minutes): Correct. Persistent hypotension (SBP &lt;90 mmHg for &gt;60 minutes) is an indication for damage control surgery, as it suggests inadequate perfusion and shock.</p> <p>Option C (Ability to achieve hemostasis): Incorrect. The inability to achieve hemostasis is a key anatomical indication for damage control surgery. If hemostasis cannot be achieved, damage control surgery is considered to temporarily control the situation.</p> <p>Option D (Inability to approximate the abdominal incision): Correct.
