      "solution": "<p>Patients with cirrhosis who are admitted with gastro- intestinal tract bleeding should receive prophylactic antibiotics even if there is no ascites. Oral norfloxacin is probably sufficient, although a recent trial suggested that a third-generation cephalosporin may be more effective if there is a high prevalence of quinolone resistance. Much of the recent reduction in mortality related to variceal bleed- ing is probably due to the increasing use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with cirrhosis and gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portal systemic shunt is not necessary unless bleeding cannot be controlled with endoscopy or medical therapy. Although the hemoglobin level should be carefully monitored, the patient is hemodynamically stable and does not need transfusion now. Overtransfusion, when hemoglobin is greater than 8 to 9 g/dL, can precipitate recurrence of bleeding and fluid overload. Fresh frozen plasma is also not necessary since the INR is relatively normal. A decision about pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment of hepatitis C should be deferred until the patient has recovered from this bleeding episode.</p>",
