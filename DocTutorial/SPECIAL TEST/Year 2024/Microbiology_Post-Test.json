Instead, Streptolysin O is responsible for beta hemolysis in Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus).</li></ul><p><strong>Option B) Beta hemolysis: Streptolysin</strong></p><ul><li>Beta hemolysis is the complete lysis of red blood cells around bacterial colonies on blood agar plates, creating a clear zone.</li><li>Streptolysin, which includes both Streptolysin O and Streptolysin S, is responsible for beta hemolysis. In the case of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus), it is primarily Streptolysin O that causes beta hemolysis.</li></ul><p><strong>Option C) Alpha hemolysis: Serum opacity factor</strong></p><ul><li>Alpha hemolysis is not typically associated with a virulence factor called \"serum opacity factor.\" Instead, alpha hemolysis is often seen with Streptococcus pneumoniae, which releases hydrogen peroxide and pneumolysin as virulence factors.</li></ul><p><strong>Option D) Gamma hemolysis: esterase</strong></p><ul><li>Gamma hemolysis is the term used when there is no hemolysis or discoloration of the agar around bacterial colonies.
