Axial Myopia results from an increase in antero-posterior length of the eyeball. It is defined as an axial length above the normal and too long for the refractive power of the whole optical system of the eye. High myopia has become one of the major causes of visual field defects, visual impairment and blindness.</li><li>Curvature myopia: Curvature Myopia occurs due to increased curvature of the cornea, lens or both. It is a condition where corneal curvature is increased than normal(i.e. radius of curvature is decreased), as a result, refractive power of cornea increases and light rays meet, in front of retina.</li><li>Positional myopia: Positional Myopia is produced by anterior placement of crystalline lens in the eye. It is a condition where the lens is abnormally placed in front of its normal location, as a result the focal point is found in front of the retina.</li><li>Index myopia: Index Myopia occurs from increase in the refractive index of crystalline lens associated with nuclear sclerosis. It happens in old age(associated with cataract), when the refractive index of lens increases, resulting in increased power of lens, so that light rays meet in front of the fovea.</li><li>Pseudomyopia: Pseudomyopia also known as Artificial Myopia, it may be produced in conditions such as excessive accommodation and spasm of accommodation. Pseudomyopia or Artificial myopia also develops after full hyperopic correction in children.</li></ol><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Comprehensive <strong>Ophthalmology </strong>by A.K.khurana, 4<sup>th</sup> edition, Page no. 12-26.</p>",

The distance between two focal points is called Sturm's conoid interval.</p><p>Astigmatism is a type of refractive error due to rotational asymmetry in the eye's refractive power. This results in distorted or blurred vision at any distance. Other symptoms can include eyestrain, headaches and trouble driving at night. Astigmatism often occurs at birth and can change or develop later in life. If it occurs in early life and is left untreated, it may result in amblyopia.</p><p>The cause of astigmatism involves an irregular curvature of the cornea and protective reaction changes in the lens of the eye, called lens astigmatism, that has the same mechanism as spasm of accommodation. Diagnosis is by an eye examination called autorefractor keratometry(objective, allows to see lens and cornea components of astigmatism) and subjective refraction.</p><p>Three treatment options are available: glasses, contact lenses, and surgery. Glasses are the simplest. Contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision and less artifacts than even double aspheric lenses. Refractive surgery permanently changes the shape of the eye and thereby cures astigmatism.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Kanski, 5th edition.</p>",

Secondary deviation is the deviation of normal eye seen under cover, when the patient is made to fix with the squinting eye.</li><li>Restriction of ocular movements</li><li>Compensatory head posture: Patients with a paralytic squint move their head such that the eyes occupy a position in the orbit where the angle of squint is minimal and this can avoid confusion and diplopia. Head is turned towards the action of paralysed muscle. When the horizontal recti(medial or lateral) are affected, the characteristic posture is a turn of the face to right or left, e.g. in left lateral rectus palsy the head is turned to the left and in left medial rectus palsy the head is turned to the right. When a vertical rectus(superior or inferior) or an oblique muscle is affected, a tilt of the head to the right or left with depression or elevation of the chin is adopted to reduce both the vertical deviation and rotation, e.g in superior oblique palsy(dextrodepression of left eye is affected). The head is tilted to the left so that the left eye can see down and medially.</li><li>There is false projection or orientation</li><li>There is no amblyopia and visual acuity is normal as paralytic squint develops in adults when visual acuity has already develop</li></ol><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Comprehensive <strong>Ophthalmology by </strong>khurana, 4th edition, Page no. 86.</p>",

This is a rare disorder and can be of two types-septic cavernous thrombosis and aseptic cavernous thrombosis. The most common form is septic cavernous sinus thrombosis. The cause is usually from a spreading infection in the nose, sinuses, ears, or teeth. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus are often the associated bacteria.</p><p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis symptoms include: decrease or loss of vision, chemosis, exophthalmos (bulging eyes), headaches, and paralysis of the cranial nerves which course through the cavernous sinus. This infection is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment, which usually includes antibiotics and sometimes surgical drainage. Aseptic cavernous sinus thrombosis is usually associated with trauma, dehydration, anemia, and other disorders.</p><p>Signs and symptoms</p><p>The most common signs of CST are related to anatomical structures affected within the cavernous sinus, notably cranial nerves III-VI, as well as symptoms resulting from impaired venous drainage from the orbit and eye. Classic presentations are abrupt onset of unilateral periorbital edema, headache, photophobia, and bulging of the eye (exophthalmos).</p><p>Other common signs and symptoms include:</p><p>Ptosis, chemosis, cranial nerve palsies (III, IV, V, VI). Sixth nerve palsy is the most common. Sensory deficits of the ophthalmic and maxillary branch of the fifth nerve are common. Periorbital sensory loss and impaired corneal reflex may be noted. Papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, and decreased visual acuity and blindness may occur from venous congestion within the retina. Fever, tachycardia and sepsis may be present. Headache with nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness) may occur. One or both pupils may be dilated and sluggishly reactive. Infection can spread to contralateral cavernous sinus within 24-48 hours of initial presentation.</p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V2LBNEETPG/PreTestQuiz/Ophthalmology010102024/19E1.jpg\"><p><strong>Reference:</strong> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_sinus_thrombosis</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Parson, Section IV, p. 268-276</p>",

It is intermediate in size between the other two branches of the ophthalmic nerve, the frontal nerve, and the lacrimal nerve.</p><p>Nasociliary nerve block is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of Charlin syndrome, which is also known as <em>nasociliary neuralgia</em>. It is due to the dysfunction of the nasociliary ganglion in a manner analogous to the dysfunction of the sphenopalatine ganglion, which is thought to be the source of cluster headaches. The presenting symptom of patients with Charlin syndrome is severe paroxysms of ocular or retro-orbital pain that radiates into the ipsilateral forehead, nose, and maxillary region. This pain is associated with voluminous ipsilateral rhinorrhea and congestion of the nasal mucosa as well as significant inflammation of the affected eye. The pain of Charlin syndrome has a rapid onset to peak, with attacks lasting 45 to 60 minutes.</p><p>The nasociliary nerve is blocked prior to its division into nasal branches of the anterior ethmoidal nerve and the infratrochlear nerve, close to the ethmoidal foramen.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Kanski 7/e, p. 256-258</p>",
