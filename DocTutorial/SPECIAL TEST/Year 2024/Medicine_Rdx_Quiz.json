In the obstructive form of HOCM, maneuvers that increase the amount of outflow obstruction will increase the intensity of the murmur. Outflow obstruction is increased by decreasing preload, which occurs in standing, performing a Valsalva maneuver, or with the administration of vasodilators. Increasing preload by squatting or passive leg raise will lead to reduction of outflow tract obstruction and a dminished murmur. The murmur of HOCM will also decrease with increasing afterload (vasopressors) or decreasing contractility (beta blockers). The murmur of aortic stenosis is typically in the right second intercostal space and radiates to the carotids. Valsalva maneuver will classically lead to a decreased aortic stenosis murmur. The murmur of congenital pulmonic stenosis is in the right second intercostal space. There is often a parasternal lift. Mitral valve prolapse causes a late systolic murmur usually introduced by an ejection click. It does not cause a crescendo-decrescendo murmur.</p>",
