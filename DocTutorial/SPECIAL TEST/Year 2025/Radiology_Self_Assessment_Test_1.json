Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome results when hyperstimulation of the ovaries is associated with an aberration of the fluid balance. It is characterized by third-space fluid accumulation and electrolyte abnormalities. On imaging, symmetric enlargement of bilateral ovaries is seen which contain multiple cystic areas of varying sizes which represent enlarged follicles or corpus luteal cysts in the presence of ascites. The \"spoke wheel\" appearance has been described with peripherally located follicles surrounding a central core of ovarian stroma. The cysts are usually anechoic but may contain hemorrhage.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic, progressive inflammatory arthritis which chiefly involves the synovial joints of the spine along with the adjacent soft tissues as well as the sacroiliac joints, although peripheral, large joints such as the hips, shoulders and knee can also be involved.</p><p>Radiological features:</p><p>SI joints: The classic sacroiliitis is bilateral and symmetrical. Changes occur in both the synovial along with ligamentous (superior and posterior) parts of the sacroiliac joints. The earliest radiographic findings occur in the subchondral cortex which appears blurred or lost. Later, small (rat-bite) erosions appear which are worse along the iliac aspect of the joint. These cause widening of the joint space with hazy margins. This is followed by larger erosions, subjacent sclerosis and joint space narrowing as irregular new bone bridges the joint space with eventual ankylosis and resolution of the sclerosis. The modified New York criteria is used for grading of sacroiliitis and was established in 1994.</p><p>Spine: Spinal involvement classically starts at the dorsolumbar or lumbosacral junction with subsequent progressive involvement of the rest of the spine in an ascending manner. Erosions initially occur at the vertebral margins at the site of attachment of the outer fibers of the annulus fibrosus (Romanus lesions) with adjacent sclerosis (shiny corner sign). Healing of these erosions or laying down of bone beneath the anterior longitudinal ligament causes \"squaring\" of the vertebral bodies, best appreciated on lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine. Exuberant new bone formation may even cause anterior convexity of the vertebral body (barrel-shaped vertebrae). As the disease progresses, there is syndesmophyte formation along the anterior and anterolateral aspects of the body due to ossification in the annulus. Similar ossifications may be seen in the interspinous ligaments and facet joints causing the dagger and tram-track signs respectively. Facet joint ankylosis is the major factor causing loss of spinal mobility.</p>",
