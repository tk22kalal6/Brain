Unlike bulimia, anorexia does not typically involve recurrent bingeing followed by purging behaviors.</p><p><strong>Atypical depression (Option C):</strong> Features include increased appetite, hypersomnia, mood reactivity, and leaden paralysis. While increased eating may occur, it does not involve bingeing with compensatory vomiting.</p><p><strong>Binge eating disorder (Option D):</strong> Involves recurrent binge eating episodes but <strong>without compensatory behaviors</strong> like vomiting or excessive exercise. Patients often become obese due to unopposed overeating.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p><p><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong> is defined by binge eating followed by <strong>purging or other compensatory mechanisms</strong>, often with normal body weight. It is treated with <strong>cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong> as first-line, alongside nutritional rehabilitation and medications like <strong>fluoxetine</strong>.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The patient's use of \"cyana-pi\" exemplifies a neologism, which is a newly coined, non-existent, and often meaningless word invented by the individual.</strong></li><li>The inability to explain it further reinforces this. His description of a \"wristwatch\" as a \"time vessel\" is a classic example of a metonym, where an unusual, symbolic, or indirectly associated term is used to refer to a common object or concept instead of its direct name.</li><li>Both neologisms and metonyms are recognized forms of formal thought disorder frequently observed in schizophrenia, particularly in its paranoid presentation.</li></ul><p><strong>Explanation of Other Options:</strong></p><p><strong>Neologism and Circumstantiality disorder (Option A):</strong> While \"cyana-pi\" fits neologism, circumstantiality involves excessive and unnecessary detail in speech before eventually returning to the main point. The patient's inability to \"reach a conclusion\" for \"cyana-pi\" doesn't align with the characteristic \"returning to the point\" of circumstantiality.</p><p><strong>Tangentiality and Circumstantiality (Option B):</strong> Tangentiality describes speech that repeatedly veers off-topic and never returns to the original point, which could partially explain the inability to explain \"cyana-pi.\" However, there is no indication of circumstantiality (roundabout but eventually relevant responses), and the core features of \"cyana-pi\" and \"time vessel\" are specifically neologism and metonymy.</p><p><strong>Incoherence and Flight of ideas (Option D):</strong> Incoherence (also known as \"word salad\") implies a complete lack of logical or understandable connections between thoughts, making speech virtually incomprehensible. Flight of ideas involves rapidly shifting from one topic to another with superficial associations, typically seen in manic episodes. The patient's speech, while distorted in word choice, is not described as completely unintelligible or rapidly shifting between unrelated topics in the manner of incoherence or flight of ideas. The examples provided suggest structured but altered word usage.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Formal thought disorder (FTD)</strong> is a hallmark symptom of schizophrenia, manifesting as disorganised thinking patterns reflected in speech.</li><li><strong>Neologisms</strong> are newly invented words without meaning to others.</li><li><strong>Metonyms</strong> involve using indirect or symbolic substitutions for common words or concepts.</li></ul><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"width:50%;height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizJul2025/SpecialGTII27072025/56E.png\">",
