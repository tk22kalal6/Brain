Medical practitioners or institutions providing services entirely free of charge are exempted.</p><ol><li><strong>Government hospitals where patients are not charged at all</strong> -Exempted, as treatment is fully free.</li><li><strong>Private hospitals providing services free of charge to all</strong> - Exempted, as no commercial transaction occurs.</li><li><strong>Hospitals collecting only nominal registration fees</strong> but offering all other services free - Exempted, as such minor fees are not considered professional charges under CPA.</li></ol><p><strong>Doctors NOT Exempted from CPA:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Private hospitals where all patients are charged</strong> - These are <strong>clearly covered under CPA</strong>, as service is rendered for payment.</li><li><strong>Hospitals where some patients are charged and others are not</strong> - <strong>Also covered under CPA</strong>, as the institution cannot claim full exemption when any part of its services involves payment. The paying patients qualify as consumers under the Act.</li></ol><p>Thus, option <strong>(d)</strong> - doctors working in hospitals where some patients are charged, and some are not - are <strong>not exempted</strong> under the CPA.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>CPA applies</strong> when services are rendered <strong>for a fee</strong>.</li><li><strong>Free government or charitable hospitals</strong> are <strong>exempted</strong>.</li><li><strong>Mixed model hospitals</strong> (some free, some paid) fall <strong>within CPA jurisdiction</strong>.</li><li><strong>Nominal registration fees</strong> do <strong>not qualify</strong> as a paid service under CPA.</li></ul>",
