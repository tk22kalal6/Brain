In the first 2 weeks of life, the mother is advised to do gentle corrective manipulation of the foot. From 2 weeks onwards the child should be under the care of an orthopaedic surgeon, who will put weekly corrective casts. The technique we currently use for correcting CTEV is the Ponseti technique.</p><ul><li>Ponsetti's philosophy: This philosophy is based on better understanding of the pathoanatomy of the deformed foot. According to Ponsetti, the calcaneo-cuboid-navicular complex is internally rotated (adducted) under the plantarflexed talus, Hence, the deformity can be corrected by bringing the complex back under the talus by gradually stretching the tight structures. This is done by putting thumb pressure over the talus head (and not over calcaneo-cuboid joint as in Kite's method). By doing this, the calcaneocuboid-navicular complex is externally rotated under the talar head.</li></ul>",

This helps to prevent skin breakdown and allows for early weight-bearing in certain lower extremity injuries or conditions.</p><p><strong>Key features of a PTB cast include:</strong></p><p>Extending from just below the knee to the toes</p><p>Incorporating a window over the patellar tendon and tibial tuberosity</p><p>Allowing for weight-bearing through the patellar tendon</p><p><strong>The other options can be ruled out as follows:</strong></p><p>A.
