The condition is usually unilateral and affects middle-aged patients. The iritis is generally mild with small, discrete, round keratitic precipitates. The acute attack usually resolves within a few weeks. The intraocular pressure typically returns to normal between attacks, but a chronic glaucoma may develop over time with recurrent episodes. Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis, pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, and pigmentary glaucoma are generally associated with chronic pressure elevation.</p>",

Atropine stimulates many medullary centres- vagal, respiratory, vasomotor.

It is due to blockade of M2 receptors on the SA node P-R interval is shortened.</li><li>Eye: Topical instillation of atropine causes mydriasis, abolition of light reflex and cycloplegia lasting 7-10 days. This results in photophobia and blurring of near vision. The ciliary muscles recover somewhat earlier than sphincter pupillae. The intraocular tension tends to rise, especially in narrow angle glaucoma.</li><li>Atropine causes bronchodilatation and reduces airway resistance, especially in COPD and asthma patients.</li><li>Atropine has relaxant action on ureter and urinary bladder; urinary retention can occur in older males with prostatic hypertrophy. However, this relaxant action can be beneficial for increasing bladder capacity and controlling detrusor hyperreflexia in neurogenic bladder/enuresis.</li><li>Atropine markedly decreases sweat, salivary, tracheobronchial and lacrimal secretion (M3 blockade).</li><li>Skin and eyes become dry, talking and swallowing may be difficult.</li><li>Body temperature: <strong>Rise in body temperature occurs at higher doses.</strong> It is due to both inhibition of sweating as well as stimulation of temperature regulating centre in the hypothalamus.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Doctrine of Anticipation:</strong></p><p>The doctrine of anticipation, also known as \"substituted judgment\" or \"best interest standard\", is used when making medical decisions on behalf of a patient who lacks the capacity to provide informed consent.</p><p>This situation often arises when a patient is mentally incapacitated or unable to make decisions due to a medical condition or disability.</p><p>In the doctrine of anticipation, the healthcare provider or the patient's legal representative (such as a family member or a court-appointed guardian) <strong>makes medical decisions based on what the patient would have chosen if they were capable of making their own decisions.</strong></p><p>Section 30 of BNS provides immunity to the doctor under such circumstances.</p><p><strong>Section 30 BNS: Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.-</strong>Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person forwhose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit:</p><p><strong>Doctrine of extended consent:</strong></p><p>The Extension Doctrine deals with the extenuating circumstance when the patient originally consented for a specific procedure, but at the time of performance of such procedure, further issues are encountered that are best resolved at the current time. If it is infeasible at that time to further consent the patient, or the person providing consent for the patient, then the original consent would be extended to cover the unexpected further care. This is only deemed true, though, if the additional procedure is medically appropriate and does not interfere with future reproductive capabilities.</p><p>The Extension Doctrine obviously does not hold true in cases where the patient has previously refused care, the nature of which is being pondered at the time of procedure. Also, if proposed further care may interfere with future reproductive capabilities, then the current procedure must be concluded and the patient expressly consented for the further care before it is provided. If the physician is in any way aware that additional care may needed during a procedure, then this should be explained and consented for at the time of original consent.</p><p><strong>Res ipsa loquitor</strong></p><p>Ordinarily, the professional negligence of a physician must be proved in Court by the expert evidence of another physician. The patient need not prove negligence in case where the rule of res ipsa loquitur applies, which means \"the thing or fact speaks for itself\". The patient has to merely state what according to him was the act of negligence.</p><p><strong>Conditions to be satisfied:</strong></p><ol><li>That in the absence of negligence the injury would not have occurred ordinarily.</li><li>That the doctor had exclusive control over the injury producing instrument or treatment.</li><li>That the patient was not guilty of contributory negligence.</li></ol><p>This enables the patient's lawyer to prove his case without medical evidence.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ol><li>Prescribing an overdose of medicine producing ill-effects.</li><li>Giving poisonous medicine carelessly.</li><li>Failure to give anti-tetanic serum in cases of injury causing tetanus.</li><li>Burns from application of hot water bottles or from X-ray therapy.</li><li>Breaking of needles.</li><li>Failure to remove the swabs/instruments during operation which may lead to complications or cause death.</li><li>Blood transfusion misadventure.</li><li>Loss of use of hand due to prolonged splinting.</li></ol><p><strong>Application:</strong> This doctrine is applied both to civil and criminal negligence. It does not apply where common knowledge or experience is not sufficiently extensive to know that the patient's condition would not have existed but for the doctor's negligence. It cannot be applied against several defendants only one of whom, who cannot be identified could have caused patient's injury.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\"http://radiology.con.mk/consent/2/extension_doctrine.html?i=1\">http://radiology.con.mk/consent/2/extension_doctrine.html?i=1</a></p>",

In more severe cases a scarring or a circle may be seen within the cornea.</p><p>Munson's sign, a protrusion of the lower eyelid in downgaze.</p><p>The most common sign of keratoconus is a scissor reflex on retinoscopy. The light reflex, instead of being evenly distributed, appears to have a dark centre, thus creating the scissor effect.</p><p>The central or paracentral cornea undergoes progressive thinning and steepening causing irregular astigmatism.</p><p>An increase in the size of the eyeball can cause axial myopia and an increase in corneal diameter can cause thinning of the cornea and breaks in the Descemet's membrane.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Doctrine of Anticipation:</strong></p><p>The doctrine of anticipation, also known as \"substituted judgment\" or \"best interest standard\", is used when making medical decisions on behalf of a patient who lacks the capacity to provide informed consent.</p><p>This situation often arises when a patient is mentally incapacitated or unable to make decisions due to a medical condition or disability.</p><p>In the doctrine of anticipation, the healthcare provider or the patient's legal representative (such as a family member or a court-appointed guardian) <strong>makes medical decisions based on what the patient would have chosen if they were capable of making their own decisions.</strong></p><p>Section 30 of BNS provides immunity to the doctor under such circumstances.</p><p><strong>Section 30 BNS: - Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.-</strong>Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person forwhose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit:</p><p><strong>Doctrine of extended consent:</strong></p><p>The Extension Doctrine deals with the extenuating circumstance when the patient originally consented for a specific procedure, but at the time of performance of such procedure, further issues are encountered that are best resolved at the current time. If it is infeasible at that time to further consent the patient, or the person providing consent for the patient, then the original consent would be extended to cover the unexpected further care. This is only deemed true, though, if the additional procedure is medically appropriate and does not interfere with future reproductive capabilities.</p><p>The Extension Doctrine obviously does not hold true in cases where the patient has previously refused care, the nature of which is being pondered at the time of procedure. Also, if proposed further care may interfere with future reproductive capabilities, then the current procedure must be concluded and the patient expressly consented for the further care before it is provided. If the physician is in any way aware that additional care may needed during a procedure, then this should be explained and consented for at the time of original consent.</p><p><strong>Res ipsa loquitor</strong></p><p>Ordinarily, the professional negligence of a physician must be proved in Court by the expert evidence of another physician. The patient need not prove negligence in case where the rule of res ipsa loquitur applies, which means \"the thing or fact speaks for itself\". The patient has to merely state what according to him was the act of negligence.</p><p><strong>Conditions to be satisfied:</strong></p><ol><li>That in the absence of negligence the injury would not have occurred ordinarily.</li><li>That the doctor had exclusive control over the injury producing instrument or treatment.</li><li>That the patient was not guilty of contributory negligence.</li></ol><p>This enables the patient's lawyer to prove his case without medical evidence.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ol><li>Prescribing an overdose of medicine producing ill-effects.</li><li>Giving poisonous medicine carelessly.</li><li>Failure to give anti-tetanic serum in cases of injury causing tetanus.</li><li>Burns from application of hot water bottles or from X-ray therapy.</li><li>Breaking of needles.</li><li>Failure to remove the swabs/instruments during operation which may lead to complications or cause death.</li><li>Blood transfusion misadventure.</li><li>Loss of use of hand due to prolonged splinting.</li></ol><p><strong>Application:</strong> This doctrine is applied both to civil and criminal negligence. It does not apply where common knowledge or experience is not sufficiently extensive to know that the patient's condition would not have existed but for the doctor's negligence. It cannot be applied against several defendants only one of whom, who cannot be identified could have caused patient's injury.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> http://radiology.con.mk/consent/2/extension_doctrine.html?i=1</p>",
