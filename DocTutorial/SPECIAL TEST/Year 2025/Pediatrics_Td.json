      "solution": "<p>There is a set of principles that characterizes the pattern and process of growth and development. Typical development is a predictable and orderly process; Although there are individual differences in children's personalities, activity levels, and timing of developmental milestones, the principles and characteristics of development have universal patterns.</p><ol><li><strong>Development proceeds from the head downward.</strong><ol><li>This is called the cephalocaudal principle. This principle describes the direction of growth and development. According to this principle, the child gains control of the head first, then the arms, and then the legs.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Development proceeds from the center of the body outward.</strong><ol><li>This is the principle of proximodistal development that also describes the direction of development. This means that the spinal cord develops before outer parts of the body. The child's arms develop before the hands and the hands and feet develop before the fingers and toes. Finger and toe muscles (used in fine motor dexterity) are the last to develop in physical development.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Development depends on maturation and learning.</strong><ol><li><strong>Maturation</strong> refers to the sequential characteristic of biological growth and development. The biological changes occur in sequential order and give children new abilities.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Development proceeds from the simple (concrete) to the more complex- orthogenetic principle</strong></li><li><strong>Growth and development is a continuous process.</strong><ol><li>As a child develops, he or she adds to the skills already acquired and the new skills become the basis for further achievement and mastery of skills. Most children follow a similar pattern. Also, one stage of development lays the foundation for the next stage of development.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Growth and development proceed from the general to specific.</strong><ol><li>Growth occurs from large muscle movements to more refined (smaller) muscle movements.</li></ol></li><li><strong>There are individual rates of growth and development.</strong><ol><li>Each child is different and the rates at which individual children grow is different. Although the patterns and sequences for growth and development are usually the same for all children, the rates at which individual children reach developmental stages will be different.</li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>Reference</strong>: Illingworth's The Development of the Infant and Young Child: Normal and Abnormal, 11e, page 4 </p>",
