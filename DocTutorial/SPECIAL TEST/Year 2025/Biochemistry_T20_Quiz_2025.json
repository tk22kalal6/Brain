This leads to <strong>impaired glycogenolysis</strong>, resulting in <strong>hepatomegaly</strong>, <strong>mild fasting hypoglycemia</strong>, and <strong>elevated liver enzymes</strong>. It is generally a <strong>milder form</strong> of glycogen storage disease. Type V affects muscle, Type I has severe hypoglycemia, and Type III involves a debranching enzyme defect.</p>",
