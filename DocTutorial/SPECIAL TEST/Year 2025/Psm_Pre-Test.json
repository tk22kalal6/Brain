Sensitivity: Sensitivity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify individuals with the condition (true positives) out of all the individuals who truly have the disease (true positives + false negatives).<br /> Changing the cutoff value from 126 mg/dl to 200 mg/dl will likely decrease sensitivity because some individuals with diabetes who have blood sugar levels between these two cutoffs may now be classified as non-diabetic (false negatives).</p><p>b. False positives: False positives occur when individuals without the condition are incorrectly identified as having the condition when they are actually disease-free. Raising the cutoff value from 126 mg/dl to 200 mg/dl will likely decrease false positives, rather than increase them, leading to an increase in specificity, because fewer individuals with blood sugar levels between these two cutoffs will be classified as diabetic.</p><p>c. All the above: This option suggests that there will be an increase in sensitivity, specificity, and false positives. However, as explained above, sensitivity is likely to decrease, and false positives are likely to decrease, while specificity is likely to increase.

Immediate testing after exposure allows for early detection of any potential HIV infection.

This schedule is appropriate for treating moderate vitamin A deficiency, as indicated by the presence of Bitot spots. It follows the WHO-recommended dosage schedule for treating vitamin A deficiency in children.</p><p>Bitot spots are a clinical sign of vitamin A deficiency and indicate a deficiency in the child. Vitamin A supplementation is necessary to address this deficiency and prevent further complications.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>b) 2 lakh IU on day 0, 1, and 14:</strong>This option provides a higher total dose of 6 lakh IU of vitamin A over 14 days. While this dose may be appropriate for severe cases of vitamin A deficiency, it is higher than the standard recommended dose for treating moderate deficiency, as indicated by Bitot spots. Such a high dose may increase the risk of adverse effects and is not necessary in this case.</p><p><strong>c) 1 lakh IU on day 0, 1:</strong>This option provides only 2 doses of 1 lakh IU of vitamin A, without a follow-up dose on day 14. The recommended schedule for treating moderate vitamin A deficiency, as indicated by Bitot spots, includes a follow-up dose on day 14 to ensure adequate supplementation and replenishment of vitamin A stores.</p><p><strong>d) 2 lakh IU on day 0, 1:</strong>Similar to option b), this option provides a higher total dose of 4 lakh IU of vitamin A over 2 days without a follow-up dose on day 14. Again, this dose is higher than the standard recommended dose for treating moderate deficiency and may not be necessary in this case.</p><p>In summary, option a) (1 lakh IU on day 0, 1, and 14) is the most appropriate choice because it follows the WHO-recommended dosage schedule for treating moderate vitamin A deficiency, as indicated by Bitot spots. Options b), c), and d) provide either higher doses or incomplete schedules, which may not be suitable for treating moderate deficiency in a 10-month-old child.

      "solution": "<p>The hyperpigmented skin lesions around the neck, often referred to as \"necklace sign\" or \"casal necklace,\" are characteristic dermatological manifestations of pellagra. Pellagra is a nutritional deficiency disease caused by a deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3) and/or tryptophan, an amino acid that can be converted to niacin in the body. Maize is a staple food in many regions, particularly in areas where pellagra is prevalent, and it is deficient in niacin unless treated with alkali, such as lime.</p><p><strong>a. Diarrhoea and dementia:</strong>This option is correct. Pellagra is characterized by the classic triad of symptoms, known as the \"4 Ds\": dermatitis (hyperpigmented skin lesions, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight), diarrhoea, dementia, and death if untreated. Therefore, it is crucial to ask about symptoms such as diarrhoea and cognitive impairment (dementia) in a patient presenting with hyperpigmented skin lesions characteristic of pellagra.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>b. Trauma:</strong>Trauma would not typically lead to hyperpigmented skin lesions around the neck unless there is a specific injury or irritation causing localized skin changes. Pellagra, on the other hand, is a systemic nutritional deficiency disease that manifests with characteristic skin lesions in areas exposed to sunlight.</p><p><strong>c. Family history:</strong>While family history is important in assessing the risk of certain conditions, it is less relevant in the context of pellagra, which is primarily caused by dietary deficiencies rather than genetic factors.</p><p><strong>d. Insect bite:</strong>Insect bites would not typically lead to hyperpigmented skin lesions resembling the \"necklace sign\" of pellagra. Pellagra is caused by nutritional deficiencies, particularly niacin deficiency, and manifests with characteristic skin changes, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurological manifestations.</p><p>In summary, option (a) is the most appropriate choice as it reflects the classic symptoms associated with pellagra and is relevant to the patient's presentation of hyperpigmented skin lesions around the neck. Options (b), (c), and (d) are less relevant in this context.</p><p><strong>Reference : </strong>Park's Preventive and social medicine, 27th Edition, Pg 734</p>",

Red: </strong>The red colour code indicates patients with severe or life-threatening injuries or medical conditions that require immediate medical attention. These patients have critical injuries or conditions that, if left untreated, could rapidly deteriorate or result in death. Red-tagged patients are prioritized for prompt medical treatment and transfer to medical facilities capable of providing advanced care.</p><p><strong>D. Blue: </strong>The blue colour code is typically used to designate patients with minor injuries or medical conditions that do not require immediate treatment. These patients may have minor cuts, bruises, or complaints that can be addressed after higher priority patients have been stabilized and treated.</p><p>In summary, the correct answer is C. Red because it indicates high priority treatment or transfer for patients with severe or life-threatening injuries or conditions. The other colour codes (black, yellow, and blue) represent different priority levels based on the severity of injuries or medical conditions, with red being the highest priority level for immediate medical intervention.</p><p><strong>Reference: </strong>Park's Preventive and social medicine, 27th EDITION Pg 923</p>",
