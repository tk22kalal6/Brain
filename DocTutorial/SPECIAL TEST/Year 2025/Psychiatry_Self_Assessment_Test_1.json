Opioids act on the central nervous system, including the brainstem, where they suppress the respiratory drive. This can lead to severely decreased or even stopped breathing, which is a medical emergency.</p><p>The <strong>drug of choice for reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression is naloxone, an opioid antagonist</strong>. Naloxone competitively binds to opioid receptors, displacing the opioids and rapidly reverses the effects of the opioids. It restores normal respiration and can save a person's life during an opioid overdose.</p><p>Other options:</p><p>A. Oral Naltrexone: Naltrexone is also an opioid antagonist similar to naloxone, but it is not the best choice in an acute opioid overdose situation. Oral naltrexone takes longer to be absorbed and act, making it less suitable for emergencies like severe respiratory depression in an opioid overdose.</p><p>C. Buprenorphine: Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist and antagonist used for opioid replacement therapy and managing opioid use disorder. While it can help with opioid withdrawal and cravings in a controlled setting, it is not the first-line choice for emergency reversal of opioid overdose and respiratory depression.</p><p>D. Flumazenil: Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepine overdose. It is not effective for opioid overdose or respiratory depression caused by opioids.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The symptoms described in the scenario, such as <em>irritability, disorientation, paranoid delusions, visual hallucinations and altered sensorium,</em> are characteristic of delirium tremens. Delirium tremens (DT) is a <strong>severe form of alcohol withdrawal</strong> that typically occurs in individuals with a history of heavy and prolonged alcohol use. It usually <strong>develops within 2 to 4 days after stopping alcohol</strong> consumption and is considered a medical emergency due to its potentially life-threatening complications.</p><p>Other Options:</p><p><strong>A. Alcohol withdrawal seizure</strong>- Alcohol withdrawal seizures are seizures that can occur in individuals <em>who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol intake</em>. While seizures can be part of alcohol withdrawal, the other symptoms described in the scenario are more indicative of delirium tremens.</p><p><strong>C. Wernicke's encephalopathy</strong>- Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurological disorder caused by <em>thiamine(vitamin B1) deficiency,</em>often associated with alcohol use disorder. It can present with a triad of symptoms, including <em>confusion, ataxia (lack of coordination) and eye movement abnormalities</em>. However, the symptoms described in the scenario go beyond the typical triad and are more consistent with delirium tremens.</p><p><strong>D. Korsakoff's psychosis</strong>- Korsakoff's psychosis is a <strong>chronic memory disorder</strong>caused by thiamine deficiency and often <strong>occurs as a result of Wernicke's encephalopathy</strong>. While it can cause memory deficits, it is not associated with the acute and severe symptoms described in the scenario. Delirium tremens is a more likely diagnosis given the acute presentation of symptoms after alcohol cessation</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Delirium tremens (DT)</strong> is an acute, severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can present with <strong>visual hallucinations</strong>, <strong>paranoid delusions</strong>, <strong>disorientation</strong>, and <strong>altered sensorium</strong>, typically developing 2 to 4 days after alcohol cessation.</li><li><strong>Alcohol withdrawal seizures</strong> are part of withdrawal but are more likely to occur within the first 24-48 hours and do not typically involve hallucinations or delusions.</li><li><strong>Wernicke's encephalopathy</strong> involves <strong>confusion</strong>, <strong>ataxia</strong>, and <strong>eye movement abnormalities</strong>, not the extensive psychiatric symptoms seen in DT.</li><li><strong>Korsakoff's psychosis</strong> is a <strong>chronic</strong> memory disorder that occurs after Wernicke's encephalopathy and is not associated with acute withdrawal symptoms like delirium or hallucinations.</li></ul>",

It can lead to difficulties in concentration, memory problems, and impaired decision-making abilities.</p><p><strong>Physiological Response:</strong> Stress activates the body's fight-or-flight response, which involves a cascade of physiological changes. These changes include increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, rapid breathing, muscle tension, and heightened alertness.</p><p><strong>Autonomic Response:</strong> The autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role in the stress response.</p><p><strong>Other options:</strong></p><p><strong>A.

      "solution": "<p>The described symptoms of intense cravings for food followed by recurrent vomiting are characteristic of bulimia nervosa. Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder that primarily affects young females and is characterised by recurrent episodes of binge eating. During these episodes, individuals <strong>consume large amounts of food in a short period,</strong> often feeling a loss of control during the process. To compensate for the excessive food intake and prevent weight gain, individuals with bulimia nervosa <strong>engage in behaviours like self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, fasting or excessive exercise.</strong></p><p>Other options:</p><p>A. Anorexia nervosa: Anorexia nervosa is another eating disorder, but it involves a different pattern of behaviour. Individuals with anorexia nervosa have a <strong>fear of gaining weight </strong>and they <strong>restrict their food intake significantly,</strong>leading to severe weight loss and potentially dangerously low body weight.</p><p>C. Atypical depression: Atypical depression is a subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD), characterised by mood reactivity (ability to experience improved mood in response to positive events), increased appetite or weight gain, excessive sleep and feeling of heaviness in the limbs. While appetite changes are present, the described pattern of intense cravings followed by recurrent vomiting is not typical for atypical depression.</p><p>D. Binge eating disorder: While the term \"binge eating\" is present in this option, it is important to distinguish binge eating disorder from bulimia nervosa. In binge eating disorder, individuals have recurrent episodes of binge eating similar to bulimia nervosa, but <strong><em>without compensatory behaviours </em></strong>such as vomiting. The absence of compensatory behaviours is a key distinction between the two disorders.</p>",
