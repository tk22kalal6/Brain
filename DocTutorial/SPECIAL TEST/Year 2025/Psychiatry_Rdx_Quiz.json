Patients are <strong>never symptom-free for more than 2 months</strong>, and the mood changes are <strong>not attributable to substances or medical illness</strong>.</li><li>This patient demonstrates the hallmark features: chronic mood instability, no major depressive or manic episodes, and normal physical/thyroid exam.</li></ul><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"width:50%;height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizOct2025/PsychiatryRDx17102025/1E.png\"> <p><strong>Explanation of the Incorrect Answers:</strong></p><p><strong>Bipolar I disorder:</strong> Requires at least one episode of mania with marked impairment, hospitalization, or psychotic features.
