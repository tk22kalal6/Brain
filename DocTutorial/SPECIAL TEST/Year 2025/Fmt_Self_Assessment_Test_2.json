      "solution": "<p>Above features is highly suggestive of viper bite.</p><p>Types of venom:</p><p>Neurotoxic - Cobra, krait</p><p>Hemotoxic - Vipers</p><p>Myotoxic - Sea snakes</p><p>FEATURES OF VIPER BITE</p><ul><li>The viperine venom is mainly haemolytic and causes intravascular haemolysis and depression of the coagulation mechanism.</li><li>The area around the bite is red and painful. The onset of swelling starts within fifteen minutes and there is often blood-stained discharge from the wound. Persistent bleeding from bite site is a constant feature. Blisters begin to appear in about 12 hours in and around the bite site, progressing subsequently to involve the entire limb.</li><li>Haematuria may be seen within a few hours of the bite. Prominent features are shock and haemorrhage.</li><li>In about 10 to 15% of the cases, extensive necrosis of skin, subcutaneous tissues and muscles may occur followed by epistaxis, haemoptysis, ecchymoses, intracranial and subconjunctival haemorrhages, and bleeding into the floor of the mouth, tympanic membrane, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract, retroperitoneum and intraperitoneum. In severe cases, the main feature is the persisting shock.</li><li>Bleeding and clotting time are usually prolonged. A haemorrhagic syndrome with blood-stained sputum, haemorrhages from the gums, rectum, the site of bite, etc., occur due to the increased coagulation time. Intravascular haemolysis may lead to haemoglobinuria.</li><li>In the case of Russell's viper and hump-nosed viper, renal failure is a frequent complication. Petechial haemorrhages are common. Death is usually due haemorrhage.</li></ul><p>FEATURES OF COBRA BITE</p><ul><li>Local symptoms start within 6 to 8 minutes. A small reddish wheal develops at the site of bite. The bitten area is tender with slight radiating burning pain and oozing of bloodstained fluid. Swelling may be minimal or even absent.</li><li>The patient feels sleepy, slightly intoxicated, weakness of legs and is reluctant to stand or move. Ptosis is the earliest neuroparalytic manifestation followed by ophthalmoplegia. There may be extraocular muscle weakness and strabismus.</li><li>Weakness of the muscles increases and develops into paralysis of the lower limbs. The paralysis then spreads to the trunk and affects the head which falls forward. The eyelids also hang down. After half to one hour, there is excessive salivation and even vomiting, headache, vertigo, paraesthesia around the mouth and myalgia. This is followed by paralysis of the facial muscles, palate, jaws, tongue, vocal cords, neck muscles. Muscles of deglutition become progressively flaccidly paralysed due to which there is difficulty in speech and swallowing. After about two hours, the paralysis is complete.</li><li>Respiratory arrest may occur due to obstruction of upper airway by the paralysed tongue or inhaled vomitus or due to paralysis of intercostal muscles and diaphragm. Coma sets in and finally the respirations stop with or without convulsions and the heart stops.</li></ul><p>FEATURES OF KRAIT BITE</p><ul><li>Symptoms resemble those of cobra bite, but there is no swelling or burning pain at the site of the bite and the convulsions are milder, while the feeling of drowsiness and intoxication is more intense. Albumin appears in urine.</li></ul><p>FEATURES OF SCORPION STING</p><ul><li>This venom contains neurotoxins that cause sodium channels to remain open. Such envenomation usually are associated with little swelling, but prominent pain, paraesthesia and hyperesthesia can be accentuated by tapping on the affected area (the tap test).</li><li>These symptoms soon spread to other locations; dysfunction of cranial nerves and hyperexcitability of skeletal muscles develop within hours. Patients present with restlessness, blurred vision, abnormal eye movements, profuse salivation, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, slurred speech, difficulty in handling secretions, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. Muscle twitching, jerking and shaking may be mistaken for a seizure.</li><li>Complications include tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and acidosis. Fatal respiratory arrest is most common among young children and the elderly.</li></ul><p>FEATURES OF WASP BITE</p><ul><li>Wasp venom is composed of biogenic amines like histamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, enzymes like Phospholipase A and B, hyaluronidase, toxic peptides etc.</li><li>Clinical Features: Local- Pain, redness, swelling</li><li>Systemic: Person allergic to venom may develop anaphylaxis - Tingling sensation, flushing, dizziness, syncope, vomiting and diarrhoea, wheezing, urticaria, angioedema, renal failure, haemolysis with haemoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis etc.</li></ul>",

In this chamber, the contraction of the layered<strong> thick wall</strong> may partly or wholly seal the wound, and<strong> bleeding can be slight.</strong> Hence, chances of survival are high when compared to other chambers of the heart..</p><p>The <strong>right ventricle</strong> is more commonly injured by a stab wound as it presents the largest frontal area. The injury to the right ventricle usually leads to <strong>copious bleeding</strong> into the pericardial sac. It is because of the inability of the <strong>thin wall</strong> to close the defect by muscle overlap and contraction.</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizJun2025/FMTSAII11062025/15E.jpg\">",
