The secondary oocyte does arrest in metaphase of the second meiotic division until fertilization occurs.</li></ul><p><strong>The process involved in the development of mature ovum is called Oogenesis.</strong></p><p><strong>Oogenesis Process:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Initiation of Oogenesis:</strong> Oogenesis is the process of forming female gametes, known as oocytes, from Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs). This process begins long before birth and takes place in the cortex of the ovary.</li><li><strong>PGC Division:</strong> PGCs undergo mitotic division to produce a large number of cells called oogonia.</li><li><strong>Formation of Primary Oocyte:</strong> Each oogonium enlarges to become a primary oocyte.</li><li><strong>Prophase of 1st Meiotic Division:</strong> The primary oocyte enters the prophase of the first meiotic division before birth. However, this division is arrested until puberty due to the presence of an oocyte maturation inhibitor (OMI) factor secreted by the follicular cells surrounding the oocyte.</li><li><strong>Completion of 1st Meiotic Division:</strong> The first meiotic division is completed only when primary oocytes start maturing and preparing for ovulation.</li><li><strong>Puberty and Ovulation:</strong> At puberty, during each ovarian cycle, 5-50 primary oocytes resume their first meiotic division, which is completed just before ovulation. This division results in two daughter cells, one of which is a secondary oocyte, and the other is the first polar body.</li><li><strong>Formation of Secondary Oocyte:</strong> The secondary oocyte enters the second meiotic division at the time of ovulation. However, this division is completed only after a sperm has penetrated the secondary oocyte. The second meiotic division is also unequal, resulting in one daughter cell receiving most of the cytoplasm and forming the ovum, while the other daughter cell receives a minimal amount of cytoplasm and forms the second polar body.</li><li><strong>Final Outcome:</strong> From one primary oocyte, only one ovum with 22 autosomes and one X chromosome is formed, along with three polar bodies, each containing 22 autosomes and one X chromosome.</li><li>This process of oogenesis is crucial for the production of female gametes and is tightly regulated by hormonal and physiological factors throughout a woman's reproductive life.</li></ol>",

The earliest sign of deficiency is a loss of sensitivity to green light, followed by impairment to adapt to dim light, then night blindness, an inability to see in the dark.</p><p>More prolonged deficiency leads to xerophthalmia: keratinization of the cornea and blindness. Vitamin A also has an important role in differentiation of immune system cells, and even mild deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. The synthesis of retinol-binding protein, which is required to transport the vitamin in the bloodstream, is reduced in response to infection(it is a negative acute phase protein), decreasing the circulating concentration of the vitamin and further impairing immune responses.</p><p>Option B: In the vitamin D deficiency disease rickets, the bones of children are under mineralized as a result of poor absorption of calcium. Similar problems occur as a result of deficiency during the adolescent growth spurt. Osteomalacia in adults results from the demineralization of bone, especially in women who have little exposure to sunlight, especially after several pregnancies.</p><p>Option C: Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy. Proline and lysine hydroxylases are required for the postsynthetic modification of procollagen to collagen. Both this enzyme requires vitamin C. So signs of vitamin C deficiency include skin changes, fragility of blood capillaries, gum decay, tooth loss and bone fracture, which can be attributed to impaired collagen synthesis(leading to delayed wound healing) and psychological changes that can be attributed to impaired synthesis of catecholamines.</p><p>Option D: Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding.</p><p>So This patient is likely to have Vitamin C deficiency.</p>",

This is because having multiple samples increases the likelihood of detecting the bacteria responsible for TB, especially considering the intermittent shedding of the bacteria in sputum.</p><p><strong>c. 3 sputum samples: </strong>While collecting three sputum samples may increase the chances of detecting TB bacteria, it's not typically necessary for initial diagnosis under RNTCP guidelines. Usually, if the first two samples are negative, additional diagnostic tests may be considered rather than collecting a third sample.</p><p><strong>d. 4 sputum samples: </strong>Collecting four sputum samples is not standard practice for diagnosing TB under RNTCP guidelines. It would be excessive and impractical in most cases.

      "solution": "<p>The correct answer is A: Clean drainage and sewage systems.</p><p><strong>Explanation of why option A is the most efficient anti-larval measure for preventing urban malaria and why the other options are not as effective:</strong></p><p><strong>A. Clean drainage and sewage systems:</strong>Keeping drainage and sewage systems clean and free of stagnant water is crucial for preventing the breeding of mosquitoes, including the Anopheles species responsible for transmitting malaria. Stagnant water in drainage systems provides an ideal breeding ground for mosquito larvae. By maintaining clean drainage and sewage systems, the standing water where mosquitoes lay their eggs is eliminated, thereby reducing the mosquito population and the risk of malaria transmission.</p><p><strong>B. Cover overhead tanks properly:</strong>While covering overhead tanks properly can prevent mosquitoes from accessing and breeding in stored water, it is not as effective as ensuring clean drainage and sewage systems. Mosquitoes can still breed in other water sources such as stagnant puddles, uncovered containers, or blocked drains if proper sanitation measures are not in place. Additionally, covering overhead tanks addresses only one potential breeding site for mosquitoes, whereas clean drainage systems address multiple potential breeding sites throughout urban areas.</p><p><strong>C. Filling cesspools and ditches:</strong>Filling cesspools and ditches can help eliminate stagnant water sources where mosquitoes breed. However, this measure may not be as comprehensive or sustainable as maintaining clean drainage and sewage systems. Filling cesspools and ditches is a reactive measure that addresses specific breeding sites, whereas clean drainage and sewage systems provide ongoing prevention by addressing the root cause of mosquito breeding in urban environments.</p><p><strong>D. Cover pits</strong>: Similar to covering overhead tanks, covering pits can prevent mosquitoes from accessing and breeding in stored water. However, like the previous option, this measure does not address the broader issue of stagnant water in drainage systems and other potential breeding sites. It provides localized prevention rather than addressing the systemic issue of mosquito breeding in urban areas.</p><p>In summary, option A, maintaining clean drainage and sewage systems, is the most efficient anti-larval measure for preventing urban malaria because it addresses multiple potential breeding sites for mosquitoes throughout urban environments. The other options, while helpful in reducing mosquito breeding in specific areas, are not as comprehensive or sustainable in preventing urban malaria transmission.</p>",

Improved healthcare, education, and access to family planning services often lead to a decline in both birth and death rates during this stage, with birth rates eventually tending to fall more rapidly than death rates.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>a. BR is lower than DR:</strong></p><p>This statement is not true for the late expanding stage. In this stage, birth rates (BR) typically remain relatively high, often higher than death rates (DR), contributing to population growth. So, BR being lower than DR would not be characteristic of this stage.</p><p><strong>b. DR begins to decline, while the BR remains unchanged:</strong></p><p>While it is true that death rates (DR) may begin to decline during the late expanding stage due to improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and living standards, birth rates (BR) also tend to decline, although not necessarily simultaneously. The statement implies that BR remains unchanged, which is not typical for this stage. Birth rates usually start to fall, although they may still be higher than death rates.</p><p><strong>d. High BR and high DR:</strong></p><p>This statement might describe an earlier stage of demographic transition, such as the early expanding stage or even the pre-transitional stage. However, in the late expanding stage, while birth rates may still be relatively high compared to developed countries, death rates begin to decline, resulting in a lower overall mortality rate compared to earlier stages. So, high death rates are not characteristic of the late expanding stage.</p><p>In summary, option \"c\" is true for the late expanding stage because it accurately reflects the ongoing decline in death rates and the tendency for birth rates to fall as a country progresses through this stage of demographic transition.</p>",

Air pollution.</p><p>The soiling index is indeed a measure related to air pollution.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not suitable:</strong></p><p><strong>a. Soil pollution:</strong>The soiling index does not directly measure soil pollution. Soil pollution refers to the contamination of soil with hazardous substances such as heavy metals, pesticides, industrial chemicals, or other pollutants. It typically involves assessing the concentration of contaminants in soil samples and evaluating their potential impacts on human health, ecosystems, and agricultural productivity.</p><p><strong>b. Water pollution:</strong>Similarly, the soiling index does not measure water pollution. Water pollution refers to the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater with harmful substances, pathogens, or other pollutants. Water pollution can result from various sources such as industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, sewage, and littering. Monitoring water pollution involves assessing water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, nutrient levels, and the presence of pollutants or pathogens.</p><p><strong>c. Noise pollution:</strong>The soiling index is not related to noise pollution. Noise pollution, also known as environmental noise, refers to the excessive or disturbing levels of noise in the environment that can have adverse effects on human health, wildlife, and quality of life. Common sources of noise pollution include transportation (e.g., road traffic, aircraft, trains), industrial activities, construction, and recreational activities. Monitoring noise pollution involves measuring sound levels in decibels (dB) and assessing their potential impacts on human health and well-being.</p><p>In summary, the soiling index is specifically associated with air pollution and is used to quantify the degree of soiling or staining of surfaces (e.g., buildings, monuments, vegetation) caused by airborne particles and pollutants. It serves as an indicator of air quality and pollution levels in urban and industrial areas. Options a, b, and c are incorrect because they describe different types of pollution that are not measured by the soiling index.</p>",

The parasite infects red blood cells, leading to symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and haemolytic anaemia.</p><p><strong>B. Tularemia (Tularaemia</strong>): Tularemia is a bacterial disease caused by Francisella tularensis. While ticks, including Dermacentor ticks, can transmit tularemia, Ixodes ticks are not the primary vectors for this disease. Instead, tularemia is commonly associated with bites from infected ticks, deer flies, and other insects, as well as exposure to infected animals or contaminated water or soil.</p><p><strong>C. Lyme disease:</strong>Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted primarily by the bite of infected Ixodes ticks, particularly Ixodes scapularis in the United States and Ixodes ricinus in Europe. Lyme disease can lead to a range of symptoms, including rash, fever, joint pain, and neurological problems, if left untreated.</p><p><strong>D.

However, the BIS is not solely focused on food standards; it covers a wide range of products and sectors.</p><p><strong>Codex Alimentarius</strong> is an international food standards body jointly established by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). It develops international food standards, guidelines, and codes of practice to ensure the safety, quality, and fairness of international food trade. While Codex standards influence food regulations worldwide, they are not specific to India.</p><p><strong>Agmark standards</strong> are related to agricultural products, including grains, pulses, spices, and vegetable oils, in India. The Agmark certification is a quality assurance mark that indicates compliance with the specified standards for agricultural commodities. However, it does not cover all food products, and its scope is limited to certain agricultural items.</p><p>Therefore, while all the options play a role in ensuring food quality and standards, the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) standards were specifically focused on regulating food safety and quality in India before the enactment of the Food Safety and Standards Act (FSSA) and the establishment of the FSSAI.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation to why other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>a. Start ART now and continue till 6 weeks of delivery:</strong>This option suggests initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) immediately upon diagnosis of HIV during the first trimester and continuing it until 6 weeks after delivery. However, this approach does not address the long-term management of HIV infection in the woman beyond the postpartum period. ART is recommended for life-long management of HIV infection to suppress the virus, prevent disease progression, and reduce the risk of transmission to the baby and sexual partners.</p><p><strong>c. Start ART after the first trimester and continue till 6 weeks of delivery:</strong>Delaying initiation of ART until after the first trimester may not be optimal for the health of the pregnant woman and her baby. Starting ART as soon as possible after diagnosis, regardless of trimester, is recommended to achieve viral suppression and reduce the risk of transmission to the baby. Additionally, stopping ART at 6 weeks postpartum may lead to rebound viremia and increased risk of disease progression.</p><p><strong>d. Start ART after the first trimester and continue life-long:</strong>Delaying initiation of ART until after the first trimester is not recommended, as it increases the risk of HIV transmission to the baby during pregnancy and childbirth. Additionally, discontinuing ART after delivery would leave the woman untreated, leading to increased risk of disease progression and transmission to sexual partners. Lifelong ART is the standard of care for HIV-positive individuals, including pregnant women, to achieve viral suppression and improve health outcomes.</p><p>In summary, option (b) Start ART now and continue life-long is the appropriate line of management for a pregnant woman found to be HIV-positive in the first trimester. Initiating ART immediately upon diagnosis and continuing it for life-long management is essential to suppress the virus, prevent disease progression, and reduce the risk of transmission to the baby and sexual partners.</p>",

It is a non-probability sampling method that relies on the convenience of the researcher or the participants. Convenience sampling is often used in situations where it is difficult or impractical to obtain a random sample from the population. While convenient, this sampling method may introduce bias into the sample and limit the generalizability of the findings to the broader population.</p><p><strong>Explanation why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>a. Simple random sampling:</strong>Simple random sampling involves randomly selecting individuals from the population, ensuring that each member has an equal chance of being chosen. It does not rely on the availability or willingness of individuals to participate, as the selection process is purely random. Therefore, convenience sampling is not an example of simple random sampling.</p><p><strong>b. Cluster sampling:</strong>Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and then randomly selecting clusters to include in the sample.

      "solution": "<p>The question describes a classic scenario of death by drowning, characterized by specific findings during a post-mortem examination. Here's how each option relates to this scenario:</p><ol><li>Ballooning of lungs:<ul><li>A key finding in drowning cases. The lungs become overdistended with water and air, resembling balloons, due to inhalation of water.</li></ul></li><li>Cadaveric spasm of hands with mud in a closed fist:<ul><li>Known as the \"washerwoman's hand sign,\" cadaveric spasm indicates that the individual was alive while drowning. The hands clutching mud or grass from the riverbed is common in such cases.</li></ul></li><li>Paltauff's hemorrhages:<ul><li>These are subpleural hemorrhages seen in drowning due to increased intrathoracic pressure and alveolar rupture during the struggle to breathe underwater.</li></ul></li><li>Arsenic from hair sample:<ul><li>This is unrelated to drowning. Hair arsenic analysis is used in chronic arsenic poisoning cases for toxicological studies and does not correlate with the post-mortem findings of drowning.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Rule Out:</strong></p><ol><li><strong> Ballooning of lungs:</strong><ul><li>Present in drowning and cannot be ruled out.</li></ul></li><li><strong> Cadaveric spasm of hands with mud in closed fist:</strong><ul><li>Common in drowning victims who struggled in water, indicating they were alive during immersion.</li></ul></li><li><strong> Paltauff's hemorrhages:</strong><ul><li>These are well-documented findings in drowning cases and provide evidence of asphyxia due to water inhalation.</li></ul></li><li><strong> Arsenic from hair sample:</strong><ul><li>This is unrelated to drowning and points to a completely different condition (chronic arsenic poisoning).
