This effort was headed by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium and by Celera Genomics. Except for a few gaps, the sequence of the entire human genome was completed in 2003, just 50 years after the description of the double-helical nature of DNA by Watson and Crick.</p><p>Human Genome Project (HGP)</p><p>The US Department of Energy together with the US National Institutes of Health started this project in 1990. James Watson (co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, Nobel laureate, 1962) was the first head of the project; later Francis Collins succeeded him. The project included scientists from 16 centers all over the world, mostly from the USA, with coordination from laboratories of Britain, France, Japan and Germany. So, the Project was named as International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium. By 1997, Celera Genomics, headed by Craig Venter, a private enterprise funded by Perkin-Elmer Company independently embarked on a similar project, which hastened the work.</p><p>For HGP, the whole human DNA was fragmented into pieces of 100-200 kb length. These were matched with individual chromosomes by looking at marker sequences. These areas were further broken into small pieces and sequenced (shotgun technique). Overlapping sequences were arranged, and fragments were re-written with the help of computer programs. It is one of the greatest achievements of humanity. The ambitious project was to decode the whole human genome and to sequence the whole human DNA. One set of human DNA contains about 3 billion base pairs (one cell contains 2 sets) and about 10,000 genes. The \"Book of Human Life\" contains \"23 Chapters\", as the 23 chromosomes.</p><p>The impact of HGP will be on all branches of medicine and related health sciences. It is now possible to isolate any human gene of interest. Many previously unknown genes have been identified. Pharmacogenomics is a recently emerged science from the genome project; it is the use of genetic information towards the development of new drugs and their targets of action. By means of linkage analysis, human genetic mapping (location of important genes) was completed by 1994. The DNA sequences were identified by \"shotgun sequencing\" method, which involves breaking the DNA into small pieces, and sequencing each of them. In 1995, a gene map of chromosomes was published. By December 1998, human chromosome 5 (about 6% of the human genome) was sequenced completely. By June 2000, \"preliminary working draft\" of the total human DNA sequence was announced. The final version of the sequence of the entire human genome was completed in 2003.</p>",

At the same time, the lack of insulin to antagonize the actions of glucagon results in increased lipolysis in adipose tissue, and the resultant nonesterified fatty acids are substrates for ketogenesis in the liver. Utilization of the ketone bodies in muscle (and other tissues) may be impaired because of the lack of oxaloacetate (all tissues have a requirement for some glucose metabolism to maintain an adequate amount of oxaloacetate for citric acid cycle activity). In uncontrolled diabetes, the ketosis may be severe enough to result in pronounced acidosis (ketoacidosis); acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate are relatively strong acids. Coma results from both the acidosis and also the considerably increased osmolality of extracellular fluid (mainly as a result of the hyperglycemia, and diuresis resulting from the excretion of glucose and ketone bodies in the urine).</p>",

In the duodenum, cobalophilin is hydrolyzed, releasing the vitamin for binding to intrinsic factors. Pancreatic insufficiency can therefore be a factor in the development of vitamin B12 deficiency, resulting in the excretion of cobalophilin-bound vitamin B12. Intrinsic factor binds only the active vitamin B12 vitamers and not other corrinoids. Vitamin B12 is absorbed from the distal third of the ileum via receptors that bind the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex, but not free intrinsic factor or free vitamin. There is considerable enterohepatic circulation of vitamin B12, with excretion in the bile, then reabsorption after binding to intrinsic factor in the ileum.</p><p>So patient undergo subtotal gastrectomy, have vitamin B12 deficiency, which results in macrocytic anemia with hypersegmented nuclei as shown in below image:</p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizJul2025/BiochemSAI15072025/26E.jpg\"><p>Option C: Although Vitamin B2(riboflavin) is centrally involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and deficiency occurs in many countries, it is not fatal, because there is very efficient conservation of tissue riboflavin.

The role of thiamin diphosphate in pyruvate dehydrogenase means that in deficiency there is impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. In subjects on a relatively high carbohydrate diet, this results in increased plasma concentrations of lactate and pyruvate, which may cause life-threatening lactic acidosis.</p><p>Option B: Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy.</p><p>Proline and lysine hydroxylases are required for the postsynthetic modification of procollagen to collagen. Both this enzyme requires vitamin C. So signs of vitamin C deficiency include skin changes, fragility of blood capillaries, gum decay, tooth loss and bone fracture, which can be attributed to impaired collagen synthesis(leading to delayed wound healing) and psychological changes that can be attributed to impaired synthesis of catecholamines.</p><p>Option C: Although Vitamin B2(riboflavin) is centrally involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and deficiency occurs in many countries, it is not fatal, because there is very efficient conservation of tissue riboflavin.

Riboflavin nutritional status is assessed by measurement of the activation of erythrocyte glutathione reductase by FAD added in vitro.</p><p>Option D: Although clinical deficiency disease is rare, there is evidence that a significant proportion of the population has marginal vitamin B6 status. Moderate deficiency results in abnormalities of tryptophan and methionine metabolism. Increased sensitivity to steroid hormone action may be important in the development of hormone-dependent cancer of the breast, uterus, and prostate and vitamin B6 status may affect the prognosis. The most widely used method of assessing vitamin B6 status is by the activation of erythrocyte transaminases by pyridoxal phosphate added in vitro, expressed as the activation coefficient. Measurement of plasma concentrations of the vitamin is also used.</p>",

The reaction proceeds with retention of all three nitrogens in arginine and release of the aspartate skeleton as fumarate. Subsequent addition of water to fumarate forms l-malate, whose subsequent NAD+-dependent oxidation forms oxaloacetate. These two reactions are analogous to reactions of the citric acid cycle, but are catalyzed by cytosolic fumarase and malate dehydrogenase. Transamination of oxaloacetate by glutamate aminotransferase then reforms aspartate. The carbon skeleton of aspartate-fumarate thus acts as a carrier of the nitrogen of glutamate into a precursor of urea.</p><p>Option C: Alanine is an amino acid, not involved in urea cycle or kreb's cycle.</p><p>Option D: Cleavage of argininosuccinate is catalyzed by argininosuccinate lyase in the urea cycle.

While the main cause of the Alzheimer disease remains elusive, the characteristic senile plaques and neurofibrillary bundles contain aggregates of the protein &beta;-amyloid, a 4.3-kDa polypeptide produced by proteolytic cleavage of a larger protein known as amyloid precursor protein. In Alzheimer disease patients, levels of &beta;-amyloid become elevated and this protein undergoes a conformational transformation from a soluble &alpha; helix-rich state to a state rich in &beta; sheet and prone to self aggregation. Apolipoprotein E has been implicated as a potential mediator of this conformational transformation.</p><p>There is an association between patients possessing the apo E4 allele and the incidence of Alzheimer disease.
