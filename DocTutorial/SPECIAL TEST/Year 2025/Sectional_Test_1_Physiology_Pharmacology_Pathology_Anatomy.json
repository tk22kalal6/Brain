During therapy, T3 and T4 levels should be checked every 3 weeks and the dose of PTU should be decreased once the mother is euthyroid or only mildly hyperthyroid so that fetal hypothyroidism does not occur.</li><li>During the second and third trimester, methimazole is the preferred antithyroid drug because PTU is associated with a higher risk of hepatocellular damage and agranulocytosis when compared with methimazole.</li></ul></li><li>Lugol's iodine can cause a transient reduction in the levels of thyroid hormones (due to the Wolff-Chaikoff effect), but after 5-10 days serum iodine would increase the production of T3 and T4 and thus exacerbate the patient's hyperthyroidism. In patients with Graves disease, the Wolff-Chaikoff effect of iodine can be utilized 5-10 days before thyroidectomy to prevent a thyroid storm. However, thyroidectomy is contraindicated during the first trimester because of teratogenicity associated with anesthetic drugs and the increased risk of fetal loss after major surgery.</li><li>Beta-blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol are safe during pregnancy and can therefore be used as a part of initial therapy to reduce heart rate and treat symptoms of thyrotoxicosis (e.g., anxiety, palpitations, sweating) until the patient becomes euthyroid. However, atenolol is associated with an increased risk of fetal growth restriction; its use during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated.</li><li>Methimazole is the antithyroid drug of choice during the second and third trimester. However, it is contraindicated during the first trimester because it is teratogenic and associated with congenital defects such as aplasia cutis, choanal atresia, esophageal atresia, and omphalocele (methimazole embryopathy).</li></ul>",

However, it usually develops within the first 1-8 weeks after initiation of therapy.

Some infants develop a generalized rash shortly after birth because maternal T cells are transferred across the placenta and attack the fetus, causing GVHD. Children with SCID are extremely susceptible to recurrent, severe infections by a wide range of pathogens, including Candida albicans, Pneumocystis jiroveci, Pseudomonas, cytomegalovirus, varicella, and a whole host of bacteria.

Approximately half of the cases of SCID are X-linked; these are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the common &gamma; (&gamma;c) chain shared by the receptors for the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Of these cytokines, defective IL-7 signaling is the most important underlying basis of SCID because this cytokine is responsible for stimulating the survival and expansion of immature B and T cell precursors in the generative lymphoid organs.</li><li>Autosomal recessive SCID. Another 40% to 50% of SCID cases follow autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance, with approximately half of these caused by mutations in adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme involved in purine metabolism. ADA deficiency results in accumulation of adenosine and deoxyadenosine triphosphate metabolites, which inhibit DNA synthesis and are toxic to lymphocytes. Other autosomal recessive forms of SCID result variously from defects in another purine metabolic pathway, primary failure of class II MHC expression, or mutations in genes encoding the recombinase responsible for the rearrangement of lymphocyte antigen-receptor genes.</li></ul>",

It is the most common abdominal malignant tumour of young children, seen most commonly between 1 to 6 years of age with equal sex incidence.</p><p>ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS: Wilms' tumour has following etiologic associations:</p><ol><li>A higher incidence has been seen in monozygotic twins and cases with family history.</li><li>Association of Wilms' tumour with some other congenital anomalies has been observed, especially of the genitourinary tract.</li><li>A few other malignancies are known to have higher incidence of Wilms' tumour. These include osteosarcoma, botryoid sarcoma, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma etc.</li></ol><p>Genetic pathogenesis of Wilms' tumour is explained as under:</p><p>Wilms' tumour associated gene,WT1gene, is located on chromosome 11p13. Normal function of the WT1 gene is synthesis of protein required for development of kidneys and gonads (ovaries/testes). Mutated form of WT1 gene is often caused by deletion in people with Wilms' tumor, aniridia (i.e. absence of iris), genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation syndrome, known by the acronym WAGR syndrome. As a result of this deletion, affected individuals are missing one copy of theWT1gene in each cell and such individuals are prone to develop Wilms' tumour and several other forms of cancers.</p><p>Another molecular mechanism for development of sporadic cases of Wilms' tumour is synergism due to common mutation between &beta;-catenin pathway and WNT (wingless) signaling pathway.</p><p>The most common presenting feature is a palpable abdominal mass in a child. Other common abnormalities are haematuria, pain, fever and hypertension. The tumour rapidly spreads via blood, especially to lungs.</p><p>Grossly, the tumour is usually quite large, spheroidal, replacing most of the kidney. It is generally solitary and unilateral but 5-10% cases may have bilateral tumour. On the cut section, the tumour shows characteristic variegated appearance-soft, fish flesh-like grey-white to cream-yellow tumour with foci of necrosis and haemorrhages and grossly identifiable myxomatous or cartilaginous elements.</p><p>Microscopically, nephroblastoma shows a mixture of primitive epithelial and mesenchymal elements. Most of the tumour consists of small, round to spindled, anaplastic, sarcomatoid tumour cells. In these areas, abortive tubules and poorly-formed glomerular structures are present.</p>",

All nodular NHLs, one of which is seen in the picture associated with this question, are the result of neoplastic proliferations of B lymphocytes. Histologically these nodules somewhat resemble the germinal centers of lymphoid follicles, but instead they are characterized by increased numbers (crowding) of nodules, their location in both the cortex and the medulla, their uniform size, and their composition (a monotonous proliferation of cells). These neoplastic B cells express CD19, CD20, CD10 (CALLA), and surface immunoglobulin. In addition, these cells express BCL6, the gene for which is located on chromosome 18. Indeed, the hallmark of follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a (14;18) translocation, which results in the overproduction of the BCL2 protein, which normally inhibits apoptosis. This product is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear envelope. It inhibits apoptosis by blocking Bax channels and by binding to and sequestering apoptosis activating factor 1 (Apaf-1).</p>",
