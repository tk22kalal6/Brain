Both this enzyme requires vitamin C. So signs of vitamin C deficiency include skin changes, fragility of blood capillaries, gum decay, tooth loss, and bone fracture, which can be attributed to impaired collagen synthesis(leading to delayed wound healing) and psychological changes that can be attributed to impaired synthesis of catecholamines.</p><p>Option B: Increased keratinization of epithelium is seen in vitamin A deficiency.</p><p>Option C: Prothrombin and several other proteins of the blood clotting system(factors VII, IX and X, and proteins C and S) each contain 4 to 6 &gamma;-carboxyglutamate residues. &gamma;-Carboxyglutamate chelates calcium ions and so permits the binding of the blood-clotting proteins to membranes. In vitamin K deficiency or in the presence of warfarin, an abnormal precursor of prothrombin(preprothrombin) containing little or no &gamma;-carboxyglutamate and incapable of chelating calcium, is released into the circulation.</p><p>Option D: Calcium has no role in collagen formation or scurvy.&nbsp;</p>",

Human telomeres have a variable number of repeats of the sequence 5&prime;-TTAGGG-3&prime;, which can extend for several kilobases. The telomeres of normal cells shorten on repeated cell division, which may result in cell death.</p><p>The enzyme telomerase replicates telomeres and is often expressed in cancer cells, helping them to evade cell death.</p><p>Telomerase, a multisubunit RNA template containing complex related to viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (reverse transcriptases), is the enzyme responsible for telomere synthesis and thus for maintaining the length of the telomere. Since telomere shortening has been associated with both malignant transformation and aging, this enzyme has become an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy and drug development.</p><p>Option A: Telomerase has Reverse transcriptase activity (RNA-dependent DNA polymerases)</p><p>Option B: Telomerase found only in Eukaryotes</p><p>Option C: Telomerase maintain telomere length and so maintain chromosome length</p><p>Option D: DNA fidelity is not maintained, as there is no proofreading activity or repair mechanism associated with telomerase.</p>",

Since amide bond synthesis is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi , the reaction strongly favors glutamine synthesis.

Following deprotonation of NH4 +, NH3 attacks &gamma;-glutamyl phosphate, and glutamine and Pi are released.

      "solution": "<p>PCR is a method of amplifying a target sequence of DNA. The development of PCR has revolutionized the ways in which both DNA and RNA can be studied. PCR provides a sensitive, selective, and extremely rapid means of amplifying any desired sequence of DNA. Specificity is based on the use of two oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to complementary sequences on opposite strands of DNA and flank the target sequence.</p><p>The DNA sample is first heat <strong><u>denatured</u></strong> (&gt;90&deg;C) to separate the two strands of the template DNA containing the target sequence; the primers, added in excess, are allowed to <strong><u>anneal</u></strong> to the DNA (typically at 50-75&deg;C) in order to generate the required template-primer complex. Subsequently, each strand is copied by a DNA <strong><u>polymerase</u></strong>, starting at the primer sites in the presence of all four dXTPs. The two DNA strands each serve as a template for the synthesis of new DNA from the two primers.</p><p>Repeated cycles of heat denaturation, annealing of the primers to their complementary sequences, and extension of the annealed primers with DNA polymerase result in the exponential amplification of DNA segments of defined length. Product DNA doubles with each PCR cycle. DNA synthesis is catalyzed by a heat-stable DNA polymerase purified from one of a number of different thermophilic bacteria, organisms that grow at 70 to 80&deg;C. Thermostable DNA polymerases withstand short incubations at over 90&deg;, temperatures required to completely denature DNA. These thermostable DNA polymerases have made automation of PCR possible. DNA sequences as short as 50 to 100 bp and as long as 10 kb can readily be amplified by PCR. Twenty cycles provide an amplification of 106 (ie, 220) and 30 cycles, 109 (230). Each cycle takes &le;5 to 10 minutes so that even large DNA molecules can be amplified fairly rapidly.</p><p>So the correct sequence is Denaturation &rarr; Annealing &rarr; Elongation, so option B is correct.</p>",
