      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Cost benefit analysis (CBA) is the method used to measure monetary benefits. It compares the costs of a program or intervention with its benefits in monetary terms to determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs.</p><p><u>MANAGEMENT METHODS AND TECHNIQUES</u></p><p>They are based on principles of behavioural sciences as well as quantitative methods.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\"><li>METHODS BASED ON BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCES:<ol><li>ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN: Poor organization results in waste of resources. It is a theory of management that organization must be suited to its current situation and the needs to be serviced. The organization of health services should, therefore, be designed so as to meet the health needs and demands of the people. Further, the organizational design should be reviewed every few years because of changing concepts or purpose, changing problems and changing technology. Efficient delivery of health services depends upon the existence of an effective organization.</li><li>PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT: This is skillful use of human resources. Proper methods of selection, training and motivation; division of responsibility; distribution of roles; elimination of \"square pegs in round holes\"(i.e., professional staff not suited to administration, either through training, selection or natural inclination, should not be entrusted with administrative and management burdens); incentive for better work; opportunities for promotion and professional advancement; effective design of \"health teams\" are all fundamental techniques of personnel management which could contribute to the efficiency of health service delivery.</li><li>COMMUNICATION: Better communication contributes to effective functioning of an organization. Communication roadblocks exist at various levels: between the doctor and the patient; doctor and nurse; between the senior officials and juniors; between the directorate and the health ministry; between the health ministry and other ministries and rest of the government. Communication barriers are responsible for delays in regular reporting and notification; delays in the compilation of statistics; delays in the release of supplies and salaries; delays in the institution of prompt remedial measures. In fact, these are some of the major weaknesses in health ministries. One of the tasks of health management is to solve the communication problems by establishing suitable vertical and horizontal communication channels.</li><li>INFORMATION SYSTEMS: Information is needed for day-to-day management of the health system. Information comes from many sources -both formal and informal. The information system should be tailored according to the management needs of the individual health services. The functions of an information system consist of collection, classification, transmission, storage. Retrieval, transformation and display of information. A good information system provides data for monitoring and evaluation of health programmes and gives the requisite feed-back to health administrators and planners at all levels. Computers can play a great role in improving the health information system.</li><li>MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES(MBO): Objectives are set forth for different units and subunits, each of which prepares its own plan of action -usually on a short-term basis. This helps in achieving the results more effectively and smoothly.</li></ol></li><li>QUANTITATIVE METHODS: Quantitative methods are derived from the field of economics, operation research and budgeting.</li></ol><p>a. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS: The economic benefits of any programme are compared with the cost of that programme. The benefits are expressed in monetary terms to determine whether a given programme is economically sound, and to select the best out of several alternate programmes. The main drawback with this technique is that the benefits in the health field, as a result of a particular programme, cannot always be expressed in monetary terms. We generally express the benefit in terms of births or deaths prevented or illness avoided or overcome.</p><p>b. COST-EFFECTIVE ANALYSIS: It is similar to cost-benefit analysis except that benefit, instead of being expressed in monetary terms is expressed in terms of results achieved, e.g., number of lives saved or the number of days free from disease. However, even cost-effective analysis is not possible in many cases. CEA is an expression of the desired effect of a programme, service, institution or support activity in reducing a health problem. CEA measures the degree of attainment of pre-determined objectives and targets. Most comprehensive indicator of CEA is Quality adjusted life years(QALYs) gained.</p><p>c. COST-ACCOUNTING: It provides basic data on cost structure of any programme. Financial records are kept in a manner permitting costs to be associated with the purpose for which they are incurred. Cost-accounting has three important purposes in health services:</p><ul><li>Cost control;</li><li>Planning and allocation of people and financial resources; and</li><li>Pricing of cost reimbursement.</li></ul><p>d. INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS: Input-output analysis is an economic technique. In the health field, \"input\" refers to all health service activities which consume resources (manpower, money, materials and time); and \"output\" refers to such useful outcomes as cases treated, lives saved or inoculations performed. An input- output table shows how much of each \"input\" is needed to produce a unit amount of each \"output\". It enables calculations to be made of the effects of changing the inputs.</p><p>e. MODEL: The model is a basic concept of management science. It is an aid to understand how the factors in a situation affect one another. It is an abstraction of the reality, not the reality itself. The decision process includes the use of a model.</p><p>f. SYSTEMS ANALYSIS: The purpose of systems analysis is to help the decision maker to choose an appropriate course of action by investigating his problem, searching out objectives, finding out alternative solutions, evaluation of the alternatives in terms of cost-effectiveness, re-examination of the objectives if necessary and finding the most cost-effective alternative. Systems analysis is essentially finding the cost-effectiveness of the available alternatives. The system can be a hospital supply system, an information system, a total community health service system, an outpatient clinic or any other system with problems of management. A system may be made of independent subsystems.</p><p>g. NETWORK ANALYSIS: A network is a graphic plan of all events and activities to be completed in order to reach an end objective. It brings greater discipline in planning. The two common types of network technique are: (a) PERT and (b) CPM.</p><ul><li>PERT(Programme Evaluation and Review Technique) is a management technique which makes possible more detailed planning and more comprehensive supervision. The essence of PERT is to construct an Arrow Diagram. The diagram represents the logical sequence in which events must take place. It is possible with such a diagram to calculate the time by which each activity must be completed, and to identify those activities that are critical. This simple technique provides a basic discipline by which all concerned in a project can know what is expected of them and to minimise any delays or crises in the implementation of the plan. It aids in planning, scheduling and monitoring the project; it allows better communication between the various levels of management; it identifies potential problems; it furnishes continuous, timely progress reports; it forms a solid foundation upon which to build an evaluation and checking system.</li><li>CRITICAL PATH METHOD(CPM) : The longest path of the network is called \"Critical path\". If any activity along the critical path is delayed, the entire project will be delayed.</li></ul><p>h. PLANNING-PROGRAMMING-BUDGETING SYSTEM(PPBS): The Planning-Programming-Budgeting System(PPBS) is primarily a system to help decision makers to allocate resources so that the available resources of an organization are used in the most effective way in achieving its objectives. The PPBS does not call for changes in the existing organization. It calls for grouping of activities into programmes related to each objective. Another approach is known as the \"Zero Budget Approach\", i.e., all budgets start at zero and no one gets any budget that he cannot specifically justify on a year-to-year basis.</p><p>i. WORK SAMPLING: It is systematic observation and recording of activities of one or more individuals, carried out at predetermined or random intervals. It provides quantitative measurement of the various activities. The major parameters that are analysed are the type of activities performed and the time needed to do specified jobs. Work sampling studies have been done on doctors, nurses, pharmacists and laboratory technicians. Work sampling permits judgments to the appropriateness of current staff, job description and training. It helps in standardising the methods of performing jobs and determining the manpower needs in any organization.</p><p>j. DECISION MAKING: Decision making is just like the basic discipline of differential diagnosis in medical practice. It is an adage that decisions should be made at the level where the best decisions can be made; it does not follow that the best decision is always made at the top of an organization. Decisions should not be made with incomplete data. In the health sector, decisions have to be made about development of resources, optimum work load for medical and paramedical workers, strategies for providing health care, etc.</p>",

This adjustment allows for comparisons of mortality rates between populations or over time, by removing the effect of differences in age distributions across populations.</p><p><strong><u>STANDARDIZED DEATH RATE</u></strong></p><ul><li>Suppose the death rate of two countries have to be compared, crude death rate is not the right indicator because different countries have different age composition with different mortality rates. For example, a developing country has more of younger population with a higher mortality rate than a developed country with lesser younger population with lower mortality rate.</li><li>The rates are comparable only if the age group of the population is comparable. Therefore, the age is standardized (or corrected) so that the confounding effect of age is removed in the entire population thereby the death rate can be compared directly.</li><li>Thus, standardization or adjustment can be made not only for age but also for sex, race, etc. The death rates corrected for age-sex distribution of population is called 'Standardized death rate'.</li><li>There are two methods of standardization-direct and indirect methods.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Direct Standardization</u></strong></p><ul><li>This can be applied only if the number of the deaths of various age/sex groups of the population of a place is known. With that data, the expected deaths can be estimated in the respective age groups of the standard population. From the total number of expected deaths of the standard population, the standardized death rate can be estimated per 1000 population by dividing by one lakh (or one million) depending upon the standard population.</li></ul><p><strong>Steps of direct standardization:</strong></p><ol><li>Data of the mid year population of the different age groups of the study area (population) is collected.</li><li>Number of deaths occurring in the respective age group is also collected.</li><li>Standard population of the country is chosen.</li><li>Age specific death rate of the study population, whose crude death rate is to be standardized, is calculated.</li><li>'Expected' number of deaths in the standard population of each age group is estimated.</li><li>Total number of expected deaths is calculated by adding all expected deaths.</li><li>Standardized age adjusted death rate is calculated by dividing the total expected deaths by the total standard population and estimated per 1000 population.</li></ol><p><strong><u>Indirect Standardization</u></strong></p><ul><li>This method is applied when the number of deaths of various age/sex groups is unknown or not available in the study population. Under such circumstances, the age specific death rate of the national standard population is obtained from the census records and the number of deaths in the study population of that are also obtained, by multiplying the MYP of the study area and the age specific death rate of the standard population.</li><li>Then the index death rate of study population (area) and the standardizing factor (i.e. correction factor) are employed to calculate standardized death rate of the study population.</li><li>Standardized mortality ratio (SMR): The simplest and most useful form of indirect standardization is the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR). The concept is that the regions with higher mortality also have the higher morbidity, and should therefore receive proportionately higher funding to combat ill-health.</li><li>The SMR has the advantage over the direct method of age adjustment in that it permits adjustment for age and other factors where age-specific rates are not available or are unstable because of small numbers. One needs to know only the number of persons in each age group in the study population and the age-specific rates of the national population (or other reference population). It is possible to use SMR if the event of interest is occurrence of disease rather than death.</li></ul>",

It is effective when taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse.</p><p><strong><u>POST COITAL CONTRACEPTION</u></strong></p><p>Post-coital (or \"morning after\") contraception is recommended within 72 hours of an unprotected intercourse. Two methods are available:</p><ul><li><strong>IUD:</strong> The simplest technique is to insert an IUD, if acceptable, especially a copper device within 5 days.</li><li><strong>Hormonal:</strong><ul><li>In India, Levonorgestrel 0. 75 mg tablet is approved for emergency contraception. It is used as one tablet of 0. 75 mg within 72 hours of unprotected sex and the 2<sup>nd</sup> tablet after 12 hours of 1<sup>st</sup> dose</li><li>Two oral contraceptive pills containing 50 mcg of <strong>ethinyl estradiol</strong> within 72 hours after qintercourse, and the same dose after 12 hours.</li><li>Four <strong>oral contraceptive pills</strong> containing 30 or 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol within 72 hours and 4 tablets after 12 hours.</li><li>Mifepristone(<strong>RU486</strong>) 10 mg once within 72 hours.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Post-coital contraception is advocated as an emergency method; for example, after unprotected intercourse, rape or contraceptive failure.</p><p><strong><u>a.LEVONORGESTREL/EZY PILL</u></strong></p><p>Levonorgestrel (E. Pills) 0.75 mg, two doses given at 12 hours interval, is very successful and without any side effects. The two tablets (1.50 mg) can be taken as a single dose also. The first dose should be taken within 72 hours (Fig. 30.11) may be taken upto 120 hours.</p><p><strong>Mode of action:</strong> The exact mechanism of action remains unclear. The following are the possibilities: Ovulation is either prevented or delayed when the drug is taken in the beginning of the cycle. Fertilization is interfered. Interferes with the function of corpus luteum or may cause luteolysis.</p><p><strong><u>b.ANTI PROGESTERONE</u></strong></p><p>Antiprogesterone (RU 486-Mifepristone) binds competitively to progesterone receptors and nullifies the effect of endogenous progesterone. Dose: A single dose of 100 mg is to be taken within 17 days of intercourse. Implantation is prevented due to its antiprogesterone effect. Pregnancy rate is 00.6%.</p><p><strong><u>c.COMBINED ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES/YUZPE METHOD</u></strong></p><p>This method consisting of consuming either 8 low dose combined oral contraceptive pills (4 as soon as possible followed by another 4 after 12 hours) or 4 standard dose combined pills(2 pills followed by another 2-pills after 12 hours).</p><p><strong><u>d.HIGH DOSE ESTROGENS</u></strong></p><p>These are Diethylstilbestrol (DES) 50 mgm a day for 5 days or Ethinyl estradiol 05 mgm a day for 5 days or estradiol benzoate 12.5 mgms combined with estradiol phenyl propionate 10.0 mgm. Failure rate is less than 1 percent. Side effects are high and severe because of high doses of estrogen. Therefore, this old method is replaced by a safer and new method</p><p><strong><u>e.COPPER IUD</u></strong></p><p>Introduction of a copper IUD within a maximum period of 5 days can prevent conception following accidental unprotected exposure. This prevents implantation. Failure rate is about 01%. It is the gold standard method to be offered to all women for EC. This is more effective than hormonal method as an emergency method.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The most effective natural family planning method among the options provided is:</p><p><strong>C. Symptothermic</strong></p><p>The symptothermal method combines the tracking of multiple fertility signs, including basal body temperature, cervical mucus changes, and additional fertility symptoms such as cervical position or vaginal sensation. By incorporating multiple indicators, the symptothermal method offers greater accuracy in identifying fertile and infertile periods compared to other natural family planning methods. It provides redundancy and cross-checking of fertility signs, enhancing its reliability and effectiveness in preventing or achieving pregnancy.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>A. Calendar Method:</strong></p><p>The calendar method, also known as the rhythm method, involves tracking the length of menstrual cycles over time to predict fertile and infertile periods. However, it relies solely on past menstrual cycle data and assumes regularity in cycle length. This method is less effective compared to others because it does not account for individual variations in menstrual cycles, making it prone to inaccuracies, especially for individuals with irregular cycles. Therefore, it is not the most effective natural family planning method.</p><p><strong>B. Billing Method:</strong></p><p>The Billing method, also known as the cervical mucus method, involves tracking changes in cervical mucus throughout the menstrual cycle to identify fertile and infertile periods. While it is more effective than the calendar method as it directly observes hormonal changes related to ovulation, its effectiveness can be influenced by factors such as vaginal infections or medications that affect cervical mucus. Therefore, it may not be as reliable as other methods, such as the symptothermal method.</p><p><strong>D. Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Method:</strong></p><p>The BBT method involves tracking basal body temperature daily to detect the slight increase in temperature that occurs after ovulation due to the release of progesterone. While it is more effective than the calendar method because it directly observes the hormonal shift associated with ovulation, it may not reliably predict the fertile window in all cases. Factors such as illness, poor sleep quality, or irregular sleep patterns can affect basal body temperature, leading to inaccuracies in predicting ovulation.</p><p>In summary, while all natural family planning methods have their merits, the symptothermal method (option c) is considered the most effective among the options provided due to its comprehensive approach, combining multiple fertility signs to improve accuracy and reliability in identifying fertile and infertile periods. Therefore, option c is the correct answer.</p>",

Anopheles:</strong>Anopheles mosquitoes typically breed in clean, clear water sources such as freshwater lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. They prefer clean water bodies for the development of their larvae. Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors of malaria, and they often breed in natural water collections like puddles, marshes, and rice fields.</p><p><strong>C. Aedes:</strong>Aedes mosquitoes, including species like Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, are known for breeding in small, artificial containers filled with clean or stagnant water. These containers can include discarded tires, flower pots, and water storage containers around human habitats. Aedes mosquitoes are vectors of diseases such as dengue fever, Zika virus, and chikungunya. They typically prefer clean or stagnant water rather than dirty water.</p><p><strong>D. Mansonia</strong>: Mansonia mosquitoes breed in freshwater habitats such as marshes, swamps, and areas with abundant vegetation. They lay their eggs on the surface of the water, often attaching them to floating vegetation. Mansonia larvae are found in relatively clean water bodies and are not typically associated with breeding in dirty water collections.</p><p><strong>Culex mosquitoes,</strong> on the other hand, are known to breed in various water sources, including polluted or dirty water collections. They are commonly found in urban environments where there are containers or pools of standing water contaminated with organic matter, such as sewage, decaying vegetation, or animal waste. Culex mosquitoes are vectors of diseases such as West Nile virus and filariasis. Their ability to breed in polluted water collections makes them a significant nuisance and health concern in urban and suburban areas.</p><p>In summary, option B is the correct answer because Culex mosquitoes are known for breeding in dirty water collections. The other options are not correct because they are associated with breeding in different types of water sources.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>(C) Puffy eyelids:</strong></p><p>Puffy eyelids, or periorbital oedema, can be a sign of excess fluid accumulation in the body, including overhydration. When the body receives more fluid than it can effectively excrete, excess fluid may accumulate in tissues, leading to swelling, particularly around the eyes. Puffy eyelids are a visible manifestation of this fluid overload and can indicate excess rehydration or fluid retention. Therefore, puffy eyelids are a sign of excess rehydration.</p><p><strong>Explanation to why other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>(A) Skin elasticity:</strong></p><p>Skin elasticity is a measure of hydration status and is used to assess dehydration rather than overhydration. Decreased skin elasticity, indicated by tenting or delayed recoil of the skin after being pinched, is associated with dehydration. Adequate skin elasticity, where the skin quickly returns to its normal position after being pinched, is indicative of normal hydration status. Therefore, skin elasticity is not a sign of excess rehydration.</p><p><strong>(B) Pulse strength:</strong></p><p>Pulse strength refers to the force or intensity of the pulse felt during palpation. While changes in pulse strength can sometimes be associated with fluid balance, they are not specific indicators of overhydration. Pulse strength may increase with improved hydration due to better perfusion, but it does not necessarily indicate excess rehydration. Therefore, pulse strength is not a reliable sign of excess rehydration.</p><p><strong>(D) Urine output:</strong></p><p>Urine output is an important parameter to monitor during rehydration therapy, as it reflects renal function and fluid balance. While excessive urine output may occur with overhydration, it is not a definitive sign of excess rehydration on its own. Urine output needs to be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical signs and symptoms to assess hydration status accurately. Therefore, urine output alone is not a specific indicator of excess rehydration.</p><p>In summary, while options (A), (B), and (D) are important clinical parameters to monitor during hydration therapy, they are not specific indicators of excess rehydration. Option (C), puffy eyelids, is a sign of excess rehydration as it indicates fluid accumulation in tissues, particularly around the eyes.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In stratified random sampling, the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups called strata based on certain characteristics that are relevant to the study. Each stratum represents a distinct subgroup within the population. Then, random samples are taken independently from each stratum. This ensures that each subgroup is represented proportionally in the final sample.</p><p><strong>Explanation why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>A. Systematic random sampling:</strong></p><p>Systematic random sampling involves selecting every nth individual from a list or population after starting at a random point. This method does not involve dividing the population into strata based on potential influencing factors. It may introduce bias if there is any underlying pattern in the list or population.</p><p><strong>C. Simple random sampling:</strong></p><p>Simple random sampling involves selecting individuals from the population randomly, where each individual has an equal chance of being selected, and each selection is independent of the others. It does not involve grouping individuals based on potential influencing factors before sampling. Therefore, it does not account for the potential factors that may influence the outcome of the study.</p><p><strong>D. Clustered random sampling:</strong></p><p>Clustered random sampling involves dividing the population into clusters or groups and then randomly selecting entire clusters to be included in the sample. This method is different from stratified random sampling because it involves selecting clusters randomly, rather than sampling from different strata based on potential influencing factors. It does not account for the potential factors that may influence the outcome of the study in the same way as stratified random sampling.</p><p>In summary, stratified random sampling is the most appropriate choice because it involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups based on potential influencing factors and then taking random samples from each subgroup to ensure proportional representation in the final sample. This approach allows for greater control over potential confounding variables and ensures that the sample is more representative of the population.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Repeatability (a):</strong> Repeatability refers to the ability to reproduce or repeat the results of an evaluation consistently under the same conditions. While repeatability is a desirable characteristic in scientific experiments and measurements, it is not typically considered an element of evaluation in the context of assessing programs or projects.</p><p><strong>Explanation for why not the other options:</strong></p><p><strong>Relevance (b</strong>): Relevance is a crucial element of evaluation, focusing on the extent to which the evaluation questions, methods, and findings are pertinent and applicable to the objectives and context of the program or project being evaluated. Evaluations should aim to address relevant questions and provide meaningful insights for stakeholders.</p><p><strong>Acceptability (c):</strong> Acceptability involves considering the perceptions and opinions of stakeholders regarding the evaluation process and findings. An evaluation should be conducted in a manner that is acceptable to stakeholders, including program beneficiaries, implementers, funders, and other relevant parties. This ensures that the evaluation results are credible, trusted, and actionable.</p><p><strong>Effectiveness (d):</strong> Effectiveness refers to the degree to which a program or intervention achieves its intended outcomes and goals. Evaluations assess the effectiveness of programs by examining the extent to which desired outcomes are achieved and whether the intervention produces the intended impact. Effectiveness is a fundamental aspect of evaluation, helping stakeholders understand the success or failure of a program and informing future decision-making and program improvements.</p><p>In summary, while repeatability is important in certain contexts, such as scientific research, it is not typically considered a core element of evaluation in the same way that relevance, acceptability, and effectiveness are. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.</p>",
