This pattern can be lengthened by 'delaying' the flap, a process in which the cuts are partially made and the flap is part lifted at a first operation; it is then replaced, thus 'training' the blood supply from a single border of the rectangle.

Ringer lactate:</strong> Ringer lactate is a balanced crystalloid solution that contains electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and lactate. It is commonly used for fluid resuscitation in pediatric patients with severe dehydration, as it helps to correct electrolyte imbalances and restore intravascular volume. Ringer lactate is preferred over normal saline in cases of severe dehydration due to its more physiologically balanced electrolyte composition.</p><p><strong>Explanation to why other options are not correct:</strong></p><ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\"><li>ORS 100ml/kg for 4 hours: Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is typically used for rehydration in cases of mild to moderate dehydration. However, in cases of severe dehydration where the child is lethargic, hypotensive, and tachypneic, oral rehydration alone may not be sufficient to rapidly correct the dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Additionally, administering ORS in a severely dehydrated child with altered consciousness may be challenging due to impaired ability to tolerate oral fluids.</li><li>ORS 100ml/kg for 6 hours: Similar to option A, administering ORS alone may not be adequate for rapidly correcting severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in a lethargic, hypotensive, and tachypneic child.</li><li>IV infusion with normal saline: Normal saline is a suitable choice for IV fluid resuscitation in cases of severe dehydration. However, Ringer lactate is preferred over normal saline due to its more balanced electrolyte composition, which closely resembles the electrolyte composition of extracellular fluid. Ringer lactate contains sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and lactate, making it more physiologically compatible for fluid resuscitation.</li></ol><p>In summary, when managing a severely dehydrated child with lethargy, hypotension, tachypnoea, and severe dehydration, the preferred choice for IV fluid resuscitation is Ringer lactate (option D) due to its balanced electrolyte composition and compatibility with paediatric patients. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Park's Preventive and social medicine, 27th Edition, Pg 267</p>",

Haematogenous spread may be seen in patients with diabetes and in immunocompromised hosts, people who inject drugs and patients with bacterial endocarditis. It is more common in females, especially during childhood, at puberty, after intercourse and during pregnancy. Acute pyelonephritis usually presents with fever, chills, flank pain, nausea and vomiting. Loin tenderness may be present. Symptoms may vary from mild to severe illness with septic shock and renal failure. Pyuria is almost always present and its absence in a patient with pyelonephritis may point towards an obstructed urinary tract. Urine and blood should be collected for culture. Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative organisms are commonly responsible. Imaging is necessary when the patient is not responding to antibiotics to rule out pyonephrosis, renal abscess and obstruction. Renal US is often the first imaging modality used. Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) typically shows decreased patchy opacification of the affected parenchyma.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Bailey &amp; Love's short practice of surgery, 28<sup>th</sup> Edition, Chapter 82, The Kidney and Ureter, Pg: 1471.</p>",

Aged RBCs with decreased plasticity (&gt;120 days) become trapped and destroyed in the spleen. Abnormal erythrocytes that result from hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell anemia, hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia, or pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) are also trapped and destroyed by the spleen. The overall effect is worsening anemia, splenomegaly, and sometimes autoinfarction of the spleen. Similarly, the spleen is involved in platelet destruction in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), formerly known as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.</li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Sabinston Textbook of Surgery, 21<sup>st</sup> Edition, SECTION X ABDOMEN,Chapter 57, The Spleen, Pg: 1570.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The correct answer is: d. Bed resistance in a slow sand filter.</p><p><strong>d. Bed resistance in a slow sand filter:</strong>This is the correct answer. Venturimeters can be used to measure the head loss or pressure drop across the filter bed in a slow sand filter. By measuring the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the filter bed using a venturimeter, one can determine the resistance offered by the filter bed to the flow of water. This information is crucial for assessing the performance of the slow sand filter and determining the need for backwashing or maintenance.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not suitable:</strong></p><p><strong>a. Air velocity</strong>: Venturimeter is not typically used to measure air velocity. Venturimeters are devices primarily used in fluid mechanics to measure the flow rate of a fluid, typically liquids, in a pipeline. They operate based on the principle of Bernoulli's equation and are commonly used in fluid engineering applications such as water supply systems and hydraulic systems.</p><p><strong>b. Size of suspended particles in air:</strong>Venturimeters are not used to measure the size of suspended particles in the air. Instruments such as particle counters or optical particle sizers are more commonly used to measure the size distribution of suspended particles in the air, particularly in air quality monitoring and environmental studies.</p><p><strong>c. SO2 content in atmosphere</strong>: Venturimeters are not used to measure the sulphur dioxide (SO2) content in the atmosphere. SO2 content in the atmosphere is typically measured using specialized gas analysers or sensors specifically designed to detect sulphur dioxide gas concentrations. These instruments employ various techniques such as spectroscopy or electrochemical sensors for accurate measurement of SO2 levels.</p><p>In summary, option d is the correct answer because venturimeters are commonly used to measure bed resistance in slow sand filters, whereas the other options are not typical applications of venturimeters.</p><p><strong>Reference: Park's Preventive and social medicine, 27th EDITION Pg </strong>839</p>",

The most notable aspect of the 1921 census was the decline in the population growth rate, attributed largely to the devastating influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, known as the Spanish flu. This pandemic resulted in a significant loss of life across India, leading to a noticeable decrease in population growth compared to previous decades. The demographic impact of the pandemic was profound, with certain regions experiencing a decline in population for the first time in recorded history. Therefore, 1921 is considered a pivotal year that marked a significant departure from previous population growth trends, hence earning the moniker \"year of big divide\".</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>a. 1881:</strong>The census of 1881 was significant in Indian demographic history as it marked the first comprehensive census conducted across British India. However, it is not specifically referred to as the \"year of big divide\". The data collected in 1881 provided important insights into the population distribution, language, religion, and other demographic characteristics of India, but it did not signify a significant shift or divide in Indian demography.</p><p><strong>c. 1947:</strong>The year 1947 is significant in Indian history as it marks the partition of British India into two independent nations: India and Pakistan. While this event had immense political, social, and demographic consequences, it is not specifically referred to as the \"year of big divide\" in the context of Indian demography. The partition resulted in large-scale migration, displacement, and violence, leading to significant changes in the population distribution and composition of the region. However, the demographic impact of partition is distinct from the demographic shift observed in 1921 due to the influenza pandemic.</p><p><strong>d. 1978:</strong>The year 1978 does not hold any specific significance in Indian demographic history that would warrant it being referred to as the \"year of big divide\". While various demographic events and changes occurred in India during this period, none are as widely recognized or significant as the demographic shift observed in 1921.</p><p>In summary, the census of 1921 is known as the \"year of big divide\" in the history of Indian demography due to the significant change in population trends, particularly the decline in population growth rate attributed to the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919.

Therefore, this characteristic is not necessarily a requirement.</p><p><strong>b. Willing to check IUD tail:</strong></p><p>It is important for a woman using an IUD to be willing and able to check the position of the IUD strings (or tail) regularly. This allows her to ensure that the IUD remains in place and has not been expelled. Therefore, this characteristic is typically considered important for successful IUD use.</p><p><strong>d. Has normal menstrual periods:</strong></p><p>Having normal menstrual periods is generally considered beneficial but not essential for copper T insertion. Women with irregular periods or other menstrual abnormalities can still safely use copper T. However, regular menstrual periods may indicate hormonal balance and reproductive health, which can be reassuring for IUD use.</p><p>In summary, having a history of ectopic pregnancy is not an ideal characteristic for copper T insertion due to the increased risk of complications. Options a, b, and d are not necessarily exclusion criteria for copper T insertion and may even be considered beneficial or desirable in some cases. Therefore, option c is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Park's Preventive and social medicine, 27th EDITION Pg 572</p>",

IDD, primarily caused by insufficient iodine intake, can lead to various health problems, including goitre, mental retardation, and cretinism.</p><p><strong>c. Urinary iodine levels among pregnant women:</strong>Urinary iodine levels among pregnant women provide a direct and sensitive measure of iodine intake and status. During pregnancy, iodine requirements increase to support foetal brain development, making pregnant women particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency. Monitoring urinary iodine levels among pregnant women can provide real-time data on iodine status and the effectiveness of iodine intervention programs.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p>Monitoring the impact of the IDDCP requires assessing iodine status in the population, and urinary iodine levels among pregnant women serve as the best indicator for several reasons.</p><p><strong>a. Prevalence of goitre among school children</strong>: While goitre prevalence can indicate iodine deficiency in a population, it is not the most sensitive indicator, as goitre formation may take time to develop after iodine deficiency occurs. Additionally, goitre prevalence may not accurately reflect recent changes in iodine intake or the effectiveness of intervention programs.</p><p><strong>b. Iodine levels in soil:</strong>Soil iodine levels may influence the iodine content of food crops, but they do not directly reflect human iodine status. The bioavailability of iodine from soil to plants and ultimately to humans can vary, making soil iodine levels less reliable as an indicator of iodine sufficiency in the population.</p><p><strong>d. Neonatal hypothyroidism</strong>: Neonatal hypothyroidism can result from iodine deficiency during pregnancy, leading to impaired thyroid hormone production in newborns. While neonatal hypothyroidism is a severe consequence of iodine deficiency, it is a late-stage indicator and may not reflect recent changes in iodine intake or the effectiveness of intervention programs.</p><p>In summary, option c) (Urinary iodine levels among pregnant women) is the best indicator to monitor the impact of the IDDCP because it provides a direct and sensitive measure of iodine intake and status, particularly during pregnancy when iodine requirements are increased. Options a), b), and d) are less sensitive or indirect indicators of iodine status and may not accurately reflect the effectiveness of intervention programs. Therefore, option c) is the most appropriate choice.</p><p><strong>Reference :</strong> Park's Preventive and social medicine, 27th EDITION Pg 739</p>",

      "solution": "<p>When a pregnant woman is positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and is found to be HBsAg-positive during labour or delivery, it is essential to take measures to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) to the newborn. The recommended intervention to prevent MTCT of HBV is a combination of Hepatitis B vaccine and Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) administered to the newborn soon after birth.</p><p><strong>(A) Hepatitis B vaccine + Immunoglobulin:</strong></p><p>This option is the correct answer. Administering both the Hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG to the newborn soon after birth is the standard of care for preventing MTCT of HBV. The Hepatitis B vaccine stimulates the infant's immune system to produce protective antibodies against HBV, while HBIG provides passive immunity by delivering preformed antibodies to neutralize the virus. This combination therapy has been shown to be highly effective in preventing MTCT of HBV.</p><p><strong>Explanation to why other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>(B) Immunoglobulin only:</strong></p><p>Administering HBIG alone without the Hepatitis B vaccine may provide temporary passive immunity to the newborn but does not stimulate the infant's immune system to produce its antibodies against HBV. Therefore, relying solely on HBIG does not provide long-term protection against HBV infection and is not sufficient to prevent MTCT of HBV.</p><p><strong>(C) Hepatitis B vaccine only:</strong></p><p>Administering the Hepatitis B vaccine alone without HBIG may provide long-term immunity to the newborn, but it does not offer immediate protection against HBV infection. In cases where the mother is HBsAg-positive, additional passive immunity provided by HBIG is recommended to provide immediate protection against HBV transmission until the infant's immune response to the vaccine develops.</p><p><strong>(D) Immunoglobulin followed by vaccine 1 month later:</strong></p><p>Delaying the administration of the Hepatitis B vaccine until one month after birth increases the risk of HBV transmission during the interim period. Providing HBIG alone without the Hepatitis B vaccine does not confer long-term immunity to the newborn. Administering the vaccine later than recommended may leave the infant susceptible to HBV infection during the unprotected period. Therefore, this option is not recommended.</p><p>In summary, the recommended intervention to prevent MTCT of HBV in newborns born to HBsAg-positive mothers is the administration of both the Hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG soon after birth (option A). This combination therapy provides immediate and long-term protection against HBV infection. Options (B), (C), and (D) do not provide optimal protection against HBV transmission and are not recommended as standalone interventions for preventing MTCT of HBV.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Park's Preventive and social medicine, 27th EDITION Pg 254</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>(D) Brucellosis:</strong></p><p>Brucellosis is a bacterial infection caused by species of the genus Brucella. While Brucella bacteria can infect various animals and are commonly found in domestic livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats, soil is not a typical reservoir for Brucella. Brucellosis is primarily transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected animals or consumption of unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals, rather than through soil exposure.</p><p><strong>Explanation to why other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>(A) Coccidioidomycosis:</strong></p><p>Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever, is a fungal infection caused by inhaling spores of the fungus Coccidioides, which typically resides in the soil in certain regions. When soil containing Coccidioides spores is disturbed, such as during construction or agricultural activities, the spores can become airborne and potentially infect humans and animals.</p><p><strong>(B) Anthrax:</strong></p><p>Anthrax is a bacterial infection caused by Bacillus anthracis. The spores of this bacterium can persist in the soil for years and are typically deposited there by infected animals. Humans can become infected with anthrax by coming into contact with contaminated soil, animal products, or by inhaling spores. Soil serves as a reservoir for anthrax spores, contributing to the persistence of the disease in certain regions.</p><p><strong>(C) Tetanus:</strong></p><p>Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which is commonly found in soil, dust, and animal feces. The bacteria produce spores that can survive in the environment for long periods. Tetanus typically enters the body through cuts or wounds contaminated with soil, allowing the spores to germinate and produce toxins that affect the nervous system.</p><p>In summary, soil serves as a reservoir for the pathogens causing coccidioidomycosis, anthrax, and tetanus, but not for brucellosis.
