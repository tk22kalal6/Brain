The presence of EM rash indicates <strong>early localized Lyme disease</strong>. Treatment should be started immediately in early localized Lyme disease as <strong>no testing is needed</strong> to confirm the diagnosis before initiating treatment. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients with Lyme disease may report a <strong>tick bite or travel</strong> to a <strong>Lyme-endemic area</strong>. Erythema migrans appear with<strong>&#160;early localized Lyme disease</strong> within days to two weeks after an infected tick bite. The skin lesion begins as a <strong>r</strong><strong>ed or purple-colored macule or papule</strong> and expands with <strong>enhanced central erythema</strong>. It may appear as a <strong>bull&#8217;s eye lesion</strong>, as in this case. The rash is often non-painful and non-pruritic and may be accompanied by systemic symptoms, such as <strong>fever, malaise, headache, stiff neck, myalgias,</strong> and<strong>&#160;arthralgias. Carditis</strong> with a prolonged PR interval on electrocardiography is a manifestation of<strong>&#160;early disseminated Lyme disease</strong>. The most common manifestation of <strong>l</strong><strong>ate Lyme disease</strong>, which occurs weeks to months after the initial infection, is <strong>arthritis</strong>, which is typically monoarticular, and affects the large joints, particularly the knee. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>The diagnostic evaluation of children who present with <strong>fever&#160;</strong>and <strong>rash&#160;</strong>involves narrowing down the most likely etiology based on <strong>history&#160;</strong>and <strong>physical exam including rash morphology</strong>. If the characteristic <strong>erythema migrans (bull&#8217;s eye lesion) rash</strong> is seen, and the patient lives in or has been to a Lyme endemic area, and there are no signs or symptoms of early disseminated or late disease, then no further work-up is required before treatment. If the patient has signs and symptoms of early disseminated or late Lyme disease, <strong>serology testing</strong> for <strong><em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em></strong> with an <strong>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</strong> with reflex to <strong>Western immunoblot</strong> should be performed. Positive serology confirms a diagnosis of Lyme disease. Repeat testing is recommended several weeks later if initial testing is negative due to low sensitivity of serologic testing in early disease. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ No testing is required:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong><strong>:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is commonly used to confirm infections such as <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em><em>.</em> Although PCR can be used to confirm Lyme disease, this test is not recommended for numerous reasons including a high false positive rate.

When evaluating a child presenting with a first-time seizure (after initial stabilization), it is important to inquire about the <strong>presence of fever</strong> within 24 hours, as <strong>febrile seizures</strong> are more common than epilepsy, and the work-up and treatment differ between the two conditions. Febrile seizures commonly <strong>occur during acute illness in healthy children</strong> between 6 months and 5 years of age. By definition, febrile seizures are <strong>provoked by fever</strong>, and affected children have no previous history of unprovoked seizures. These children don&#8217;t require electroencephalogram (EEG), neuroimaging, or other diagnostic workups, and treatment involves supportive care and antipyretics. <br><br><strong>Febrile seizures</strong> occur in one in every 25 otherwise healthy and typically developing children between 6 months and 5 years of age, with a recurrence risk of 25-35% with subsequent febrile illnesses. Treatment of febrile seizures includes supportive care and antipyretic administration. The use of antiepileptics has not been shown to be helpful. <br><br>A single febrile seizure that occurs within 24 hours of fever and lasts less than 5 minutes, with generalized body involvement, is referred to as a <strong>simple febrile seizure</strong>, and the child requires no further neurodiagnostic evaluation. <strong>Complex febrile seizures</strong> refer to seizures that recur within 24 hours of the initial seizure, are focal, or are prolonged in nature.

Physical examination identifies a <strong>webbed neck, broad chest, adrenarche without thelarche, nail dysplasia, </strong>and <strong>short 4<sup>th</sup> digits</strong>. These findings are consistent with <strong>Turner syndrome</strong>. <strong>High blood pressure</strong> during the well-child visit and a history of <strong>myopia </strong>also supports this diagnosis. Turner syndrome is diagnosed by <strong>karyotype</strong>. <br><br>The first step in evaluating a patient with short stature is to identify whether the short stature is pathologic or non-pathologic. If the height velocity is normal, and there are no signs and symptoms of an underlying condition, the patient likely has <strong>non-pathologic short stature</strong>. This is confirmed with a <strong>bone age radiograph</strong>. <br><br>Lab work is typically necessary to diagnose the various pathologic causes of short stature. When weight-for-length ratio is decreased, malnutrition, chronic illness, or celiac disease may be the cause of short stature. <strong>Celiac disease</strong> is diagnosed with <strong>anti-tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A </strong>and <strong>immunoglobulin G</strong>. Chronic illness can be difficult to diagnose, but physical examination and screening labs, such as a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, inflammatory markers, and urinalysis, can aide in making a diagnosis.<br><br>When weight-for-length ratio is normal or increased, endocrine or genetic disorders may be the cause. Endocrine disorders should be considered, including <strong>hypothyroidism </strong>and <strong>growth hormone deficiency</strong>, which can be diagnosed with <strong>thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) </strong>or<strong> insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3)</strong>, respectively. <strong>Idiopathic short stature</strong> is a <strong>diagnosis of exclusion</strong>; the history, physical, and laboratory studies will all be normal.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Karyotype:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;</span><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are growth hormones, and low levels of these hormones signify growth hormone deficiency.

Physical examination shows <strong>hepatosplenomegaly</strong>, and laboratory studies demonstrate <strong>decreased acid sphingomyelinase activity</strong>, which confirms the diagnosis of <strong>Niemann-Pick disease</strong>.<br><br>In a patient presenting with a suspected inborn error of metabolism, the evaluation should include an assessment for <strong>progressive neurological deterioration</strong>. If present, the next step is to evaluate self-mutilating behavior and unusual odors. If both are absent, examine for <strong>organomegaly</strong>. <strong>Hepatosplenomegaly </strong>without coarse facial features, along with loss of early motor function, suggests <strong>Neimann-Pick disease</strong>. In contrast, the presence of both hepatosplenomegaly and coarse facial features, particularly when accompanied by corneal clouding, is more consistent with Hurler syndrome, whereas Hunter syndrome is not associated with corneal clouding.<br><br><strong>Niemann-Pick disease</strong> is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of <strong>acid sphingomyelinase</strong>. This leads to the accumulation of sphingolipids throughout the body, resulting in tissue damage and organ dysfunction. Affected patients often present with <strong>feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, </strong>and <strong>developmental delay</strong>. <strong>Regression of developmental milestones</strong> becomes noticeable by the age of one year. Physical examination typically reveals <strong>lymphadenopathy</strong>, <strong>hepatosplenomegaly</strong>, and spasticity or rigidity. Laboratory investigations can include a peripheral smear and lipid profile. Confirmation of the diagnosis is achieved by measuring <strong>acid sphingomyelinase activity</strong> in leukocytes and performing <strong>genetic analysis</strong>.

Physical exam is significant for <strong>tachycardia, hypotension, sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes,&#160;</strong>and <strong>delayed capillary refill</strong>. These findings, along with laboratory results showing <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong> and <strong>hyponatremia</strong>, are consistent with <strong>hypovolemic hyponatremia</strong>. <strong>Urinary sodium</strong> can help determine the cause of hypovolemic hyponatremia. <strong>Urine sodium levels &lt;20 mmol/L</strong> suggest an extra-renal cause of hyponatremia, such as <strong>viral gastroenteritis</strong> in this case. &#160;<br><br><strong>Hypovolemic hyponatremia</strong> is usually caused by a combination of sodium loss and water retention to compensate for the volume depletion. Physical exam findings often include <strong>tachycardia </strong>and an <strong>orthostatic drop in blood pressure, sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes, </strong>and <strong>decreased skin turgor</strong>.<br><br>When evaluating hyponatremia in a patient, it is important to order a <strong>plasma osmolality</strong>. If it is &gt;280 mOsm/kg, consider pseudohyponatremia or hyperosmolality; but if it is <strong>&lt;280 mOsm/kg</strong>, diagnose <strong>hyponatremia </strong>and assess <strong>volume status</strong> to determine if the patient is <strong>hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic</strong>. In the setting of hypovolemic hyponatremia, the history and <strong>urine sodium</strong> will help determine the etiology. <br><br><strong>Urine sodium level &lt;20 mmol/L</strong> suggests extrarenal causes of sodium loss. If the patient has a history of <strong>vomiting </strong>and <strong>diarrhea</strong>, such as in this case, the underlying cause of hyponatremia is likely <strong>gastrointestinal loss of sodium</strong>. <strong>Extensive burns </strong>or<strong> excessive sweating</strong> increases insensible fluid losses and can also cause hypovolemic hyponatremia. Also, children with <strong>cystic fibrosis</strong> are susceptible to hyponatremia due to sodium loss through sweat. <strong>Pancreatitis, small bowel obstruction, </strong>or a<strong> severe allergic reaction</strong> may lead to accumulation of extracellular fluid within extravascular spaces, resulting in hypovolemic hyponatremia. Inappropriately <strong>high urine sodium &gt;20 mmol/L</strong> suggests a <strong>renal cause</strong> of hypovolemic hyponatremia, such as salt-wasting, which can be seen in renal dysplasia, proximal tubule dysfunction, or diuretic use.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Serum potassium of 5.4 mEq/L:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hyperkalemia is seen in patients with mineralocorticoid deficiency, which presents with hypotension, hyponatremia, and urine sodium &gt;20 mmol/L.

If so, inquire about <strong>exposure to cat or dog feces</strong> and a history of <strong>geophagia </strong>(eating dirt), since these factors increase the risk of <strong>toxocariasis </strong>and <strong>ocular larva migrans</strong>. When those risk factors are absent, <strong>retinoblastoma </strong>should be strongly considered. <br><br>Retinoblastoma is the most common ocular tumor in children and typically presents with <strong>leukocoria </strong>in a child under three years of age. History may reveal <strong>strabismus or visual changes</strong>. A family history of retinoblastoma or related tumors such as osteosarcoma reflects a germline <strong><em>RB1 </em>gene</strong> mutation. Clinical findings may include one or more <strong>creamy or whitish-gray retinal masses</strong>, orbital inflammation, blood in the anterior chamber <strong>(hyphema)</strong>, <strong>retinal detachment, </strong>or<strong> vitreous inflammation</strong>. Once suspected, orbital <strong>ultrasound or MRI</strong> confirms the diagnosis by demonstrating an <strong>intraocular mass with calcifications</strong> and assessing for optic nerve involvement or extraocular spread.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Slit-lamp examination &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A slit-lamp evaluates anterior eye structures, including the cornea and lens, and is commonly used to diagnose cataracts, keratitis, and uveitis.

If the patient is <strong>2-36 months</strong> old and has a <strong>temperature &#8805;39 &#176;C (102.2 F)</strong>, an <strong>occult bacterial infection</strong> should be considered first.

Symptoms concerning leukemia include fatigue, bleeding/bruising/petechiae, and bone pain. Lymphomas are known for B symptoms which include fever, weight loss, and night sweats. Lymphoma may also be associated with dyspnea and cough. <br><br>Once malignancy is ruled out, inflammatory disorders such as Kawasaki, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should be considered. sJIA and SLE may present with rashes, arthritis and joint swelling, and mouth sores.

All preterm infants&#160;should be&#160;on iron supplementation for the first year of life.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Having citrus foods with supplemental iron:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Red blood cell transfusion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Red blood cell transfusion&#160;should be&#160;given to patients with severe anemia (defined as hemoglobin &lt; 5 g/dL).&#160;This patient&#160;has mild anemia which can be treated with oral supplementation&#160;and&#160;does&#160;not&#160;warrant&#160;a red blood cell&#160;transfusion.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Discontinue breastfeeding:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Although there is limited iron in breastmilk, iron deficiency anemia is not&#160;an indication&#160;to&#160;discontinue&#160;breastfeeding.

The current recommendation for patients who are 22-28 days old with a fever and abnormal inflammatory markers is to perform a&#160;<strong>lumbar puncture</strong>&#160;to obtain&#160;<strong>cerebrospinal (CSF) studies&#160;</strong>and to start<strong>&#160;empiric antibiotics. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>The <strong>initial work-up</strong>&#160;for infants <strong>0-60 days</strong> old who present with a&#160;<strong>fever&#160;</strong>includes obtaining a <strong>complete blood count (CBC), inflammatory markers</strong>&#160;such as c-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT),<strong>&#160;blood cultures,</strong>&#160;and <strong>urinalysis</strong>. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Infants <strong>less than 21 days old&#160;</strong>also need a <strong>urine culture&#160;</strong>and <strong>lumbar puncture</strong> for <strong>CSF studies.</strong>&#160;If the infant is at increased risk for herpes simplex virus (HSV)&#160;infection, such as when there is a maternal history of genital HSV lesions or the infant presents with seizures or vesicles,&#160;they should also be<strong>&#160;tested for HSV. &#160;&#160;</strong>&#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Additional evaluation of <strong>infants 22-60 days</strong> old with fever depends on the results of the urinalysis and inflammatory markers. If<strong> inflammatory markers are abnormal, CSF studies</strong> (and a urine culture if the urinalysis was abnormal) should be obtained in infants <strong>22-28 days old </strong>and considered in infants 29-60 days old. If inflammatory markers are normal but the urinalysis is abnormal, a urine culture should be obtained. If both the inflammatory markers and urinalysis are normal, CSF studies should be considered in infants 22-28 days old but are not necessary in infants 29-60 days old. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>The&#160;initial evaluation for infants with fevers is performed to&#160;diagnose bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and meningitis/encephalitis.

Physical exam reveals <strong>signs of dehydration</strong> secondary to <strong>gastrointestinal loss</strong> leading to <strong>hypernatremia</strong>.<br><br>Symptomatic patients with acute hypernatremia and <strong>significant hypovolemia</strong> should receive <strong>emergent fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluids</strong>. <br><br>Hypernatremia (defined as serum sodium concentration &gt; 145 mEq/L) can be classified as <strong>hypovolemic, euvolemic</strong>, or <strong>hypervolemic&#160;</strong>hypernatremia. <strong>Hypovolemic hypernatremia</strong> may result from <strong>gastrointestinal loss</strong> and <strong>reduced fluid intake</strong>, as in this case. Symptoms of hypernatremia in infants can include <strong>muscle weakness, restlessness, high-pitched cry, insomnia,&#160;</strong>and <strong>lethargy</strong>. An acute or severe rise in serum sodium concentration may lead to neurologic complications, such as <strong>seizures</strong> and <strong>coma</strong>. Increased serum osmolality causes water to rapidly shift out of cells, causing the brain to shrink, subsequently stretching intracranial blood vessels, and may result in <strong>intracranial hemorrhage</strong>.<br><br>In the setting of acute symptoms secondary to hypernatremia, an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong> should be performed. If the patient is unstable, the first step is to stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation. In patients with signs of significant hypovolemia, as in this patient, <strong>emergent fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluid</strong> is needed to restore intravascular volume and tissue perfusion. Excessive volume resuscitation should be avoided to prevent cerebral edema. Once intravascular volume is restored, or in cases where there is no need for urgent volume expansion, treatment should focus on providing fluid necessary to correct any remaining hypernatremia. <strong>Monitoring urine output is essential</strong>. Once the patient is stabilized, continuous vital sign monitoring and oxygen as needed are the next steps in treatment. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Administer isotonic intravenous fluids:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Measure urine osmolality:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient has acute hypovolemic hypernatremia.

Infants with upper respiratory symptoms (cough, nasal congestion), patients who are less than 60 days old, and those who were born premature should be evaluated for respiratory infections (e.g. pertussis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection). <br><br><strong>BRUEs</strong> are <strong>witnessed episodes</strong> during <strong>infancy&#160;</strong>that last <strong>less than one minute</strong> and are characterized by <strong>cyanosis or pallor</strong>; absent, decreased, or <strong>irregular breathing</strong>; a marked <strong>change in muscle tone</strong>; or <strong>altered responsiveness</strong>; followed by a <strong>return to the infant&#8217;s baseline state</strong> of health. Based on historical features and exam findings, infants who meet the criteria for BRUE can be classified into high and low-risk categories. High-risk features are detailed in the graphic above.

An <strong>echocardiogram </strong>should be performed to help confirm the diagnosis. <br><br><strong>Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</strong> is a critical congenital heart disease that presents with findings secondary to&#160;<strong>decreased pulmonary blood flow</strong>. Patients typically&#160;develop cyanosis and shortness of breath shortly after birth or in the first few months of life, depending on the severity. TOF has 4 components:&#160;<strong>overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect</strong> (VSD), <strong>pulmonary stenosis</strong>, and <strong>right ventricular hypertrophy</strong> (RVH). History may reveal cardiac defects on&#160;<strong>prenatal ultrasound</strong>. Physical exam&#160;may show&#160;<strong>central cyanosis</strong>, a <strong>harsh systolic ejection murmur on left sternal border</strong>,&#160;and&#160;<strong>low oxygen saturation</strong> as&#160;are seen in this patient. &#160;<br><br>Newborns with&#160;<strong>central cyanosis</strong>&#160;should be evaluated for <strong>cardiac </strong>and <strong>non-cardiac causes</strong>.&#160;To help differentiate the etiology of central cyanosis,&#160;<strong>pulse oximetry</strong>&#160;for pre- and post-ductal saturations should be checked to determine if congenital heart disease is likely. Pulse oximetry measurements on the <strong>right-hand measure pre-ductal saturation</strong>, and pulse oximetry measurements on <strong>either foot measure post-ductal saturation</strong>.&#160;&#160;<br><br>Criteria for echocardiogram to rule out cyanotic congenital heart disease&#160;includes&#160;<strong>SpO<sub>2</sub> less than 90% in the right hand and foot, SpO<sub>2</sub> less than 95% in right hand and foot</strong>&#160;on three separate occasions,&#160;or&#160;a <strong>difference of 3% or higher between the pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturations</strong> on three separate occasions. If pre-ductal saturations are significantly higher than post-ductal saturations, this means that de-oxygenated blood is being shunted from the pulmonary artery to the aorta through an open ductus arteriosus. This is called <strong>differential cyanosis</strong>.&#160;If any of these criteria are met, <strong>echocardiogram </strong>is necessary to evaluate the patient for critical congenital heart disease.&#160;If echocardiogram is normal or criteria are not met, consider other etiologies of cyanosis, such as pulmonary causes, upper airway obstruction, respiratory depression, neonatal sepsis,&#160;or hemorrhagic shock. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Complete blood count&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Complete blood count (CBC) is useful for determining neonatal sepsis and hemorrhagic shock; both may cause central cyanosis in newborns.

Hypocalcemia can lead to severe presentations such as seizures, stridor secondary to laryngospasm, and prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram. If the patient is unstable, securing the airway, ensuring adequate breathing, and stabilizing circulation are priorities.

The most likely cause of this patient&#8217;s short stature is <strong>malnutrition&#160;</strong>or decreased caloric intake. <br><br>The initial evaluation of short stature requires a thorough history, physical examination, and <strong>evaluation of the growth chart</strong>. Important aspects of the history include birth history, dietary history, parental heights (in order to calculate mid-parental height), and family history of &#8220;later bloomers&#8221; or growth issues. The review of symptoms should be broad and assess for systemic symptoms and should especially highlight gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea). Physical examination should evaluate for dysmorphic features, pallor, murmur, goiter, skin findings, and lymphadenopathy. <br><br>One of the most important aspects of the physical examination in patients being assessed for short stature is an <strong>accurate height and weight</strong> measurement. <strong>Under age two</strong>, measurements should be plotted on a <strong>World Health Organization (WHO) growth chart</strong>. <strong>After age two</strong>, measurements should be plotted on a <strong>Centers for Disease Control (CDC) growth chart</strong>.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. This patient most likely has <strong>congenital syphilis</strong>. A <strong>desquamating rash on the palms, soles</strong>, or diaper area is characteristic of congenital syphilis. <br><br>Congenital syphilis is caused by vertical transmission of <strong><em>Treponema pallidum</em></strong> from infected mothers. Maternal history may reveal <strong>limited prenatal care&#160;</strong>or a<strong>&#160;genital chancre</strong>. Newborn exam is typically normal at birth, but by <strong>1 to 2 months of age</strong>, infants typically develop a <strong>desquamative maculopapular rash</strong> (often seen on the <strong>palms, soles,&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;diaper area</strong>) and <strong>snuffles&#160;</strong>(rhinitis with <strong>mucopurulent nasal discharge</strong>). Other common findings include <strong>pseudoparalysis</strong> due to bone inflammation resulting in severe pain during movement, <strong>generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly,&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;condyloma lata</strong> (wart-like lesions on moist areas of skin). Late congenital syphilis presents after two years of age with oral findings like Hutchinson teeth and mulberry molars. Affected children can also develop deafness, interstitial keratitis, and skeletal abnormalities, such as saber shins. <br><br>With these physical examination findings, syphilis should be suspected. Complete blood count (CBC) may show <strong>thrombocytopenia&#160;</strong>and <strong>anemia</strong>. <strong>Venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL)&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;rapid plasma reagin (RPR)</strong> of the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the <strong>infant</strong> and blood of the <strong>mother&#160;</strong>should be obtained to make a diagnosis.

Following ingestion of lactose or galactose-containing products (e.g., breast milk, standard formula), galactose-1-phosphate <strong>accumulates in tissues</strong>, particularly the <strong>liver and eyes</strong>. Affected infants may present with <strong>lethargy, feeding intolerance, hepatic dysfunction, </strong>and <strong>sepsis due to <em>E. coli</em></strong>, especially before newborn screening results are available. Long-term complications include developmental and learning delays. On physical exam, <strong>hepatomegaly, persistent jaundice, </strong>and <strong>cataracts</strong> may be present. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of non-glucose-reducing substances in the urine and absent GALT activity. Management includes immediate discontinuation of lactose-containing feeds and initiation of a soy-based formula.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cataracts:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hearing loss:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Sensorineural hearing loss can occur in congenital rubella syndrome, which may also present with cataracts, a patent ductus arteriosus, and a blueberry muffin rash.

      "solution": "<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ro7GDTqsQpSNP_ldzmtD2n4gSiabmrGj/_.png\"></div><br>This 10-year-old patient&#8217;s findings (decreased breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, tachypnea, and mild hypoxia) are characteristic of a <strong>simple pneumothorax</strong>. The patient remains hemodynamically stable and shows no signs of tension pneumothorax such as tracheal deviation, hypotension, or severe respiratory distress. In stable cases, high-flow <strong>oxygen&#160;</strong>can promote reabsorption of pleural air, and <strong>chest X-ray</strong> is the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the pneumothorax. <br><br>The table below outlines how <strong>specific injury patterns</strong> identified during the <strong>secondary survey</strong> can inform the prioritized differential diagnosis and the selection of appropriate confirmatory tests in pediatric trauma.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intubation and mechanical ventilation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Intubation is reserved for patients with respiratory failure, altered mental status, or impending airway compromise. Although tachypneic and hypoxic, this patient is alert, maintains a patent airway, and is hemodynamically stable.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Supplemental oxygen and chest X-ray:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Emergent needle decompression:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Needle decompression is indicated for a tension pneumothorax, which typically presents with hemodynamic instability, tracheal deviation, and distended neck veins. While this patient does have signs of a simple pneumothorax, none of the tension features are present; therefore, supplemental oxygen and imaging is the more appropriate next step.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Computed tomography (CT) of the chest:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: CT may be more sensitive for detecting smaller or occult pneumothoraces, but it is not the first-line imaging modality in a stable trauma patient. A chest X-ray is quicker and sufficient for initial evaluation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Broad-spectrum antibiotics:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: There is no clinical evidence of infection or open chest trauma. Antibiotics are not indicated in cases of isolated blunt chest injury without signs of infection.</span></div>",
