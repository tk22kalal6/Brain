It is a chronic condition that requires optimal approach for the management of related symptoms based on their severity. Patients with mild pain are usually managed with<strong>&#160;combined oral contraceptive pills</strong> (OCPs) and as-needed non-steroids anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For those with contraindications to combined OCPs (see table), <strong>progestin-only pills&#160;</strong>(POP) are an acceptable <strong>alternative</strong>, which act by inhibiting the growth of endometrial tissue. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/0FWjYkE_T5_B-OaJ_43HMhX-QBCLOr0Y/_.png\"></div><br><strong>Laparoscopic resection&#160;</strong>of ectopic endometrial tissue is considered the <strong>gold standard</strong> and is both diagnostic and therapeutic.

      "solution": "This patient is presenting with <strong>postpartum hemorrhage</strong> following the delivery of the placenta. The physical examination reveals a <strong>boggy, soft uterus</strong>, which is consistent with the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage due to <strong>uterine atony</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is an <strong>obstetric emergency</strong> and is one of the most common causes of maternal mortality. Postpartum hemorrhage is defined as 500 ml of blood loss following a vaginal delivery, or more than 1000 ml of blood loss after a C-section. The definitive management of PPH depends on the underlying cause. The most common causes of postpartum hemorrhage can be remembered as 4 T&#8217;s - <strong>tone&#160;</strong>(i.e. uterine atony), <strong>trauma&#160;</strong>(i.e. lacerations), <strong>tissue&#160;</strong>(i.e. retained products of conception), and <strong>thrombin&#160;</strong>(i.e. coagulopathy). The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony. Normally, after delivery, the uterus continues to contract, which clamps the spiral arteries and reduces uterine bleeding. Risk factors for uterine atony are factors that cause <strong>overdistention of the uterus</strong> such as multiparity, greater than 4 previous deliveries, previous C-section or uterine surgery, polyhydramnios, large fetus (as seen in this patient), anesthetic drugs, and prolonged labor. The diagnosis of uterine atony is made clinically by demonstrating a boggy, soft and enlarged uterus while excluding other sites of bleeding. Initial management includes <strong>maternal stabilization</strong>, <strong>uterine massage</strong> and <strong>oxytocin&#160;</strong>(1st line); 2nd line agents include methylergonovine and surgical interventions.<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/r6k5x4ALThO69EU7Rp1LQqCYSm2qlZkd/_.png\"></div><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/sS39Vn2dShed_DV6UxxukXAlSem6u-rB/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administer methylergonovine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Methylergonovine is a uterotonic and analgesic used in postpartum hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony to control the bleeding.

The exact cause of eclamptic seizures is not entirely understood, but it is hypothesized to be related to a dysfunctional autoregulatory system of the cerebral circulation which results in vasogenic and/or cytotoxic edema. The majority of patients experience a prodrome of signs and symptoms in the hours before the initial seizure which includes <strong>hypertension</strong>, <strong>headache</strong>, <strong>visual disturbances</strong>, <strong>right upper quadrant or epigastric pain</strong>, <strong>ankle clonus</strong>, and <strong>altered mentation</strong>. Some patients may be asymptomatic. Eclampsia can occur preterm, intrapartum or postpartum. Management is aimed to prevent maternal hypoxia and trauma, treat the hypertension, prevent recurrent seizures, and evaluate the necessity of prompt delivery. <strong>Magnesium sulfate</strong> is a <strong>first-line</strong> medication that works by <strong>stabilizing excitable membranes</strong> and preventing seizure recurrence.

Bacteria are subsequently able to penetrate the skin and proliferate within the stagnant milk. <em><strong>Staphylococcus aureus</strong></em> is the most common causative organism, which can colonize the neonate&#8217;s nasopharynx, leading to infection within the breast during feeding. The diagnosis of mastitis is based upon the clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests are generally not required; however, culture can assist in guiding the antibiotics regimen. &#160;<br><br>Initial management of non-severe cases is aimed to reduce pain and swelling (e.g., NSAIDs, cold compresses) and <strong>continuation of breastfeeding</strong> -- since lactostasis always precedes mastitis, active expression of breast milk to get rid of milk stagnation is of utmost importance. Management of infective lactational mastitis (persistent symptoms beyond 12 hours plus fever) involves<strong>&#160;antibiotic therapy</strong> with activity against S. aureus (nafcillin, oxacillin) and continuation of breastfeeding. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Your condition is due to an underlying malignancy; chemotherapy is indicated; stop breastfeeding:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive type of breast cancer that can occur in women at any age.

The most appropriate next step is to perform <strong>saline microscopy</strong>. If saline microscopy shows <strong>motile trichomonads</strong>, then <strong><em>trichomonas vaginalis</em></strong> can be diagnosed.<br><br>Vaginal trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection that is caused by the protozoan parasite, <strong><em>trichomonas vaginalis</em></strong>. Symptomatic patients with trichomoniasis typically report vaginal discharge with an odor that is accompanied by vulvar itching, irritation, and/or dysuria. The physical exam may reveal a yellow, frothy, vaginal discharge as well as vaginal erythema or cervical erythema with petechiae, known as a <strong>strawberry cervix</strong>. The diagnosis can be made with <strong>saline microscopy</strong> that shows <strong>motile trichomonads</strong> and many polymorphonucleocytes. The pH is typically greater than 4.5 and the &#8220;whiff&#8221; test is typically positive. If no motile trichomonads are seen, then nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) for T. vaginalis can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Saline microscopy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Candida PCR test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Patients with vaginal candidiasis typically present with thick, white, curd-like vaginal discharge.

One known side effect is the development of <strong>hyponatremia</strong>.<br><br>Oxytocin is a peptide hormone produced by the hypothalamus and stored and released in the posterior pituitary. It stimulates uterine contraction by binding to Gq protein-coupled receptors. Once activated, these receptors activate another molecule called phospholipase C. Phospholipase C cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate. Finally, inositol triphosphate promotes the opening of calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, enhancing calcium release into the cytoplasm, which mediates the contraction of the smooth muscle.<br><br>Exogenous oxytocin administration is indicated for both ante- and postpartum conditions. In the antepartum period, oxytocin is administered to strengthen uterine contractions to induce or facilitate labor. Oxytocin is also administered to treat postpartum hemorrhage as it mediates the contraction of the uterus and subsequent closure of uterine vasculature.<br><br>Side effects of oxytocin include vasodilation, which may result in hypotension and tachycardia. In addition, patients may develop water retention and hyponatremia. This occurs secondary to the ability of oxytocin to act on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the renal tubules, promoting free water retention.

If available, pre-treatment with mifepristone is recommended because it reduces the risk of retained products of conception. This option allows patients to better control the timing and setting of their miscarriage while avoiding a surgical procedure. A <strong>suction dilation and curettage (D&C)</strong> is considered definitive management with the lowest failure rate and is associated with <strong>lower amounts of bleeding and faster resolution of symptoms.&#160;</strong>Some patients may determine these benefits outweigh the inherent risks of surgery. &#160; <br><br>All patients, including those undergoing expectant management, should be counseled on<strong>&#160;warning signs</strong> that require evaluation. These include heavy bleeding (soaking at least two pads per hour for at least two hours in a row), prolonged bleeding (bleeding persisting beyond two to three weeks), pain uncontrolled with pain medication, fever, or abnormal/foul-smelling discharge. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Additionally, regardless of the management option chosen, <strong>Rh immune globulin</strong> should be administered to all <strong>Rh-negative patients at risk of alloimmunization.</strong> This includes all patients undergoing a procedure during pregnancy (e.g. D&C for early pregnancy loss) and those with uterine bleeding, especially after 7 weeks of gestational age. <strong>Alloimmunization&#160;</strong>refers to the development of antibodies in maternal serum against antigens on fetal red blood cells, which can occur when fetal and maternal blood come into contact with one another. Once alloimmunized, these maternal antibodies may attack any future Rh-positive fetus, resulting in severe fetal anemia and/or pregnancy loss.

Iron deficiency anemia</strong> is the most common <strong>cause of anemia in pregnancy.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>A mild degree of dilutional anemia is physiologic during pregnancy. However, specific trimester-related cutoffs should be used to define anemia in pregnancy. For patients in the first or third trimester of pregnancy, a hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL is diagnostic of anemia. For patients in the second trimester, a hemoglobin of less than 10.5 g/dL is diagnostic of anemia. Pregnant patients should be screened for<strong>&#160;anemia of pregnancy in the first and second trimesters,</strong> and if present, patients should be treated before birth where blood loss can worsen anemia and lead to maternal and fetal complications. All pregnant patients should also be screened for hemoglobinopathies using hemoglobin electrophoresis at the start of their pregnancy. &#160;<br><br>Causes of anemia of pregnancy include<strong>&#160;nutritional deficiencies</strong>, resulting in <strong>impaired red blood cell production.</strong> In addition, inherited mutations of hemoglobin structure, known as hemoglobinopathies, or conditions resulting in increased destruction of red blood cells can also cause anemia during pregnancy. Patients with malabsorption syndromes (e.g. celiac disease, prior gastric bypass) may develop folate or B12 deficiency. Patients with multiple medical comorbidities may develop anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. Physical examination should assess for scleral icterus (e.g. hemolysis) and neurologic signs, such as ataxia (e.g. B12 deficiency). &#160;<br><br>Pregnant patients with anemia may present with<strong>&#160;fatigue, shortness of breath,</strong> or restless legs (especially in iron deficiency). When evaluating a patient with anemia of pregnancy, history should focus on determining the underlying cause by assessing dietary intake, use of prenatal vitamins, family history of hemoglobinopathies, history of nausea and vomiting, and signs of blood loss. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common pathologic cause of anemia in pregnancy due to multiple factors. Iron requirements increase significantly in pregnancy and inadequate iron intake (often in resource-limited places), blood loss from prior deliveries, and conditions that prevent intake or impair absorption (like nausea and vomiting) in pregnancy can lead to iron deficiency. &#160;<br>&#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/4iZTfrbsRZylyFkbQbmX0xbDS-etL4fP/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;Iron deficiency:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Family history of pernicious anemia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Pernicious anemia can lead to inadequate absorption of B12 with subsequent macrocytic anemia.

The pelvic ultrasound findings of a <strong>myometrial cyst, heterogeneous myometrium,&#160;</strong>and <strong>asymmetric myometrial thickness&#160;</strong>supports the diagnosis of adenomyosis. However, definitive diagnosis can only be made by pathologic evaluation of a hysterectomy specimen. &#160;<br><br><strong>Adenomyosis&#160;</strong>is a benign uterine condition characterized by the presence of <strong>ectopic endometrial stroma</strong> and <strong>glands&#160;</strong>in the <strong>myometrium</strong>. The presence of this ectopic tissue in the myometrium causes it to appear heterogeneous. Varying amounts in different areas create the asymmetric thickness, while the cysts represent dilated endometrial glands. These characteristic ultrasound findings help to differentiate adenomyosis from other causes of chronic pelvic pain and bleeding such as leiomyomata and endometriosis. Other <strong>ultrasound findings</strong> may include <strong>striated projections</strong> from the endometrium, an obscured endometrial echo border and a <strong>globally enlarged uterus.&#160;</strong>In addition, affected areas of the myometrium may show diffuse vascularity with color doppler. &#160;<br><br>Most cases of adenomyosis are diagnosed in parous women in their 40s and 50s, with regression noted following menopause.

An initial dose of an <strong>intravenous antihypertensive</strong> agent, like <strong>labetalol</strong>, should be given as soon as possible, and the patient and fetus should be monitored closely. <br><br>Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy exist on a spectrum, which includes gestational hypertension, preeclampsia without or with severe features, HELLP syndrome, and eclampsia. Additionally, patients with chronic hypertension may also develop superimposed preeclampsia, HELLP, and eclampsia. These conditions are classified according to the <strong>initial gestational age</strong> at presentation; <strong>severity </strong>of the hypertension; and the presence or absence of <strong>proteinuria, warning symptoms, </strong>and <strong>specific lab findings</strong>. <br><br>The first step in evaluating a pregnant patient with hypertension is to determine the stability of both the pregnant person and fetus by assessing and addressing the <strong>CABCDEs</strong>. In most cases of severe hypertension in pregnancy, the patient will not have catastrophic hemorrhage or stroke and will be able to maintain their airway, breathing, and circulation. Fetal well-being should be assessed by analyzing the <strong>fetal heart rate pattern</strong>, and, depending on patient symptoms, performing a pelvic exam. <strong>IV access</strong> should be obtained quickly.<br><br>After the initial assessment of the patient and fetal well-being, it is critical to <strong>control the patient&#8217;s blood pressure</strong> as soon as possible, ideally within 30 to 60 minutes. If the patient has IV access, the recommended agents are <strong>IV labetalol or IV hydralazine</strong>. However, immediate-release oral nifedipine can be used if the patient does not have IV access.

Oral nifedipine is a commonly used antihypertensive in pregnancy for daily blood pressure control in a non-acute setting or in an acute setting if IV access is unavailable. Additionally, nifedipine is used to inhibit contractions for a limited duration of time, typically 48 to 72 hours, in patients with preterm labor.

The pituitary can secrete FSH, but the ovaries cannot respond to or secrete E2 (E2 is low). Therefore, there is no negative feedback on the pituitary, causing FSH levels to rise.

On ultrasound, fibroids appear as uniform, well-encapsulated hypoechic<strong>&#160;round masses within the myometrium. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>An evaluation of AUB is warranted when a patient&#8217;s menstrual patterns fall outside the normal parameters described by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). The normal menstrual cycle should occur <strong>once every 24 to 38 days</strong> and<strong>&#160;last &#8804; 8 days.</strong> Additionally, patients may experience random or cyclic intermenstrual bleeding. In either case, a pelvic <strong>ultrasound </strong>is warranted. Causes of AUB can be divided into structural and non-structural causes, which FIGO categorizes according to the acronym <strong>PALM-COEIN.</strong> The structural causes of AUB include <strong>endometrial polyps, adenomyosis, leiomyomas,</strong> and <strong>malignancy </strong>(or hyperplasia). The non-structural causes include <strong>coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial dysfunction, iatrogenic</strong>, and <strong>not otherwise classified. &#160; &#160; &#160;</strong> &#160; <br><br>Beyond a pelvic ultrasound to look for structural causes, further work-up of abnormal uterine bleeding is guided by the patient&#8217;s presentation and detailed in the table above.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Encapsulated monoclonal proliferation of smooth muscle:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct: </strong></span><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Localized proliferation of endometrial tissue around a vascular core:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>This describes an endometrial polyp, which would be suggested as a&#160;possible diagnosis&#160;when the pelvic ultrasound shows a thickened endometrial stripe, unlike the patient in the vignette.

This is&#160;<strong>abnormal </strong>and&#160;indicates&#160;abnormally&#160;<strong>high vascular resistance</strong>,&#160;limiting blood flow through the placenta. Because the placenta is the respiratory organ in the fetus, reduced placental blood flow can lead to&#160;<strong>fetal hypoxia</strong>, acidemia, and death.&#160;Because this&#160;patient's&#160;doppler shows&#160;<strong>severely increased placental resistance, delivery</strong>&#160;should be considered to prevent adverse outcomes.&#160;<br><br><strong>Umbilical artery Doppler </strong>velocimetry measures the flow of blood through the umbilical arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood away from the fetal heart to the placenta for oxygenation.

Additionally, dilation of the cervix during labor will lead to placental bleeding over the cervix, so these patients should be delivered by cesarean, ideally before the onset of labor. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/1o4MdokYRDqtspLLy6mg59B_R-SrT-ki/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ History of multiple&#160;previous&#160;cesarean births&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong>&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cocaine use&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>Cocaine use may slightly increase the risk of placenta previa&#160;with bleeding.&#160;However,&#160;cocaine use is much less of a risk factor for placenta previa than is&#160;a history of&#160;previous&#160;cesarean birth.

They start at the onset of a contraction, reach their nadir at the peak of a contraction, and recover at the end of the contraction. These dips in FHR represent a <strong>fetal vagal response to head compression during descent into the pelvis</strong> and are commonly seen with <strong>advanced cervical dilation</strong>. <br><br>Intrapartum FHR monitoring serves to detect inadequate fetal oxygenation during labor and allows for intervention before fetal acidemia leads to permanent hypoxic injury. Fetal autonomic responses to mechanical or hypoxic stress reduce the heart rate to reduce myocardial workload. <br><br>Clinical factors may predispose patients to certain fetal heart rate patterns. For example, early <strong>decelerations&#160;</strong>are commonly seen with <strong>advanced cervical dilation</strong> when fetal head compression occurs as the head enters the true pelvis. <strong>Variable decelerations</strong>, which represent umbilical cord compression, are more common in the setting of <strong>ruptured membranes and oligohydramnios</strong>. <strong>Late decelerations</strong> suggest uteroplacental insufficiency and are often observed in conditions associated with <strong>microvascular disease</strong>, such as hypertensive disorders, pre-gestational diabetes, autoimmune disease, and fetal growth restriction. <br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/SRLLkSAlQmiy9mytd5yHXusrS-i4BGPd/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cervical dilation of 9 cm:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ruptured membranes and oligohydramnios:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Ruptured membranes and decreased amniotic fluid volume increase the risk of umbilical cord compression, which leads to variable decelerations characterized by abrupt decreases in FHR&#8212;findings not seen in this vignette.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Magnesium sulfate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Magnesium sulfate and opioids are common causes of minimal variability, which is defined as normal fluctuations of the FHR having an overall amplitude of 5 bpm or less.

Late decelerations begin, peak, and recover after the onset, peak, and end of a contraction, respectively. In this vignette, the decelerations mirror the contraction, consistent with early decelerations. This is a normal finding that indicates head compression, commonly seen at advanced cervical dilation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intrapartum fever:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Intrapartum fever is typically associated with fetal tachycardia, defined as a baseline FHR &gt; 160 bpm.

There are several ways to obtain a sample of the endometrial tissue, but the most common method is with an <strong>endometrial pipelle</strong>, which can be performed in the office. Hysteroscopy with direct biopsy of endometrial tissue can also be performed if results of a pipelle biopsy are inadequate, if a patient is unable to tolerate the office procedure, or if suspicion for EIN or endometrial carcinoma is high enough.<br><br>Endometrial biopsy is recommended for all patients who are <strong>&#8805;45 years of age with AUB</strong>, and for all <strong>postmenopausal patients</strong> with an <strong>endometrial thickness &gt;4 mm</strong>, due to the increased risk of endometrial carcinoma. In premenopausal patients, endometrial thickness does not correlate with the risk of endometrial cancer. In patients with AUB who are under 45 years of age, biopsy is indicated if risk factors for EIN or endometrial cancer are present. These include a history of unopposed estrogen exposure, type 2 diabetes, nulliparity, early age of menarche, late age of menopause, and a personal or family history of Lynch syndrome.

It should be suspected in women of reproductive age with risk factors for a tubal pregnancy, including the previous history of tubal pregnancy, IUD use, sterilization, and history of tubal disease. Laboratory investigations would reveal a rising beta hCG level, and imaging could reveal an extra ovarian adnexal mass/ extrauterine gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The fallopian tubes are situated in the upper margin of the broad ligament of the uterus and are divided anatomically into 4 divisions; the infundibulum, the ampulla, the isthmus, and the intramural or interstitial part of the tube. The isthmus forms the medial one-third of the tube. The ampulla forms the lateral two-thirds and is the site of fertilization. The infundibulum forms the lateral end of the uterine tube and is attached to the tubal pole of the ovary. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Due to its close proximity to the ovary, ovarian torsion or rupture are often considered in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen in a woman of reproductive age.

Medroxyprogesterone is a synthetic progestogen called progestin. &#160;Progestins can be divided into two groups: the progesterone derivatives and the testosterone derivatives. <br><br>Progestins <strong>suppress ovulation by inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone</strong> from the hypothalamus, <strong>induce atrophic changes in the endometrium, and thicken the cervical mucus</strong>.

The most likely diagnosis is<strong>&#160;adnexal torsion</strong> and a recent history of an <strong>inciting event</strong>, like<strong>&#160;vigorous exercise</strong> or anything that would<strong>&#160;increase intraabdominal pressure</strong> (e.g. <strong>weight lifting</strong>), would be consistent with this diagnosis. &#160;<br><br><strong>Adnexal torsion</strong> refers to twisting of the ovary and fallopian tube, either completely or partially, leading to obstruction of blood supply. Adnexal torsion can lead to significant compression of the ovarian blood supply. It first causes venous obstruction and then can cause arterial obstruction and necrosis of the ovary. As such, adnexal torsion is a<strong>&#160;surgical emergency</strong> and treatment is necessary to preserve ovarian and tubal functioning and prevent infertility. The main<strong>&#160;risk factors for adnexal torsion&#160;</strong>are <strong>ovarian masses</strong> and <strong>prior adnexal torsion</strong>. The most common predisposing factors are ovarian cysts or benign neoplasms, with most being related to the reproductive cycle. Masses in the ovaries increase the risk of rotation.

However, visualization of the bladder and upper portions of pelvic structures will be more limited. In contrast, an<strong>&#160;abdominal ultrasound</strong> provides a broader view of the extent of disease in the entire pelvic region, with improved visualization of the bladder and other surrounding structures to assess for involvement. Overlying bowel gas and fat, however, can reduce image quality. In general, <strong>transvaginal and abdominal ultrasounds are complementary</strong> and offer visualization of the same pelvis from different vantage points.

Inflammation, scarring,</strong> <strong>and adhesions</strong> result from ectopic endometrial tissue foci responding to hormonal changes, especially <strong>estrogen</strong>. Endometriosis may cause <strong>infertility </strong>and there is a greater incidence of endometriosis in first-degree relatives (e.g. infertility in the patient&#8217;s sister could be endometriosis).

      "solution": "<strong>Sterilization</strong>, also known as <strong>permanent contraception</strong>, is a surgical procedure that is intended to permanently <strong>prevent future pregnancies.</strong> The only indication for permanent contraception is a <strong>patient&#8217;s desire</strong> for the procedure. Likewise, the only <strong>absolute contraindication</strong> to sterilization is the <strong>lack of consent from a fully informed patient.</strong> This means that for the patient to provide consent, she must be free from any coercion and truly <strong>understand all the options&#160;</strong>and the implications of her decision. At the end of this encounter, the patient expresses <strong>uncertainty about permanent contraception</strong> by stating her desire to learn more about LARCs. Therefore, performing a sterilization procedure on this patient is contraindicated until she confidently rejects all other forms of contraception in favor of sterilization. &#160; <br><br>Although patient desire is the only indication for sterilization, numerous patient factors may be obtained in history and exams that make <strong>alternative forms of contraception</strong> more favorable, as detailed in the table below. The patient should be counseled on these alternatives to obtain informed consent. Additionally, the risk of unintended pregnancy should be weighed against the risks of surgery and this should be discussed with the patient to obtain informed consent. &#160; <br><br>It is important for the counseling provider to <strong>clearly explain all the relevant medical facts&#160;</strong>and to make a medically sound <strong>contraceptive recommendation</strong>. For example, the physician in the vignette should inform the patient of her increased risk of regret due to her young age, as well as the potential increased risk of surgical injury due to suspected adhesive disease from endometriosis, and that for these reasons, a LARC is a better option to consider right now. However, the final decision to proceed with sterilization should always lie with the well-informed patient and may be based on personal preferences. Therefore, if the patient returns with strong, clear convictions desiring sterilization, it would be appropriate to proceed with the procedure at that time. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/_6vwkRK2TeGbPddtpPDGc7VLQGuub8uq/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Uncertainty about permanent contraception:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Having exclusively female sexual partners:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The biological sex and gender of a person&#8217;s partner(s) is not a contraindication for providing permanent sterilization.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Age &lt; 25 and lack of living children:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>There is no association between the number of living children a person has and the likelihood of regretting permanent sterilization, though a young age at the time of sterilization is associated with regret of permanent sterilization.

      "solution": "This pregnant patient who presents with <strong>heavy vaginal bleeding</strong><strong>,</strong> clots, moderate crampy <strong>abdominal pain</strong>, and pelvic examination revealing a <strong>dilated cervical os</strong> with <strong>tissue protruding&#160;</strong>from the canal most likely has experienced an<strong>&#160;incomplete miscarriage.&#160;</strong>The presence of tachycardia and hypotension reflects<strong>&#160;hemodynamic instability&#160;</strong>and is consistent with significant <strong>blood loss.</strong> In this setting, <strong>immediate suction curettage</strong> to remove all remaining products of conception is required to prevent further blood loss and stabilize the patient. Delaying surgical intervention can lead to increased morbidity and even possible mortality. &#160; &#160;<br><br>During most first trimester losses, loss of the fetus or embryo occurs before the expulsion of the products of conception. Prior to 10 weeks, the fetus and placenta are expelled together.<strong>&#160;The initial symptom</strong> is usually <strong>bleeding&#160;</strong>as a consequence of cervical opening and placental separation. Bleeding is<strong>&#160;followed by crampy abdominal pain</strong>. By definition, an incomplete miscarriage means that some pregnancy tissue has not been completely expelled. In a stable patient, in addition to curettage, expectant management and misoprostol are management options that can be used to complete the process. Patient preference often determines which modality is selected. &#160; &#160;<br><br>To restore <strong>hemodynamic stability,</strong> other steps besides <strong>suction curettage </strong>must be taken.<strong> Intravenous fluids </strong>should be administered to restore blood volume, and <strong>transfusion of packed red blood cells </strong>should be provided depending on hemoglobin levels. Additionally, if the patient is Rh-negative, RhoGAM should be given to prevent Rh sensitization in future Rh-positive pregnancies. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Misoprostol:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>This patient&#160;likely has&#160;an incomplete miscarriage.

      "solution": "This woman, who presents with <strong>shoulders</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>that do <strong>not deliver</strong> with gentle downward traction and retraction of the fetal head against the perineum <strong>(turtle sign)</strong>, has <strong>shoulder dystocia</strong>. Shoulder dystocia refers to the impaction of the fetal shoulder on the bony pelvis, and it is an obstetric emergency. Initial management steps include <strong>calling for help</strong>, having the patient <strong>stop pushing</strong>, performing the <strong>McRoberts maneuver (Hyperflex and abducting the maternal hips)</strong>, <strong>and&#160;</strong>applying <strong>suprapubic pressure. &#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>The<strong>&#160;McRoberts maneuver</strong> involves <strong>hyperflexing&#160;</strong>and abducting the maternal hips, which can be thought of as bringing the maternal <strong>knees&#160;</strong>towards the <strong>armpits</strong>. This maneuver <strong>rotates&#160;</strong>the <strong>symphysis&#160;</strong>pubis towards the maternal head, <strong>flattens&#160;</strong>the <strong>lumbosacral&#160;</strong>curve, and can free the impacted shoulder. Simultaneously, applying <strong>suprapubic pressure</strong> internally rotates the anterior shoulder, creating a shorter bisacromial diameter, and can manually dislodge the impacted shoulder. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Management&#160;</strong>of shoulder dystocia should begin with the least invasive, lowest-risk <strong>external&#160;</strong>maneuvers. Pushing should stop. The <strong>McRoberts</strong> maneuver with <strong>suprapubic&#160;</strong>pressure will be the first choice and is often effective. If dystocia persists, internal maneuvers, including delivery of the posterior arm, Rubin and Woods rotational maneuvers, posterior axillary sling, and Gaskin would be second-line choices. An episiotomy may improve access to these internal maneuvers. If these initial steps are unsuccessful, methods of last resort would include the Zavanelli maneuver, abdominal rescue, fetal clavicle fracture, and symphysiotomy. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>A description of first, second, and third-line maneuvers for shoulder dystocia are provided in the table below. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/h-8FAeLkSQi2nkMrOWzTHlBpRwaZF0in/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Hyperflex and abduct the maternal hips&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Perform episiotomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Shoulder dystocia is not caused by the soft tissue of the perineum; it is due to bone-on-bone impaction.

This patient's prior <strong>chlamydial infection</strong> likely increased her risk for developing an ectopic pregnancy.<br>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that has implanted outside of the uterus. The most significant risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include a history of <strong>prior ectopic pregnancy</strong>, as well as the presence of clinical factors that suggest potential <strong>fallopian tube damage</strong>, including a history of <strong>pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), chlamydial infection, pelvic surgery, endometriosis, </strong>and <strong>ruptured appendicitis</strong>. While a history of PID increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy three-fold, a history of chlamydial infection alone still increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy by 30%. Additional risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include a history of infertility, use of assisted reproductive technology to achieve pregnancy, smoking, <em>in utero</em> exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), and regular vaginal douching. <br><br>Finally, it should be noted that IUDs are highly effective contraceptive methods and, overall, significantly decrease the risk of ectopic pregnancy. For example, one study demonstrated that IUD users have rates of ectopic pregnancy that are approximately 14 times lower than those not using contraception. If, however, a patient does become pregnant with an IUD in place, the chance that the pregnancy is ectopic can approach 50%, depending on the type of IUD. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Previous chlamydial infection:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ History of cholecystectomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Cholecystitis affects the upper abdominal cavity and is unlikely to increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy.

An <strong>amnioinfusion&#160;</strong>could help relieve pressure on the umbilical cord and is the best next step in managing the patient in this vignette. An amnioinfusion refers to an infusion of sterile saline into the uterine cavity through an intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC), cushioning the umbilical cord. &#160;<br><br>Labor management is guided by the fetal heart rate (FHR) category. Category I tracings are reassuring and can be managed with routine care.

Patients with these tracings should first be assessed for the presence of accelerations and moderate variability, both of which are associated with a normal fetal acid-base status. When these reassuring features are present, intrauterine resuscitation is usually appropriate. This can include repositioning the patient, administering an IV fluid bolus, and, in cases of recurrent variable decelerations, performing an amnioinfusion. Additionally, patients should be assessed for signs of infection, abruption, cord accident, or maternal hypotension and treated accordingly if any are found.<br>&#160; &#160; <node/><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/GOKMuh_-QC2ZlVI1ypndvOUxS46DnaWI/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Amnioinfusion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Supplemental oxygen:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Supplemental oxygen does not improve fetal outcomes and is no longer recommended as part of routine intrauterine resuscitation in patients with a normal oxygen saturation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tocolysis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Tocolysis can be considered for patients not receiving uterotonic agents who develop tachysystole and category II tracings.

This type of incontinence is primarily caused by detrusor overactivity, in which involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle lead to a sudden and strong need to void. <strong>Urodynamic testing</strong> can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating these involuntary contractions. <br><br>The diagnostic workup for urinary incontinence begins with a detailed history and physical examination, including assessment of symptoms, medical history, and current medications. Initial tests often include <strong>urinalysis and urine culture</strong> to rule out infection. Simple in-office evaluations such as the <strong>cough stress test and post-void residual (PVR)</strong> measurement help assess for stress incontinence and incomplete bladder emptying, respectively. If the initial evaluation is inconclusive or if UUI is suspected, further testing such as urodynamic studies may be required to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Post-void residual (PVR) measurement:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A PVR measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after voiding and is typically elevated in overflow incontinence. However, this patient has no reported difficulty emptying the bladder, and the symptoms are more consistent with urgency urinary incontinence. Therefore, the PVR is expected to be normal.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cough stress test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The cough stress test assesses for stress urinary incontinence by observing for urine leakage during activities that increase abdominal pressure, such as coughing. Since the patient does not report leakage during coughing or laughing, the test would likely be normal.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Test of urethral mobility:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Urethral hypermobility would be expected with stress urinary incontinence. However, this patient&#8217;s symptoms are more consistent with urgency incontinence rather than stress incontinence, so this test would likely be normal.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pelvic ultrasound:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A pelvic ultrasound is used to visualize the pelvic organs.

Episiotomies are done to minimize perineal injuries caused by overstretching the perineum by the fetal head; however, they are not routinely <strong>indicated</strong>. &#160;Possible indications for an episiotomy include conditions when the physician anticipates a perineal tear, elderly primigravida, macrosomia, face to pubis delivery, forceps/ventouse delivery, breech delivery, or shoulder dystocia. &#160; &#160;<br><br>There are two common <strong>approaches&#160;</strong>to an episiotomy; a mediolateral approach and a median approach. &#160;In a <strong>mediolateral episiotomy,</strong> the incision is made at an angle and proceeds from the vaginal opening diagonally downwards to the left or the right in a straight line that runs an inch away from the anus. &#160;During a mediolateral episiotomy, structures incised include the posterior vaginal wall, superficial and deep transverse perineal muscles, bulbospongiosus, part of the levator ani, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. &#160; <br><br>In the <strong>median episiotomy</strong>, the incision proceeds from the vaginal opening downwards. Median episiotomies bifurcate the perineal body, which supports the female pelvic organs, particularly the posterior vaginal wall. Incision of the perineal body poses a risk of pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence. Midline episiotomies can also extend into the anal sphincter and cause sphincter dysfunction and fecal incontinence. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/uWVZ64HDSceOf5SmIYZBFWjUSv_ARI3k/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/lsAuTeclQO_r3HxUMKV01-nGTomXgFF3/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Perineal body&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Anal mucosa:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Fourth-degree perineal tears involve the anal sphincter complex and the anal mucosa.

The molecular structure of stool softeners includes a hydrophilic polar end and a hydrophobic non-polar end. This allows docusate to facilitate dishesion of fatty stool and allow for water penetration, making the stool softer. Other examples of emollient stool softeners include glycerin and mineral oil. Docusate does not have adverse effects in pregnancy and is therefore generally considered to be safe. While very safe and well-tolerated, it is important to note, however, that in recent years the effectiveness of docusate has been called into question more and more. A side effect of all long-term emollient stool softener use is intermittent diarrhea. Docusate is often used in combination formulations with senna to treat opioid-induced constipation.

Migraine with aura is a contraindication to systemic COC due to an increased risk of <strong>stroke</strong>. <br><br><strong>Reversible contraception</strong> refers to any method of pregnancy prevention that doesn&#8217;t impact future fertility. The evaluation of a patient who desires reversible contraception begins by assessing the patient&#8217;s <strong>age </strong>and the timing of their last <strong>menstrual period</strong>. <strong>Sexual history</strong>, while not required, helps guide conversations on safe sexual practices and can be assessed using the &#8220;5 Ps&#8221;: Partners, Practices, Past history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), Prevention of STIs, and Pregnancy intention. Decisions about what type of contraception to use are driven by <strong>patient preference</strong> as well as the patient's <strong>medical eligibility criteria</strong> (MEC). The MEC is a set of standards that provides recommendations on the safety of contraceptives in the setting of different medical conditions and includes factors from the <strong>patient&#8217;s history</strong> such as active or prior medical diagnoses, mental health conditions, breastfeeding status, postpartum status, and medications.<br><br>When prescribing oral contraception, vital signs should be performed and the patient&#8217;s <strong>blood pressure and BMI should be assessed</strong>. These can be evaluated from either a current or prior recent office visit, as an in-person visit is not required before prescribing contraception. Hypertension is a contraindication to the use of combined oral contraception pills. Factors relating to pelvic health, such as evidence of <strong>pelvic infections</strong> or <strong>uterine anomalies</strong> should be considered as well; however, a <strong>pelvic examination is not required</strong> before prescribing oral contraceptive pills.

The patient subsequently undergoes intensive dietary modifications and initiates regular moderate physical activity. Her self-monitoring of blood glucose shows postprandial glucose levels ranging from 95-115 mg/dL. Based on these results, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

      "solution": "<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/qMvQvK-kTdWUgFFzO4LiV1d7RfCy-8ll/_.png\"></div><br><br>The patient's 100-gram <strong>oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)</strong> results indicate gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), as two of the values meet or exceed the <strong>Carpenter and Coustan criteria&#160;</strong>(fasting &lt;95 mg/dL, 1-hour &lt;180 mg/dL, 2-hour &lt;155 mg/dL, 3-hour &lt;140 mg/dL). In this case, the patient's fasting glucose is normal, but the 1-hour and 2-hour values are elevated. After initiating dietary and lifestyle modifications, she demonstrates good glucose control. This classifies her condition as <strong>A1 GDM</strong>, which can be managed with<strong>&#160;lifestyle modifications&#160;</strong> including <strong>dietary changes,</strong><strong>&#160;physical activity,</strong> and self-monitoring of glucose levels without the need for medication. &#160;<br><br>A1 and A2 are classifications of GDM that help guide management strategies based on the severity of the condition. <strong>A1 GDM&#160;</strong>is diagnosed when<strong>&#160;glycemic control</strong> is <strong>achieved&#160;</strong>through<strong>&#160;diet and exercise alone without medication.&#160;</strong>Women with A1 GDM do not require medication and management focuses on lifestyle modifications, including intensive nutritional counseling and regular moderate physical activity to maintain blood glucose within the target range. Commonly used antepartum glycemic targets are one-hour postprandial blood glucose concentration &lt;140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) and two-hour postprandial glucose concentration &lt;120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L). &#160;<br><br><strong>A2 GDM represents</strong> a more <strong>severe </strong>form of GDM, where blood glucose levels remain high despite dietary and lifestyle changes, and <strong>glycemic control is achieved with medications. A2 GDM</strong> should be managed with<strong> pharmacological interventions</strong> such as insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. <strong>A2 GDM</strong> is associated with a <strong>higher risk of pregnancy-related complications</strong>, requiring more intensive monitoring and management compared to <strong>A1 GDM. </strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Initiate insulin therapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This patient&#8217;s gestational diabetes (GDM) is classified as A1, indicating that blood glucose levels are elevated but can be controlled with dietary modifications and physical activity alone. This patient has adequate glucose control with initial diet and lifestyle interventions and should continue current management. Insulin therapy is indicated for A2 GDM or for cases of A1 GDM that do not respond adequately to dietary and lifestyle interventions.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Continue with dietary modifications and regular moderate physical activity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Repeat oral glucose tolerance testing in 4 weeks:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>While daily self-monitoring of blood glucose is an essential part of managing diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus, retesting with an oral glucose tolerance test in 4 weeks is not indicated once the diagnosis is established.
