Treatment of PD involves several medications that increase dopamine levels within the brain. &#160; <br><br>Levodopa is peripherally metabolized by dopamine decarboxylase and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Levodopa (L-DOPA) is commonly given in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa) to prevent its peripheral metabolism to dopamine, as peripherally active dopamine leads to various adverse effects (e.g.nausea, vomiting). &#160; &#160;<br><br>When levodopa is co-administered with a decarboxylase inhibitor, the medication is converted by peripheral <strong>COMT </strong>to the inert metabolite 3-O- methyldopa (3-OMD). Only 10% of a given dose of levodopa reaches the brain for subsequent conversion to dopamine. Two medications that<strong> inhibit COMT</strong> are <strong>tolcapone </strong>and <strong>entacapone</strong>, which can be used as adjunctive therapies to treat PD. Both COMT inhibitors exert their therapeutic effects by inhibiting the peripheral metabolism of levodopa and increasing its bioavailability for the central nervous system. In addition, they reduce the formation of 3-OMD, which competes with L-DOPA for transport into the brain. Tolcapone inhibits both peripheral and, to a lesser extent, central COMT, whereas entacapone acts only in the periphery. &#160; <br><br>COMT inhibitors are often combined with levodopa when patients develop motor complications. In addition, they improve the therapeutic response to levodopa and reduce the &#8220;wearing-off&#8221; phenomenon.

      "solution": "This 21-year-old patient presents with signs and symptoms of <strong>increased intracranial pressure (ICP)</strong>, including lethargy and papilledema following a <strong>toxic ingestion</strong>. Acute liver failure from acetaminophen toxicity can cause hyperammonemia, which leads to cerebral edema. This may appear on neuroimaging as a <strong>loss of gray-white matter differentiation</strong>.<br><br>After initial stabilization and supportive care, a <strong>computed tomography (CT)</strong> of the head can help identify whether the increase in ICP is secondary to expansion of the cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or brain compartments. Imaging may demonstrate <strong>ventriculomegaly, hemorrhage </strong>or <strong>vascular expansion</strong> such as an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, <strong>mass effect, ischemia</strong>, or cerebral edema. Blurring of the margins between the gray and white matter regions within the brain parenchyma, along with <strong>effacement of sulci and ventricles</strong>, suggests cerebral edema. &#160;<br><br>Once the underlying cause of increased ICP is identified, definitive treatment can proceed. In cases of cerebral edema, management focuses on preventing further injury by addressing the underlying cause. For acetaminophen overdose, appropriate interventions include gastrointestinal decontamination, early administration of N-acetylcysteine, hyperosmolar therapy, and ICP monitoring. <br><br>P.S.
