The electrocardiogram is concerning for inferior myocardial infarction given the ST-elevations in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal changes. In the peri-myocardial infarction period, patients are at high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and must be treated with appropriate medications to terminate the arrhythmia. The only medication that is contraindicated in this setting is <strong>flecainide</strong>, a <strong>class IC antiarrhythmic medication</strong><strong>,</strong> which <strong>cannot be used in the setting of ischemia or known structural heart disease. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Understanding the clinical uses and indications for class I antiarrhythmics is an important concept. In general, these medications are all used for the treatment of <strong>ventricular tachycardias, </strong>while only class IA and IC medications carry clinical utility in the treatment of <strong>supraventricular tachycardias. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Class IA medications are often used particularly for recurrent atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.

The wide anterior chamber angle&#160;observed&#160;on&#160;gonioscopy&#160;supports&#160;this diagnosis. The most&#160;appropriate initial&#160;treatment for open-angle glaucoma is&#160;<strong>topical prostaglandin analogs</strong>&#160;(e.g.&#160;latanoprost), which&#160;<strong>increase the outflow of aqueous humor</strong>&#160;and&#160;lower&#160;intraocular pressure, helping to&#160;prevent&#160;optic&#160;nerve damage.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Treatment for&#160;<strong>open-angle glaucoma</strong>&#160;focuses on&#160;<strong>lowering IOP</strong>&#160;to prevent further optic nerve damage. First-line&#160;treatment includes&#160;topical medications,&#160;such as&#160;<strong>prostaglandin analogs</strong>,&#160;which&#160;increase aqueous humor outflow,&#160;and&#160;<strong>beta-blockers</strong>, which reduce aqueous humor production.&#160;<strong>Laser trabeculoplasty </strong>may be performed to enhance drainage&#160;and may be&#160;used&#160;first&#160;line&#160;as well.

Initial treatment includes intravenous medications,&#160;such as mannitol or&#160;<strong>acetazolamide</strong>, and topical agents,&#160;like&#160;<strong>beta-blockers and alpha-2 agonists</strong>. Definitive treatment involves<strong> laser peripheral iridotomy </strong>or&#160;<strong>surgical iridectomy </strong>to relieve the blockage&#160;via creation&#160;of&#160;a&#160;new drainage pathway for aqueous humor, thereby preventing recurrent episodes and preserving vision.&#160;For patients with acute&#160;angle-closure glaucoma, the untreated opposite eye has a 40-80% risk of developing the condition within five&#160;to ten years, so prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy is recommended for the unaffected eye.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Surgical trabeculectomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong>&#160;Surgical therapy is used initially&#160;only in cases of severe peripheral field loss,&#160;or&#160;it&#160;can be used as second line therapy for patients who&#160;do&#160;not&#160;respond to medications&#160;or laser therapy.&#160;This patient should be treated with&#160;topical medication before considering surgery.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intravenous mannitol:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect</span><span>:</span></strong><strong>&#160;</strong>Intravenous mannitol is used&#160;in emergency situations&#160;to rapidly lower intraocular pressure&#160;in patients&#160;with&#160;acute angle-closure glaucoma.

Together, these findings indicate <strong>acute urinary retention</strong> resulting in <strong>postrenal AKI</strong>. <strong>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)</strong> is the most common cause of acute urinary retention in older adult patients with a prostate, and digital rectal examination often reveals an <strong>enlarged, palpable prostate</strong>.<br><br>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a sudden decline in kidney function that results in electrolyte imbalances, extracellular dysregulation, and accumulation of nitrogenous wastes such as ammonia and uric acid. <strong>Postrenal AKI</strong> is a form of AKI caused by <strong>obstruction of urine flow anywhere in the urinary tract</strong>, leading to increased back pressure and reduced glomerular filtration. It is classified by the level of urinary tract obstruction, either upper or lower. <br><br>History and physical examination findings help distinguish the underlying cause of postrenal AKI. <strong>Upper urinary tract obstruction</strong> (e.g., nephrolithiasis, tumor) typically presents with flank pain, hematuria, and a history of <strong>recurrent kidney stones&#160;</strong><strong>or</strong><strong>&#160;uropathy</strong>. In contrast, <strong>lower urinary tract obstruction</strong> from BPH often manifests with urinary hesitancy, incomplete bladder emptying, a slow stream, and suprapubic discomfort. On physical examination, findings may include a <strong>distended bladder</strong> or a <strong>palpable prostate</strong> on digital rectal examination.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Enlarged, palpable prostate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Spasticity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Neurogenic bladder is a common cause of urinary retention in patients with a known history of neurologic disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, spinal cord injury). In this case, the normal reflexes, absence of other neurologic signs, and a well-controlled HbA1c argue against a neurogenic cause.

However, these conditions often present with back pain, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and pyuria and/or hematuria on urinalysis.

Crohn disease can affect any part of the GI tract (from the <strong>mouth to the anus</strong>) and is characterized by<strong> transmural skip lesions</strong> which can lead to abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever. It can be categorized as mild to moderate, moderate to severe, or severe. Management is based on the severity of disease. When evaluating a patient with suspected Crohn disease, physicians should first perform an ABCrohn diseaseE assessment (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) to determine if the patient is <strong>stable or unstable.</strong> &#160; <br><br>Patients with severe Crohn disease might present with signs of <strong>shock </strong>like tachycardia and refractory hypotension. Because of the high mortality risk in these individuals, it is essential to hospitalize them, obtain intravenous access, and start them on <strong>IV fluids</strong>. Once they are stable, look for the cause of their instability, such as small bowel obstruction or sepsis from an abscess. &#160; <br><br>Patients with Crohn disease who develop an acute <strong>small bowel obstruction</strong> (SBO) typically have symptoms of nausea, vomiting, cramping, abdominal pain, and inability to pass flatus or stool (this is called obstipation). SBO may result from a stricture causing mechanical obstruction. Medical management with<strong> intravenous hydration, bowel rest, and nasogastric suction</strong> is often successful, with a response seen within 24 to 48 hours.

Treatment is directed at reducing inflammation (steroids) and relaxing bronchial smooth muscle (beta-agonists and muscarinic antagonists).

If more control is needed, this regimen can be changed to a <strong>daily low-dose ICS</strong> with or without an as-needed SABA for rescue therapy. If a patient&#8217;s asthma continues to be partially controlled, they should switch to a <strong>daily low-dose ICS-LABA</strong>, again adding a SABA for rescue therapy. If patients are still poorly managed, the next step is changing to a <strong>daily medium-dose ICS-LABA</strong> and, eventually, a <strong>daily high-dose ICS-LABA</strong>. If asthma is still poorly controlled, other medications should be considered, such as an <strong>inhaled LAMA or biological agents</strong> (e.g., mepolizumab, omalizumab).<br><br>For <strong>acute asthma exacerbations</strong>, including those in status asthmaticus, patients should receive <strong>supplemental oxygen</strong>, inhaled <strong>bronchodilators&#160;</strong>including a short-acting muscarinic antagonist like ipratropium and a short-acting beta agonist or SABA like albuterol, and <strong>systemic corticosteroids</strong>. If a patient doesn&#8217;t respond to this treatment, then a single dose of <strong>IV magnesium</strong> may be administered. If they do not respond to these measures, patients should be considered for non-invasive ventilation (e.g. bi-level positive airway pressure) or endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Peripheral smear can help differentiate between the causes of hemolysis. <strong>Decreased hepatic uptake</strong> can occur due to medications (e.g. <strong>rifampin</strong>) as seen in this case, portosystemic shunting (e.g. after TIPS procedure), cirrhosis, and congestive hepatopathy from right heart failure.

Several medications (such as <strong>probenecid</strong>, <strong>rifampin</strong>, and others) can <strong>impair the hepatic uptake of bilirubin</strong>. Unconjugated bilirubin then gets absorbed into the bloodstream without conjugation and leads to elevated serum unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin.

On physical examination, she has tenderness to palpation and there is a <strong>tear in the posterior anal midline</strong>, suggesting an <strong>anal fissure</strong>. Anal fissures are one of the most common causes of anal pain and bleeding. Anal fissures are <strong>superficial tears in the anoderm</strong> distal to the dentate line and are usually located in the <strong>posterior midline</strong>. The majority of anal fissures are caused by local trauma such as constipation or diarrhea, vaginal delivery, or anal sex. On physical examination, they appear as <strong>superficial lacerations</strong> with or without bleeding. At times perianal skin tags may also be present which indicate prior episodes of inflammation or hemorrhoids.<br><br>When examining a patient with an anal fissure, the patient should be in the most comfortable position. Anal fissures are very tender to palpation and can be excruciatingly painful for the patient. Therefore, physical manipulation of the anus or rectum should be kept to a minimum, and instrumentation with anoscopy should be avoided if possible.<br><br>A thorough history and physical examination is important for developing the differential diagnoses for a patient presenting with hematochezia. One <strong>key historical element</strong> is the <strong>absence or presence of rectal pain</strong>. Causes of painless hematochezia include diverticular bleeding, Dieulafoy lesions, angiodysplasia, and colorectal cancer. Causes of painful hematochezia can include anorectal disorders (such as anal fissures, external hemorrhoids, thrombosed internal hemorrhoids, anorectal abscesses, and anal cancer), inflammatory colitis (IBD), and radiation telangiectasia or proctitis.

Occult GI bleeds can be from inflammatory, neoplastic, and congenital causes. <br><br>All patients presenting with active, ongoing bleeding should have blood tests obtained to evaluate their hemoglobin and assess the need for transfusion. Blood tests may also help differentiate an active lower GI bleed from an active brisk ongoing upper GI bleed. <strong>Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-to-creatinine ratio</strong> can help differentiate between the two. Blood gets absorbed as it travels through the small bowel leading to an increased BUN, and patients may have decreased renal perfusion with an ongoing bleed. This will lead to an <strong>elevated creatinine BUN-to-creatinine ratio</strong> in patients with an <strong>upper GI bleed</strong>. In a lower GI bleed, the BUN-to-creatinine ratio would be normal.<br><br>An upper GI endoscopy should be performed when an upper GI bleed is suspected. Endoscopy may not be possible if a patient is having active bleeding. However, other diagnostic studies should be obtained to identify the site of bleeding. These may include bedside NG tube lavage, CT angiography, and tagged red cell scan to identify the site of the bleeding.

All patients should first be assessed for stability. If unstable, the airway, breathing and circulation should be stabilized. This patient has an altered mental status and is in <strong>respiratory distress</strong>, he should have immediate stabilization of his airway and breathing with <strong>endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation</strong>. In patients with HHS, intubation is recommended when the Glasgow coma score is less than 8. <br><br>Once the airway has been secured, the next step would be to obtain IV access, start IV fluid hydration and continuous vital sign monitoring. HHS and DKA may present similarly, so after stabilization of the patient, additional history should be obtained as well as laboratory testing. Both conditions occur in the setting of <strong>precipitating events</strong> which can include new-onset diabetes, infections or other acute illnesses, medication side effects, or inadequate treatment of already-diagnosed diabetes mellitus. HHS is more commonly seen in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The most appropriate test to diagnose this is a <strong>CT scan of the chest with IV contrast</strong>. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of airway obstruction should have a thorough history taken and targeted laboratory and imaging studies guided by the most likely cause. <br><br>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected airway obstruction is guided by the most likely cause based on history and physical exam. <strong>Tracheal narrowing</strong> manifests with persistent cough, sputum retention, and recurrent respiratory infections.

While a chest x-ray serves as a first-line investigation, it has limited utility for non-radiopaque objects, but may show indirect findings including hyperinflation of the affected side and mediastinal shift towards the unaffected side.

Either a chest x-ray or chest CT scan can be used to make the diagnosis. An x-ray may demonstrate the classic 'finger-in-glove' sign, where opacities originate from the hilum and project towards the periphery. CT findings will often reveal filling defects within the bronchi, indicative of mucus plugging. <br><br><strong>Malignancies&#160;</strong>can present with a chronic cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, and smoking history.

Hepatitis C should be suspected in patients with known high-risk behaviors or exposures (e.g., tattooing with non-sterile equipment, IV drug use, sexual contact with a known HCV carrier).

Patients with active infection (positive HCV RNA) should be treated with antivirals, such as sofosbuvir-velpatasvir or glecaprevir-pibrentasvir. Patients should be counseled about lifestyle modifications (e.g. alcohol cessation) and vaccinated against hepatitis A and B virus. If HCV RNA is negative and there is a high suspicion of infection, HCV RNA testing should be repeated in six months.

As a result, ritonavir can lead to <strong>impaired clearance</strong> and <strong>increased serum concentration</strong> of the medications mentioned above.

Administration of<strong>&#160;sublingual nitroglycerin</strong> is the best next step to improve his symptoms. &#160; <br><br>Nitroglycerin is an antianginal drug of the class nitrates, typically used to manage acute episodes of myocardial ischemia. It acts by causing venous smooth muscle relaxation (via cGMP), leading to a decrease in cardiac preload, which, in turn, causes a <strong>reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>The sublingual form of nitroglycerin has a rapid onset, causing a vasodilatory effect within the first 3 minutes after administration that lasts approximately 25 minutes, making it suitable for the treatment and short-term prevention of acute anginal pain. Other routes of nitroglycerin administration include transdermal and intravenous, both of which are used for the long-term prevention of angina pectoris. Isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide mononitrate, which also belong to the class of nitrates and are administered orally, have a more prolonged onset (15-30 minutes) &#160;and duration of action (6-10 hours), which makes them useful for the long-term prevention of angina pectoris.

      "solution": "This patient presents with crampy abdominal pain and intermittent non-bloody diarrhea that is exacerbated by consuming lactose containing foods. These findings are suggestive of lactose intolerance, which is a type of osmotic diarrhea. Affected patients lack the enzyme lactase. As a result, lactose cannot be broken down and remains in the intestinal lumen, where it is osmotically active and prevents water absorption by the intestines.<br><br><strong>Osmotic diarrhea</strong> occurs due to the presence of unabsorbed solutes (e.g. lactose) in the intestinal lumen. These unabsorbed solutes exert an osmotic power, trapping water in the lumen as well as drawing water into the lumen. Osmotic diarrhea is watery, non-bloody, and typically resolves when the causative substance (e.g., food, medication) is discontinued.<br><br>Another type of diarrhea is <strong>secretory diarrhea</strong>, which can occur in certain infections (e.g. <em>Vibrio cholera</em>) and some gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. VIPoma). It results from excessive secretion of ions into the intestinal lumen, which exerts an osmotic effect and sucks fluid from the surrounding tissues into the intestinal lumen. Secretory diarrhea is also watery, and non-bloody, but unlike osmotic diarrhea, persists even with decreased oral intake.<br><br>Moreover, there is <strong>inflammatory </strong>(exudative) <strong>diarrhea</strong>. This type of diarrhea is typically seen in patients with certain autoimmune disorders (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease) or bacterial (e.g. <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>) invasion of the intestinal wall. These conditions lead to an inflammatory process that damages the intestinal epithelium. The diarrhea is usually purulent, bloody, and persists during fasting. Systemic symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, and weight loss may also be seen.<br><br>Finally, diarrhea can occur due to <strong>increased gastrointestinal motility</strong>, which causes water and nutrients to reach the colon too fast without adequate time for proper digestion and absorption.

TNF inhibitors are members of a class of medications called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that can be used in rheumatoid arthritis to decrease joint damage. Apart from rheumatoid arthritis, TNF inhibitors can also be used in the treatment of psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disorders, and ankylosing spondylitis. The discovery of TNF inhibitors was a major step in the therapeutic approach to rheumatic disease.<br><br>TNF is a major proinflammatory cytokine that is mainly produced by activated macrophages but can also be produced by lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Soluble TNF then binds to its receptors and signals the production of other cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6). TNF plays an important role in many autoimmune disorders and inflammatory disorders, but also is involved in the defense against infections (e.g., tuberculosis) and tumors.<br><br>There are 5 TNF inhibitors in use today, four monoclonal antibodies against TNF (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab), and one soluble TNF receptor (etanercept). <br><br>TNF inhibitors are associated with significant side effects, some of which can be lethal. The most common side effects include:<br><br><ul><li>Infections: TNF inhibitors increase the risk of many infections, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. These infections can sometimes be lethal. In addition, it has been shown that the use of TNF inhibitors can lead to the reactivation of tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C. Therefore, it is recommended that all patients be tested for active/latent TB, HIV, and hepatitis B, and C before starting the treatment with TNF inhibitors.</li><li>Hepatotoxicity: Which can be severe and lead to fulminant hepatic failure.</li><li>Malignancies: TNF inhibitors increase the risk of malignancy, especially lymphomas.</li><li>Congestive heart failure: although TNF inhibitors do not lead to CHF, patients with preexisting CHF taking TNF inhibitors can develop worsening of cardiac function and increased mortality. Therefore, TNF inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe CHF.</li><li>Demyelinating disorders: This includes optic neuritis, myelitis, transverse myelitis, and guillain-barre syndrome.

Methotrexate is a non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and is used as the first-line treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as it halts the disease progression.<br><br>Methotrexate inhibits the proliferation of immune cells and thus inhibits the immune response via multiple mechanisms of action. The main effect of methotrexate is inhibiting the <strong>conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase</strong> (DHTFR). Tetrahydrofolate is the active form of folate needed to make purines and pyrimidine bases and thus make DNA and RNA. By inhibiting DHFTR, methotrexate inhibits the synthesis of DNA and RNA required for cellular division and immune response, inhibiting the proliferation of immune cells. This is also the mechanism by which methotrexate can be used to treat some cancers. It can also inhibit protein synthesis.<br><br>Adenosine has anti-inflammatory effects and suppresses T- and B-cell proliferation and response. In addition, methotrexate has another mechanism of action that helps reduce immune response. It inhibits an enzyme called AICAR transformylase, which results in the accumulation of adenosine. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ZQZfUV7IRu_GzDggf-paFrTLRFyys_R5/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Methotrexate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Leflunomide:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: &#160;Leflunomide is an antimetabolite that inhibits the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines.

      "solution": "This patient has hyperthyroidism in the setting of a symmetrical, non-tender thyroid, which raises concerns for Graves disease. <strong>Thionamides </strong>(e.g., methimazole, propylthiouracil) are commonly used treatment options. Thionamides work by preventing thyroid hormone synthesis via inhibition of <strong>thyroid peroxidase</strong>. In addition, propylthiouracil (PTU) prevents the peripheral conversion of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub> via inhibition of <strong>5&#8217;-deiodinase</strong>.<br><br>It is important to note that <strong>methimazole </strong>and <strong>propylthiouracil </strong>(PTU) are used in pregnancy even though they can cross the placenta. However, during the first trimester, when organogenesis is taking place, the fetus is susceptible to drug-induced damage, and thus PTU is preferred. The rationale is that PTU is less likely to cross the placenta due to its extensive plasma protein binding. On the other hand, methimazole is contraindicated during the first trimester because it is associated with <strong>aplasia cutis</strong>, a condition characterized by the absence of a portion of skin. Then, during the second and third trimesters, once organogenesis is complete, methimazole is preferred due to its lower risk of hepatotoxicity.<br><br>Patients taking thionamides require close monitoring of thyroid and liver function and should be educated on symptoms and signs that should prompt medical review. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Methimazole:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Methimazole is an oral anti-thyroid drug commonly used to treat hyperthyroidism in the general population.

Treatment for kidney tumors is multifaceted and includes possible radical nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy, or targeted therapy with various immunotherapies. This question is asking for a specific therapy that will block neovascularization and angiogenesis seen with cancer. In the pathophysiology of cancer, it is well known that cancer cells overexpress vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which as the name suggests, promotes neovascularization in the tumor microenvironment. VEGF expression is associated with several different cancer types. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF-A, preventing this process of neovascularization from taking place.

The patient is found to have a pituitary microadenoma (&lt;10 mm), but inferior petrosal sinus sampling does not indicate that the pituitary gland is the source of ACTH. Therefore, <strong>CT imaging of the chest</strong> should be done to look for <strong>small cell lung cancer</strong>, which is the most likely <strong>ectopic source of ACTH</strong> in this patient with a significant smoking history.<br><br>Once Cushing syndrome is confirmed, plasma ACTH levels should be measured. If ACTH is low, then this indicates <strong>ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome</strong> and abdominal imaging should be performed to look for an adrenal mass. If ACTH is high then the patient has <strong>ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome</strong>, and a brain MRI should be performed to look for a pituitary source of ACTH. If a <strong>pituitary macroadenoma</strong><strong>(&#8805;10 mm)</strong> is found, this is likely the source and the condition is referred to as <strong>Cushing disease</strong>. If a <strong>microadenoma (&lt;10 mm)</strong> is found, then <strong>inferior petrosal sinus sampling</strong> should be performed. The ACTH levels in the blood from the petrosal sinus (central) are compared to the levels in the peripheral vein. A significant central-to-peripheral ACTH pituitary gradient (often a ratio greater than 2 or 3 at baseline, and greater than 3 after CRH stimulation) indicates a central source of ACTH (i.e. the pituitary gland). If there is <strong>no significant gradient</strong>, it suggests that ACTH production is coming from somewhere other than the pituitary, indicating an <strong>ectopic source</strong>. The next step given the low central-to-peripheral ACTH pituitary gradient is to perform chest imaging to look for a lung malignancy. <strong>Ectopic ACTH production from small cell lung cancer</strong> is typically treated with <strong>tumor resection</strong>.<br><br>Management of Cushing syndrome depends on the underlying cause of the condition.

The pain is associated with less than 5 minutes of morning stiffness and worsens with use during the day. The left knee has evidence of a noninflammatory effusion with crepitus, joint line tenderness, and limited range of motion. The interphalangeal joints of the hands have evidence of bony hypertrophy. This patient&#8217;s age, history, and clinical exam are consistent with <strong>osteoarthritis</strong>.<br><br>Joint pain is a very common reason for patients to seek medical care, and it can be caused by a wide variety of local or systemic pathologies. To narrow down the differential diagnosis, it is helpful to classify the type of joint involvement. Joint pain can be <strong>traumatic&#160;</strong>or <strong>nontraumatic</strong>; and <strong>acute</strong>, <strong>subacute</strong>, or <strong>chronic</strong>. It can involve one joint (monoarticular), a few joints (oligoarticular), or multiple joints (polyarticular). It can affect mostly the skeleton (axial) or the extremities (peripheral). And finally, joint pain and swelling may be <strong>inflammatory&#160;</strong>(e.g. septic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis) or <strong>non-inflammatory</strong> (<strong>e.g. osteoarthritis</strong>). The history and physical examination will provide clues to the diagnosis. Imaging, arthrocentesis (cell count, differential, gram stain, culture), and blood work may be needed to make the diagnosis.<br><br>Patients with osteoarthritis typically have joint pain that is <strong>worse with activity</strong>, as well as morning stiffness lasting <strong>less than 30 minutes</strong>. They typically experience limitations in functioning. Physical exam may show bony enlargement in the hands at the interphalangeal joints and the base of the thumb. The knees may exhibit bony enlargement, joint line tenderness, limited range of motion, and instability. Effusions may be present, but arthrocentesis will reveal synovial fluid that is non-inflammatory or only mildly inflammatory. Osteoarthritis typically affects the knees, hips, interphalangeal joints of the hands, the first CMC joints, first MTP joints, and facet joints of the lower cervical and lower lumbar spine. Diagnosis is made clinically, and radiographs can be used to help make the diagnosis. Characteristic findings on the x-ray include characteristic features of OA like marginal osteophytes, localized joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and cysts.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/AEtRj3RpSSaqXF0W7tV5cOeNQLmJuLjj/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Osteoarthritis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Gout:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Patients with gout typically present with acute flares involving one or occasionally a few joints that are painful, swollen, warm, and erythematous.

NAGMA&#160;frequently&#160;occurs with&#160;<strong>hyperchloremia</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>in the setting of&#160;<strong>bicarbonate </strong><strong>loss </strong>rather than extra acid production.&#160;<strong>Renal and gastrointestinal causes</strong>&#160;are the most common, but other causes exist,&#160;such as iatrogenic causes.&#160;<strong>Hyperalimentation </strong>from parenteral nutrition and&#160;<strong>excessive 0.9% saline infusions</strong>&#160;(&#8220;normal&#8221; saline is not physiologically &#8220;normal&#8221;) are common&#160;causes in the&#160;inpatient&#160;setting.&#160;<strong>Profuse diarrhea</strong>&#160;can lead to NAGMA via bicarbonate loss.&#160;<strong>Hypoaldosteronism </strong>and&#160;the&#160;use of&#160;<strong>spironolactone </strong>have also been implicated. Finally,&#160;<strong>renal tubular acidosis (RTA)</strong>&#160;is a commonly overlooked cause of NAGMA. Younger patients are more likely to have type 1 or type 2,&#160;whereas&#160;older patients or those with chronic medical issues may have type 4&#160;renal tubular acidosis.

Patients typically present with<strong> rapid onset severe respiratory distress, </strong>often following a precipitating event such as&#160;<strong>sepsis</strong>,&#160;trauma, pneumonia, or pancreatitis.&#160;In ARDS management, the aim of mechanical ventilation is to&#160;optimize&#160;oxygenation and minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. The ideal&#160;initial&#160;ventilator settings include a&#160;<strong>low tidal volume (4-8 mL/kg), high initial FiO2 (100%), PEEP of 5 cm H2O, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Initial ventilation settings should start with a<strong> tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight, </strong>within the 4-8 mL/kg range recommended for ARDS. This strategy is employed to reduce the risk of alveolar overdistension and&#160;subsequent&#160;barotrauma.&#160;The&#160;<strong>FiO2 is initially set to 100% </strong>to counter severe hypoxemia quickly, and then it is carefully reduced based on arterial blood gas results, to prevent oxygen toxicity. Setting the&#160;<strong>Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) at 5 cm H2O </strong>helps&#160;maintain&#160;alveolar patency at the end of&#160;expiration, enhancing oxygenation without causing overdistension or barotrauma. Monitoring and&#160;maintaining&#160;the&#160;plateau pressure below 30 cm H2O&#160;is also critical to avoid overdistension of the alveoli. Additionally, a respiratory rate of&#160;<strong>12 breaths/min</strong>&#160;is chosen to&#160;facilitate&#160;<strong>permissive hypercapnia,</strong> a tactic that allows higher CO2 levels as a trade-off for lower ventilatory pressures and volumes, thereby reducing the risk of lung injury.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;Tidal Volume (mL/kg of predicted body weight)&#160; &#160; &#160;FiO2&#160;(%)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Positive end-expiratory pressure (cm H2O)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Respiratory Rate (breaths/min)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;6&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;100&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;5&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;12&#160; &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong>&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Tidal Volume (mL/kg of predicted body weight)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;FiO2&#160;(%)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Positive end-expiratory pressure (cm H2O)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Respiratory Rate (breaths/min)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;12 &#160;&#160;100&#160; &#160;&#160;1020:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>This patient&#160;</span><span>likely has</span><span>&#160;acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
