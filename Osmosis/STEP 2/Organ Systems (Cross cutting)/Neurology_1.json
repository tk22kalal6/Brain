The etiology is often<strong>&#160;idiopathic</strong>, with the possible cause being viral-associated ischemic demyelination (e.g., herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr) or sometimes as a complication of Lyme disease or sarcoidosis.<br><br>The motor pathway for the facial nerve starts from the motor cortex, where its upper motor neuron (UMN) travels downwards through the internal capsule to reach the facial motor nucleus in the lateral pons. This nucleus has a <strong>dorsal&#160;</strong>and <strong>ventral part</strong>. The former innervates muscles of the <strong>upper</strong> face and lacrimation, while the latter innervates muscles of the<strong>&#160;lower</strong> face and salivation. The<strong>&#160;dorsal</strong> region receives innervation from the UMN of<strong>&#160;both</strong> hemispheres. The<strong>&#160;ventral</strong> region receives innervation only from the UMN of the<strong>&#160;opposite&#160;</strong>hemisphere. That is why unilateral <strong>UMN lesions&#160;</strong>(e.g. stroke) only affect the <strong>lower&#160;</strong>part of the face on the <strong>contralateral&#160;</strong>side.<br><br>The UMN fibers cross over before they synapse with LMN, which then travel ipsilaterally, supplying the same side of the face. Therefore, an <strong>LMN lesion</strong> affects the<strong>&#160;upper and lower&#160;</strong>side of the face <strong>ipsilaterally</strong>.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/pA2801D7TKuYrHyvoa80JlCOR1_urx-M/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/L6L_yujBTvWkxz8C-15rpJK9RWaCGN-_/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Lower motor neuron lesion of the involved cranial nerve:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Upper motor neuron lesion of the involved cranial nerve:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Unilateral UMN lesions (e.g. stroke) only affect the lower part of the face on the contralateral side.

This patient has paralysis on the right side of the upper and lower facial muscles, making a UMN lesion unlikely.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reactivation of a dormant virus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The major complication of reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus is the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which typically includes the triad of ipsilateral facial paralysis, ear pain, and vesicles in the auditory canal and auricle.

Injury to this area can lead to ipsilateral paralysis of the facial muscles. However, it would not explain the sudden onset of symptoms one month after the procedure and the hyperacusis in this patient.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tumor at the cerebellopontine angle:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Even though a tumor at the cerebellopontine angle (e.g. schwannoma) can sometimes involve the facial nerve, it is usually preceded by the symptoms of CN VIII impingement (i.e., tinnitus, ataxia, vertigo, or sensorineural hearing loss), none of which are seen in this patient.</span></div>",

The most appropriate test to diagnose this condition is a <strong>lumbar punctur</strong>e performed at the <strong>L4/L5 intervertebral space,</strong> denoted by choice D in the diagram above. &#160; <br><br>Indications for the performance of a<strong>&#160;lumbar puncture (LP)</strong> are many, namely the evaluation of infection in the central nervous system, subarachnoid hemorrhage, central nervous system malignancies, and demyelinating disorders such as Guillain Barre syndrome. LP is generally safe; however, it is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure, bleeding diathesis, or suspected spinal epidural abscess. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Performance of the procedure requires sterile technique and positioning the patient in either a lateral decubitus position or sitting upright. In an average adult, the spinal cord tapers and ends at the level between the L1 and L2 vertebrae. In neonates, it ends at L3, so the procedure is safely performed via needle insertion at the L4/L5 interspace in both populations. This space is most easily identified via <strong>direct palpation of the superior iliac crests</strong> and tracing an imaginary line from this point to the lumbar spine. Palpation of the lumbar spine at this location will reveal the L4/L5 spinous processes, and the area for needle insertion is between the two. &#160; <br><br>The insertion sequence includes skin, subcutaneous tissue, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, epidural space, and finally, the <strong>subarachnoid</strong>&#160;<strong>space</strong>.

Additionally, the physical examination demonstrates dysfunction of the <strong>spinocerebellar, lateral corticospinal, and dorsal column pathways</strong>, consistent with <strong>subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. &#160;&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Several spinal cord pathologies can be identified via a careful neurological examination to reveal the affected spinal cord tract(s). For example, <strong>subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord</strong> results when vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is absent or deficient. It may become deficient due to malabsorptive disease (e.g., Crohn disease, pernicious anemia), dietary restriction (e.g. veganism), or medications that interfere with cobalamin absorption (e.g., metformin, proton pump inhibitors). When physiologic stores of vitamin B12 are low, levels of methylmalonic acid increase, which causes degeneration of the myelin sheath of the <strong>spinocerebellar, lateral corticospinal,&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;dorsal column pathways,</strong> resulting in subacute combined degeneration (SCD). SCD manifests with symptoms of gait ataxia, paresthesias, and impaired position/vibration sense. Furthermore, SCD can cause psychiatric symptoms, including <strong>worsening depression</strong> or signs of <strong>dementia</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Additional noteworthy patterns of spinal cord pathologies include Brown-Sequard syndrome, syringomyelia, and tabes dorsalis. <strong>Brown-Sequard syndrome</strong> is a rare asymmetrical spinal cord injury pattern that occurs following a stab wound, penetrating injury, or, less commonly, fracture or blunt trauma. It results in <strong>ipsilateral loss</strong> of motor function, vibration, and proprioception due to the <strong>dorsal columns and corticospinal tract damage.</strong> In addition, contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation occurs at one or two levels below the lesion due to injury of the <strong>spinothalamic tracts</strong> (which decussate at the anterior commissure). Brown-Sequard syndrome may also be associated with <strong>Horner syndrome</strong> (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) if the lesion occurs <strong>above the T1 level</strong> and causes damage to the <strong>oculosympathetic pathway</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Syringomyelia</strong> describes a <strong>cystic cavity</strong> within the spinal cord, usually within the <strong>central canal,</strong> that can expand over time and compress the <strong>anterior white commissure,</strong> a structure directly anterior to the cervical canal. The anterior white commissure is the decussation site for the spinothalamic tracts, relaying pain and temperature sensation. As a result, syringomyelia causes a \"<strong>c</strong><strong>ape-like,\" bilateral, symmetrical loss of pain and temperature sensation</strong> in the <strong>upper extremities</strong>. Syringomyelia is associated with Chiari I malformation, a congenital condition characterized by abnormally shaped cerebellar tonsils that herniate below the level of the foramen magnum. &#160; <br><br>Lastly, <strong>tabes dorsalis</strong> arises due to infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by <em>Treponema</em> <em>pallidum</em>, the spirochete that causes syphilis. Tertiary infection of the spinal cord leads to demyelination and degeneration of the <strong>dorsal column and roots,</strong> resulting in findings of gait ataxia and incoordination.

Therefore, <strong>primidone&#160;</strong>should be the preferred treatment. &#160; <br><br>Tremor is defined as a rhythmic, involuntary, oscillatory movement of a body part caused by either alternating or synchronous antagonist muscle contractions. ET is the most common cause of action tremor in adults. Classically, ET involves the hands and becomes apparent by arm movement during an activity (intention tremor) or sustained antigravity postures. The tremor can be quite disabling, affecting daily activities such as writing, drinking from a glass, and using utensils. The tremor is typically slowly progressive, bilateral, slightly asymmetric with moderate to high frequency (6 to 12 Hz). ET may also affect the head, voice, and less commonly, the face or trunk. A helpful clue often seen on USMLE exams is that ET is often <strong>relieved by small amounts of alcohol</strong> intake, and therefore, patients often self-medicate with alcoholic beverages. &#160; <br><br>The neuropathologic basis of ET remains poorly understood, but involvement of the cerebellum and brainstem (locus coeruleus) has been suggested.

      "solution": "This patient presents with hyperkyphosis, postural instability, hypokinesia (small steps), resting tremor, and personality changes (anxiety or depression). Together, these findings are consistent with <strong>Parkinson disease</strong> (PD). PD is caused by degeneration of the substantia nigra, and disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway, thus decreasing striatal dopamine levels. Treatment of PD involves several medications that increase dopamine levels within the brain. &#160; <br><br>Initial treatment often involves a combination of <strong>carbidopa/levodopa.</strong> Unlike dopamine, levodopa can cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), which gets converted to dopamine in the CNS via decarboxylases. Dopamine decarboxylase inhibitors, like <strong>carbidopa</strong>, prevent the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery, allowing for more levodopa to cross the BBB. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Over time, dopamine becomes more efficiently metabolized by different enzymes in the brain, leading to a <strong>&#8220;wearing-off&#8221; phenomenon</strong>&#8211;where the patient&#8217;s symptoms improve when they take the medication, with effects rapidly ending after one or two hours. People also experience the <strong>&#8220;on/off&#8221; phenomenon</strong>, where patients experience sudden oscillations of symptomatic improvement followed by a rapid return to rigidity and hypokinesia. Chronic use of levodopa can also cause dyskinesias, which are uncontrolled, involuntary movements. These motor complications occur as the disease progresses, as<strong>&#160;nigrostriatal neurons lose their capacity to store and recycle dopamine.</strong> This phenomenon requires higher doses of levodopa and subsequent over-excitation of striatal neurons. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Reemergence of parkinsonism symptoms between doses:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Worsening of impulse control disorder:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Worsening of impulse control disorders (e.g., gambling, compulsive buying) can be seen in patients taking dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole and ropinirole.

The examiner should test the frontalis strength by asking the patient to wrinkle his forehead or raise his eyebrows. Orbicularis oculi strength is tested by asking the patient to close the eyes tightly while the examiner tries to open them. Procerus function is assessed by asking the patient to furrow the brow. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Other&#160;historical and examination characteristics can help differentiate between the most likely cause&#160;of peripheral facial nerve palsy. Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can result in unilateral or bilateral <strong>peripheral facial nerve palsy, </strong>may present with additional history of tingling or weakness in the extremities and&#160;with hypo- or areflexia on examination. Lyme disease can present with either unilateral or bilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy. Patients&#160;may report exposure to an endemic area, a tick bite, or a rash. <strong>The most common type </strong>of peripheral palsy, <strong>Bell palsy, i</strong>s idiopathic, though some patients may report a recent illness or stressor. Exposure to keratitis can be treated with lubricating eye drops and patching. Treatment with oral corticosteroids within 72 hours of symptom onset is recommended, with improvement anticipated over the next three months.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Lack of&#160;additional&#160;neurologic deficits&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hearing loss:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Herpes zoster&#160;</span><span>oticus</span><span>, also known as Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, can result in peripheral facial nerve palsy,</span><span>&#160;with&#160;</span><span>co</span><span>-</span><span>involvement</span><span>&#160;of cranial nerve 8 given its proximity to the geniculate ganglion.

If an initial computerized tomography (CT) of the head <strong>does not show hemorrhage</strong> or <strong>evidence of ischemic stroke</strong> but symptoms persist and suspicion for stroke is high, <strong>CT or magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA)</strong> may reveal <strong>vessel occlusion or source of emboli</strong> as the cause of <strong>ischemic stroke</strong>. <br><br>Patients may be candidates for mechanical thrombectomy or chemical thrombolysis.

The diagnosis of TIA with documented absence of tissue infarction on imaging is a clinical diagnosis based on a determination that the symptoms are most likely caused by brain ischemia. <br><br>When patients have a likely <strong>stroke with neurological dysfunction that is persistent</strong>, the first step is imaging, typically with <strong>CT or sometimes MRI to determine if a hemorrhage</strong> is present.

These concerning features are summarized by the <strong>SNNOOP10</strong> mnemonic, which includes:<br><br><ul><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Systemic symptoms</strong> (such as fever or weight loss)</li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Neurological deficits</strong>&#160; &#160;Neoplasm (known history of cancer)</li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Onset sudden</strong> (thunderclap headache)&#160;</li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Onset after age 50</strong></li></ul>The additional ten \"p\"s include:<br><ul><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Pattern</strong> change in headache</li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Positional </strong>headache (worsening with changes in posture)</li><li>&#160; &#160;headache <strong>Precipitated by Valsalva</strong> maneuvers (such as coughing or sneezing)</li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Papilledema </strong></li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Progressive </strong>worsening of headache&#160;</li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Pregnancy </strong></li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Painful </strong>eye with autonomic features</li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Posttraumatic </strong>headache&#160;</li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Pathology </strong>of the immune system (such as HIV or immunosuppressive therapy)&#160;</li><li>&#160; &#160;<strong>Painkiller </strong>overuse (suggesting medication-overuse headache)</li></ul><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Onset and intensity of headache:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ History of headaches:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A history of stable, recurrent migraines does not warrant neuroimaging.

Which is in contrast to leg pain seen in vascular claudication which is worse with walking and relieved when the patient stops walking even when they remain upright. &#160; <br><br><strong>Spinal stenosis</strong> refers to narrowing of the vertebral foramen in one or more vertebrae, typically in the lumbar region. Most commonly, this is an age-related condition due to <strong>osteoarthritis and progressive disk degeneration</strong> that results in facet joint arthropathy, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. These processes ultimately result in the narrowing and impingement of the central spinal canal. &#160; <br><br>Clinically, spinal stenosis results in <strong>&#8220;neurogenic claudication&#8221;</strong>, which refers to worsening pain with walking or standing upright, and relief with sitting where there is forward flexion at the waist. lying flat, or bending forward.

Metoclopramide is the classically used anti-dopaminergic for nausea related to migraines, but other agents with anti-dopaminergic activity, such as <strong>prochlorperazine&#160;</strong>and <strong>promethazine&#160;</strong>also work very well. In contrast, aprepitant, dronabinol, and meclizine are not particularly effective in treating nausea related to severe migraines.

The vision loss&#160;can be on the&#160;<strong>same side of both eyes (homonymous)&#160;</strong>involving either the two right or the two left halves of the visual fields;&#160;or it can involve the temporal halves of both eyes&#160;<strong>(bitemporal hemianopsia).</strong>&#160;It can be caused by lesions in the PCA affecting the optic tract. <strong>Homonymous hemianopsia</strong> is concerning for a stroke contralateral&#160;both to the visual field impairment and the side of hemiparesis. While the infarct could occur anywhere along the retrochiasmal visual pathway,&#160;<strong>PCA ischemia in the occipital lobe</strong> results in <strong>macular sparing</strong>, whereby the patient will maintain a small central area of vision.&#160;<strong>Bitemporal hemianopsia</strong>&#160;suggests&#160;a<strong>&#160;sellar or suprasellar mass lesion</strong> affecting the optic chiasm. In the absence of hemianopsia, the underlying cause of painless vision loss may be determined through <strong>history, fundoscopic examination, laboratory studies</strong>, or, in the case of giant cell arteritis, a temporal artery biopsy.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain without contrast:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct: </strong></span><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Electroencephalogram (EEG):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>While seizures&#160;</span><span>may result in transient vision disturbances&#160;</span><span>because of</span><span>&#160;epileptiform dis</span><span>charges in the occipital electrodes on electroencephalography</span><span>, this patient&#8217;s vision loss is persistent and accompanied by&#160;</span><span>signs and symptoms</span><span>&#160;concerning for a stroke, which c</span><span>an be best</span><span>&#160;diagnosed&#160;</span><span>wit</span><span>h magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Visual evoked potentials:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Visual evoked potentials can&#160;</span><span>help localize lesions in the visual pathway</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>This</span><span>&#160;patient&#8217;s vision loss and&#160;</span><span>accompanying</span><span>&#160;symptoms are concerning for stroke,&#160;</span><span>which&#160;</span><span>represents</span><span>&#160;a neurological emergency</span><span>&#160;t</span><span>hat should be confirmed with MRI</span><span>&#160;</span><span>of the brain</span><span>.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypercoagulability testing:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>While&#160;</span><span>hypercoagulable states can increase a patient&#8217;s risk for acute ischemic stroke, this patient&#8217;s&#160;</span><span>symptoms&#160;</span><span>are</span><span>&#160;</span><span>concerning for</span><span>&#160;a posterior circulation infarct</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>which</span><span>&#160;can be better evaluated throu</span><span>gh neuroimaging.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits without contrast:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>Orbital imaging can be helpful in some cases of unilateral vision loss, but this patient&#8217;s symptoms are concerning for a posterior cerebral artery stroke, which can be confirmed by imaging of the brain.</span>&#160;</span></div>",

Demyelinating diseases, such as <strong>multiple sclerosis (MS)</strong>, are the most common cause in this patient&#8217;s age group. <br><br>For patients with binocular diplopia, the first step is to determine the orientation of the diplopia. <strong>Vertical diplopia</strong> suggests a <strong>cranial nerve (CN) IV (trochlear nerve) palsy</strong>, which can be either congenital or acquired. <strong>Horizontal diplopia</strong> can be caused by a <strong>CN IIl (oculomotor nerve) palsy</strong> or by a <strong>CN VI (abducens nerve) palsy</strong>. Unilateral abducens nerve palsy may result from ischemia, whereas bilateral abducens nerve palsy can occur from increased intracranial pressure. <br><br><strong>Internuclear ophthalmoplegia</strong> is defined by <strong>impaired adduction</strong> of one eye with associated <strong>nystagmus in the contralateral abducting eye</strong>. This occurs due to a lesion in the <strong>medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF)</strong> in the dorsomedial brainstem, which disrupts the coordinated function of CNs VI and III. In <strong>older patients</strong> or those with other stroke risk factors, such a lesion is more commonly <strong>ischemic</strong>, whereas in <strong>younger patients, demyelinating disease</strong> such as MS is a more likely cause.

The accompanying features of dysarthria, cardiomyopathy, and scoliosis are suggestive of <strong>Friedrich ataxia</strong>, a hereditary condition for which there may be a <strong>positive family history of similar symptoms</strong>. <br><br>Polyneuropathies are associated with demyelination or axonal injury of multiple peripheral nerves. Causes can be hereditary, like Friedrich ataxia, adrenomyeloneuropathy, or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or acquired due to autoimmunity, infections, chronic conditions, or nutritional deficiencies. <br><br>Patients may report <strong>bilateral, progressive paresthesias</strong>, with or without muscle weakness, and may have <strong>diminished or absent reflexes</strong>. It is crucial to ask about a family history of similar symptoms and their onset and duration. Hereditary polyneuropathies generally have a gradual onset and a positive family history, while acquired polyneuropathies lack familial patterns. Some acquired conditions, such as Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome, present with an acute onset (days to weeks), while others, like diabetic neuropathy, develop over months to years. Depending on the etiology, additional symptoms may include ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, urinary changes, cognitive decline, hearing or vision changes, or fatigue.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Family history of similar symptoms:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Elevated serum level of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Elevated VLCFA is associated with adrenomyeloneuropathy, which can present with similar signs of polyneuropathy and cerebellar dysfunction.

Bulbar involvement is common in motor neuron disease and may manifest as <strong>difficulty swallowing</strong>. <br><br>In evaluating a patient with suspected motor neuron disease, it is essential to assess for sensory involvement through history and physical examination. The presence of <strong>sensory deficits</strong> suggests an <strong>alternative diagnosis</strong>, as motor neuron diseases typically spare sensory pathways. Patients may report <strong>weakness of the face, neck, arms, or legs</strong>. As these conditions progress, weakness may affect muscles involved in <strong>speech, swallowing, and respiration</strong>.<br><br>Motor neuron diseases can involve upper motor neurons originating in the cerebral cortex or lower motor neurons located in the brainstem and anterior horn of the spinal cord. <strong>Lower motor neuron signs</strong> include <strong>muscle atrophy, fasciculations, hyporeflexia, and decreased tone</strong>. <strong>Upper motor neuron signs</strong> include <strong>spasticity and hyperreflexia</strong>.

There is no past medical history, and no medications are taken. The last primary care visit was over 10 years ago. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 118/80 mmHg. Body mass index (BMI) is 19 kg/m&#178;. On examination, there is proximal muscle weakness in the lower extremities and visible atrophy of the bilateral thighs. Fasciculations are noted in the upper and lower extremities. Spasticity and hyperreflexia are present in the lower extremities. Sensation is intact throughout. A comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 level are all within normal limits. Which of the following additional tests would most likely confirm the diagnosis?",

The extra glutamines in HD cause the mutated protein to aggregate within the neuronal cells of the caudate and putamen, leading to neuronal cell death and a decrease in inhibitory neurotransmitters like<strong>&#160;GABA</strong> and an increase in stimulatory neurons like <strong>dopamine&#160;</strong>in these regions. This imbalance is responsible for chorea and athetosis. &#160; <br><br>Since dopamine is increased in the affected regions of the brain, medications that lower dopamine levels, such as <strong>tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine,&#160;</strong>are usually used to manage <strong>chorea</strong>, these medications work on both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. In the presynaptic neuron, they <strong>block vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT)</strong> found on the vesicles, inhibiting the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft. On the postsynaptic neuron, these medications act as a weak dopamine receptor antagonist, where they bind to the receptors and prevent dopamine from binding. &#160; <br><br>Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are also useful for treating <strong>Tourette syndrome.</strong> Side effects include <strong>sedation&#160;</strong>and <strong>pseudoparkinsonism</strong>.

Secondary causes include normal pressure hydrocephalus, cortical or white matter ischemia, medication or toxin effect, tumors, genetic disorders, chronic head trauma, or Parkinson-plus syndromes. Primary forms of parkinsonism include Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. <br><br>For patients with primary parkinsonism symptoms, investigating for signs of dementia can help differentiate the conditions and guide further treatment. In <strong>dementia with Lewy bodies, neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms are typically more prominent than motor symptoms</strong>, while motor symptoms are more prominent in Parkinson disease. Management of dementia with Lewy bodies includes supportive care and pharmacological management of cognitive, motor, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Visual hallucinations:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Olfactory loss:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Olfactory loss is observed in Parkinson disease but is less specific.

The medical history, including the use of medications and substances and a review of systems, may provide clues to the underlying etiology. Laboratory studies may reveal a toxic or metabolic cause (e.g., hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, liver derangements, renal dysfunction, positive drug screen). Evaluation for symptoms of <strong>seizure </strong>or <strong>signs of infection</strong> can also help identify a cause and direct treatment.
