NTDs may be open (e.g., myelomeningocele, meningocele, encephalocele, and anencephaly) or closed (e.g. spina bifida occulta). &#160; Risk factors for developing closed or open neural tube defects include<strong>&#160;folic acid deficiency</strong>, gestational diabetes, maternal obesity, and certain medications (e.g., valproate, carbamazepine). Most isolated NTDs appear to be caused by folate deficiency, probably in combination with genetic or environmental risk factors. Folate deficiency may arise from inadequate oral intake, malabsorption, use of folic acid antagonists, or genetic causes of abnormal folate metabolism. Folic acid supplementation is recommended for all women during preconception and the first trimester periods; 0.4 mg daily of folic acid is recommended for all women, beginning before conception and continued through pregnancy. For women taking carbamazepine or valproate, or those with a prior infant with an NTD or with an NTD affecting either parent, a <strong>higher folic acid dose of 4 mg</strong> daily is recommended. <br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/UrLuSxvFRiuiE7hQtrXpkSlDQQ_qk7bE/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cessation of cocaine use:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Cocaine is a potent vasoconstrictor, and therefore, it can cause fetal and placental injury leading to placental abruption, spontaneous abortion, prematurity, and fetal death.

It is important to remember the relationship between the nasal cavity and its surrounding structures because nasal congestion can cause inflammation and swelling of the mucosa close to the openings of these spaces. When the surrounding spaces are unable to drain properly, infection can develop and spread.<br><br>In particular, the <strong>maxillary sinuses</strong> are the most common site to which an infection in the nasal cavity might spread. The openings (or ostia) to the maxillary sinuses are small and can be easily obstructed when the surrounding nasal mucosa becomes congested. Also, because of the orientation of the maxillary sinuses in the skull, it is difficult for them to drain properly when the head is <strong>upright or lying on one side</strong>; the ostia are directed towards one another, so when lying on the side, only the top sinus can actually drain. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/LlhMEToFRfOcjFRA9xplo7cXRZuL_Uz6/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Frontal sinus &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The frontal sinus is located in the frontal bone and opens into the anterior part of the middle meatus via the frontonasal duct.

      "solution": "This patient with anemia, family history of sickle cell anemia and renal papillary necrosis, and medical history of severe chest pain from vaso-occlusive crises has <strong>sickle cell disease (SCD)</strong> that warrants treatment with <strong>hydroxyurea</strong>. SCD, also called sickle cell anemia, is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder that is caused by a genetic mutation that <strong>substitutes glutamic acid with valine</strong> in the sixth position of the beta globin chain in adult hemoglobin. Replacing glutamic acid, a negatively charged molecule, with valine, a neutral molecule, creates a hydrophobic effect on the surface of the beta globin chain and creates what is called <strong>Hemoglobin S (HbS)</strong>. This hydrophobic surface interacts with the hydrophobic molecules on other beta globin chains and causes them to polymerize. Especially when there is acidosis, hypoxia, or dehydration, HbS changes its shape and aggregates with other HbS proteins to form long chains that distort erythrocytes into a crescent or sickled shape. This distortion leads to both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. &#160; <br><br>Since inheritance of SCD is autosomal recessive, a patient must have both copies of the gene to get the disease. If the person has just one copy of the mutation and one normal hemoglobin A gene, or HbA, then they have <strong>sickle cell (HbS) trait</strong> and are said to be a carrier for SCD. In this scenario, the family history of sickle cell disease in the maternal uncle and renal papillary necrosis in the paternal grandfather indicate that the patient&#8217;s parents likely both have sickle cell trait.

Clinically and radiographically, valgus deformity will present as &#8220;knock knees,&#8221; whereas varus deformity will present as &#8220;bow legs&#8221;. Genu valgum can be a <strong>normal finding</strong> in patients <strong>between the ages of 2-5 years</strong>. In the majority of toddlers with physiologic genu valgum, the condition will resolve with age as the long bones of the legs continue to ossify. While genu valgum may be a standard variant in toddlers, it can also represent a pathologic disturbance in the development of long bones.<br><br>Measurement of the <strong>Q-angle</strong> can be used to assess the alignment of the knee joint This angle is found by measuring the angle formed between the quadriceps muscles and the patella tendon. The normal Q angle falls between 12 and 20 degrees when the knee is extended, with males normally falling at the low end of this range and females in the high end.<br><br>Large Q-angles outside of the normal range are associated with varus deformities that can be caused by underlying nutritional deficiencies, skeletal dysplasias, growth disorders, or persistence of severe physiologic genu varus after the age of 2 years.

Startling to loud sounds is considered a part of the <strong>language development</strong> of an infant, and also provides information about <strong>hearing status</strong>.<br><br>The <strong>developmental milestone assessment</strong> of an infant begins with a thorough history and physical examination. History-taking should begin with the <strong>birth history</strong>, including gestational age and birth weight, as well as whether there is a <strong>family history</strong> of developmental delays. Caregivers should be asked to provide details about what new skills their baby has learned since the last clinic visit, as well as whether they have any <strong>concerns&#160;</strong>about the child&#8217;s development. Important aspects to include in the history of a <strong>one-month-old infant</strong> include how the child is feeding and moving, and whether the infant <strong>responds to loud noises</strong> and can <strong>focus on an object</strong> placed a few inches from his or her face. If any of these areas are not met, or the child is not feeding well and <strong>gaining weight</strong> appropriately, it would be considered a <strong>red flag</strong>.<br><br>Typical physical examination findings for a one-month-old include <strong>lifting the head off of the exam table</strong> when placed prone, <strong>moving both arms and legs equally</strong>, and keeping the <strong>hands fisted and near the face</strong> most of the time. Young infants have a &#8220;startle&#8221; reflex known as the <strong>Moro reflex</strong>, where sudden movements, loud sounds, or a dropping feeling cause the baby to throw back his or her head, extend out the arms and legs, cry, and then pull the arms and legs back in (image below). Another important aspect to consider during an infant assessment, especially for very young infants, is to take note of any <strong>caregiver indifference</strong>, meaning a caregiver who is not responsive to their infant. Caregiver indifference is a <strong>red flag</strong> and should be investigated further. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/00TtcUd-TR23tgJVH5hoN_pRQ3qn9k70/_.png\"></div><br><sup><strong>&#160;Moro Reflex by tawamie is licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 DEED Reproduced from WikimediaCommons&#160;</strong>&#160;</sup><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ No response to loud sounds:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Moro reflex is present:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The Moro or &#8220;startle&#8221; reflex is present from birth until around 2-6 months of age. &#160;It would not be concerning for a one-month-old to still have a Moro reflex. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Holds fisted hands near the face most of the time:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Holding fisted hands near the face most of the time is expected for a one-month-old. &#160;This will typically decrease to about 50% of the time by two months old and further decrease after that. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inability to lift chest in tummy time:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A one-month-old is expected to be able to lift their head during tummy time, but an infant typically cannot lift the chest until two months of age. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inability to focus on an object three feet away:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A one-month-old infant should be able to focus on an object placed a few inches from his or her face. &#160;Infants begin to track objects and focus on objects further away after two months of age. &#160;</span></div>",

DDH results from <strong>misalignment of the femoral head and acetabulum.</strong> The <strong>Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers</strong> should be used to screen all infants less than 6 months of age for DDH, since early identification and intervention can prevent severe complications, such as hip joint osteoarthritis. If either of these tests is positive, bilateral hip ultrasound should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of DDH. &#160;<br><br>Normally, the femoral head sits within the acetabulum of the hip creating a <strong>&#8220;ball and socket&#8221; joint.</strong> However, in cases of DDH, the <strong>acetabulum is too shallow</strong>, preventing the femoral head from sitting in it. This results in the independent growth of both bony structures, which causes <strong>misalignment of the femoral head and acetabulum.&#160;</strong>Ultimately, this leads to an unstable hip joint. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The <strong>Ortolani maneuver</strong> is performed with the patient in the supine position.

For example, a normal hemoglobin at 3 days old is 18.5 g/dL compared to 11.2 g/dL at 2 months old. In the setting of anemia, the most important parts of a complete blood cell count are the <strong>hemoglobin and hematocrit</strong>, the <strong>mean corpuscular value (MCV),&#160;</strong>and the other cell lines (white blood cells and platelets). The MCV will differentiate <strong>microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias</strong>. It is important to check other cell lines to ensure it is isolated anemia and not aplastic anemia. &#160; &#160;<br><br>A <strong>peripheral smear</strong> can help identify the etiology of the anemia. For example, basophilic stippling of red blood cells is pathognomonic for lead poisoning, <strong>segmented neutrophils</strong> are pathognomonic for<strong>&#160;B12 and folate deficiency,</strong> and toxic granules are consistent with an inflammatory process. A <strong>reticulocyte count</strong> should be obtained in the setting of anemia to determine if the anemia is due to underproduction (low reticulocyte count) or red blood cell destruction or loss (elevated reticulocyte count). &#160; &#160;<br><br>If the patient has <strong>microcytic anemia, iron studies</strong> and <strong>lead level</strong> should be obtained. In the setting of <strong>macrocytic anemia, folate and B12 levels</strong> should be obtained.

Of note, all states check for thyroid disease on newborn screens.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) can also cause <strong>pancreatic insufficiency</strong> which can lead to <strong>bulky, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea)</strong>.<br><br>Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene resulting in a defect in chloride channels affecting organs with secretory functions like the lungs and pancreas. &#160;Due to the defect in chloride channels, abnormally viscous secretions that are thick and sticky are produced. This primarily <strong>impairs airway clearance</strong> and increases the <strong>risk of respiratory infection</strong>. It often results in <strong>pancreatic insufficiency</strong> leading to <strong>steatorrhea </strong>characterized by frequent, bulky, foul-smelling stools that may be oily, and <strong>failure to thrive</strong> or poor weight gain due to malabsorption of fat and protein. Patients may also experience acute or recurrent pancreatitis and focal biliary cirrhosis. <strong>Newborns </strong>with CF may present with <strong>meconium ileus </strong>or<strong> prolonged jaundice</strong>.

Children are<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>first vaccinated against varicella at 12 months and then again at 4 years</strong><strong>.</strong>&#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Vaccinations are essential in preventing infection in children. They work by activating an immune response and producing antibodies. The antibodies produced as a result of vaccines help fight off future invading microbes. Vaccinations are given throughout childhood, starting with the Hepatitis B vaccine which is given within the first 24 hours of life. This child would have received a vaccination against Hepatitis B at birth. Hepatitis B is a 3-dose series and is also given at 2 months and 6 months. She would also have received RSV immunoprophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies if mom did not receive the vaccination between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation. At 2 months she would have received Hepatitis B, rotavirus, DTaP, Hib, pneumococcal conjugate (PCV), and inactivated poliovirus (IPV). Rotavirus is a 2 or 3-dose series (depending on the manufacturer) given at 2, 4, and +/- 6 months. DTaP is a 5-dose series given at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 months, and 4 years. Hib is a 2 or 3-dose series (depending on the manufacturer) given at 2, 4, and +/- 6 months. A booster dose is given at 12 months. PCV is a 4-dose series given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. Lastly, IPV is a 4-dose series given at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 4 years. In addition to MMR, Varicella, PCV13, and Hib at 12 months, patients also receive Hepatitis A. The second dose of Hepatitis A is given 6 months later at 18 months. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>The <strong>CDC provides guidelines</strong> regarding the <strong>vaccination schedule.</strong> The timing for each dose of a vaccine was determined by looking at age-specific risks for disease, risks for complications, and responses to vaccination, as well as maternal immunity transmitted to newborns/infants. In general, the recommendation is to vaccinate as early as possible as long as vaccine efficacy and safety have been proven. Most <strong>children receive vaccinations following the standardized CDC schedule&#160;</strong>but, as mentioned above, there are certain scenarios such as international travel, immunocompromised state, cochlear implants, and prematurity which may alter which vaccines are given and when.

The body is exposed to enough of the pathogen to create an immune response with a low risk of actually becoming infected with the pathogen. &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Examples of live attenuated vaccines include the <strong>MMR&#160;</strong>and varicella vaccines. The MMR vaccine protects against <strong>measles, mumps, and rubella viruses.&#160;</strong>Mumps is a virus that is associated with parotitis and orchitis. <strong>Measles</strong>, also known as <strong>rubeola</strong>, is a virus that typically presents with a specific <strong>morbilliform rash in addition to cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and Koplik spots. Rubella,&#160;</strong>also known as german measles, is a virus that also presents with a <strong>morbilliform rash.</strong> If a mother is infected with Rubella while pregnant, the fetus can have congenital rubella syndrome, which has severe complications. <strong>Varicella</strong>, also known as <strong>chickenpox</strong>, presents with <strong>diffuse pruritic vesicles. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>The most common infections that are protected against with pediatric immunizations are Hepatitis B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Rotavirus, Corynebacterium diphtheria, Clostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Poliovirus, Influenza, COVID-19, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Hepatitis A, Neisseria meningitis, and Human papillomavirus. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inactivated vaccine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>Inactivated vaccines include Hepatitis A, flu, and polio vaccines.

Tetanus is caused by<em>&#160;Clostridium tetani,</em> which results in painful muscle contractions.

Given this patient's good appearance and paucity of risk factors for hospitalization, it is reasonable to pursue outpatient management. This patient's presentation is most consistent with either <strong>viral pneumonia</strong> (e.g., influenza) or <strong>atypical pneumonia</strong><strong>(e.g., due to mycoplasma)</strong>. <strong>Viral PCR testing</strong> should be performed to evaluate for a potential viral pathogen that is responsive to antiviral therapy (e.g., influenza, COVID-19).

Up until the age of 13 years, blood pressure in children is evaluated based on percentiles relative to the child&#8217;s <strong>biological sex, age,</strong> and <strong>height</strong>. Any blood pressure above 120/80 mmHg is considered elevated in the pediatric population; therefore, this child&#8217;s <strong>blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg&#160;</strong>should have <strong>further evaluation. &#160;</strong>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>The well-child visit for an adolescent begins with a focused history, including discussion of any <strong>health changes&#160;</strong>since the last visit, followed by a physical examination consisting of vital signs and a full body exam, including chaperoned genitourinary and breast exams, if applicable. Important features to note are the <strong>height, weight, and body mass index,</strong> which are interpreted by percentiles based on the child&#8217;s age and biological sex. Body mass index is considered <strong>healthy&#160;</strong>when it falls between the <strong>5th and 85th percentiles.</strong><strong>&#160;Screening for hypertension</strong> is done by measuring a yearly blood pressure, which is also interpreted based on percentiles up until age 13. <strong>Vision and hearing</strong> are screened at regular intervals throughout the adolescent years. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>An important part of the physical examination in an adolescent is evaluation of&#160;<strong>puberty-related changes.&#160;</strong>This is done using the <strong>sexual maturity rating,&#160;</strong>or SMR, which is also called <strong>Tanner staging.&#160;</strong>SMR starts with <strong>Stage 1, which is prepubertal</strong>, and ends at Stage 5, which is complete sexual maturity. This scale consists of two independent criteria including the appearance of pubic hair in both sexes and either the increase in testicular volume in biological males or breast development in biological females.

Laboratory&#160;findings show&#160;hyperglycemia, normal C-peptide value,&#160;and negative islet-antibody testing. A n<strong>on-immune-mediated form of diabetes mellitus (DM)</strong> should be considered. The patient&#8217;s phenotypic characteristics and family history are more consistent with<strong> maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)</strong> or <strong>(Monogenic diabetes)</strong> rather than type 2 DM, and the positive genetic testing confirms the diagnosis of MODY. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus in a symptomatic patient include hemoglobin A1C of 6.5 percent or greater; fasting blood glucose of 126 milligrams per deciliter or greater; a random blood glucose 200 milligrams per deciliter or greater; or a blood glucose during a 2-hour OGTT that is 200 milligrams per deciliter or greater.&#160;Once the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus has been established in a child, labs including a C-peptide level and islet cell autoantibodies will help determine which type of DM is present. If C-peptide levels are low and islet cell autoantibodies are positive, <strong>type I DM </strong>can be diagnosed. Normal or elevated levels of C-peptide with negative islet cell autoantibodies is suggestive of either<strong> type II DM or MODY.</strong> Patient characteristics and genetic testing can differentiate between these types. &#160; &#160; <br><br>MODY is a type of&#160;non-immune-mediated diabetes mellitus&#160;that often presents with&#160;hyperglycemia in patients <strong>younger than 25 years old.</strong> Patients have&#160;<strong>impaired insulin secretion.</strong>&#160;A diagnosis of MODY should be considered in patients with atypical&#160;diabetes <strong>(negative diabetes-associated autoantibodies, no obesity, lack of metabolic features) </strong>and&#160;with a<strong> family history of multigenerational diabetes.

Given this patient's age, the recommendation is to <strong>admit her for empiric intravenous (IV) antibiotics </strong>while awaiting laboratory testing results. Empiric treatment for a patient this age includes intravenous <strong>Ampicillin </strong>and <strong>Ceftazidime (+/- Acyclovir</strong> if the infant is at risk for or shows signs of herpes simplex virus). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients <strong>60 days or younger with a fever</strong> are at a <strong>higher risk of invasive bacterial infections </strong>than older infants. The initial step in management is Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, and Exposure (ABCDE) assessment to ensure&#160;the patient is stable. Patients with a fever at this age require IV access with vital sign monitoring. They may also require supplemental oxygen and vasopressors.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>The fever can be treated with <strong>acetaminophen</strong>. Additional treatment and disposition depend on the patient's specific age and on an&#160;identified source. Patients <strong>0-21 days old</strong> with fever should always be <strong>admitted </strong>to the hospital and started on <strong>empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics</strong> until a source is identified and treatment narrowed. Infants <strong>22-60 days old</strong> with a fever should be <strong>admitted </strong>and started on <strong>empiric antibiotics if inflammatory markers are abnormal.</strong> If inflammatory markers are normal in this age group, hospital admission and empiric antibiotics depend on the patient&#8217;s clinical status, lab results, and physician preference.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Once a&#160;<strong>source</strong> is<strong> identified, treatment</strong> is <strong>narrowed </strong>to treat the specific infection.

Precocious puberty can be classified as <strong>central&#160;</strong>or <strong>peripheral</strong>.

It is associated with other endocrinopathies, including hyperthyroidism, growth hormone (GH) excess, renal phosphate wasting with or without rickets, and Cushing syndrome. Biological females presenting with premature episodic vaginal bleeding consistent with menstrual bleeding should be evaluated for features of MAS. In MAS, the cafe-au-lait spots have irregular borders with characteristic <strong>&#8220;coast of Maine&#8221; appearance</strong> and are often isolated to one side of the body. The skeletal disease (PFD) almost always involves the proximal femurs and the skull base. If the diagnosis of MAS is suspected based on skin findings and lab work consistent with <strong>peripheral precocious puberty</strong>, then <strong>X-rays or CT scans of the affected bones</strong> should be performed. If imaging demonstrates <strong>expanded bone</strong> with a <strong>ground glass appearance</strong>, this indicates fibrous dysplasia, and together, these findings confirm the diagnosis of MAS. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Congenital adrenal hyperplasia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency typically presents with virilization and ambiguous genitalia in females and salt wasting.

Antibiotics are rarely indicated in cases of acute gastroenteritis; but given this child&#8217;s fever, bloody stools, and length of the illness, it is reasonable to start<strong>&#160;empiric antibiotic treatment with azithromycin. &#160;</strong><br><br>The <strong>acute management</strong> of a pediatric patient with diarrhea depends first on the child's stability. Diarrhea can cause severe <strong>hypovolemia</strong>, critical electrolyte disturbances, and significant blood loss, all of which require emergent correction. The management of a child in stable condition with <strong>mild or moderate dehydration </strong>begins with <strong>rehydration therapy</strong>, preferably by the <strong>oral route</strong>. Evidence suggests that patients with gastroenteritis can maintain a <strong>regular diet</strong>, as food restrictions, such as avoidance of dairy or solid foods, have not been shown to be of benefit. Loperamide should be avoided in children with diarrhea when bloody stools or fever are present as it can prolong the length and worsen the severity of infection. Most cases of bacterial gastroenteritis are <strong>self-limited; antibiotics</strong> are typically reserved for patients with <strong>severe disease</strong> or those who are <strong>at risk for severe disease</strong> (e.g. immunocompromised).

These diseases are typically associated with&#160;<strong>non-tender, mobile lymph nodes</strong>&#160;and&#160;systemic symptoms such as fever, joint pain, and rash.&#160;Physical exam can aid in&#160;the&#160;diagnosis (e.g.,&#160;a malar rash is consistent with systemic lupus&#160;erythematosus).&#160;<strong>Kawasaki disease</strong>&#160;is a&#160;<strong>clinical diagnosis </strong>but&#160;for&#160;other autoimmune diseases,&#160;blood work&#160;is often necessary&#160;to&#160;establish&#160;a diagnosis&#160;(e.g.,&#160;Lupus&#160;confirmed by the&#160;presence&#160;of&#160;anti-double-stranded DNA and anti-smith antibodies).&#160;<br><br>If&#160;autoimmune disease&#160;is&#160;ruled out&#160;as the cause of&#160;lymphadenopathy,&#160;<strong>infectious processes</strong>&#160;should be considered.&#160;<strong>Lymphadenitis </strong>tends to present with a&#160;<strong>single, erythematous, tender lymph node</strong>.&#160;<strong>Localized infections</strong>&#160;can&#160;cause&#160;<strong>regional lymphadenopathy</strong>.&#160;Lymphadenitis and local infections&#160;with regional lymphadenopathy&#160;tend to be&#160;<strong>clinical diagnoses</strong>;&#160;however,&#160;if lymphadenitis does not respond to empiric treatment,&#160;then&#160;further evaluation with a lymph node&#160;biopsy or serologic testing for&#160;<em>Bartonella henselae</em>&#160;is&#160;necessary.&#160;<strong>Viral illnesses</strong>&#160;can cause&#160;<strong>generalized lymphadenopathy</strong>&#160;and systemic symptoms&#160;and testing for specific viruses can be done with serologies and&#160;PCR.&#160;However,&#160;because they are often&#160;self-limited,&#160;viral testing may not always be done.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Single tender erythematous cervical lymph node:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Generalized lymphadenopathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Generalized lymphadenopathy is found in systemic infections such as&#160;viral infections.

The physical examination should include BMI, blood pressure, vision and hearing, a head-to-toe musculoskeletal and basic neurologic exam, complete cardiac exam including distal pulses, assessment for phenotypic features of Marfan syndrome, and a chaperoned testicular exam in biologically male patients.&#160;&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Amenorrhea:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct: </strong></span><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acne:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>Acne can be seen in conditions of androgen excess, which&#160;can cause&#160;amenorrhea;&#160;however,&#160;this patient&#160;has a decreased body mass index (BMI) and low bone mineral density (BMD)&#160;which&#160;are&#160;consistent with the female athlete&#160;triad of&#160;low energy availability, menstrual dysfunction, and decreased BMD.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hirsutism&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;Hirsutism may be seen&#160;</span><span>in states of</span><span>&#160;androgen excess, which can cause amenorrhea, but&#160;</span><span>patients with androgen excess typically&#160;</span><span>present with central weight gain</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>T</span><span>his</span><span>&#160;patient has a low&#160;</span><span>body mass index</span><span>&#160;and&#160;</span><span>signs and&#160;</span><span>symptoms consistent with the female athlete</span><span>&#8217;s</span><span>&#160;triad</span><span>&#160;of</span><span>&#160;low energy availability, menstrual dysfunction, and decreased&#160;</span><span>BMD</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pectus excavatum:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>Pectus excavatum is a phenotypic feature&#160;</span><span>that</span><span>&#160;may be seen in Marfan syndrome</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>Additional</span><span>&#160;clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome include tall stature, arachnodactyly, cardiac&#160;</span><span>anomalies</span><span>, and&#160;</span><span>an abnormally long arm span.&#160;</span><span>This&#160;</span><span>patient</span><span>&#160;does not&#160;</span><span>have clinical</span><span>&#160;</span><span>features suggestive of Marfan syndrome, making pectus excavatum unlikely&#160;</span><span>to be seen on physical exam</span><span>.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tachycardia&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>This patient&#8217;s presentation and findings are consistent with the female athlete triad.

A <strong>transthoracic echocardiogram</strong> should be ordered next to help determine if diagnostic criteria for HCM are met. <br><br><strong>HCM</strong> refers to a genetic condition associated with <strong>left ventricular hypertrophy</strong> that cannot be attributed to another cardiac, systemic, or metabolic cause. It should always be considered in pediatric patients with exertional chest pain or dyspnea, especially if a systolic ejection murmur is heard on physical examination. Ventricular hypertrophy causes decreased compliance, which results in poor left ventricular (LV) filling.

Physical exam showing <strong>scaphoid abdomen with bowel sounds</strong>&#160;<strong>in&#160;</strong><strong><span>the&#160;</span><span>chest</span></strong> is indicative of <strong>pulmonary hypoplasia from congenital diaphragmatic hernia</strong>. Chest X-ray showing <strong>bowel loops in the left hemithorax&#160;</strong>confirms this diagnosis. This newborn is unstable and in respiratory distress; therefore, <strong>intubation and mechanical ventilation&#160;</strong>are necessary to maintain airway and breathing. &#160;<br><br><strong>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia</strong> leads to <strong>pulmonary hypoplasia</strong> due to lung compression by abdominal viscera in the chest and is usually identified by <strong>prenatal ultrasound</strong>. Physical exam in newborns shows <strong>respiratory distress at birth, central cyanosis</strong>, low oxygen saturation, and <strong>scaphoid abdomen</strong> with <strong>audible bowel sounds in the chest</strong>. Chest X-ray will show <strong>bowel loops in the left hemithorax&#160;</strong>with displacement of the cardiac silhouette to the right. <br><br>When initially evaluating a newborn with central cyanosis, an ABCDE assessment should be performed. If the patient is unstable, the first step is to stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation. Newborns with cyanosis are considered unstable, so <strong>maintaining the airway and breathing</strong> is essential. Delay in securing adequate airway can lead to <strong>severe acidosis and hypoxia</strong>, which increases the risk of <strong>pulmonary hypertension</strong>. Obtaining intravenous access, continuous vital signs monitoring, and oxygen supplementation as needed are the next steps in treatment. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intravenous antibiotics&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Intravenous antibiotics should be started in patients with suspected neonatal sepsis and neonatal pneumonia.

If a newborn screen returns with an elevated IRT level or there is clinical suspicion for CF, sweat chloride testing should be ordered. An <strong>elevated sweat chloride level</strong> is consistent with cystic fibrosis and should prompt genetic testing for CF. Two sweat chloride levels &#8805; 60 mmol/L or a positive cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator <strong>(CFTR) mutation</strong> confirms the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

She has chronic difficulty falling asleep, which has been worse lately, and she sometimes only gets 7-8 hours of sleep. She takes no medication or supplements and has no other significant past medical history. Growth parameters are at the 45<sup>th</sup> percentile.

Based on her otherwise typical development and unremarkable physical examination, <strong>childhood absence epilepsy</strong> is the most likely diagnosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed by <strong>electroencephalography </strong>(EEG), demonstrating a <strong>generalized 3 Hz spike and wave discharge pattern</strong>. In these patients, seizures are often provoked by sleep deprivation and/or hyperventilation.<br><br><strong>Epilepsy </strong>is defined as <strong>two or more unprovoked seizures</strong> more than 24 hours apart or a clinical history concerning for seizures with corresponding EEG findings. The age of the child at the time of seizure presentation can help distinguish between epilepsy syndromes. Absence epilepsy is a common childhood-onset disease that can be mistaken for &#8220;daydreaming&#8221; or inattention. The behavioral arrests typically last only seconds and may be accompanied by automatisms, like eyelid fluttering or lip-smacking, after which the child immediately returns to baseline.<br><br>For children with generalized epilepsy, neuroimaging is not typically indicated. However, behavioral arrests may occur as the result of focal seizures, for which neuroimaging is appropriate. The child may experience focal neurological symptoms or deficits such as vision or sensory changes prior to the behavioral arrest; in this case, EEG should be followed with MRI. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Electroencephalogram (EEG):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Attention-deficit diagnostic questionnaires:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Symptoms of inattention may be suggestive of attention deficit disorder; however, this child&#8217;s behavioral arrests are concerning for absence seizures, which can be diagnosed with EEG.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This child presents with symptoms of inattention, specifically behavioral arrests, which is concerning for absence seizures; this condition can be diagnosed with EEG.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Overnight polysomnography:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Sleep disorders that can be diagnosed with overnight polysomnography are typically associated with excessive daytime sleepiness.

Obtaining a <strong>radiograph&#160;</strong>for <strong>bone age</strong> is the best next step in the evaluation of this patient if the <strong>height velocity is found to be normal</strong>, there are <strong>no symptoms of an underlying condition</strong>, and <strong>weight-for-length ratio is normal</strong>. The bone age can help determine what further steps are needed to diagnose the underlying cause of short stature. <br><br>For patients with short stature, it is important to assess height velocity. Normal height velocity can be found in the chart below. If there are <strong>no signs or symptoms of an underlying condition</strong>, and the <strong>height velocity is normal</strong><strong>, non-pathologic short stature</strong> should be considered, and a <strong>bone age</strong> should be ordered. <br><br>If there are <strong>signs and symptoms of an underlying condition</strong> or if the <strong>height velocity is decreased, pathologic short stature</strong> should be considered. Disproportionate skeletal growth is concerning for a skeletal dysplasia. Patients with short stature and proportionate skeletal growth require lab work evaluation (e.g., complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, inflammatory markers, thyroid function tests, growth hormone levels, celiac autoantibodies, urinalysis, karyotype [if assigned female at birth]). <br><br>Patients with pathologic short stature and proportionate skeletal growth can be further distinguished by the <strong>weight-for-length ratio</strong>. Weight-for-length ratios tend to be decreased with malnutrition, celiac disease, and other chronic illnesses. Weight-for-length ratios tend to be normal/increased with hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, glucocorticoid excess, genetic disorders such as Turner syndrome, and idiopathic short stature.<br><br><span>Image 1.

These findings are consistent with <strong>Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</strong> (BWS) which is associated with <strong>hypoglycemia</strong> secondary to <strong>hyperinsulinism</strong>.<br><br><strong>Hyperinsulinism&#160;</strong>is the most common cause of hypoglycemia during infancy. Hyperinsulinism can be classified as <strong>transient</strong> or <strong>persistent</strong>. <strong>Transient physiologic hyperinsulinism</strong> occurs in infants who are <strong>small</strong> or <strong>large for gestational age, preterm,&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;infants of a diabetic mother</strong> and is seen in the first two days of life. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia can also be caused by ingestion of medications such as insulin or sulfonylureas.<br><br>Hyperinsulinism can also be a feature of some genetic syndromes, including Beckwith-Widemann syndrome (<strong>BWS</strong>), which is a congenital overgrowth syndrome caused by a mutation in chromosome 11p15. Patients with BWS can have transient or persistent hypoglycemia. <strong>Persistent hypoglycemia</strong> is due to <strong>islet cell hyperplasia&#160;</strong>and <strong>congenital hyperinsulinism</strong>. Other features of BWS are macrosomia, limb-length discrepancy, hemihypertrophy, abdominal wall defects (omphalocele, umbilical hernia), and organomegaly. Typical dysmorphic facies include <strong>macroglossia</strong>, prominent eyes, infraorbital creases, anterior earlobe creases, posterior helical pits, and facial nevus flammeus. <br><br>Laboratory findings seen in patients with hyperinsulinism include <strong>elevated insulin</strong> and <strong>C-peptide</strong> levels, <strong>decreased free fatty acids</strong>, and <strong>decreased beta-hydroxybutyrate</strong>. Another diagnostic test for hyperinsulinism is an increase in plasma glucose levels of more than 30 mg/dL in response to <strong>glucagon administration</strong> during hypoglycemia.

The patient's mother did not have exposure to pets during the pregnancy. The most likely diagnosis is <strong>congenital rubella syndrome</strong> caused by maternal infection with <strong>rubella virus</strong>.<br><br>Congenital rubella infection occurs via <strong>vertical transmission</strong> when there is a history of maternal infection with the rubella virus during the early stages of gestation. Infection before 4 weeks of gestation can cause pregnancy loss, while infection between <strong>4 weeks and 4 months</strong> often causes <strong>congenital defects</strong>. Infection after 4 months typically does not lead to sequelae. <br><br>Patients with congenital rubella often present with a <strong>purplish-blue rash</strong> caused by dermal hematopoiesis (i.e. &#8220;blueberry muffin&#8221; rash), <strong>salt-and-pepper retinopathy, bilateral cataracts,&#160;</strong>and <strong>glaucoma</strong>. Cardiac manifestations include <strong>peripheral pulmonary stenosis&#160;</strong>and <strong>patent ductus arteriosus</strong>, which causes a &#8220;machine-like&#8221; murmur. Neurologic sequelae include developmental delays and <strong>sensorineural hearing loss</strong>. <br><br><strong>IgM and IgG titers</strong> for rubella and an <strong>echocardiogram&#160;</strong>should be ordered when congenital rubella is suspected. If the IgM titer or the cultures are positive, or if IgG titers are rising and the echocardiogram reveals patent ductus arteriosus or peripheral pulmonary stenosis, congenital rubella can be diagnosed. &#160;<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/XbMybbDRQh6Z96dscUWarfLWS-u1fHIM/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cytomegalovirus (CMV):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Newborns with congenital CMV infection are usually small for gestational age and present with microcephaly, a blue-colored rash, and chorioretinitis.

A friend's daughter began walking around 12 months of age. The patient was born at 29 weeks&#8217; gestation with a birth weight of 1,350 grams. The pregnancy was complicated by eclampsia requiring emergency cesarean delivery. The infant was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and discharged at 3 months of age. The hospital course was complicated by respiratory distress syndrome, grade III intraventricular hemorrhage without calcifications, and anemia that required multiple transfusions. Other developmental milestones are appropriate for age. The infant passed a repeat hearing screen at 12 months. Follow-up with ophthalmology shows no concerns. Weight, height, and head circumference are at the 20<sup>th</sup> percentile for age on the World Health Organization growth curve. Temperature is 37&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 25/min, blood pressure is 83/36 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The anterior fontanelle is closed. Physical exam is notable for hypertonia, spastic lower extremities, and hyperreflexia but is otherwise unremarkable. Which of the following diagnostic measures would best help to determine the underlying cause of this patient&#8217;s developmental delay?",

This is likely secondary to <strong>periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)</strong> following intraventricular hemorrhage, which can be further evaluated by <strong>MRI of the brain</strong>. <br><br>Premature infants are at increased risk of delays in <strong>cognitive, motor, language,&#160;</strong>and <strong>social development</strong>, which are often associated with <strong>comorbid conditions</strong>. A history of perinatal infections, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, fetal growth restriction, or brain injury may be revealed.

These findings are highly suggestive of <strong>glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I)</strong>, also known as von Gierke disease. <strong>Hypertriglyceridemia </strong>is commonly seen in affected infants. <br><br>In the evaluation of hypoglycemia in infants, the <strong>timing of hypoglycemia</strong> in relation to feeding is a critical diagnostic clue. <strong>Postprandial </strong>hypoglycemia raises suspicion for inborn errors of <strong>carbohydrate metabolism</strong>, such as <strong>hereditary fructose intolerance or classic galactosemia</strong>. In contrast, <strong>fasting </strong>hypoglycemia accompanied by <strong>lactic acidosis</strong> suggests a defect in <strong>gluconeogenesis</strong>, such as <strong>fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency or GSD I</strong>. Molecular genetic testing can help distinguish between these conditions. <br><br><strong>GSD I</strong> results from mutations affecting glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Infants typically present between two and six months of age with fasting hypoglycemia (often within two to three hours of a meal) and poor weight gain.

Infantile hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors of infancy. Although usually low-flow lesions, a bruit may occasionally be heard over larger or more superficial hemangiomas due to increased vascularity. <br><br>A focused history and physical examination is critical when evaluating pediatric head and neck masses, as it provides early insight into the probable cause, whether malignant, infectious, or developmental. Important historical features include <strong>age of onset, growth rate, systemic symptoms</strong> (e.g., fever, <strong>weight loss</strong>, or <strong>night sweats</strong>), and <strong>exposure history</strong> (e.g., animal contact, recent infections, or radiation). Physical findings such as <strong>location&#160;</strong>(midline versus lateral), <strong>consistency&#160;</strong>(soft, firm, or fluctuant), <strong>mobility</strong>, and <strong>skin changes</strong> (discoloration, warmth, or tenderness) help narrow the differential diagnosis. For example, a rapidly enlarging firm lateral mass with systemic symptoms may suggest malignancy, while a soft, fluctuant, erythematous lesion suggests infection.

Laboratory findings show ketosis and an elevated <strong>osmolar gap</strong> of 33 mOsm/kg (calculated using the formula below) <strong>without a high anion gap metabolic acidosis</strong>. These findings strongly suggest toxic alcohol ingestion, specifically <strong>isopropyl alcohol</strong>. Isopropyl alcohol is commonly found in hand sanitizers, rubbing alcohol, and some household cleaning products.

In non-verbal pediatric patients, important clues such as the presence of <strong>open containers, pill bottles,&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;similar symptoms in family members</strong> can help narrow the differential diagnosis. <br><br>Basic laboratory testing should be obtained to assess for metabolic abnormalities or <strong>anemia</strong>, as seen in cases like lead poisoning.

In addition to normocytic anemia with low reticulocyte count, there can also be neutropenia. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Obtain IV access:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Start supplemental oxygen:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Although this patient&#8217;s respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are at the high and low end of normal, respectively, supplemental oxygen is not indicated.

A <strong>large anterior fontanelle</strong> is a common finding in patients with congenital hypothyroidism. This patient&#8217;s history of <strong>feeding problems</strong> and persistent <strong>jaundice&#160;</strong>and <strong>umbilical hernia</strong> on physical examination are consistent with the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism. Labs confirm hyperbilirubinemia and <strong>macrocytic anemia</strong>, both of which can be associated with congenital hypothyroidism. &#160; <br><br>When narrowing down the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with <strong>anemia</strong>, the <strong>patient&#8217;s age</strong> is important, as some causes of anemia occur only at certain times in a child&#8217;s life, such as physiologic anemia of infancy which occurs around 8-12 weeks of life. Whether the patient has a <strong>history of prematurity&#160;</strong>should also be considered. Premature infants are at risk for anemia of prematurity around 4-8 weeks of life. History should also include diet history, medications, exposures (such as exposure to lead paint), recent infections, family history of anemia, and <strong>newborn screen results. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Anemia in newborns and infants can present with generalized<strong>&#160;fatigue and malaise.</strong> On physical exam, patients may have<strong>&#160;tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, a flow murmur, and/or pallor.</strong> Congenital disorders associated with anemia often have associated <strong>physical abnormalities</strong> that may help narrow down the differential.

Physical examination findings and&#160;x-ray&#160;findings are concerning for&#160;<strong>typical bacterial pneumonia</strong>.&#160;Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly seen in pediatric patients with bacterial pneumonia. Given this patient's&#160;good&#160;appearance and lack of risk factors&#160;necessitating&#160;hospitalization, it is reasonable to pursue outpatient management. Given a negative viral PCR and chest&#160;x-ray&#160;showing&#160;<strong>focal consolidation</strong>, this patient should be treated with&#160;<strong>amoxicillin to target <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em></strong>&#160;which is the most likely pathogen.<br><br>In pediatric patients, treatment of pneumonia is dependent on whether the patient meets criteria for inpatient versus outpatient treatment. Historical elements, physical examination and radiographic findings are used to&#160;determine&#160;the need for specific medications.&#160;<strong>Outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia</strong>&#160;can be treated with&#160;<strong>amoxicillin</strong>. Inpatients can be treated with ampicillin. If the patient has not been vaccinated or if there is high-level penicillin resistance locally, a third-generation cephalosporin should be used instead. Patients at risk for&#160;methicillin-resistant&#160;<em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>&#160;(MRSA),&#160;which includes those who have recently&#160;been&#160;hospitalized&#160;or who have coinfection with influenza, should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic in addition to vancomycin or clindamycin for&#160;MRSA&#160;coverage.&#160;<br><br>Patients with&#160;<strong>atypical pneumonia</strong>&#160;can be treated with a&#160;<strong>macrolide antibiotic</strong>. Patients with viral pneumonia from influenza should be treated with a neuraminidase inhibitor. Patients with other types of viral pneumonia (e.g.&#160;respiratory&#160;syncytial&#160;virus, or&#160;RSV) should receive supportive care. All pediatric patients with pneumonia should receive supportive care with&#160;antipyretics, analgesics, respiratory support, and hydration.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Amoxicillin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Azithromycin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: Macrolides</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;including Azithromycin</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;serve as first-line treatment for atypical pneumonia.
