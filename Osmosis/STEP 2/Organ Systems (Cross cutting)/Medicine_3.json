Septic arthritis is usually monoarticular, affecting one large joint, and the diagnosis typically relies on synovial fluid aspiration and analysis. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Arthrocentesis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administration of intra-articular kenalog:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Administration of intra-articular kenalog is often part of the treatment of osteoarthritic pain.

Colchicine and oral or intra-articular glucocorticoids are alternatives for patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to NSAIDs such as those with a history renal disease, heart failure, peptic ulcer disease, NSAID hypersensitivity, or patients taking anticoagulation. All patients with gout should be counseled regarding <strong>lifestyle modifications</strong>, such as maintaining a healthy weight, maintaining adequate hydration, and modifying dietary habits (limiting high-purine foods, sugary beverages, and alcohol).<br><br><strong>Urate-lowering therapy (ULT)</strong> with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as <strong>allopurinol&#160;</strong>or febuxostat, is indicated for patients with recurrent gout attacks, tophi, urate nephrolithiasis, stage 2 or worse chronic kidney disease, or evidence joint damage on imaging (e.g., punched out extra-articular erosions, soft tissue gouty tophi). These medications reduce the production of uric aci, and prevent future attacks. They should not be started during an acute gout attack as they can precipitate or worsen a flare due to mobilization of stored uric acid. To prevent this, patients should take low-dose anti-inflammatories for 2 to 4 weeks prior to the initiation of ULT.<br><br><strong>Serum urate levels</strong> should be checked one month after initiating therapy with ULT. If the <strong>serum urate level is &lt; 6 mg/dL</strong>, this indicates <strong>adequate response to treatment</strong>. In such cases, the patient should continue gout flare prophylaxis with low-dose colchicine (preferably) or an NSAID for up to six months. If the <strong>serum urate level is &#8805; 6 mg/dL</strong>, adjustments to the treatment regimen may be needed while continuing gout flare prophylaxis. Adjustments include increasing the dose of the current xanthine oxidase inhibitor, switching to a different xanthine oxidase inhibitor, or adding a uricosuric agent such as probenecid. Once serum urate levels remain below target for six months, gout flare prophylaxis should be discontinued, and serum urate level should be followed annually. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Prescribe indomethacin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Prescribe allopurinol:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Allopurinol is a urate-lowering medication used for long-term prophylactic management of gout in patients with a history of recurrent gout attacks, chronic kidney disease, physical findings of tophi, or imaging findings of joint damage.

This clinical presentation is consistent with the diagnosis of <strong>hypocalcemia secondary to chronic kidney disease. &#160; <br></strong><br>Important causes of hypocalcemia include hypomagnesemia, impaired vitamin D conversion, hypoparathyroidism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. When evaluating patients with hypocalcemia, magnesium should be checked first. If it is not the cause of hypocalcemia, then additional lab work including a basic metabolic panel, serum PTH and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (inactive form of Vitamin D) should be checked. If the serum creatinine is elevated, then the active form of vitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, should be checked.

CKD impairs the kidney's ability to <strong>convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D</strong> in response to parathyroid hormone (PTH). This active form of vitamin D is necessary for intestinal absorption of calcium. As levels of active vitamin D drop, less calcium is absorbed from the gut, leading to hypocalcemia. CKD also reduces the kidney's ability to excrete phosphate, leading to hyperphosphatemia. Elevated phosphate levels can also precipitate calcium, further lowering serum calcium levels. The decrease in serum calcium stimulates PTH secretion in an attempt to restore calcium homeostasis. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;Serum Calcium&#160;&#160;Serum Phosphate&#160;&#160;Serum PTH&#160;Serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D&#160;&#160;Decreased&#160;&#160;Increased&#160;&#160;Increased&#160;&#160;Decreased&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Serum Calcium&#160;&#160;Serum Phosphate&#160;&#160;Serum PTH&#160;Serum 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D&#160;&#160;&#160;Decreased&#160;&#160;Increased&#160;&#160;Increased&#160;&#160;Normal:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Decreased calcium, increased phosphate, increased PTH, and normal 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D reflects hyperphosphatemia.

Furthermore, radiography demonstrates <strong>excessive lumbar lordosis</strong> or an increase in inward curvature of the lumbar vertebrae. &#160; <br><br>The spine's normal curvature typically follows four normal curvatures, which can be seen on a lateral view radiograph. These include thoracic and sacral kyphosis. Kyphosis is an increased front to back curve of the spine giving a convex curve in the spine (i.e., convexity towards the back of the spine). in those areas. There is also a normal cervical and lumbar lordosis giving a gently concave curve in those areas (i.e, concavity towards the back of the spine). Two common spinal abnormalities include <strong>excessive thoracic or thoracolumbar kyphosis </strong>and <strong>excessive lumbar lordosis</strong>. &#160; <br><br><strong>Excessive kyphosis</strong> typically occurs in the thoracic region and leads to a hunchback appearance. This process can be postural or due to vertebral compression fractures from osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, or spondylolisthesis. Additional etiologies include genetic disorders such as Scheuermann kyphosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, or metabolic or congenital disabilities like spina bifida. &#160; <br><br><strong>Excessive lumbar lordosis</strong> results in the presence of an anterior pelvic tilt or swayback posture on physical examination. It is most often due to poor posture, obesity, weak hamstrings, tight hip flexors, or osteoporosis. Like excessive kyphosis, excessive lumbar lordosis is also associated with several genetic disorders, including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and achondroplasia. It can lead to lumbar pain and if untreated, excessive lumbar lordosis may result in slippage of intervertebral discs, radiculopathy, and spondylolisthesis.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Excessive lumbar lordosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Excessive thoracolumbar kyphosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Thoracolumbar kyphosis refers to excessive thoracic/lumbar convexity seen in the sagittal plane..

The best drug of choice in this situation is fidaxomicin or vancomycin. The next best drug is metronidazole in resource-poor settings where these antibiotics are not available.<br><br>Metronidazole is a <strong>bactericidal&#160;</strong>antibiotic that functions by <strong>generating free radicals</strong> that damage DNA and cause it to fragment. Without the DNA as a template, the invading pathogens will be unable to synthesize new nucleic acids, which will lead to cell death. Metronidazole is relatively nontoxic to humans since, to function, the medication needs to be activated by a protein called <strong>ferredoxin</strong>. Ferredoxin is found in anaerobic bacteria and protozoans but not in humans or aerobic bacteria.<br><br>The medication can treat many <strong>anaerobic infections</strong> (e.g., <em>Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides</em> species) and <strong>protozoal infections</strong> (e.g., <em>Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica</em>).

Some important red flags to consider are <strong>hematochezia</strong>, <strong>unintentional weight loss</strong>, a family history of colon cancer, acute onset of constipation in an older adult, a <strong>change in stool caliber</strong>, or identification of a rectal mass. Signs suggesting malignancy should lead to a prompt endoscopic exam with <strong>colonoscopy&#160;</strong>or flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy of any suspicious lesions. <br><br><strong>Secondary constipation</strong> can be diagnosed whenever there is an <strong>identifiable secondary cause</strong> for the condition. <strong>Certain medications</strong>, including <strong>iron supplements</strong>, <strong>opiates</strong>, and <strong>antihypertensives</strong>, are known causes of constipation. Endocrine and metabolic disorders can also predispose patients to constipation, including diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and <strong>pregnancy</strong>. Pregnancy leads to physiologic and anatomic changes in the gastrointestinal tract that increase the likelihood of constipation. Neurological conditions, such as spinal cord injury, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and multiple sclerosis, are additional causes of secondary constipation. Finally, diseases of the colon, including <strong>malignancy </strong>and <strong>inflammatory bowel disease</strong>, as well as diseases of the anorectal area, such as <strong>anal fissures</strong>, <strong>proctitis</strong>, and <strong>strictures</strong>, can lead to constipation.<br><br>When there are no identifiable secondary causes, it is considered <strong>primary constipation</strong>, which can be due to an identified <strong>intrinsic problem</strong> of the stool evacuation process (like <strong>slow transit</strong>) or no <strong>specific underlying cause</strong> may be found. When red flags are not present and no underlying secondary cause is identified, it is reasonable to initiate a trial of <strong>empiric treatment</strong>. Recommended interventions are <strong>lifestyle modifications</strong>, including <strong>increasing physical activity</strong>, <strong>water intake</strong>, and dietary sources of <strong>fiber</strong>. The addition of over-the-counter <strong>fiber supplements</strong> and <strong>laxatives </strong>is also a reasonable first step in treatment. When the constipation resolves with empiric treatment and no specific underlying cause or red flag is found, typically no further workup is needed. However, specific diagnostic testing should be done to further characterize the constipation as <strong>normal transit constipation</strong>, <strong>slow transit constipation</strong>, or <strong>dyssynergic defecation/outlet constipation</strong> when there is inadequate response to initial interventions. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Primary constipation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Primary constipation is considered when there is no secondary cause of constipation like a medical condition or medication.

This clinical presentation is strongly suggestive of <strong>obstructive sleep apnea</strong> (OSA), which is a common cause of <strong>secondary hypertension</strong>.<br><br>OSA is characterized by repeated episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to oxyhemoglobin desaturation and sleep fragmentation. Common clinical features include loud snoring, witnessed apnea, and daytime sleepiness. Morning headaches are often due to nocturnal hypercapnia from repeated apneic episodes. Furthermore, chronic intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia can contribute to the development of <strong>treatment-resistant hypertension</strong>.<br><br>Evaluation for OSA typically involves using the <strong>STOP-BANG questionnaire</strong>, a screening tool that gauges the likelihood of OSA based on the patient's clinical presentation and a subsequent <strong>polysomnography to confirm the diagnosis</strong>.

The first step in this process involves <strong>tyrosine</strong>, a precursor of norepinephrine, being transported into the noradrenergic nerve terminal by a Na+-dependent carrier. Tyrosine is converted to DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase. DOPA is then converted to dopamine. Afterward, dopamine is transported into synaptic vesicles with assistance from <strong>vesicular monoamine oxidase transporters</strong> (VMAT). Within the vesicles, dopamine is converted by dopamine &#946;-hydroxylase into norepinephrine. Whenever the appropriate signal travels down the axon to the axon terminal, these vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane, enabling norepinephrine to release into the synaptic cleft and bind to adrenergic receptors of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. <br><br>The drug <strong>reserpine&#160;</strong>primarily works by <strong>blocking VMAT</strong>, inhibiting dopamine transport from the neuron cytoplasm into the synaptic vesicles. <strong>Guanethidine</strong>, another adrenergic antagonist, accumulates in the synaptic vesicles, displacing norepinephrine and <strong>depleting presynaptic norepinephrine stores</strong>. Both reserpine and guanethidine were historically used to treat <strong>hypertension</strong>. However, they are mainly obsolete nowadays due to their poor absorption, slow metabolism, and side effect profile. Finally, there is <strong>metyrosine</strong>, which <strong>inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase</strong> and prevents the conversion of tyrosine to DOPA. Metyrosine is used to <strong>manage blood pressure in individuals with pheochromocytoma</strong>.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/A1i6WQaITOSEixlYyIE2nXhGRdWkVae0/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Guanethidine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Guanethidine inhibits norepinephrine release.

In some cases, certain medications do not undergo any metabolism (e.g. lithium) and do not exert their effects until they are excreted via the kidneys. &#160; &#160; <br><br>In general, most medications are excreted through urination via the kidneys. In the kidneys, some medications or their metabolites are directly filtered through the glomerulus, while others are secreted in the proximal convoluted tubule. Ultimately, these drugs and metabolites travel to the distal convoluted tubule where polar, water-soluble molecules are excreted. A portion of non-soluble molecules is passively diffused back into peritubular circulation. &#160; &#160; <br><br>Additional routes of excretion include the hepatobiliary system, lungs, and to a lesser extent, bodily secretions such as sweat or milk.

These are young trophozoites of the <em>Plasmodium </em>parasite, often referred to as \"ring forms\" due to their appearance.<br><br>Malaria, caused by the <em>Plasmodium </em>species, is an infectious disease transmitted via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito. This leads to <strong>RBC lysis and subsequent hemolysis</strong>. Patients with malaria typically have episodes of fever with chills, with a pattern that can vary based on the Plasmodium species but often involves cycles where the individual will feel well for a period, followed by sudden and intense shaking, fevers, and diaphoresis. Other symptoms include fatigue, pallor, dizziness, headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Presence of intraerythrocytic ring-form structures:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Presence of intraerythrocytic \"Maltese cross\" structures:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This finding is indicative of Babesiosis, a parasitic infection transmitted by ticks typically seen in temperate zones including the Northeast and upper Midwest regions of the United States. The \"Maltese cross\" formation represents the tetrads of Babesia parasites within the red cells. The clinical presentation can be similar to malaria with fevers and hemolysis, but this patient's travel history and cyclical fevers align more closely with malaria. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Predominance of spherocytes:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A blood smear with a predominance of spherocytes is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis and also can be seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

This genetic disorder prompts red cells to assume a sickle shape under conditions of low oxygen, leading to occlusion of small vessels and painful crises. SCD does not exhibit the cyclical fever pattern associated with malaria, making it an unlikely diagnosis in this patient. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Presence of bite cells:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Bit cells can be seen during hemolytic episodes in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Oxidative stress induces hemoglobin to denature and form Heinz bodies, and the spleen's macrophages \"bite\" these inclusions out, leading to the characteristic \"bite\" cell appearance. While this patient does exhibit symptoms of hemolysis, the cyclical fever pattern and travel history make malaria more likely. &#160;</span></div>",

Based on the underlying cause, syncope can be categorized into several types. These include <strong>cardiogenic syncope</strong> caused by heart-related issues; <strong>reflex-mediated syncope</strong> triggered by various stimuli like neck pressure; syncope due to <strong>orthostatic hypotension</strong>; and <strong>neurologic syncope</strong>, which is associated with neurological conditions. If a patient presents with a chief concern suggesting syncope, an ABCDE assessment should be performed to determine if they are unstable or stable, followed by a systematic investigation to determine the most likely cause.

Biopsy classically reveals<strong>&#160;transmural inflammation</strong> with<strong>&#160;multinucleated giant cells, mononuclear infiltrate, and disruption of the internal elastic lamina</strong> in affected arteries.

A tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) should be administered in this setting. The medication works by <strong>aiding in the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. &#160; </strong><br><br>Usually, when a blood clot is no longer needed, the body dissolves the blood clot through a process called fibrinolysis, which is the gradual degradation of the fibrin mesh. The enzyme tPA converts a circulating protein produced by the liver called plasminogen into its active form called <strong>plasmin</strong>. Plasmin then cuts the fibrin into smaller pieces, thus allowing the trapped red blood cells and platelets to float away and allowing the clot to dissolve. Typically, healthy endothelial cells release only tiny amounts of tPA, but when exposed to coagulation factors (mainly factor X and thrombin), they start making large amounts of tPA. &#160;&#160;<br><br>By understanding this process, pharmacologists developed recombinant forms of tPA such as <strong>alteplase </strong>(tPA), <strong>reteplase </strong>(rPA), <strong>streptokinase</strong>, and <strong>tenecteplase</strong>.

Standard treatment for stage IV colon cancers includes either FOLFOX (Folinic acid, Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (Folinic acid, Fluorouracil, irinotecan) chemotherapy regimens. Before starting either of these chemotherapy regimens, it is now common to &#8220;prime&#8221; the patient&#8217;s immune system with targeted monoclonal antibodies, which help the patient&#8217;s immune system increase the immune visibility of tumor cells. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Approximately 60-80% of cancer cells in colorectal tumors overexpress the EGFR receptor. Both &#160;Cetuximab and Panitumumab are monoclonal antibody therapies targeted against the EGFR receptor used in the treatment of stage IV colorectal cancer and some head and neck tumors. Panitumumab is a human monoclonal antibody, whereas Cetuximab is a chimeric mouse monoclonal antibody. Both Cetuximab and Panitumumab have similar side effects, including rash, elevated LFTs, and diarrhea. Neither therapy is more efficacious in the treatment of colorectal cancer. A key difference between the two drugs is the role that cetuximab plays in immunological priming. Cetuximab has been shown to increase ADCC and other immunostimulatory activities such as cell maturation, T-cell recruitment to the tumor, increased antigen presentation, and cytotoxic NK T-cell priming.

The most likely diagnosis is <strong>spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</strong> (SBP) which is caused by <strong>bacterial translocation from the gut. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>SBP is a common and serious complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. SBP primarily develops due to <strong>bacterial translocation</strong>, where <strong>gut bacteria</strong> (e.g., <em>E. coli, Klebsiella</em>) penetrate the intestinal wall and enter the mesenteric lymph nodes before migrating to and infecting the ascitic fluid. Factors contributing to bacterial translocation in cirrhosis include intestinal bacterial overgrowth, increased intestinal permeability, and impaired host immune defense mechanisms.

By separating the visceral from the parietal peritoneal surfaces, the ascites prevent the development of a rigid abdomen.

They should also be offered&#160;appropriate&#160;<strong>psychosocial counseling, </strong>and any associated medical conditions should be treated (e.g.&#160;opioid-induced constipation).&#160;Counseling can consist of recovery programs, individualized or group support (e.g. narcotics anonymous), as well as cognitive behavioral therapy.&#160;All patients should be provided with overdose prevention education.&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Pharmacologic therapy for opioid use disorder includes either opioid agonists <strong>(methadone and buprenorphine)</strong>&#160;or the&#160;<strong>opioid antagonist naltrexone.</strong>&#160;Methadone is a long-acting opioid agonist that is most often used for patients taking high daily doses of opioids with higher levels of physical dependence. It can also be used in patients who have been unsuccessful on buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist that&#160;ameliorates&#160;withdrawal symptoms and suppresses cravings. Hospitalized patients with opioid use disorders can start medication treatment with buprenorphine once they are experiencing&#160;withdrawal symptoms.&#160;It can then be continued.&#160;Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist. It can precipitate withdrawal in patients who are actively using opioids. Therefore, patients who will be using it for ongoing medication treatment should first have medically supervised withdrawal before starting it. Giving it to patients in active withdrawal can worsen withdrawal symptoms.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available around the clock for consultation on patients with known or suspected poisoning, and those who may be critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222).&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Buprenorphine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong><strong>:</strong> See Main Explanation.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Naloxone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong> Naloxone is a fast-acting opioid antagonist that can reverse and block the effects of opioids.

If no recent medications were used, a careful history and physical examination can help determine whether an <strong>infectious&#160;</strong>or an <strong>inflammatory/autoimmune etiology&#160;</strong>is more likely. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Often, a <strong>diagnosis can be made clinically&#160;</strong>with common skin rashes. However, laboratory testing and, if necessary, a skin biopsy can help in cases of atypical, severe, or overlapping conditions. <strong>Tinea corporis and nummular eczema</strong> are two conditions that can present with overlapping features on physical examination. A classic history of <strong>eczema</strong>, or <strong>atopic dermatitis,&#160;</strong>includes the<strong>&#160;&#8220;atopic triad&#8221; of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma.</strong> Patients with itchy, dry, erythematous patches on flexor surfaces, with these historic features can be diagnosed with eczema (atopic dermatitis). If the classic atopic history is absent, and itchy, raised, erythematous rings are present in a patient with <strong>frequent skin-to-skin contact with others,</strong> or with <strong>close contact with an infected individual,&#160;</strong>then<strong>&#160;tinea corporis&#160;</strong>can be diagnosed clinically. When the clinical picture is unclear, further testing with a KOH test can determine if fungal elements are present to guide treatment. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Potassium hydroxide test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing&#160;</span><span>of vesicular fluid&#160;</span><span>is commonly used to&#160;</span><span>confirm herpes zoster (shingles) by&#160;</span><span>testing for</span><span>&#160;the varicella-zoster virus.

The finding of inflamed scleral vessels on slit lamp examination supports the diagnosis. At least half of cases of scleritis are linked to an underlying <strong>autoimmune condition</strong> like <strong>rheumatoid&#160;</strong><strong><span>arthritis</span><span>.</span>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>The history and physical examination of a patient with a red eye are aimed at determining whether <strong>red flag features</strong> are present and narrowing down the diagnosis. Red flag features indicate an immediate threat to vision. Red flag findings include<strong>&#160;severe pain, decreased visual acuity, photophobia, pupillary changes, increased intraocular pressure, anterior chamber inflammation, and corneal epithelial defects. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br><strong><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/rloAxMWnTS_kcjmgSuBYq-EbSZmt-pul/_.png\"></div></strong><br><br>Key features from the history can help narrow down the most probable cause. For example, scleritis commonly occurs in patients with an underlying autoimmune condition, while hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis is usually seen in patients who are sexually active or immunocompromised, or in neonates exposed during vaginal delivery. Patients with keratitis often have underlying autoimmune conditions or infections (i.e., herpes simplex virus). Keratoconjunctivitis sicca often occurs in patients with a history of Sjogren syndrome or in patients taking medications with a drying effect on the eyes (e.g., antihistamines, diuretics). Certain forms of angle-closure glaucoma are hereditary; therefore, a positive family history can signal an increased risk of this condition. Patients with conjunctivitis may have a history of recent exposure to chemical irritants, recent bacterial or upper respiratory infections, or seasonal allergies. Benign causes of a red eye can often be diagnosed clinically after a thorough history and physical examination. In cases where red flags are present, the history and physical will determine which additional tests are necessary in consultation with an ophthalmologist. <br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Rheumatoid arthritis&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recent head trauma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Head trauma</span><span>&#160;</span><span>can cause a&#160;</span><span>variety of eye disorders</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;including globe rupture, subconjunctival hemorrhage, corneal abrasion</span><span>s</span><span>,&#160;</span><span>and glaucoma.&#160;</span><span>However,&#160;</span><span>t</span><span>his&#160;</span><span>patient</span><span>&#160;</span><span>has&#160;</span><span>scleritis</span><span>, which is commonly associated with autoimmune&#160;</span><span>conditions</span><span>&#160;</span><span>like rheumatoid arthritis.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Multiple sexual partners:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Although&#160;</span><span>bacterial infection</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>such as from a sexually transmitted infection</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;can lead to scleritis, this</span><span>&#160;etiology</span><span>&#160;</span><span>represents</span><span>&#160;only a small percentage of cases of scleritis and&#160;</span><span>is</span><span>&#160;typically</span><span>&#160;associated with copious purulent discharge</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;which is&#160;</span><span>absent</span><span>&#160;in this case.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sickle cell anemia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>S</span><span>ickle cell anemia&#160;</span><span>increases the&#160;</span><span>risk of developing glaucoma.&#160;</span><span>However, t</span><span>his patien</span><span>t</span><span>&#160;</span><span>has</span><span>&#160;scleritis, which is</span><span>&#160;</span><span>frequently</span><span>&#160;associated with au</span><span>toimmune c</span><span>onditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recent vomiting:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Increased intrathoracic pressure&#160;</span><span>from actions like</span><span>&#160;coughing,&#160;</span><span>sneezing,&#160;</span><span>vomiting, heavy&#160;</span><span>lifting</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;or</span><span>&#160;performing a</span><span>&#160;Valsalva maneuver</span><span>&#160;can lead to a subconjunctival hemorrhage</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>However, t</span><span>his&#160;</span><span>has</span><span>&#160;scleritis</span><span>, which is&#160;</span><span>often associated with autoimmune conditions</span><span>&#160;like rheumatoid&#160;</span><span>arthritis</span><span>.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div>",

As a result, this patient&#8217;s expected ABG would have shown a <strong>respiratory alkalosis</strong>, characterized by an<strong>&#160;elevated pH of 7.52 and a reduced PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 19 mEq/L as seen in answer choice A</strong>. This finding would have prompted the clinicians to <strong>reduce the tidal volume</strong>. <br><br>Respiratory alkalosis is a condition characterized by a <strong>decrease in arterial carbon dioxide</strong> (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 35 mm Hg) due to excessive alveolar ventilation, leading to an <strong>increase in blood pH</strong> (&gt; 7.45). Bicarbonate levels may be normal or slightly decreased as a compensatory mechanism. Common etiologies of respiratory alkalosis include psychogenic hyperventilation, pulmonary disease, drug toxicity, central nervous system disorders, and iatrogenic factors such as <strong>inappropriate ventilator settings</strong>. <br><br>Iatrogenic respiratory alkalosis can occur when <strong>ventilator settings result in excessive alveolar ventilation</strong>. The primary settings that affect this are <strong>tidal volume and respiratory rate</strong>. If either of these are <strong>set too high</strong>, they may contribute to a decrease in PaCO<sub>2</sub>. This can be corrected by turning down the tidal volume or respiratory rate. Thus, ABG monitoring is essential to recognize and correct potential acid-base disturbances that may occur in mechanically ventilated patients. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;Laboratory test&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Result&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;pH&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;7.52&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;PaCO2&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;28 mm Hg&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;PaO2&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;90 mm Hg&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;HCO3&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;19&#160;mEq/L&#160; &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Laboratory test&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Result&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;pH&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;7.44&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;PaCO2&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;40 mm Hg&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;PaO2&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;95 mm Hg&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;HCO3&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;24&#160;mEq/L&#160; &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This ABG result shows normal values, suggesting adequate ventilation and gas exchange.

Beyond supportive care,&#160;several pharmacological therapies can be helpful. The most effective pharmacologic treatment for allergic rhinitis&#160;is <strong>intranasal steroids</strong><strong>.&#160;</strong>When these cannot be tolerated or are ineffective,&#160;<strong>intranasal antihistamines&#160;</strong>serve as a helpful adjunct and can be used alone or in combination with a nasal steroid.

An <strong>oral decongestant</strong> may be needed when allergic rhinitis is severe, meaning that it significantly impacts the patient&#8217;s quality of life. The leukotriene receptor antagonist, montelukast, can be prescribed in patients who also have asthma. If environmental control measures have been maximized and the patient is experiencing significant symptoms despite an optimal medication regimen, <strong>immunotherapy </strong>can be considered. Allergen-specific testing is not necessary in the routine workup of allergic rhinitis unless immunotherapy is being considered, or when the causative agent cannot be readily identified. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Fluticasone propionate nasal spray:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct:</strong></span><span>&#160;See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Azelastine nasal spray&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Azelastine is an antihistamine nasal spray which can provide&#160;</span><span>additional</span><span>&#160;symptom relief when&#160;</span><span>glucocorticoid</span><span>&#160;nasal sprays are not tolerated or&#160;</span><span>ineffective</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>G</span><span>lucocorticoid nasal sprays are&#160;</span><span>a first</span><span>&#160;line treatment for allergic rhinitis.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Oxymetazoline nasal spray:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Oxymetazoline nasal spray is a topical decongestant&#160;</span><span>which can cause a form of rebound nasal congestion called rhinitis medicamentosa</span><span>&#160;</span><span>when&#160;</span><span>used for more than&#160;</span><span>72 hours</span><span>&#160;at a time</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;Oxymetazoline has limited usefulness in the temporary relief of nasal congestion&#160;</span><span>and</span><span>&#160;should not be recommended for ongoing therapy in allergic rhinitis.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Montelukast:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist,&#160;</span><span>can be helpful in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, especially in patients with a history of asthma</span><span>.

He could previously walk up a flight of stairs without stopping but now must stop halfway up to catch his breath. A recent transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Temperature is 37.4 &#186;C (99.3 &#186;F), pulse is 84/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, blood pressure is 133/82 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. On physical examination, he is well-appearing, and the posterior oropharynx is unremarkable. lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but expiration is much longer than inspiration. An in-office chest radiograph is unremarkable. Which of the following treatments would be most appropriate now?",

It is commonly seen in patients with <strong>pulmonary conditions</strong> such as COPD/emphysema or in patients with <strong>hypomagnesemia and theophylline use</strong>. The ECG is characterized by changing the morphology of the P waves and a variable PR interval leading to an <strong>irregular pulse and a heart rate greater than 100 bpm</strong>. Management is based on treating the underlying condition or administering intravenous magnesium.<br><br>Patients presenting with distinct types of supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) (defined as narrow complex tachycardias) tend to exhibit similar symptoms including <strong>lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, palpitations</strong> and occasionally <strong>exercise intolerance</strong>. Physical examination may reveal clues to the type of SVT (<strong>e.g., regular pulse or irregular pulse</strong>) or bounding neck pulses that can occur in patients with AVNRT. Whether patients have a regular or irregular pulse rate can help narrow down the type of Supraventricular arrhythmia. Conditions where patients have a regular pulse include sinus tachycardia, focal atrial tachycardia, typical AVNRT, orthodromic AVRT, and atrial flutter with RVR. In contrast, SVT&#8217;s where patients have an irregular pulse include atrial fibrillation and multifocal atrial tachycardia. An electrocardiogram is necessary to diagnose the specific type of arrhythmia.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Multifocal atrial tachycardia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sinus tachycardia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>Sinus tachycardia would present with a regular pulse, not an irregular&#160;</span><span>pulse as seen in this patient.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>This patient with emphysema and an irregular pulse who presents with recurrent&#160;</span><span>palpitations</span><span>&#160;</span><span>most&#160;</span><span>likely</span><span>&#160;has</span><span>&#160;multifocal atrial tachycardia.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Typical&#160;AV nodal reentrant tachycardia&#160;(AVNRT):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>Typical&#160;</span><span>AV nodal reentrant tachycardia is a&#160;</span><span>regular supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that results from a reentry circuit within the AV node and&#160;</span><span>perinodal tissue</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Patients&#160;</span><span>present</span><span>&#160;with a regular pulse.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>This patient with emphysema who presents with recurrent&#160;</span><span>palpitations</span><span>&#160;and has an irregular pulse at 132/</span><span>min&#160;</span><span>most</span><span>&#160;</span><span>likely</span><span>&#160;has</span><span>&#160;multifocal atrial tachycardia.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Atrial tachycardia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>Atrial tachycardia (AT) is a regular atrial rhythm at a constant rate of &gt;100 beats per minute&#160;</span><span>that&#160;</span><span>originat</span><span>es</span><span>&#160;outside the sinus node</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;This patient with emphysema who presents with recurrent&#160;</span><span>palpitations</span><span>&#160;and has an irregular pulse at 132/</span><span>min&#160;</span><span>most</span><span>&#160;</span><span>likely</span><span>&#160;has</span><span>&#160;multifocal atrial tachycardia.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response refers to a type of&#160;</span><span>supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)</span><span>&#160;</span><span>that</span><span>&#160;presents with a &#8220;saw tooth</span><span>&#8221; pattern found in the inferior&#160;</span><span>leads;</span><span>&#160;patients</span><span>&#160;</span><span>present</span><span>&#160;with a regular pulse</span><span>&#160;</span><span>of&#160;</span><span>around 150 beats/min</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;This patient with emphysema&#160;</span><span>who presents with recurrent&#160;</span><span>palpitations</span><span>&#160;</span><span>and&#160;</span><span>has&#160;</span><span>an irregular pulse&#160;</span><span>at&#160;</span><span>132/</span><span>min&#160;</span><span>most</span><span>&#160;</span><span>likely</span><span>&#160;has</span><span>&#160;multifocal atrial tachycardia.</span>&#160;</span></div>",

Catheter-directed ablation may also be performed.<br><br>All unstable patients with SVT, such as those with altered mental status, hypotension, or signs of such, should have immediate <strong>synchronized cardioversion</strong>. Patients with arrhythmias like focal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter should be treated with <strong>rate-controlling agents</strong> like beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, and patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter should be considered for anti-coagulation given the risk of thromboembolic disease. Patients with <strong>refractory arrhythmias</strong> should be considered for <strong>catheter ablation</strong>. Notably, patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) are often difficult to rate control, and treatment directed at treating the underlying disease along with magnesium sulfate is typically used. With sinus tachycardia, patients should be assessed for physiologic causes like anxiety, pain, and exercise or pathologic causes, like infection, hypovolemia, and anemia.

She is found to have tenderness over the greater trochanter and pain with adduction and abduction. These findings suggest <strong>greater trochanteric pain syndrome, . &#160; &#160;</strong><br><strong><br>Hip pain</strong> is a common reason for patients to seek medical care, both in the clinic and the emergency department. Patients may develop hip pain from<strong>&#160;hip joint pathology&#160;</strong>or <strong>local musculoskeletal issues causing radiation into the hip joint&#160;</strong>(e.g., lumbar or knee issues). In many cases, the history and physical examination are sufficient to make a diagnosis.&#160;Imaging (e.g., radiographs, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) is sometimes necessary when the diagnosis is unclear.&#160; &#160; <br><br>Patients with hip pain should have a thorough history evaluating the <strong>onset of pain</strong> (e.g., abrupt, or gradual, trauma, obvious inciting event), <strong>activity level, characteristics of the pain</strong> (e.g., type, severity, radiation), and <strong>any exacerbating or remitting factors.</strong> Rapid weight gain or pregnancy can be triggers for hip pain in cases such as meralgia paresthetica or lumbar radiculopathy. <strong>Obesity </strong>can predispose to pathologies such as greater trochanteric pain syndrome, as seen in this patient. Physical examination should include <strong>joint inspection and palpation, active and passive range of motion, strength testing, special tests, and maneuvers.</strong> The <strong>FABER </strong>(flexion, abduction, external rotation) and <strong>FADIR </strong>(flexion, adduction, internal rotation) maneuvers can help determine if the pain originates from the hip joint. Many other exam maneuvers (e.g., straight leg raise, pelvic compression test) can help differentiate between the many causes of hip pain. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Greater trochanteric pain syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong><strong>: </strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Meralgia paresthetica:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>: </strong>While meralgia paresthetica&#160;can&#160;cause lateral thigh pain,&#160;it is&#160;typically&#160;described&#160;as&#160;burning or numbness in the lateral thigh, which this patient does&#160;not&#160;exhibit.

He is subsequently given medication with a <strong>moderate effect</strong>&#160;on sodium channel blockade, which is consistent with the mechanism of action of <strong>class IA antiarrhythmic medications.</strong> Among the answer choices, choice A best characterizes the effects these medications have on the cardiac action potential. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Only sodium channel blockers (class I antiarrhythmics) will affect the duration of the action potential (AP) by modulating phase 0 (as illustrated in the figure). Class Ia drugs block fast-acting sodium channels, slowing Phase 0 upswing, and increasing the AP duration. In addition, <strong>class IA drugs</strong> have some potassium channel blockade, resulting in further AP and refractory period prolongation. <strong>Class IB drugs </strong>shorten the AP and effective refractory period. <strong>Class IC drugs </strong>dramatically slow phase 0, but do not increase the AP duration. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong>&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>: </strong>Mexiletine is a class&#160;Ib&#160;sodium channel blocker that functions by mildly depressing phase 0 and shortening repolarization, thereby decreasing the duration of the action potential.

It can also block potassium channels and can be used as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, with its main effects on phases 3 and 4. Sotalol does not cause sodium channel blockade.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>: </strong>This graph&#160;demonstrates&#160;the effects of a class IV antiarrhythmic agent such as diltiazem. These effects are mediated by calcium channel blockade, not sodium.&#160;&#160;</span></div>",
