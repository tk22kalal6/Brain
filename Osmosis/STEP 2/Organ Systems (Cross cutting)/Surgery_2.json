      "solution": "This patient is 2 days out from ventral hernia repair with mesh and presents with difficulty breathing, fever, and crackles in bilateral lung bases, suggestive of <strong>atelectasis</strong>&#8211;a common cause of postoperative fever within the first 2 days following surgery. Risk factors for atelectasis include <strong>incisional pain, shallow breathing</strong> with poor alveolar recruitment, depressed cough from narcotics, prolonged bed rest, and <strong>smoking history</strong>.<br><br>Postoperative fever is defined as a systemic body temperature that is at or above 38&#176;C or 100.4&#176;F within the postoperative period which gets divided into <strong>4 phases</strong> based on the <strong>timing</strong> of the fever: <strong>immediate, acute, subacute, and delayed</strong>. <br><br>An <strong>immediate&#160;</strong>postoperative fever occurs within <strong>24 hours</strong> of the procedure. The most common cause is <strong>physiologic</strong>, but life-threatening complications such as acute transfusion reactions or adverse drug reactions can also occur. Physiologic fevers are transient, self-limited, and tend to occur following surgeries involving high levels of tissue trauma. <strong>Acute transfusion reactions</strong> should be suspected in patients who received <strong>blood products</strong> or have a personal or family history of transfusion reactions. Physical exam findings include flushing, skin rash, angioedema, respiratory distress, or hypotension. An adverse drug reaction can occur if the patient receives anesthetics, antibiotics, or other medications.<br><br>The <strong>acute phase</strong> of postoperative fever occurs between <strong>postoperative days 1 to 7</strong>. The causes of fever during this time are recalled using the <strong>5 Ws</strong>: &#160;<br><br><ul><li>&#160;Wind - Atelectasis or Pneumonia&#160;</li><li>&#160;Water - Urinary Tract Infection&#160;</li><li>&#160;Wound - Surgical Site Infection - superficial and deep&#160;</li><li>&#160;Walking - Vascular causes - DVT, phlebitis, central line infection&#160;</li><li>&#160;Wonder Drugs - Drug Fever</li></ul><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/NHYBcQhQRg6Qasc-3nAiLEnASZWL12mX/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><strong>Subacute&#160;</strong>postoperative fever occurs between <strong>weeks 1-4</strong> post-procedure. There are 2 important diagnoses that should not be missed during this time: <strong>anastomotic leaks</strong> and <strong><em>clostridium difficile&#160;</em>infection</strong>. In an anastomotic leak, patients will present with abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or obstipation after abdominal surgery. Physical exam will reveal abdominal tenderness, distension, and signs of peritonitis (such as rebound, guarding, and decreased bowel sounds). The use of antibiotics increases the risk of <em>Clostridium Difficile</em> infection. Patients will complain of colicky abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, nausea, abdominal tenderness, and distension. <br><br>Lastly, the <strong>delayed&#160;</strong>phase of postoperative fever occurs <strong>more than 30 days</strong> after the procedure. Most fevers that occur at this stage are unrelated to the surgery and caused by community infections such as upper respiratory infections. However, <strong>device or prosthesis infections</strong> and <strong>fistula formation</strong> are two complications that should not be missed. A device or prosthesis infection should be considered when there is intraoperative device implantation (such as mesh during hernia repair, ICD) or prosthesis implantation during joint replacement surgery. Patients will present with erythema, edema, and tenderness around the implantation site. Fistulas may occur in patients that have undergone resections requiring anastomosis or postoperative chemoradiation. They often present with erythema, tenderness, foul discharge, or bleeding from a visible fistula site. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Atelectasis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acute transfusion reaction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Acute transfusion reactions present within the first 24 hours after surgery with the transfusion of blood products.

Adhesions from previous abdominal surgeries are the most common cause of SBO (evidenced by surgical scars on the abdomen)</strong>. Hernias are another common cause. SBO occurs when a blockage in the small bowel prevents the passage of intraluminal contents (e.g., gas, chyme), which results in distention of the bowel proximal to the obstruction. This condition manifests with pain, abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting.<br><br><strong>Adhesions are bands of scar-like tissue that can form between organs or between an organ and the abdominal wall</strong>. They often develop after abdominal surgery, particularly open surgery or emergency surgery. Less commonly, adhesions can develop from nonoperative trauma to the abdomen.

Physical examination demonstrates a positive <strong>McMurray test</strong> with external rotation of the right knee and valgus stress applied. These findings are consistent with a <strong>medial meniscus injury</strong>.<br><br>Meniscal injuries are a common injury in athletes. This injury often arises from a <strong>twisting force</strong> applied to the knee while the foot is planted. Patients experience varying degrees of pain following the injury, with some patients seeking care immediately while others seek care weeks to months after the inciting event. Patients often recall a sensation of the knee &#8220;popping,&#8221; &#8220;clicking,&#8221; and a feeling that the knee &#8220;gives way&#8221; with specific movements. Additionally, movements that involve twisting, such as pivoting while running, often exacerbate the pain. &#160; <br><br>Clinically, patients may have joint line tenderness, inability to squat or kneel, loss of smooth passive knee motion, and joint effusion if presenting soon after the injury. In addition, patients may have a positive <strong>McMurray test</strong>. This test is performed when the examiner flexes the knee to maximal flexion beyond 90&#176; and then extends the knee with internal rotation of the tibia and a varus stress, then returns the knee to maximal flexion and extends the knee with external rotation of the tibia and a valgus stress. Pain or catching/locking with internal rotation and varus stress indicates a lateral meniscal tear, whereas pain or catching/locking with <strong>external rotation and valgus stress</strong> as seen in this patient indicates a <strong>medial meniscus tear</strong>. An additional physical examination maneuver to test for meniscal tears is the <strong>Thessaly test</strong>. The patient stands on the affected leg with the knee flexed at 5&#176; and then 20&#176; while the patient actively rotates the knee and the whole body externally and internally using the knee as the pivot point.

The cardiovascular side effect profile results from the ability of local anesthetics to bind fast Na+ channels in cardiac myocytes--resulting in reduction of cardiac contractility and arrhythmia generation.

Over time, as an agonist binds to its cellular receptor, it may lose its ability to produce a robust response within cells via secondary messengers. Desensitization (also called tachyphylaxis) generally occurs rapidly and can occur after the first dose of a medication. On the other hand, tolerance occurs always after repeated doses and may take weeks or months. In this patient, he is likely experiencing desensitization (tachyphylaxis) to epinephrine, so repeated doses exert a weaker effect than the original dose.<br><br>Desensitization and tolerance can occur via many mechanisms, with several of the most common mechanisms outlined below:<br><br><ol><li><strong>Downregulation of receptor expression</strong>. For example, chronic opioid use results in downregulating the number of receptors available to bind the opioid or may increase the degradation or sequestration of receptors. This results in stronger doses of opioids needed to produce the same effect.</li><li><strong>Uncoupling of receptors to secondary messengers</strong>. This is often mediated by proteins called <strong>arrestins</strong>, which bind to G-protein-coupled receptors to prevent interaction with secondary messengers. They can also tag these receptors for endocytosis. <strong>This is common in desensitization (tachyphylaxis)</strong>.</li><li><strong>Exhaustion of intracellular intermediary molecules</strong>. This can occur with drugs such as amphetamines, which eventually leads to the depletion of secondary messengers within cells.</li><li><strong>Increased breakdown of agonists</strong>. For example, this can occur with chronic alcohol use, as &#8220;tolerance&#8221; increases with repeated chronic use due to more rapid degradation of ethanol.</li><li><strong>Physiologic adaptation in the body</strong>.

While clinical history and physical exam findings associated with each type of ICH can vary widely, certain key elements should raise suspicion for each type. These are identified during the <strong>secondary survey,</strong> which includes a <strong>brief patient history</strong> and a thorough<strong>&#160;physical exam</strong>, including a <strong>complete neurologic exam. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Epidural hematomas</strong> typically occur with blunt trauma to the<strong>&#160;temporal bone,&#160;</strong>leading to fractures. Because the middle meningeal artery is close to the temporal bone, sharp bone fragments or blunt trauma itself can injure it and cause bleeding into the epidural space. It is more common in <strong>patients who are younger than 50</strong> because, in older individuals, the dura is firmly attached to the skull. Typically, patients present with<strong>&#160;initial loss of consciousness, then a lucid period,</strong> after which their <strong>mental status deteriorates. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>In contrast, <strong>subdural hematomas</strong>, which are more common in<strong>&#160;older patients</strong> (particularly those taking <strong>anticoagulant medications)</strong> and patients with <strong>alcohol use disorder</strong>, often result from a <strong>fall with a head strike</strong>, and typically present with <strong>progressive changes in mental status</strong> (i.e. confusion, drowsiness, somnolence). <strong>Subarachnoid hemorrhages</strong> can be caused by blunt trauma to the head as well as <strong>sudden acceleration-deceleration</strong> (i.e. motor vehicle accident) and may present with <strong>severe headache</strong> and/or <strong>neck pain</strong> in addition to changes in mental status, including loss of consciousness. <strong>Intraparenchymal hemorrhages</strong> can be caused by blunt or penetrating head trauma and are often associated with focal neurologic deficits on physical exam. While not a type of ICH, <strong>diffuse axonal injury</strong> is another type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to consider, and is typically caused by <strong>sudden acceleration-deceleration</strong> and is often associated with <strong>severely depressed mental status</strong> (i.e. loss of consciousness with prolonged unresponsiveness) without focal neurologic deficits. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The modality of choice for <strong>patients with head trauma is CT,&#160;</strong>which is fast, highly sensitive, and <strong>specific for intracranial bleeds.</strong> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful in certain scenarios, such as in cases of suspected diffuse axonal injury which is less easily seen on CT; however, it is not the initial imaging modality of choice for adults with traumatic brain injuries.

One of the main advantages of an open embolectomy is that <strong>blood flow is generally restored very quickly.</strong> However, if comorbidities increase the risk for general anesthesia, a <strong>femoral cutdown and embolectomy</strong> can be performed under regional or local anesthesia.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Femoral cutdown and embolectomy&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong> Open embolectomy, which quickly restores blood flow to the affected limb, is the treatment of choice for&#160;an immediately&#160;threatened limb.

A critical component of acute management for pediatric patients with TBI is to <strong>calculate a Glasgow coma scale (GCS).</strong> This score's results guide further management, including the need for advanced imaging or airway support (e.g. intubation). &#160; &#160; <br><br>TBI refers to brain damage that results from an external mechanism, like a fall, motor vehicle accident, or non-accidental trauma. When a pediatric patient presents with a TBI, it is important to stabilize them urgently, assess the severity of the injury, and determine the need for imaging. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Primary survey should be performed by assessing the <strong>airway, breathing,</strong> and <strong>circulation</strong>; and <strong>immobilization of the neck and spine&#160;</strong>should be performed. Additional supportive measures should include obtaining intravenous (IV) access, starting IV fluids, continuously monitoring vital signs, and providing supplemental oxygen if needed. Next, a <strong>Glasgow Coma Scale</strong>, or GCS should be calculated. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>This scale assesses the<strong>&#160;patient&#8217;s eye opening</strong> in addition to their <strong>motor and verbal responses</strong>, to determine their <strong>level of consciousness</strong> and need for imaging or additional airway support. In general, patients with a <strong>GCS of less than 8 should be considered for intubation</strong> (a helpful rhyme is <em>&#8220;GCS of eight means you intubate!&#8221;</em>). In addition, the GCS provides an objective measurement to assess the degree of brain injury. For children under two years of age, a modified Pediatric GCS can be used instead. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/iXtHL3UBTFKCPt7Vobzsap56T4CQuKiH/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Calculate Glasgow coma scale:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Correct</span><span>:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>See Main Explanation</span><span>.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intubate the patient&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong>&#160;</span><span>This patient, while confused, is currently protecting&#160;</span><span>his</span><span>&#160;</span><span>airway</span><span>&#160;and therefore does not need intubation.

Temperature is 37.2&#176;C (99.0&#176;F), blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On examination, he appears uncomfortable and restless, frequently shifting positions. Physical examination reveals marked tenderness over the right costovertebral angle. The abdomen is soft, nondistented, and nontender, without abdominal rebound or guarding. Urinalysis shows hematuria. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",

The most likely diagnosis is <strong>nephrolithiasis</strong>. The best next step in management is to obtain a <strong>non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis</strong> which is the gold standard for diagnosing kidney stones. <br><br>The workup for patients presenting with acute vomiting should begin with a focused history and physical examination to identify associated symptoms, such as abdominal pain, fever, and neurological deficits which can guide the evaluation and narrow down the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests (including a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and urinalysis) are important for identifying dehydration, electrolyte derangements, infection, or urinary etiologies such as nephrolithiasis. Imaging studies are tailored to the suspected etiology; for example, a computed tomography (<strong>CT</strong>) <strong>scan of the abdomen and pelvis</strong> can assess for <strong>gastrointestinal or urological conditions</strong>, such as bowel obstruction or nephrolithiasis, while pelvic ultrasound is preferred for obstetric and gynecological causes like ectopic pregnancy or ovarian torsion. Extra-abdominal causes, such as increased intracranial pressure, should be evaluated with a detailed neurological examination and imaging likely with a head CT.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Antiemetic medication and discharge home:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Prescribing an antiemetic and discharging home would be appropriate if the vomiting was mild and self-limiting and was clearly due to a benign and identified cause (e.g. viral gastroenteritis) without red-flag symptoms or complications. This patient has severe pain and findings consistent with nephrolithiasis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Abdominal ultrasound:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Ultrasound is less sensitive than CT for identifying ureteral stones, especially small or distal stones. Abdominal ultrasound can be used in patients with vomiting and abdominal pain when radiation exposure must be avoided, such as in pregnant patients, or when assessing for conditions like biliary disease, hydronephrosis, or free abdominal fluid.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Upper endoscopy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Upper endoscopy is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms and findings point to a urinary system etiology such as nephrolithiasis rather than an upper gastrointestinal cause.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Abdominal X-ray:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Abdominal X-ray is helpful in evaluating acute vomiting when assessing for bowel obstruction or perforation, as it can reveal air-fluid levels, dilated bowel loops, or free air under the diaphragm. However, this patient with vomiting, severe flank pain, and hematuria most likely has nephrolithiasis. Abdominopelvic x-rays may be considered in nonpregnant patients when CT is not available.</span></div>",

Transthoracic echocardiogram is generally sufficient to make a diagnosis. <br><br>Each valvulopathy can cause a characteristic murmur as detailed in the table below: <br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/LxiAht1fRtKjdL3-Pe7_K662SaO_Fhd9/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ High-frequency decrescendo murmur at the left 2nd intercostal space, louder with inspiration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Blowing decrescendo early diastolic murmur at the right 2nd intercostal space, S3 heart sound:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This murmur could be heard in cases of aortic regurgitation.

Together, these findings are concerning for an anterior cruciate ligament tear, best confirmed on physical examination with the <strong>Lachman test</strong>.<br><br>The knee's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most anterior ligamentous component of the knee joint. It prevents the tibia from sliding out in front of the femur and provides rotational stability. The ACL is the most commonly injured ligament in the knee and typically occurs in sports during moments of <strong>rapid deceleration, direction changes, or pivoting on a lower extremity with the foot planted</strong>. Symptoms include the sensation of a &#8220;pop&#8221; or &#8220;tear&#8221; during the injury as well as significant effusion, pain, and sensation of joint instability immediately after the incident.<br><br>Two physical examination techniques with high sensitivity for detecting ACL tears are the <strong>Lachman test</strong> and the <strong>anterior drawer test</strong>. The <strong>Lachman test</strong> involves flexing the knee at 20&#176;with the patient supine. At the same time, the examiner places one hand behind the tibia and the other hand grasps the patient's thigh and pulls the tibia forward. A positive test is indicated by anterior translational of the tibia or a &#8220;soft&#8221; end feel. The anterior drawer test involves the examiner grasping the proximal lower leg below the tibial plateau with the knee in 90&#176;of flexion and attempting to translate the lower leg anteriorly with the patient's foot planted on the examination table. Definitive diagnosis of ACL tear is achieved with MRI. Signs of ACL tear on MRI include swelling, increased signal intensity, fiber discontinuity and abnormal ACL orientation. An empty notch sign which is a fluid signal at the site of femoral attachment at the intercondylar notch may be seen and it denotes avulsion at the femoral attachment. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Lachman test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ober test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The Ober test is used to evaluate tension in the iliotibial band.

Posterior cruciate ligament injury commonly occurs with a direct blow to the front of the knee such as when a bent knee hits the dashboard in a motor vehicle collision. Based on this patient&#8217;s mechanism of injury, an anterior cruciate ligament injury is more likely. &#160;</span></div>",

The mass fluctuates with her menstrual cycle. This clinical presentation is suggestive of a <strong>fibroadenoma</strong>. The best next step in the evaluation of suspected fibroadenoma in a<strong>&#160;patient younger than 35 years old&#160;</strong>is an <strong>ultrasound of the breast</strong>, as it can distinguish fluid-filled cysts from solid masses and characterize these masses as benign or suspicious for malignancy. If the patient is 35 years old or older, breast ultrasound and mammography are both indicated. &#160; <br><br>For an adult presenting with a breast mass suggestive of a fibroadenoma, ultrasonography, and mammography are useful in classifying the fibroadenoma as simple, complex, or giant based on distinct radiologic features. &#160; &#160; <br><br>With a <strong>simple fibroadenoma</strong>, ultrasonography often depicts a well-circumscribed, uniform, hypoechoic, oval, or round lesion, while mammography may show a well-circumscribed oval mass that is either hypodense or isodense to the surrounding breast tissue. Macrolobulation or partially obscured margins may also be seen. Simple fibroadenomas in young women that are asymptomatic and not enlarging may be followed with a repeat breast exam and imaging studies at 6 months to determine if they continue to be stable, or a core needle biopsy may be performed. &#160; <br><br>In ultrasonography, a <strong>complex fibroadenoma&#160;</strong>may exhibit features of a simple fibroadenoma, but will also have internal calcifications, irregular borders, or lobulations. A mammogram often reveals a well-circumscribed oval or round mass with 'popcorn' calcifications, and obscured or irregular borders. An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy with histopathology revealing sclerosing adenosis, duct epithelial hyperplasia, epithelial microcalcifications, and papillary apocrine changes, along with stromal and glandular elements of fibroadenomas confirms the diagnosis. &#160; <br><br>A <strong>giant fibroadenoma</strong> is typically larger than 5 cm on ultrasound, maintaining the well-circumscribed, uniform hypoechoic characteristics of simple fibroadenomas. Mammography may reveal a large, well-circumscribed mass that is hypodense or isodense to the surrounding breast tissue. It may be macrolobulated or have partially obscured margins. Importantly, giant fibroadenomas may be confused with phyllodes tumors due to their rapid increase in size. An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy can help differentiate between the two and excision is recommended for giant fibroadenomas. In giant fibroadenomas, hypercellular stroma, epithelial and myoepithelial hyperplasia, and proliferation of stromal and epithelial cells without a leaf-like growth pattern are typically seen. &#160; &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Breast ultrasonography:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Observation and repeat breast examination and imaging in 6 months:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>If ultrasonography demonstrates findings consistent with a simple fibroadenoma and the patient remains asymptomatic, then observation and repeat examination and imaging in 6 months to ensure stability would be appropriate treatment.

CT imaging demonstrates a fracture through the base of the odontoid process, which is consistent with a <strong>type II odontoid fracture</strong>. &#160; <br><br><strong>Odontoid fractures</strong> are the most common type of cervical spine injury seen in older patients and refer to fractures of the odontoid process (dens of C2 vertebra). They often occur in older patients as a result of <strong>low-energy falls</strong>. This injury pattern most commonly occurs secondary to <strong>forced hyperextension of the neck</strong>. Less commonly, it can arise via forced hyperflexion of the neck. These fractures can be recognized by bone discontinuation in the dens on an open mouth radiograph or CT scan. &#160; <br><br>Odontoid fractures are classified into three distinct injury patterns. A <strong>type I odontoid fracture</strong> refers to an avulsion fracture of the tip of the odontoid process and represents a <strong>stable cervical spine injury</strong>. <strong>Type II and type III odontoid fractures</strong> represent <strong>unstable cervical spine injuries</strong> and refer to a fracture through the base of the odontoid process and a fracture through the C2 vertebral body, respectively. In particular, <strong>type II injuries</strong> are at risk of <strong>avascular necrosis</strong> and nonunion due to poor blood supply.

Because of the posterior relationships of the pancreas, cancer of the head often compresses and obstructs the bile duct and/or the hepatopancreatic ampulla. This causes obstruction, resulting in the retention of bile pigments, <strong>painless enlargement of the gallbladder</strong> (Courvoisier sign), and obstructive jaundice. <strong>Courvoisier&#8217;s law</strong> states that an enlarged and non-tender gallbladder accompanied by mild jaundice is unlikely caused by gallstones and rather caused by pancreatic or gallstone cancer.

When the superior mesenteric artery is invaded, it usually means that the cancer cannot be surgically resected.

      "solution": "This patient presents with a recent history of significant weight loss presents with intermittent gross hematuria and lumbar pain. The abdominal CT scan demonstrates left renal vein compression at its distal segment between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery with mild proximal dilatation. In combination, this presentation is consistent with nutcracker syndrome (NCS). &#160; <br><br>NCS occurs when the <strong>left renal vein,</strong> which drains blood from the left kidney, becomes <strong>squeezed between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)&#160;</strong>and <strong>abdominal aorta</strong>. Normally, the aortomesenteric angle (between SMA and aorta) is around 45 degrees, with the renal vein cushioned by a bit of fat in the mesentery. If there is significant weight loss which shrinks the mesenteric fat, this angle is reduced, and the arteries begin to pinch the left renal vein, causing renal hypertension. Over time, the high pressures cause small breaks in the renal blood vessels. Patients typically present with<strong>&#160;gross hematuria</strong> and <strong>left flank pain</strong> that may improve or worsen depending on positioning. &#160; <br><br>Since the left gonadal vein drains via the left renal vein, nutcracker syndrome can also result in<strong>&#160;left testicular pain</strong> in males or <strong>left lower quadrant pain</strong> in females, especially during intercourse and during menstruation.

The classic signs of a strangulated hernia include severe pain and skin changes overlying a tender abdominal bulge. The patient may have signs of bowel obstruction and sepsis. Strangulated hernias require <strong>emergent surgical evaluation and intervention</strong>. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Referral to general surgery:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ CT of the abdomen and pelvis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: CT of the abdomen and pelvis is not indicated for uncomplicated hernias that show no evidence of strangulation or incarceration.

Femoral neck fractures are common in older patients, especially those with underlying osteoporosis. They can occur with low energy falls and have a high morbidity and mortality rate. &#160; <br><br>Hip fractures get divided into <strong>intracapsular&#160;</strong>(femoral head and neck) or <strong>extracapsular&#160;</strong>(intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric). Specifically, a femoral neck or head fracture is an intracapsular, displaced fracture that typically occurs following a fall onto the lateral hip. Patients with a displaced femoral neck fracture are generally <strong>unable to bear weight&#160;</strong>on the affected side and present with a<strong>&#160;shortened leg with external rotation</strong> of the affected hip (due to the psoas and iliacus muscle contraction without acetabular counterforce). Notably, intracapsular fractures can be associated with disruption of the blood supply from the <strong>medial circumflex artery</strong>, resulting in <strong>avascular necrosis.</strong> Femoral head fractures are often associated with posterior dislocation of the hip and are at increased risk of sciatic nerve injury. Because of the potential for avascular necrosis with intracapsular fractures arthroplasty with hip replacement is typically the procedure of choice. &#160; <br><br>In contrast, an<strong>&#160;intertrochanteric fracture</strong> is an <strong>extracapsular fracture</strong> that occurs between the greater and lesser trochanters. A subtrochanteric fracture which is defined as a fracture within 5 cm distal to the lesser trochanter is also considered an extracapsular fracture. Clinical presentation is similar to femoral neck fractures. Both fracture patterns require surgical correction (e.g. open reduction with internal fixation) unless the patient is not a good surgical candidate. With extracapsular fractures the blood supply is usually intact and fixation is the procedure of choice. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/aa5TwEsMSjyJ9s9GQwLw-Sb-Rg_OXc5p/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Posterior dislocation of the femoral head:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Posterior dislocation of the femoral head occurs secondary to high-velocity motor vehicle collisions.

Biopsy can be a punch, shave, incisional, or excisional biopsy. <strong>Islands or nests of basaloid epithelial cells</strong> containing <strong>large nuclei</strong> with <strong>peripheral palisading</strong> and <strong>clefting&#160;</strong>from adjacent tumor stroma are classic findings of <strong>nodular type</strong> basal cell carcinoma.<br><br>After histologic identification, BCC is then further differentiated as being <strong>low risk for recurrence&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;high risk for recurrence</strong> based on patient factors and tumor characteristics. Tumors are considered to be low risk for recurrence if they are primary lesions, less than 20 mm in size with well-defined borders; with nodular, superficial, or other non-aggressive growth pattern; and located on the trunk or extremities (other than the hands or feet). BCC is characterized as <strong>high risk for recurrence</strong> if the lesion is a <strong>recurrent&#160;</strong>lesion; if it is <strong>&#8805; 20 mm in diameter</strong>; located on the <strong>head, neck, hands, feet, or genitalia</strong>; or if the borders are <strong>ill-defined</strong>. Perineural invasion is a sign of a lesion being high risk for recurrence as well as if the histopathology shows micronodular, morpheaform, sclerosing, infiltrating, basosquamous, or carcinosarcomatous patterns of growth.
