      "solution": "This 14-year-old adolescent presenting for a well-child visit should be asked about <strong><span>self-harm and depression</span><span>.</span></strong> An effective way to open this conversation is to<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>ask about the child&#8217;s mood for the previous two weeks</strong> to determine whether they&#8217;re experiencing any symptoms of depression or anxiety. The provider can also ask how the child expresses their feelings, including any coping strategies for dealing with strong emotions, and ask if they have trusted people to confide in. Adolescent patients should also be <strong>screened for depression and suicidal ideation.&#160;</strong>The <strong>Patient Health Questionnaire-A&#160;</strong>(PHQ-A) is a survey that can be administered to adolescents to screen, diagnose, and monitor depression. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>A core aspect of health promotion in the well-child visit for an adolescent is the <strong>HEADSSS assessment.</strong> HEADSSS is a mnemonic used to highlight the important aspects of the patient interview and stands for <strong>H</strong>ome; <strong>E</strong>ducation and Employment; <strong>A</strong>ctivities; <strong>D</strong>rugs and substance use;<strong>&#160;S</strong>exuality, Gender Identity, and Relationships; <strong>S</strong>elf-harm and Depression; and <strong>S</strong>afety. It is ideal for this part of the patient interview to be conducted <strong>without the parent present</strong> to build autonomy, strengthen the physician-patient relationship, and allow the child to ask questions they might otherwise be reluctant to ask. The environment should be <strong>non-judgmental and supportive</strong> so that the adolescent can openly express concerns about sensitive issues. The table below includes the key topics to cover during the HEADSSS assessment. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>P.S.

Symptoms of persistent hyperglycemia include <strong>polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia,&#160;</strong>and <strong>weight loss.</strong> Clinical signs may progress rapidly to DKA, and patients may have vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, weakness, and lethargy. Associated dehydration can cause tachycardia, delayed capillary refill time, poor skin turgor, and dry mucus membranes. <strong>Kussmaul respirations,</strong> as seen in this patient, refers to a deep, rapid pattern of breathing. In addition, ketoacidosis may result in a <strong>fruity odor&#160;</strong>to the breath. &#160; &#160; <br><br>The most serious complication of DKA is <strong>severe neurologic injury</strong> and development of cerebral edema. Warning signs include&#160;headache, bradycardia, irritability,&#160;altered mental status, unresponsiveness, and coma. Laboratory values necessary for diagnosing DKA are <strong>hyperglycemia&#160;</strong>with a blood glucose level &gt;200 mg/dL, <strong>venous pH &lt; 7.3</strong> or <strong>serum bicarbonate level &lt; 15 mEq/L, ketonemia</strong> (blood b-hydroxybutyrate concentration &#8805;3 mmol/L), and ketonuria.&#160; &#160; <br><br>In the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis, an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong>&#160;should be performed. If the patient is unstable, the first step is to stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation. In patients with&#160;<strong>signs of dehydration,</strong> as seen in this patient,<strong>&#160;intravenous fluid</strong> administration is the first step to correct dehydration, acidosis, and reverse ketosis. Fluid replacement should begin before starting intravenous insulin therapy. Electrolyte repletion and monitoring <strong>sodium </strong>and <strong>potassium </strong>levels, along with monitoring urine output and neurological status is essential. Once the patient is stabilized, continuous vital sign monitoring and oxygen as needed can be provided. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Intravenous&#160;isotonic saline&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See&#160;Main&#160;Explanation.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intravenous&#160;sodium bicarbonate&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Sodium bicarbonate administration is not recommended in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis&#160;</span><span>(DKA)&#160;</span><span>and&#160;</span><span>has not shown benefit in the resolution of DKA</span><span>.

A <strong>bulging anterior fontanelle</strong>&#160;can be seen in infants with <strong>acute meningitis&#160;</strong>and would be the most concerning finding in this clinical scenario and would require lumbar puncture and empiric antibiotics/antivirals.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>An extensive<strong>&#160;perinatal and birth history</strong>&#160;should be obtained for children&#160;with&#160;<strong>fever&#160;</strong>who are<strong>&#160;0-60 days old</strong>. It is important to note whether the infant was <strong>premature</strong>, had an <strong>extended hospital stay</strong> following delivery, and the course of&#160;development since delivery. Parents should be asked about perinatal complications that require&#160;additional or more frequent evaluation and care.&#160;<strong>Maternal infections including group B streptococcus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Neisseria gonorrhea, and Chlamydia trachomatis should be noted.</strong>&#160;If there is maternal history of an infection, follow-up questioning should include whether the mother was treated, received prophylaxis, or started on suppressive therapy.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Children &lt;60 days old with fever often present with <strong>non-specific symptoms </strong>such as<strong> fussiness, lethargy</strong>, and<strong> poor feeding.</strong> Depending on the source of the fever, they may also have diarrhea, vomiting, rash, cough, and congestion.

Other signs and symptoms of dehydration include decreased urine output (concerning if &lt;4 times/day), dry mucous membranes, and delayed capillary refill.&#160;A <strong>bulging fontanelle </strong>is concerning for <strong>meningitis </strong>or increased intracranial pressure.

Labs show hypernatremia, <strong>urine osmolality &lt; 300 mOsm/kg, serum osmolality &gt; 300 mOsm/kg</strong>, and <strong>diluted urine</strong> indicating diabetes insipidus (DI). She has a history of <strong>bipolar disorder</strong> and is taking <strong>lithium</strong>, which is known to cause <strong>nephrogenic DI</strong>. Therefore, the best next step to confirm the diagnosis is a <strong>desmopressin challenge test</strong>.<br><br>DI can result from vasopressin deficiency (central DI) or <strong>vasopressin insensitivity</strong> at the level of the <strong>kidney (nephrogenic DI)</strong>. The diagnosis of DI is established if the <strong>serum osmolality is &gt;300&#8239;mOsm/kg</strong>, and the <strong>urine osmolality is &lt;300&#8239;mOsm/kg</strong>. In this patient, a <strong>desmopressin challenge test</strong> is indicated to establish the diagnosis of DI and to differentiate central from nephrogenic causes. <strong>Nephrogenic DI</strong> can be congenital or acquired. Congenital nephrogenic DI is less common and may be seen in the first several weeks of life. Acquired nephrogenic DI can result from medication intake such as <strong>lithium </strong>and <strong>amphotericin B</strong>, or electrolyte abnormalities such as <strong>hypercalcemia </strong>or <strong>hypokalemia</strong>.<br><br><strong>Desmopressin challenge test</strong> is performed by giving the patient desmopressin and evaluating the urine osmolality after 1 hour. If the <strong>urine osmolality increases by 50% or less</strong> with <strong>no change in urine volume</strong>, the kidneys are not responding to vasopressin, which confirms <strong>nephrogenic DI</strong>. However, if urine osmolality increases by more than 50% with an increase in urine volume, that indicates vasopressin deficiency and that the kidneys are responding normally to vasopressin. Central DI can be diagnosed in this scenario, which usually occurs in the setting of head trauma, intracranial tumors like craniopharyngioma, anatomic pituitary or hypothalamus defects, or intracranial surgery. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Abdominal computed tomography&#160;scan&#160;(CT scan)&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Abdominal CT scan may show evidence of adrenal hyperplasia or Conn syndrome which can lead to hypervolemic hyponatremia.

He has multiple clinical features suggestive of <strong>transient synovitis</strong>. Blood work shows a mildly elevated white blood cell count and there is evidence of a moderate effusion on hip ultrasonography. Arthrocentesis of the hip involved demonstrates no evidence of septic arthritis with no growth on culture. The findings are consistent with transient synovitis which is typically <strong><span>s</span><span>elf-limited</span></strong> and resolves on its own within 2 weeks. The initial recommended treatment for this condition involves <strong>rest and NSAIDs</strong>.<br><br><strong>Septic arthritis</strong> refers to a <strong>bacterial infection</strong> of the <strong>synovium and joint space</strong>. <strong>Transient synovitis (toxic synovitis) is noninfectious synovial inflammation</strong> and can present similarly. Differentiating the two is important since the treatment is different. <br><br>If there is enough suspicion, formal diagnosis of septic arthritis and transient synovitis can be confirmed via <strong>joint aspiration</strong>, with evaluation of synovial fluid cell count with differential, gram stain, and culture. When children present with hip pain and there is concern for septic arthritis, arthrocentesis should be performed. In patients with <strong>septic arthritis</strong>, synovial fluid analysis will typically reveal <strong>bacterial growth, cloudy or purulent fluid</strong>, as well as a <strong>cell count &gt; 50K WBC/mm<sup>3</sup></strong>. These patients will also typically have positive blood cultures. In contrast, patients with <strong>transient synovitis</strong> will have a <strong>negative gram stain and culture, clear or yellow fluid</strong>, and a <strong>cell count of 5K - 15K WBC/mm<sup>3</sup></strong>. <br><br>Treatment of&#160;<strong>septic arthritis</strong>&#160;involves&#160;<strong>empiric intravenous antibiotics</strong>&#160;based on the&#160;patient's&#160;age, clinical status,&#160;and risk factors.&#160;Antibiotics&#160;are&#160;tailored&#160;to the synovial fluid&#160;culture and sensitivity results.&#160;<strong>Arthrocentesis </strong>is both diagnostic and therapeutic and is necessary to decompress the joint space and&#160;remove inflammatory&#160;debris.&#160;<strong>Surgical consultation</strong>&#160;may be necessary for&#160;arthroscopic drainage or arthrotomy.&#160;In contrast,&#160;<strong>transient synovitis</strong>&#160;is managed conservatively, with&#160;treatment focused on&#160;<strong>pain control</strong><strong><span>, rest,</span><span>&#160;and supportive care</span><span>.&#160;</span>&#160;</strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Administer ibuprofen:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Admit for observation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;This patient has&#160;transient synovitis&#160;and there is no&#160;indication&#160;for observation.&#160;This patient can be discharged&#160;home.

Physical examination shows localized <strong>tenderness&#160;</strong>and <strong>swelling&#160;</strong>of the <strong>right proximal thigh</strong> and limited range of motion of the hip.

The patient had an episode of cyanosis and hypotonia lasting less than one minute. After evaluation by the emergency room physician, the patient is deemed appropriate for discharge home without further workup. Therefore, the patient must be considered <strong>low-risk</strong>. Patients with low-risk features will have a <strong>normal physical</strong> examination at the time of evaluation. An <strong>open anterior fontanelle</strong> is <strong>appropriate </strong>for a patient who is <strong>6 months old</strong>. <br><br>BRUEs are <strong>witnessed episodes</strong> during <strong>infancy</strong>, lasting <strong>less than one minute,</strong> that are characterized by <strong>cyanosis or pallor; absent, decreased, or irregular breathing</strong>; a marked <strong>change in muscle tone</strong>; or <strong>altered responsiveness</strong>; followed by a return to the infant&#8217;s baseline state of health. A BRUE is diagnosed when <strong>no underlying cause for these symptoms </strong>can be identified after a thorough history, physical examination, and occasionally lab work and further evaluation. Based on historical features and exam findings, infants who meet the criteria for a BRUE can be classified into <strong>high or low-risk categories</strong>. <br><br>When a BRUE is suspected, a careful history and physical examination should be performed to assess for <strong>high-risk BRUE features</strong>, the presence of which will guide further workup and management. High-risk features include <strong>age &lt;60 days old</strong>, history of <strong>prematurity, more than one BRUE episode</strong>, episode <strong>&gt;1 minute</strong>, and history of <strong>cardiopulmonary resuscitation</strong> by a medical provider. Patients are also considered high-risk if they have <strong>concerning historical features</strong> or <strong>physical examination</strong> findings such as, but not limited to, respiratory illness, access to medications, episodic vomiting or lethargy, congenital anomalies, bulging anterior fontanelle, or abnormal bruising. Patients with high-risk features should be further evaluated for targeted precipitating factors or physical examination findings that might suggest an underlying infectious process, inborn error of metabolism, cardiovascular anomaly, GERD/laryngospasm, epilepsy, or potential child abuse.

This patient also has evidence of <strong>end organ dysfunction</strong> as evidenced by hypotension and acute kidney injury (diagnosed by elevated creatinine). Sepsis associated with cardiovascular dysfunction or multisystem organ failure is further classified as severe <strong>sepsis</strong>.<br><br><strong>Sepsis </strong>refers to a dysregulated immune response to infection and is frequently associated with organ dysfunction, shock, and death. The infection can be bacterial, viral, or fungal, and may originate from any tissue, initiating a complex interplay between infectious virulence factors and host defense mechanisms. The main goals of management are to identify and treat the infection while maintaining hemodynamic stability to prevent or minimize organ damage. <br><br>All pediatric patients undergoing evaluation for sepsis should have standard bloodwork performed including a <strong>complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, blood culture, lactic acid, urinalysis, coagulation profile, </strong>and <strong>blood gas analysis</strong>. Further workups should be tailored to the suspected source of infection (e.g., lumbar puncture and CSF studies for patients with suspected meningitis, or chest x-ray for patients with suspected pneumonia). Additional studies including inflammatory markers like procalcitonin can help assess infection and sepsis risk. <br><br>When sepsis is suspected, all patients should also be assessed for the presence of <strong>SIRS</strong>, as detailed in the chart above. Patients who screen positive for SIRS and have a source of infection can be diagnosed as having <strong>sepsis</strong>.

The murmur of HCM is usually heard best at the <strong>left sternal border</strong> and is described as a <strong>harsh systolic murmur that increases in intensity during Valsalva or after standing.</strong> ECG findings can be variable, or normal; therefore, the history and physical should be used to determine if further evaluation is necessary before authorizing participation in sports. Recent <strong>musculoskeletal symptoms or injuries, </strong>with or without neurologic manifestations, should also be a red flag indicating that participation in sports may be unsafe without further workups. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Do not authorize sports participation and order an echocardiogram:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Authorize sports participation with protective gear:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;This athlete will need to use protective gear given his history of&#160;</span><span>orchiectomy.&#160;</span><span>However,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>given</span><span>&#160;his&#160;</span><span>parent</span><span>&#8217;s unexpected drown</span><span>ing</span><span>&#160;at&#160;</span><span>an early age</span><span>&#160;</span><span>and&#160;</span><span>the</span><span>&#160;harsh systolic murmur&#160;</span><span>heard&#160;</span><span>on cardiovascular examination</span><span>&#160;and ECG findings</span><span>,&#160;</span><span>an</span><span>&#160;echo</span><span>cardiogram&#160;</span><span>should be performed&#160;</span><span>prior to&#160;</span><span>authorization</span><span>&#160;for sports participation.</span><span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Authorize sports participation with cardiology follow-up:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;Athletes with&#160;</span><span>physical exam and ECG findings that are consistent with&#160;</span><span>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&#160;</span><span>(HCM) (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span>&#160;harsh systolic murmur, non-specific ST changes)&#160;</span><span>should not&#160;</span><span>be authorized to</span><span>&#160;</span><span>participate</span><span>&#160;in sports until the condition has been ruled out</span><span>&#160;via&#160;</span><span>additional</span><span>&#160;testing,&#160;</span><span>with</span><span>&#160;an echocardiogram</span><span>.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Do not authorize sports participation and order genetic testing:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>Genetic testing can help narrow the cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&#160;(HCM)&#160;in patients with an established diagnosis; however, this patient has not yet had an echocardiogram to&#160;establish&#160;the diagnosis.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Do not authorize sports participation and order chest computed tomography:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>C</span><span>hest computed tomography may be helpful&#160;</span><span>for</span><span>&#160;evaluating patients&#160;</span><span>who&#160;</span><span>potentially</span><span>&#160;</span><span>have</span><span>&#160;Marfan</span><span>&#160;syndrome</span><span>&#160;which is</span><span>&#160;</span><span>a genetic disorder affecting connective tissue&#160;</span><span>that</span><span>&#160;can also present with heart problems.</span><span>&#160;However, this patient does not have features suggestive of Marfan syndrome</span><span>.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div>",

Diagnosis of a peritonsillar abscess can be made clinically.

If a fluid collection has developed around the tonsil (i.e., peritonsillar abscess), drainage is required in addition to antibiotics.

If shiga toxin testing and stool cultures are negative, then <strong>complement genotyping and testing for antibodies to complement proteins</strong> should be performed next.<br><br>When patients are suspected of having thrombotic microangiopathy, the evaluation should include CBC with peripheral blood smear, CMP, coagulation profile, LDH, reticulocyte, and haptoglobin. Results will typically demonstrate <strong>anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury</strong>, elevated LDH levels and reticulocytosis, and decreased or undetectable haptoglobin levels. Peripheral blood smears will show <strong>schistocytes</strong>.<br><br>Further diagnosis of the specific type of TMA is dependent upon the patient&#8217;s age and risk factors. <strong>TTP occurs</strong> almost exclusively in adults and adults with suspected TMA can have the diagnosis confirmed with <strong>ADAMTS13 activity testing</strong>. In contrast, <strong>HUS </strong>is more commonly seen in <strong>pediatric patients</strong>. Patients with suspected HUS should have <strong>stool culture and shiga toxin testing for Shiga toxin-producing E coli</strong>. If there is no history of exposure to contaminated livestock or food and the stool culture/toxin testing is negative, or if there is a <strong>family history of unexplained renal failure, complement studies</strong> should be performed to diagnose <strong>atypical HUS</strong> that can occasionally be caused by <strong>medications </strong>and should be suspected in patients with recent use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents or quinine.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Complement genotyping and antibody testing:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Stool testing for Giardia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect</span></strong><span>:&#160;</span><span>Giardia infection does not lead to HUS, infection with Shig</span><span>a</span><span>&#160;toxin</span><span>-</span><span>producing E</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;coli can lead to HUS.&#160;</span><span>Atypical cases of&#160;</span><span>HUS can also be caused by&#160;</span><span>hereditary</span><span>&#160;complement gene mutations, medications, and&#160;</span><span>acquired</span><span>&#160;complement</span><span>&#160;</span><span>autoantibodies</span><span>.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ ADAMSTS13 activity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: ADAMTS13 activity testing is&#160;</span><span>indicated</span><span>&#160;in the workup of&#160;</span><span>suspected&#160;</span><span>TTP.

These findings are concerning for intracranial injury secondary to <strong>non-accidental trauma</strong><strong>.</strong> For patients with evidence of physical trauma, the first step in management involves stabilization and identification of potentially life-threatening injuries such as skull fractures or intracranial hemorrhage. When nonaccidental trauma is suspected in patients with seizures, altered mental status, or evidence of head trauma, computed <strong>tomography (CT) imaging of the brain and skull&#160;</strong>and radiographic <strong>skeletal survey&#160;</strong>is warranted. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Non-accidental trauma refers to any intentional act that causes physical or psychological harm to a child, typically committed by a caregiver. Non-accidental trauma, which is also called child maltreatment or child abuse, can be sub-categorized into neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, and medical abuse. Neglect refers to inadequate provision of a child&#8217;s basic needs, which causes harm or could potentially cause harm.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Regardless of the subtype, all patients with suspected non-accidental trauma/neglect&#160;should have&#160;an initial screening assessment to ensure stable&#160;airway, breathing, and circulation. Unstable patients should receive appropriate interventions (e.g., intubation if obtunded&#160;and intravenous fluids if dehydrated, for example from neglect.). Lab&#160;work is warranted&#160;if there is unusual bleeding or bruising. Depending on the age of the patient, and the patient&#8217;s presentation,&#160;<strong>radiographs&#160;</strong>should be performed to assess for&#160;potential fractures. When head trauma is suspected,&#160;patients should undergo a careful neurologic examination followed by a <strong>brain and skull CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#160;</strong>Abusive head trauma, previously called shaken baby syndrome,&#160;occurs in children under 2 years of age from blunt force, trauma,&#160;and/or shaking and can result in vomiting,&#160;seizures, or coma from intracranial bleeding.&#160;These patients should also undergo a<strong> dilated fundoscopic exam</strong> to assess for retinal hemorrhage, which is commonly found in patients with non-accidental head injuries. Once the patient is stabilized, Child Protective Services (CPS) should be contacted.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>P.S.

Would&#160;raise concerns for HCM. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Once a murmur is identified in a pediatric patient, a focused history and physical examination should be performed. Patients and parents should be asked about&#160;<strong>chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, palpitations,</strong>&#160;or <strong>syncope</strong>. Newborns with a murmur should be assessed for<strong>&#160;difficulty feeding</strong> and <strong>cyanosis.

He has <strong>septic shock</strong> most likely secondary to <strong>bacterial infection. &#160;</strong>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>There are four main categories of shock: <strong>distributive, hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and obstructive. Distributive shock</strong> includes septic, anaphylactic, and neurogenic shock and results from <strong>peripheral vasodilation</strong> and <strong>increased but inadequate cardiac output.</strong> Distributive shock is typically considered a <strong>warm shock. &#160; &#160;</strong>&#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Sepsis&#160;</strong>results from a suspected or proven<strong>&#160;infectious etiology,</strong> and clinical deterioration leads to <strong>septic shock</strong>, which may result in <strong>multi-organ dysfunction&#160;</strong>and <strong>mortality</strong>. Clinical signs of septic shock include <strong>unstable temperatures</strong> (hyperthermia or hypothermia), <strong>tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension</strong>, and <strong>signs of infection</strong> (e.g. abnormal lung findings consistent with pneumonia in this patient). When septic shock is suspected, <strong>complete blood count (CBC), lactate,&#160;</strong>and inflammatory markers (i.e., <strong>C-reactive protein (CRP),</strong>&#160;<strong>erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),</strong> and <strong>procalcitonin&#160;</strong>level) should be ordered. Blood and urine <strong>cultures&#160;</strong>should be drawn, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures should possibly be obtained via lumbar puncture. Lab results typically reveal<strong>&#160;elevated white blood cell</strong>&#160;<strong>count&#160;</strong>and <strong>low platelets&#160;</strong>in combination with an <strong>elevated lactate</strong> and increased inflammatory markers. Cultures might reveal a causative pathogen. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>The other types of distributive shock are <strong>anaphylactic shock</strong> and neurogenic shock. Patients with anaphylactic shock present after exposure to an <strong>allergen </strong>with <strong>itching, rash,</strong> and <strong>shortness of breath, </strong>and physical examination may reveal <strong>urticaria, angioedema, wheezing,</strong> or <strong>stridor</strong>.

Patients with severe symptoms secondary to hyponatremia (e.g. seizures), regardless of the etiology, should be given a <strong>bolus of</strong> <strong>hypertonic saline</strong> to correct the serum sodium and prevent seizures. <br><br>Patients with <strong>euvolemic hyponatremia</strong> may have conditions affecting the central nervous system, such as <strong>meningitis, brain tumors or trauma, </strong>or<strong> recent brain surgery</strong>. The history of <strong>head trauma</strong> and <strong>polyuria </strong>in this case increases the possibility of <strong>cerebral salt wasting</strong>. Symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea, confusion, weakness, and headache. Severe symptoms include <strong>vomiting, lethargy, seizures</strong>, or cardio-respiratory distress. In patients with euvolemic hyponatremia, as in this patient, physical examination usually reveals a <strong>normal heart rate</strong> with <strong>no orthostatic drop in blood pressure, moist mucous membranes, normal skin turgor</strong>, and no signs of hypervolemia, such as ascites or edema. <br><br>In the setting of severe symptoms secondary to hyponatremia, an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong> should be performed. If the patient is unstable, the first step is to stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation. Unstable patients with hyponatremia often have a <strong>sodium level &lt;125 mEq/L</strong>, which can result in <strong>cerebral edema</strong>, <strong>seizures</strong>, and <strong>respiratory arrest</strong>. If these findings are present, <strong>emergent administration of hypertonic saline</strong> is necessary to correct the serum sodium and prevent seizures. Once the patient is stabilized, they should be placed on continuous vital sign monitoring and supplement with oxygen as needed. Monitoring urine output is essential. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intravenous fluids given at a slow rate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient has euvolemic hyponatremia.

A parent reports that the mass has been present intermittently for several years and enlarges during colds or upper respiratory infections. There is no fever, weight loss, night sweats, or recent trauma, and the child is otherwise healthy and up to date on immunizations. The family has a pet cat at home. On examination, the child is afebrile and in no distress. A 3 cm soft, non-tender, fluctuant mass is noted anterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. The overlying skin appears normal without erythema or warmth. The mass does not move with swallowing or tongue protrusion. Oropharyngeal and lymphatic examinations are unremarkable. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck reveals a well-defined, low-attenuation cystic structure lateral to the carotid sheath and anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this condition?",

Key features such as growth rate, location, consistency, and associated symptoms help guide the assessment. <strong>Firm, immobile masses</strong> with systemic signs such as fever or weight loss raise concern for <strong>malignancy</strong>, whereas <strong>tender, erythematous</strong> lesions are more consistent with <strong>infection</strong>. <strong>Soft, mobile, midline or lateral</strong> lesions that vary with illness suggest a <strong>developmental anomaly</strong>. Additional history, including recent infections, environmental exposures, and radiation history, along with a thorough physical examination, further refines the differential.

Voluntary withholding (due to pain or other biopsychosocial causes) is a major cause of constipation in children. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recently starting primary school:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Functional constipation (constipation arising from an unknown etiology) is common in children and has been associated with several biopsychosocial risk factors. While recently starting primary school introduces new psychological stressors on the child, this explanation is unlikely since he started having symptoms one week before starting school. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Pain:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Obesity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: While there are several risk factors associated with both obesity and constipation, such as long-term sedentary lifestyles and low-fiber diets, no direct association between obesity and constipation exists. Rather than developing constipation, overweight and obese adolescents may be more likely to have fecal incontinence. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lack of exercise:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: There is a long-held belief that bowel frequency increases in proportion to increased exercise; however, these findings are not evidence-based. Physical exercise has been shown to dramatically increase physical fitness; however, no consistent effect on large bowel function has been found. Therefore, while this patient should partake in more daily exercise, it should not have an impact on his recent symptoms of constipation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diabetes mellitus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Constipation is reported in nearly 60% of adults with diabetes mellitus. The cause of constipation remains poorly understood and likely involves long-term autonomic and enteric neuropathy. Patients with diabetes frequently suffer from enteropathic diarrhea and bloating due to the same pathophysiology. The child in this vignette has neither been diagnosed with diabetes nor does he present with any classical symptoms of diabetes such as polyuria, polydipsia, polyphasia or fatigue. Children with new-onset diabetes frequently present with nocturnal enuresis. &#160;</span></div>",

In addition to stabilizing the patient with airway management, <strong>naloxone&#160;</strong>should be administered as quickly as possible. Naloxone is an <strong>opioid antagonist</strong> that can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or via an endotracheal tube.<br><br><strong>Opioid exposure</strong> in the pediatric population can present along a continuum from mild symptoms of <strong>constipation</strong>, <strong>euphoria</strong>, or <strong>altered mental status</strong>, to life-threatening <strong>respiratory&#160;</strong>and <strong>central nervous system depression</strong>. Prompt recognition of a potential opioid overdose is critical to the patient&#8217;s survival. Patients with an opioid overdose are often unable to relay a history on their own, and bystanders, as well as objects found at the scene may be needed to suggest opioid involvement. Common physical examination findings in opioid overdose are respiratory depression with a <strong>decreased respiratory rate</strong> and <strong>shallow breathing, stupor,&#160;</strong>and <strong>miosis</strong>. &#160;<strong>Naloxone&#160;</strong>is an opioid antagonist that rapidly reverses the effects of opioids. It has a low risk of adverse effects and should be administered as quickly as possible to any patient with a <strong>suspected opioid overdose</strong>. Acute opioid overdose can be diagnosed clinically and obtaining laboratory studies to confirm exposure should not delay the administration of naloxone.<br><br>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available around the clock for consultation on patients with known or suspected poisoning, and those who may be critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222). <br><br>P.S.

Patients <strong>without red flags</strong> can usually be treated with supportive care without the need for further workup as presumptive viral <strong>gastroenteritis</strong>. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Children with acute diarrhea and <strong>red flag</strong> features likely have a <strong>severe case of viral gastroenteritis</strong> or a<strong>&#160;bacterial infection</strong>, such as from <em>Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter,</em> or <em>Escherichia coli</em>. If red flag symptoms are present, a complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), and stool studies should be ordered. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>In contrast to acute diarrhea, <strong>chronic diarrhea</strong> occurs when symptoms have lasted for <strong>two or more weeks.</strong> Children with chronic diarrhea and red flag symptoms, including <strong>bloody stools,</strong> may have an <strong>inflammatory process,&#160;</strong>such as inflammatory bowel disease or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. In addition to a CBC, CMP, and stool studies, inflammatory markers, colonoscopy (likely), and endoscopy (possibly) should be obtained. <strong>Chronic, non-bloody diarrhea&#160;</strong>with other red flag symptoms, such as fever or weight loss, should raise suspicion for <strong>pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease, parasitic gastroenteritis, or hyperthyroidism.&#160;</strong>Pancreatic insufficiency and occasionally celiac disease, parasitic gastroenteritis, and hyperthyroidism will have steatorrhea. Children with <strong>chronic diarrhea</strong> who do <strong>not have red flag symptoms</strong> should be evaluated for<strong> lactase deficiency, toddler&#8217;s diarrhea, or irritable bowel syndrome. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Stool culture:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Fecal calprotectin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>Fecal calprotectin is&#160;usually&#160;elevated in inflammatory bowel disease, which also presents with bloody&#160;diarrhea,&#160;although symptoms are&#160;typically&#160;chronic rather than acute.&#160;This patient&#8217;s acute presentation&#160;of fever and bloody stools&#160;after consumption of&#160;undercooked&#160;beef&#160;is&#160;more concerning for&#160;a&#160;bacterial&#160;cause of diarrhea,&#160;and&#160;a&#160;stool culture would be&#160;the preferred&#160;next step in the workup.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>Tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A test is helpful in the workup of celiac disease,&#160;which can&#160;cause chronic, watery&#160;diarrhea&#160;with steatorrhea.

Occasionally, further evaluation is necessary. Rashes due to roseola infantum, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), varicella (chickenpox), and coxsackievirus (hand, foot, and mouth disease) usually do not require testing, since the clinical presentation provides enough information to make the diagnosis in most cases, and the care is supportive.

Physical examination findings can include signs and symptoms of shock. Other types of acyanotic congenital heart defects present with <strong>murmurs </strong>and possibly heart failure symptoms (e.g., tachypnea and hepatomegaly). The description of the murmur can help diagnose the type of congenital heart defect. There are also many genetic syndromes with characteristic phenotypic features associated with congenital heart defects. For example, in Williams syndrome, patients can have a full face, a broad forehead, rounded cheeks, and a depressed nasal bridge with anteversion of the nares and associated supravalvular aortic stenosis. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Vital signs play a key role in the initial evaluation. A <strong>pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturation</strong> provides information about the oxygenation of the systemic circulation before and after the ductus arteriosus inserts into the aorta. Patients with a critical left ventricular outflow obstruction can have a pre-ductal oxygen saturation that is higher than the post-ductal oxygen saturation. <strong>Four extremity blood pressures</strong> can help diagnose coarctation as a blood pressure gradient of 20 mmHg or more between the upper and lower extremities is consistent with coarctation of the aorta. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong>&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Systolic murmur with a widely fixed and split S2 heard best at the left upper sternal border:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>An atrial septal defect presents as a systolic murmur with a widely fixed and split S2 heard best at&#160;</span><span>the&#160;</span><span>left upper sternal border.&#160;</span><span>However, t</span><span>his patient</span><span>&#160;</span><span>has a&#160;</span><span>diagnosed&#160;</span><span>ventricular septal defect which&#160;</span><span>presents with</span><span>&#160;a h</span><span>olosystolic murmur heard best at&#160;</span><span>the&#160;</span><span>left lower sternal border.</span>&#160; &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Systolic murmur radiating to the back:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>P</span><span>ulmonary stenosis</span><span>&#160;presents as a systolic murmur radiating to the back.</span><span>&#160;This patient&#160;</span><span>has a&#160;</span><span>diagnosed&#160;</span><span>ventricular septal defect which&#160;</span><span>presents&#160;</span><span>with</span><span>&#160;a h</span><span>olosystolic murmur heard best at</span><span>&#160;the</span><span>&#160;left lower sternal border.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Continuous machine-like murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border with radiation to the back:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>P</span><span>atent ductus arteriosus (PDA) presents&#160;</span><span>with</span><span>&#160;a continuous&#160;</span><span>machine</span><span>-like murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border with radiation to the back</span><span>.

This patient meets several criteria for <strong>functional constipation</strong> via the <strong>Rome criteria</strong>. The most important <strong>initial step</strong> in management of constipation is starting an <strong>oral laxative</strong>. <br><br>Constipation refers to an abnormal stooling pattern associated with <strong>hard stools</strong> and <strong>incomplete, infrequent, or painful defecation</strong>. The stooling pattern in healthy infants is highly variable. By four years of age, most healthy children pass one normally formed stool daily or every other day. Constipation in this age group is more likely to represent a functional gastrointestinal disorder. <strong>Functional constipation</strong> is a diagnosis of exclusion and can only be diagnosed using the <strong>Rome criteria</strong> once other organic causes of constipation are ruled out.<br><br>Acute management of pediatric patients with constipation first includes an <strong>assessment&#160;</strong>for any <strong>alarm features</strong>, including delayed passage of meconium, fever, vomiting, rectal bleeding, severe abdominal distension, urinary incontinence or bladder disease, weight loss or poor weight gain, or extraintestinal symptoms. Functional constipation in children is best <strong>managed&#160;</strong>with <strong>oral laxative therapy, behavioral modification, dietary changes,&#160;</strong>and <strong>disimpaction</strong> with rectal medications when necessary. Behavioral modification should be started after the oral laxative treatment has begun. Disimpaction with rectal medication is indicated in only severe cases (e.g. constipation-associated fecal incontinence) because it is invasive and can be difficult to administer to a fearful child. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Start an oral laxative:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Obtain an abdominal X-ray:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s history and physical examination are consistent with constipation.

He also has&#160;a<strong>&#160;cleft lip</strong> and&#160;<strong>micrognathia&#160;</strong>suggestive of <strong>DiGeorge&#160;</strong>or <strong>velocardiofacial syndrome</strong>. Most patients with DiGeorge syndrome have congenital heart disease (CHD). The findings in this patient are consistent with <strong>truncus arteriosus,</strong> which&#160;can be&#160;confirmed with&#160;an <strong>echocardiogram showing</strong> a&#160;<strong>single arterial trunk</strong>&#160;supplying the systemic and pulmonary circulations and truncal artery overlying a ventricular septal defect (VSD).&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>When evaluating patients with suspected CHD,&#160;it is important to obtain maternal, prenatal, and family history. Physical exam should focus on the presence and characteristics of heart sounds and murmurs. All neonates with suspected CHD should have peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) measured in both preductal (right hand) and postductal (either foot) locations to assess for cyanosis and differential cyanosis. Universal screening&#160;of newborns with pulse oximetry is offered in most hospitals.&#160;ECG should be performed, although it may be normal during the neonatal period,&#160;and it may show only nonspecific abnormalities. However, some CHDs&#160;are associated with specific ECG patterns.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Chest x-ray should be performed and can give indications of the underlying CHD. In right-sided obstructive lesions (e.g., TOF), pulmonary vascular markings are usually decreased. Increased pulmonary vascular markings can be seen in the truncus arteriosus as pulmonary vascular resistance falls after delivery.&#160;Increased vascular marking from Pulmonary venous congestion and edema due to heart failure may be seen with obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) and in patients with heart failure due to left-sided obstructive lesions (e.g.,&#160;HLHS).&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Echocardiograms&#160;</strong>can confirm the diagnosis of CHD and determine the type of lesions present. Additionally, when patients present with&#160;<strong>cyanosis&#160;</strong>and <strong>likely congenital heart disease,&#160;</strong>it is important to determine if the<strong>&#160;CHD is ductal dependent</strong> because, without administration of prostaglandins, the ductus arteriosus will close and lead to potentially life-threatening consequences within the first few days of life. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cardiac catheterization&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>Cardiac catheterization examine</span><span>s</span><span>&#160;structures not visualized by echocardiography or for procedures like balloon septostomy.&#160;</span><span>This patient has&#160;</span><span>features of&#160;</span><span>truncus&#160;</span><span>arteriosus,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>and&#160;</span><span>an&#160;</span><span>echocardiogram</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;not c</span><span>ardiac&#160;</span><span>catheterization</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>is used to confirm the diagnosis.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Echocardiogram&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Correct:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Electrocardiogram&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong> Electrocardiogram (ECG) can&#160;show indications of&#160;right, left, or biventricular hypertrophy in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD).&#160;However,&#160;it is&#160;not used to make a diagnosis of CHD.&#160;This patient&#160;likely has&#160;truncus&#160;arteriosus,&#160;and an electrocardiogram should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hyperoxia test&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong>&#160;A hyperoxia test&#160;was historically used to&#160;distinguish cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) from pulmonary disease.&#160;Patients&#160;with cyanotic CHD are unable to increase their arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) during administration of 100% oxygen.&#160;For this patient with&#160;likely&#160;truncus&#160;arteriosus,&#160;an echocardiogram&#160;is used to confirm&#160;the diagnosis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Microsomal analysis&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;Microsomal analysis&#160;</span><span>can</span><span>&#160;</span><span>confirm</span><span>&#160;the diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome which can be associated with truncus&#160;</span><span>arteriosus</span><span>.

If the patient presents with significant emesis, it may be beneficial to make the patient nothing by mouth <strong>(NPO)</strong> and insert a <strong>nasogastric tube</strong> to decompress the stomach. If there is concern for an underlying infection, <strong>broad-spectrum antibiotics</strong> should be administered. Infants who are unstable or have symptoms of an acute abdomen (e.g., significant abdominal distension and tenderness) should have a surgical consultation for possible laparotomy. &#160;In stable patients, detailed history and physical exams can provide clues to the underlying diagnosis and guide the evaluation and management. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Advise parents to avoid oats until age three:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Order oat immunoglobulin E levels:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>This patient presents with food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) secondary to&#160;</span><span>oats</span><span>.

The patient has <strong><span>projectile</span><span>&#160;</span><span>emesis</span><span>&#160;</span><span>immediately</span></strong><strong>&#160;after eating</strong> and always seems hungry. Physical examination is significant for an <strong>&#8220;olive-shaped&#8221; abdominal mass&#160;</strong>in the right upper quadrant, and abdominal ultrasound identifies a <strong>thickened pyloric sphincter.</strong> These findings are consistent with <strong>pyloric stenosis.</strong> The incidence of pyloric stenosis is increased in <strong>males </strong>and in <strong>firstborn </strong>children. The incidence is also increased in preterm infants and children born to younger mothers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>When assessing newborns or infants who present with vomiting, the patient's age can help create a differential diagnosis, and it is important to determine if the emesis is bilious or nonbilious.

The initial work-up of intussusception should be an <strong>abdominal ultrasound,&#160;</strong>looking for a <strong>&#8220;target sign&#8221;</strong> (see below). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Bilious emesis</strong> in newborns and infants is often a sign of<strong>&#160;intestinal obstruction</strong> and is an <strong>emergency</strong>. Once the patient is stabilized, they should have <strong>imaging&#160;</strong>performed. An abdominal radiograph, abdominal ultrasound, or an upper gastrointestinal contrast study may be performed depending on certain factors like symptomatology, and whether the patient is premature. Patients with <strong>intussusception</strong>, which is caused by <strong>telescoping of part of the intestine into itself</strong> will have a<strong>&#160;target sign</strong> on <strong>abdominal ultrasound.

His physical examination is significant for <strong>abdominal distention</strong> and <strong>dermatitis herpetiformis.&#160;</strong>The most likely diagnosis is <strong>celiac disease</strong>. Patients with Down syndrome are at increased risk for celiac disease and <strong>tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (TTG IgA)&#160;</strong>can be used to detect celiac disease. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients with Down syndrome are at increased risk for autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated systemic disorder that results in inflammation and damage to the small intestine caused by <strong>gluten-containing food</strong> such as <strong>wheat, rye,</strong> and <strong>barley</strong>. Patients with celiac disease typically present with<strong>&#160;chronic diarrhea, growth faltering,&#160;</strong>and <strong>abdominal pain</strong> or <strong>bloating</strong>. <strong>Patients&#160;</strong>may also have extraintestinal <strong>manifestations&#160;</strong>such as <strong>dermatitis herpetiformis</strong> (itchy papulovesicular rash on buttocks, back, scalp and extremities). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>To diagnose celiac disease, <strong>TTG IgA&#160;</strong>and <strong>quantitative IgA levels</strong> should be obtained. If the TTG IgA is positive, and the quantitative IgA is normal, the patient most likely has celiac disease. An <strong>endoscopy&#160;</strong>with biopsies can confirm the diagnosis. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Thyroid panel&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>Thyroid p</span><span>anel</span><span>&#160;is useful&#160;</span><span>for</span><span>&#160;diagnosing</span><span>&#160;hypothyroidism in p</span><span>atients</span><span>&#160;</span><span>with Down&#160;</span><span>syndrome</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>which&#160;</span><span>typically presents with</span><span>&#160;</span><span>poor growth, constipation, and dry skin.

He eats fruits and breastfeeds although the patient&#8217;s mother is unsure of her supply. Parents report that the infant nurses on demand and drinks two cups of juice daily. The infant has adequate wet diapers each day, and two bowel movements daily. Stools are loose but without blood or mucus. There is no history of difficulty feeding, choking, or vomiting. Family history is non-contributory. The Infant was born at full term without complications at birth or during the pregnancy. Newborn screening tests were normal. Development has been appropriate for age. Temperature is 37&#176; C (98.6&#176; F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 25/min, blood pressure is 90/52 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Weight has dropped from the 45<sup>th</sup> percentile to the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile over the last four months. Height and head circumference are at the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile. On physical examination, the patient is well-appearing and in no acute distress. No dysmorphic facial features are noted. &#160;Pulmonary and abdominal exams are normal. A soft 1/6 flow murmur is appreciated at the left sternal border. An erythematous diaper rash is present. Complete blood count is shown below. Thyroid profile, liver and kidney functions are normal.

The patient is a picky eater and drinks more juice than is recommended at 15 months. Although the patient frequently breastfeeds, the mother is unsure of her supply. The patient&#8217;s <strong>microcytic anemia</strong> and associated <strong>flow murmur</strong> support the history of inadequate intake, specifically iron intake. <strong>Inadequate caloric intake</strong> is the most likely etiology of his <strong>poor growth</strong>. <br><br><strong>Growth faltering</strong> refers to the <strong>inability to gain or maintain adequate weight</strong>. The most common cause of growth faltering is inadequate intake, which can be due to insufficient supply or other reasons for inadequate food consumption, such as oral aversion. Inadequate intake in the neonatal period may reflect <strong>improper mixing of formula or difficulties with breastfeeding</strong>. At older ages, <strong>inadequate food supplies and excessive consumption of unbalanced sources of nutrition </strong>most often lead to inadequate intake. <br><br>Reviewing growth parameters on a standardized growth chart is the first step in the evaluation of growth faltering. If the patient&#8217;s <strong>weight-for-age or BMI is more than 2 standard deviations (&lt;5<sup>th</sup> percentile) below the mean</strong> for age or if the <strong>weight-for-age has crossed 2 major percentile lines, growth faltering</strong> is diagnosed. To evaluate growth faltering secondary to inadequate caloric intake, a <strong>dietary assessment</strong> to examine <strong>calorie intake</strong> and <strong>feeding behaviors</strong> should be performed. History may reveal formula dilution, feeding massive quantities of juice or milk, an unbalanced diet that does not provide the necessary macronutrients for optimal growth, or food insecurity and resource instability. The evaluation for inadequate intake should also include assessing for vomiting, behavioral issues, mechanical feeding issues, and psychosocial issues.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Inadequate caloric intake&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased energy expenditure&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Increased energy expenditure&#160;can&#160;result from genetic conditions, immunodeficiencies, hyperthyroidism,&#160;or chronic cardiac, pulmonary, liver, or renal&#160;diseases,&#160;which are not noted in this infant.&#160;This infant&#8217;s heart murmur is an innocent murmur&#160;likely due&#160;to anemia.&#160;In this case, the&#160;limited food&#160;and high&#160;juice intake&#160;have&#160;most&#160;likely&#160;caused&#160;inadequate caloric intake&#160;leading to&#160;growth faltering.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inborn errors of metabolism&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Patients with Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) can present with vomiting, diarrhea, characteristic body odors, growth faltering, and labs showing hypoglycemia, ketonuria, and hyperammonemia, none of which are seen in this patient.

Labs confirm <strong>conjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong>&#160;and&#160;<strong>elevated liver enzymes.</strong>&#160;These findings are consistent with <strong>cholestasis&#160;</strong>which is most often due to <strong>biliary atresia in newborns.&#160;</strong>An&#160;<strong>abdominal ultrasound</strong> is the best next step in evaluation. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>While jaundice is a common and benign physiologic phenomenon in newborns, it is considered <strong>pathologic&#160;</strong>if it progresses rapidly, begins within the first day of life, is extremely high, persists beyond two weeks of age,&#160;or is <strong>associated with cholestasis. Biliary atresia</strong> is the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis. In this condition, there is <strong>progressive biliary obstruction</strong>. Affected neonates typically present around <strong>two to eight weeks of age</strong>&#160;with findings that may include&#160;p<strong>rolonged jaundice, pruritus, dark urine</strong>, and <strong>pale clay-colored stools. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Patients with <strong>jaundice that begins or persists without improvement beyond two weeks&#160;</strong>of life should be further evaluated.&#160;The first step is to determine&#160;if&#160;there is <strong>direct (conjugated) and indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia.&#160;</strong>If there is&#160;<strong>persistent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong> after two weeks of life, it is often due to <strong>breast milk jaundice</strong>, but other causes should be considered, especially if the total bilirubin is high. If labs reveal<strong>&#160;conjugated hyperbilirubinemia &#8805; 1 mg/dL</strong>, an <strong>abdominal ultrasound</strong> should be performed to <strong>assess for cholestasis</strong>. An <strong>absent or atrophic gallbladder</strong> and a<strong>&#160;triangular cord sign</strong> (a triangular echogenic density in the liver hilum) are suggestive of biliary atresia. An <strong>intraoperative cholangiogram</strong> is the gold standard for diagnosing biliary atresia. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai procedure) is the treatment of choice. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Abdominal ultrasound&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reticulocyte count&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect</span><span>:</span></strong><span>&#160;</span><span>Ordering a</span><span>&#160;</span><span>r</span><span>eticulocyte count</span><span>&#160;is useful&#160;</span><span>for</span><span>&#160;assessing the</span><span>&#160;cause&#160;</span><span>of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</span><span>&#160;and&#160;</span><span>d</span><span>etermining</span><span>&#160;if the</span><span>&#160;</span><span>hyperbilirubinemia is</span><span>&#160;due&#160;</span><span>to&#160;</span><span>hemolysis&#160;</span><span>or a</span><span>&#160;</span><span>non-hemolytic process</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;This patient has&#160;</span><span>conjugated&#160;</span><span>hyperbilirubinemia</span><span>,&#160;</span><span>which can be secondary to</span><span>&#160;</span><span>biliary atresia,</span><span>&#160;and a&#160;</span><span>reticulocyte count</span><span>&#160;will not&#160;</span><span>aid</span><span>&#160;in&#160;</span><span>making a</span><span>&#160;diagnosis.</span><span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Peripheral blood smear&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect</span><span>: </span></strong><span>P</span><span>eripheral blood smear</span><span>s</span><span>&#160;</span><span>can&#160;</span><span>confirm&#160;</span><span>red blood cell</span><span>&#160;</span><span>membr</span><span>a</span><span>nopat</span><span>hies</span><span>&#160;</span><span>and</span><span>&#160;enzyme deficiencies</span><span>&#160;such as spherocytosis and&#160;</span><span>glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase</span><span>&#160;(G6PD)</span><span>&#160;deficiency</span><span>;&#160;</span><span>however,</span><span>&#160;patients with these disorders</span><span>&#160;present with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and&#160;</span><span>an&#160;</span><span>elevated reticulocyte count.&#160;</span><span>This patient</span><span>&#160;</span><span>has conjugated hyperbilirubinemia,&#160;</span><span>which may be caused by</span><span>&#160;</span><span>biliary atresia</span><span>,&#160;</span><span>and an</span><span>&#160;abdominal ultrasound</span><span>&#160;s</span><span>hould be ordered next.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Uridine&#160;diphosphate&#160;&#8211;glucuronosyltransferase-1A1&#160;activity&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect</span><span>: </span></strong><span>Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase activity (</span><span>U</span><span>GT)</span><span>&#160;</span><span>is low in</span><span>&#160;Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 which presents within the first&#160;</span><span>few&#160;</span><span>days</span><span>&#160;</span><span>of life&#160;</span><span>with rapidly progressive</span><span>&#160;</span><span>unconjugated</span><span>&#160;hyperbilirubinemia</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>This patient&#160;</span><span>has conjugated hyperbilirubinemia,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>which may be caused by biliary atresia, and an abdominal ultrasound</span><span>&#160;s</span><span>hould be ordered next.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hemoglobin&#160;electrophoresis&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>H</span><span>emoglobin electrophoresis&#160;</span><span>can be used to&#160;</span><span>confirm sickle cell disease&#160;</span><span>and</span><span>&#160;thalassemia which&#160;</span><span>both&#160;</span><span>present with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;However, t</span><span>his patient&#160;</span><span>has conjugated hyperbilirubinemia,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>which may be caused by biliary atresia, and an abdominal ultrasound</span><span>&#160;s</span><span>hould be ordered next.</span>&#160;</span></div>",
