She has a history of two prior cesarean births&#8212;the first for malpresentation and the second was an elective repeat procedure. After extensive counseling, she elects to undergo a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC). An epidural is in place, although she has become more uncomfortable over the past hour. Vital signs are within normal limits, and the most recent cervical exam shows 6 cm dilation, 75% effacement, and 0 station. The fetal heart rate (FHR) tracing shows a baseline rate of 130 bpm, without rapid fluctuations from baseline or visually apparent accelerations. There are recurrent abrupt decreases in FHR of 30 to 60 bpm below baseline that last approximately 30 seconds and begin at the onset of each contraction. Contractions are regular and occur every 2 to 4 minutes. How should this FHR pattern be classified?",

This concerning pattern is associated with fetal acidemia and requires urgent management. <br><br>Intrapartum FHR monitoring detects inadequate fetal oxygenation during labor and enables intervention before fetal acidemia causes permanent injury.

On the other hand, category III is associated with fetal acidemia and necessitates prompt evaluation and intervention. Category III is defined by absent variability with either bradycardia or recurrent late or variable decelerations. A sinusoidal pattern, which appears as a smooth sine wave-like pattern (sometimes described as a &#8220;sawtooth pattern&#8221;) with a cyclic frequency of 3-5 waves per minute, is also considered category III.

The pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has a history of chronic hypertension managed with nifedipine. Labor is progressing spontaneously, and she has an epidural in place. Temperature is 36.7&#176;C (98.1&#176;F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 16/min, blood pressure is 128/92 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. She appears well, and cervical exam reveals 7 cm dilation with 80% effacement, and the fetal vertex is at 0 station. The baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) is 150 bpm with beat-to-beat variability of 10 bpm. There are no accelerations. The patient soon develops recurrent decelerations with each contraction that descend abruptly and become progressively deeper. Contractions are now occurring every 2 to 3 minutes. The nurse repositions the patient and administers an IV fluid bolus with no improvement in the decelerations. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

An <strong>amnioinfusion&#160;</strong>could help relieve pressure on the umbilical cord and is the best next step in managing the patient in this vignette. An amnioinfusion refers to an infusion of sterile saline into the uterine cavity through an intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC), cushioning the umbilical cord. &#160;<br><br>Labor management is guided by the fetal heart rate (FHR) category. Category I tracings are reassuring and can be managed with routine care. On the other hand, category III tracings are abnormal and require prompt resuscitation and delivery if there is an inadequate response. <br><br><strong>Category II</strong> tracings indicate an <strong>indeterminate fetal well-being</strong> and warrant further evaluation. Patients with these tracings should first be assessed for the presence of accelerations and moderate variability, both of which are associated with a normal fetal acid-base status. When these reassuring features are present, intrauterine resuscitation is usually appropriate. This can include repositioning the patient, administering an IV fluid bolus, and, in cases of recurrent variable decelerations, performing an amnioinfusion. Additionally, patients should be assessed for signs of infection, abruption, cord accident, or maternal hypotension and treated accordingly if any are found.<br>&#160; &#160; <node/><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/GOKMuh_-QC2ZlVI1ypndvOUxS46DnaWI/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Amnioinfusion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Supplemental oxygen:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Supplemental oxygen does not improve fetal outcomes and is no longer recommended as part of routine intrauterine resuscitation in patients with a normal oxygen saturation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tocolysis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Tocolysis can be considered for patients not receiving uterotonic agents who develop tachysystole and category II tracings.

A second-degree perineal tear involves injury to the perineal body. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Perineal tears are a common obstetric injury following difficult vaginal childbirth. They are distinct from an episiotomy, an intentional enlargement of the vaginal introitus to facilitate delivery. &#160; <br><br>An episiotomy is a surgical incision that involves the perineum and the posterior vaginal wall during the second stage of labor. Episiotomies are done to minimize perineal injuries caused by overstretching the perineum by the fetal head; however, they are not routinely <strong>indicated</strong>. &#160;Possible indications for an episiotomy include conditions when the physician anticipates a perineal tear, elderly primigravida, macrosomia, face to pubis delivery, forceps/ventouse delivery, breech delivery, or shoulder dystocia. &#160; &#160;<br><br>There are two common <strong>approaches&#160;</strong>to an episiotomy; a mediolateral approach and a median approach. &#160;In a <strong>mediolateral episiotomy,</strong> the incision is made at an angle and proceeds from the vaginal opening diagonally downwards to the left or the right in a straight line that runs an inch away from the anus. &#160;During a mediolateral episiotomy, structures incised include the posterior vaginal wall, superficial and deep transverse perineal muscles, bulbospongiosus, part of the levator ani, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. &#160; <br><br>In the <strong>median episiotomy</strong>, the incision proceeds from the vaginal opening downwards. Median episiotomies bifurcate the perineal body, which supports the female pelvic organs, particularly the posterior vaginal wall. Incision of the perineal body poses a risk of pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence. Midline episiotomies can also extend into the anal sphincter and cause sphincter dysfunction and fecal incontinence. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/uWVZ64HDSceOf5SmIYZBFWjUSv_ARI3k/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/lsAuTeclQO_r3HxUMKV01-nGTomXgFF3/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Perineal body&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Anal mucosa:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Fourth-degree perineal tears involve the anal sphincter complex and the anal mucosa.

This is because the rate of hCG increase slows as the pregnancy progresses and ultimately plateaus around 10 weeks, and normal values can vary widely after FCA is established. Therefore,<strong>&#160;after FCA is identified on ultrasound, FCA is used to follow viability</strong> rather than hCG trends.

This patient has several risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, including previous abdominal surgery and a previous STI. An<strong>&#160;initial hCG level of 2,100 mIU/mL that increases to 2,550 mIU/mL after 48 hours</strong> would be consistent with this diagnosis. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>HCG&#160;</strong>is produced by<strong>&#160;placental trophoblast cells.</strong> In the presence of a <strong>normal pregnancy,</strong> levels should <strong>rise by at least 53% in 48 hours</strong> and double every 48 to 72 hours until reaching a peak at 10 weeks.
