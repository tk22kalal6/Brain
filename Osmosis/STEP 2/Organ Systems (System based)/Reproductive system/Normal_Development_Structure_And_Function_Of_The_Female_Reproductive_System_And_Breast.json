Physical examination is significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness and distension. There is questionable right costovertebral angle tenderness. Digital rectal exam is significant for a boggy enlarged prostate. Laboratory evaluation is significant for a serum creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL, increased from a baseline of 0.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen of 45 mg/dL. White blood count is slightly elevated and urinalysis shows leukocytes and trace blood and is negative nitrates and leukocyte esterase. A foley catheter is placed with minimal urine output.

      "solution": "The clinical findings of <strong>polydipsia&#160;</strong>and <strong>polyuria&#160;</strong>in a patient taking <strong>demeclocycline&#160;</strong>should raise the suspicion of <strong>nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI)</strong>. The inability to raise urine osmolality after a trial of ADH confirms the diagnosis of nephrogenic DI. &#160;<br><br>The first step in the treatment of both central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) is similar. It involves <strong>starting the patient on a low-sodium, low-protein diet&#160;</strong>and <strong>removing any offending agents.</strong> Should conservative measures fail, subsequent interventions will differ depending on which type of DI the patient has. To grasp the treatment rationale, it is important to understand the pathophysiology of each condition. &#160;<br><br>The patient in this question has <strong>nephrogenic DI,</strong> which occurs when the kidney&#8217;s V2 receptors are resistant to ADH. Even when exogenous ADH is administered, there is no increase in water reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the kidney, keeping the urine osmolality low. The next step in treatment involves administering <strong>a thiazide diuretic</strong>. The diuretic creates a hypovolemic state, which paradoxically increases fluid reuptake in the proximal tubules, ultimately reducing the volume of fluid lost in urine. &#160;<br><br>In contrast, <strong>central DI&#160;</strong>occurs when there is inadequate ADH production by the posterior pituitary. In such cases, exogenous ADH administration generally results in a 50% or greater increase in urine osmolality, making desmopressin <strong>(synthetic ADH-analog)</strong> the treatment of choice. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Obtain abdominal CT:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Pathologies such as polycystic kidney disease and renal amyloidosis can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI). However, the patient&#8217;s recent history of demeclocycline use provides a more likely explanation for her symptoms. As a result, an abdominal CT is not indicated at this time.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Initiate hydrochlorothiazide therapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Initiate desmopressin therapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Desmopressin is a synthetic ADH analog used in the treatment of central DI. This patient most likely has nephrogenic DI. Desmopressin is rarely used to treat nephrogenic DI and is indicated only when other treatment options, such as thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretics, have failed.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Encourage restriction of daily fluid consumption:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Fluid restriction may be recommended for patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Individuals with SIADH have low serum osmolality and high urine osmolality. In contrast, this patient has an elevated serum osmolality and reduced urine osmolality, which is consistent with DI. Fluid restriction is not indicated for patients with DI as it may exacerbate their dehydration.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Initiate lithium therapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Lithium is used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and may cause nephrogenic DI as a side-effect.

      "solution": "This patient is experiencing <strong>leg paralysis and proximal arm weakness</strong> in association with<strong>&#160;severe hypokalemia.</strong> Additionally, the patient has had several months of symptoms consistent with <strong>hyperthyroidism&#160;</strong>(e.g. heat intolerance, palpitations, weight loss). The patient has evidence of muscle weakness and thyrotoxicosis on examination. Thus, <strong>thyrotoxic periodic paralysis</strong> is the most likely diagnosis. This would be associated with a <strong>low TSH and elevated T4. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>There are many potential causes of hypokalemia. Often, this can be elicited from the history and presentation (e.g. decreased potassium intake, recent GI illness, diuretic use). If the cause is not obvious, additional workup can be obtained. This should start with obtaining a <strong>serum magnesium</strong> level to rule out hypomagnesemia. From there, patients should be evaluated for potential causes of<strong>&#160;transcellular potassium shifts.</strong> This should include reviewing medications (e.g.<strong>&#160;theophylline, beta agonists, insulin)</strong> and evaluating for conditions like <strong>hyperthyroidism</strong>, which may be accompanied by symptoms (e.g. heat intolerance, palpitations) and a <strong>low TSH. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>Periodic paralysis (PP) is a muscle disease where patients experience episodes of muscle weakness that can last from hours to days. When patients are also hypokalemic during these episodes of muscle weakness and are found to have symptoms and evidence of thyrotoxicosis, then thyrotoxic periodic paralysis can be diagnosed. &#160; <br><br>If these causes are ruled out, the next step is to obtain <strong>urine studies in order to calculate a urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio.</strong> If this ratio is <strong>&#8804; 1.5, extrarenal potassium wasting&#160;</strong>is most etiology, which can be caused by laxative overuse, other causes of severe diarrhea, or excessive sweating. If the ratio is<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>&gt; 1.5, then a condition causing renal potassium wasting i</strong>s likely. In patients with hypertension or evidence of hypervolemia, consider diseases affecting mineralocorticoid activity, such as Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. If no cause is found, the next step is to check the patient&#8217;s acid-base status. Metabolic acidosis is associated with renal tubular acidosis and acetazolamide use. Metabolic alkalosis is associated with Bartter and Gitelman syndrome as well as diuretics. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/raKOVTiZQB_KI-mbD7nYGQbeSLijDsMW/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Low TSH and high T4:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Low magnesium:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Hypomagnesemia can cause hypokalemia.

In addition, chemotherapeutic agents like <strong>cyclophosphamide&#160;</strong>have been shown to induce SIADH. &#160; <br><br>Cyclophosphamide is nitrogen mustard that acts as an alkylating agent. Other nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine and ifosfamide. Cyclophosphamide is indicated in treating solid organ tumors, leukemia, and lymphomas. It is also used to treat rheumatic disorders such as SLE, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and microscopic polyangiitis. Its mechanism of action involves the <strong>creation of cross-links between interstrand guanine bases of DNA, resulting in DNA damage and impairment of replication and repair.&#160;</strong>&#160; Cyclophosphamide is associated with additional adverse effects, including alopecia, GI disturbances, myelosuppression, hemorrhagic cystitis, gonadal toxicity, infertility, and teratogenic effects. &#160; <br><br>Hyponatremia due to SIADH is characterized by low serum osmolality (&lt;275 mOsm/kg H20), high urine osmolality (&gt;100 mOsmol/kg H20) and high urine sodium (&gt;40 mEq/L). Treatment of SIADH includes free water restriction and administration of IV 0.9% normal saline when neurologic symptoms are also present. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/GL7-P5QOSFOrHyOsehh1s3w_Rl2Mmyur/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/wzYzbYpeR0qN7ORw38QJqeo8SxySKbqe/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ZUpZs1j-QHOJKt2UK3x3Wul_T8qZRnYR/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administer lisinopril&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, indicated in the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction.
