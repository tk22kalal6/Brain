The physical examination reveals a <strong>boggy, soft uterus</strong>, which is consistent with the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage due to <strong>uterine atony</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is an <strong>obstetric emergency</strong> and is one of the most common causes of maternal mortality. Postpartum hemorrhage is defined as 500 ml of blood loss following a vaginal delivery, or more than 1000 ml of blood loss after a C-section. The definitive management of PPH depends on the underlying cause. The most common causes of postpartum hemorrhage can be remembered as 4 T&#8217;s - <strong>tone&#160;</strong>(i.e. uterine atony), <strong>trauma&#160;</strong>(i.e. lacerations), <strong>tissue&#160;</strong>(i.e. retained products of conception), and <strong>thrombin&#160;</strong>(i.e. coagulopathy). The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony. Normally, after delivery, the uterus continues to contract, which clamps the spiral arteries and reduces uterine bleeding. Risk factors for uterine atony are factors that cause <strong>overdistention of the uterus</strong> such as multiparity, greater than 4 previous deliveries, previous C-section or uterine surgery, polyhydramnios, large fetus (as seen in this patient), anesthetic drugs, and prolonged labor. The diagnosis of uterine atony is made clinically by demonstrating a boggy, soft and enlarged uterus while excluding other sites of bleeding. Initial management includes <strong>maternal stabilization</strong>, <strong>uterine massage</strong> and <strong>oxytocin&#160;</strong>(1st line); 2nd line agents include methylergonovine and surgical interventions.<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/r6k5x4ALThO69EU7Rp1LQqCYSm2qlZkd/_.png\"></div><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/sS39Vn2dShed_DV6UxxukXAlSem6u-rB/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administer methylergonovine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Methylergonovine is a uterotonic and analgesic used in postpartum hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony to control the bleeding.

The exact cause of eclamptic seizures is not entirely understood, but it is hypothesized to be related to a dysfunctional autoregulatory system of the cerebral circulation which results in vasogenic and/or cytotoxic edema.

One known side effect is the development of <strong>hyponatremia</strong>.<br><br>Oxytocin is a peptide hormone produced by the hypothalamus and stored and released in the posterior pituitary. It stimulates uterine contraction by binding to Gq protein-coupled receptors. Once activated, these receptors activate another molecule called phospholipase C. Phospholipase C cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate. Finally, inositol triphosphate promotes the opening of calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, enhancing calcium release into the cytoplasm, which mediates the contraction of the smooth muscle.<br><br>Exogenous oxytocin administration is indicated for both ante- and postpartum conditions. In the antepartum period, oxytocin is administered to strengthen uterine contractions to induce or facilitate labor. Oxytocin is also administered to treat postpartum hemorrhage as it mediates the contraction of the uterus and subsequent closure of uterine vasculature.<br><br>Side effects of oxytocin include vasodilation, which may result in hypotension and tachycardia. In addition, patients may develop water retention and hyponatremia. This occurs secondary to the ability of oxytocin to act on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the renal tubules, promoting free water retention. Finally, oxytocin can lead to tachysystole (5 or more contractions in 10 minutes over a 30-minute duration).<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/JBACGZa1R5Sr-MBWK2aB118pSz_dAcnc/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Hyponatremia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypernatremia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: When oxytocin is administered excessively or for prolonged periods, it acts similarly to antidiuretic hormone, promoting free water reabsorption and hyponatremia. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypoglycemia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hypoglycemia is not a side effect of oxytocin. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Venous thromboembolism:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Tranexamic acid (TXA) is sometimes used in patients with severe postpartum hemorrhage.

Therefore, <strong>expectant management</strong> and treatment with <strong>Rh immune globulin</strong> to prevent alloimmunization in future pregnancies is the most appropriate management. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The management choice is determined by the type of miscarriage. <strong>Expectant management&#160;</strong>is indicated for <strong>stable patients with threatened or complete miscarriage,</strong> while surgical management is indicated for unstable patients and those with infections. &#160; &#160;<br><br>For stable patients with <strong>asymptomatic (i.e. missed), inevitable, or incomplete pregnancy loss</strong>, all three management strategies (i.e. expectant, medical, and surgical) are appropriate and<strong>&#160;patient preference</strong> should guide the decision. <strong>Medical management</strong> of an early miscarriage involves the use of misoprostol, which induces uterine contractions to expel the products of conception. If available, pre-treatment with mifepristone is recommended because it reduces the risk of retained products of conception. This option allows patients to better control the timing and setting of their miscarriage while avoiding a surgical procedure. A <strong>suction dilation and curettage (D&C)</strong> is considered definitive management with the lowest failure rate and is associated with <strong>lower amounts of bleeding and faster resolution of symptoms.&#160;</strong>Some patients may determine these benefits outweigh the inherent risks of surgery. &#160; <br><br>All patients, including those undergoing expectant management, should be counseled on<strong>&#160;warning signs</strong> that require evaluation. These include heavy bleeding (soaking at least two pads per hour for at least two hours in a row), prolonged bleeding (bleeding persisting beyond two to three weeks), pain uncontrolled with pain medication, fever, or abnormal/foul-smelling discharge. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Additionally, regardless of the management option chosen, <strong>Rh immune globulin</strong> should be administered to all <strong>Rh-negative patients at risk of alloimmunization.</strong> This includes all patients undergoing a procedure during pregnancy (e.g. D&C for early pregnancy loss) and those with uterine bleeding, especially after 7 weeks of gestational age. <strong>Alloimmunization&#160;</strong>refers to the development of antibodies in maternal serum against antigens on fetal red blood cells, which can occur when fetal and maternal blood come into contact with one another. Once alloimmunized, these maternal antibodies may attack any future Rh-positive fetus, resulting in severe fetal anemia and/or pregnancy loss. In the U.S., Rh immune globulin is usually given routinely to any Rh-negative patient who experiences bleeding during pregnancy. However, it should be noted that international guidelines regarding the use of Rh immune globulin in the first trimester vary. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/TqnedFjbTam3Zsep7tAVZMNWT-KYcmAz/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Rh-immune globulin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Blood transfusion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient is hemodynamically stable and her bleeding has slowed, so a blood transfusion is not needed at this time.
