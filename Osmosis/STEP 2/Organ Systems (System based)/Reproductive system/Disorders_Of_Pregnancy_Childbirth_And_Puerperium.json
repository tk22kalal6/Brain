Medication options for this route include fentanyl, morphine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, or remifentanil. These various <strong>opioids&#160;</strong>are similar in effectiveness. An additional benefit of opioid analgesia is the low cost. Systemic opioids can also offer quick relief compared to an epidural, which takes time to place and take effect. However, the effectiveness of systemic opioids is limited, as they do not take away all labor pain completely and wear off after a couple of hours. &#160;<br><br>Systemic opioid analgesia is generally safe. The major maternal side effects are nausea and vomiting, but they can also cause <strong>respiratory depression</strong>. There are several instances where opioids should be avoided in labor. Opioids cross the placenta, and therefore, they should be avoided in patients who are close to delivery (i.e.,10 cm dilated). This is because they can cause <strong>newborn respiratory depression</strong> if administered <strong>close to delivery</strong>. Another instance to avoid systemic opioid analgesia is in patients taking opioid agonist-antagonist medications as they can <strong>precipitate acute withdrawal</strong>.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cervical dilation of 10 cm:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;</span><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ History of obstructive sleep apnea:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong>:</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Obstructive sleep apnea is a risk factor for anesthesia complications</span><span>&#160;if general anesthesia is needed</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;but it can be given with close monitoring</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>However, t</span><span>his</span><span>&#160;patient has cervical&#160;</span><span>dilatation</span><span>&#160;of&#160;</span><span>10 cm</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>and</span><span>&#160;parental analgesia&#160;</span><span>should</span><span>&#160;not be&#160;</span><span>given</span><span>&#160;t</span><span>his&#160;</span><span>close</span><span>&#160;to delivery&#160;</span><span>due to the risk of fetal respiratory depression.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Fetal heart rate accelerations:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Fetal heart rate accelerations are reassuring signs reflecting normal fetal acid-base status.

Of note, it can also be used during repair of vaginal lacerations after delivery. &#160; &#160; &#160;Pharmacological pain management options in labor include systemic opiate analgesia, nitrous oxide, regional anesthesia such as epidural or spinal/intrathecal analgesia, and local anesthesia such as a pudendal block.

Medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The patient has irregular menstrual cycles and had trouble with conception. Temperature is 36.9&#176;C (98.4&#176;F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 104/70 mmHg. On examination, the abdomen is non-tender to palpation, and the uterine fundus is palpable higher than expected for gestational age. The fetal heart rate (FHR) is detected in the 130s/min in the right lower quadrant and in the 170s/min in the left lower quadrant. Which of the following medications, if used at the time of conception, would increase the likelihood for the condition explaining the fetal heart rate findings?",

Her primary care physician suspected Rocky Mountain spotted fever and prescribed an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by blocking peptidyltransferase at the 50S ribosomal subunit. The patient was not aware that she was pregnant at that time. The last menstrual period was approximately 15 weeks ago. She is concerned about the potential side effects on her baby.

Chloramphenicol is effective against some<strong><em>&#160;Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides species, and Rickettsia species</em></strong>.

Varicocele is defined as<strong>&#160;dilation of the pampiniform plexus</strong>, which is the venous drainage network of the testes.<br><br>Left-sided varicocele is more common due to drainage of the left gonadal vein into the left renal vein at a perpendicular angle. The effect is compounded by the compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery <strong>(nutcracker effect)</strong>, increasing the intravascular pressure in the left gonadal vein and the dilation of the pampiniform plexus. A right-sided varicocele should always raise suspicion for retroperitoneal pathology (e.g. renal cell carcinoma), especially if it is non-diminishing on recumbent position.<br><br>Affected patients may be asymptomatic, but they can present with soft, unilateral scrotal mass that does not transilluminate, dull-aching scrotal pain, and/or infertility. A bag-of-worms-like appearance is seen on scrotal examination.<br><br>In contrast, a <strong>hydrocele</strong> is thought to result from an imbalance of fluid secretion and reabsorption in the tunica vaginalis, leading to fluid accumulation around the testes and spermatic cord.

Finasteride <strong>inhibits the conversion of testosterone to DHT by blocking</strong> the action of enzyme <strong>5-alpha reductase</strong>, leading to decreased growth and, ultimately, shrinkage of the prostate gland, thereby reducing the blockage on the urethra. However, these effects usually take months to develop; therefore, finasteride's effects will only be seen after continuous use for a long period. Finasteride can also be used in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia.<br><br>Side effects of finasteride are common and include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and gynecomastia.

Among the answer choices, <strong>continuous leuprolide therapy</strong> would be most effective in achieving this effect.<br><br>Leuprolide is a <strong>GnRH agonist</strong> that can be administered in either a continuous or pulsatile pattern. When given in a <strong>constant pattern</strong>, the medication can cause down regulation of GnRH receptors in the pituitary. These changes lead to decreased secretion of FSH, LH, and sex hormones (e.g., testosterone and estrogen). As a result, continuous administration can help treat <strong>endometriosis, uterine fibroids, prostate cancer, </strong>and <strong>precocious puberty</strong>. Leuprolide is typically given preoperatively for 3-months to reduce the size of uterine fibroids before surgical resection. Furthermore, continuous leuprolide can be used <strong><em>in vitro</em> fertilization</strong> techniques to prevent premature ovulation.<br><br>On the other hand, <strong>pulsatile therapy</strong> of leuprolide mimics the physiological secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus. In other words, the drug binds and activates GnRH receptors, thereby increasing the downstream synthesis of LH, FSH, and sex hormones. This administration method was historically used to induce ovulation and treat <strong>infertility </strong>but is rarely used today due to the availability of better alternatives (e.g. clomiphene). &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Estrogen-progesterone combined oral contraceptive therapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Combined oral contraceptives can be used to treat menorrhagia secondary to uterine fibroids.

If a GnRH agonist is given in a continuous pattern, it downregulates GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, reducing FSH, LH, and sex hormone secretion. These changes can cause fibroids to shrink. In contrast, a GnRH agonist given in a pulsatile pattern increases FSH and LH secretion, leading to fibroid enlargement. &#160;</span></div>",

The pelvic ultrasound findings of a <strong>myometrial cyst, heterogeneous myometrium,&#160;</strong>and <strong>asymmetric myometrial thickness&#160;</strong>supports the diagnosis of adenomyosis.

Varying amounts in different areas create the asymmetric thickness, while the cysts represent dilated endometrial glands.

The pituitary can secrete FSH, but the ovaries cannot respond to or secrete E2 (E2 is low). Therefore, there is no negative feedback on the pituitary, causing FSH levels to rise. Ultimately, this results in a <strong>high FSH (&gt; 20 IU/L)&#160;</strong>with <strong>low E2</strong>.<br><br><strong>Low estrogen</strong> levels can cause <strong>vasomotor symptoms</strong>, such as hot flashes, and <strong>vaginal dryness</strong> that can contribute to <strong>dyspareunia&#160;</strong>(ie, painful sex). Over time, a hypoestrogenic state can lead to loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Additional findings on history and exam can also suggest a cause of POI. For example, a history of chemo- or radiation therapy, stigmata of Turner syndrome, and a family history of Fragile X syndrome (an X-linked disorder that can cause intellectual disability is strongly associated with POI). These patients require hormone replacement therapy, BMD monitoring, and psychological support. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Ovarian insufficiency:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypothalamic suppression:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hypothalamic suppression is characterized by low or normal FSH and low E2.

The most likely diagnosis is<strong>&#160;adnexal torsion</strong> and a recent history of an <strong>inciting event</strong>, like<strong>&#160;vigorous exercise</strong> or anything that would<strong>&#160;increase intraabdominal pressure</strong> (e.g. <strong>weight lifting</strong>), would be consistent with this diagnosis. &#160;<br><br><strong>Adnexal torsion</strong> refers to twisting of the ovary and fallopian tube, either completely or partially, leading to obstruction of blood supply. Adnexal torsion can lead to significant compression of the ovarian blood supply. It first causes venous obstruction and then can cause arterial obstruction and necrosis of the ovary. As such, adnexal torsion is a<strong>&#160;surgical emergency</strong> and treatment is necessary to preserve ovarian and tubal functioning and prevent infertility. The main<strong>&#160;risk factors for adnexal torsion&#160;</strong>are <strong>ovarian masses</strong> and <strong>prior adnexal torsion</strong>. The most common predisposing factors are ovarian cysts or benign neoplasms, with most being related to the reproductive cycle. Masses in the ovaries increase the risk of rotation. Patients may have a recent history of <strong>vigorous activity</strong> or<strong>&#160;increased abdominal pressure</strong> that may lead to torsion. &#160;<br><br>Patients with adnexal torsion generally present with<strong>&#160;sudden onset abdominal or pelvic pain</strong>, which is typically <strong>intermittent but can be constant if there is torsion and detorsion</strong> of the ovary. Fever may be present. Patients often have nausea and vomiting. On physical examination, patients will have <strong>abdominal or pelvic tenderness to palpation</strong> and may have features consistent with an acute abdomen, including <strong>guarding&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;rebound tenderness</strong> depending upon the severity. A<strong>&#160;pelvic mass</strong> may potentially be palpated.

Endometriosis refers to the presence of endometrial tissue implanted <strong>outside </strong>of the endometrial cavity. While patients are typically diagnosed clinically and started on treatment, the <strong>gold standard</strong> for diagnosing endometriosis is <strong>diagnostic laparoscopy</strong>, which allows the surgeon to directly visualize any ectopic endometrial tissue and obtain biopsy samples that can confirm the diagnosis histologically. <br><br>If a focused history and physical exam suggest endometriosis, the first step is to obtain a <strong>pelvic ultrasound</strong>, which can provide evidence to <strong>support </strong>the diagnosis, such as an <strong>endometrioma </strong>(a homogenous ovarian cyst with internal echos) or evidence of <strong>deeply infiltrating endometriosis</strong> (e.g. nodules on the uterosacral ligaments). However, the ultrasound is normal in the majority of patients with endometriosis. The primary purpose of the ultrasound is to <strong>rule out alternative structural causes</strong> of the patient&#8217;s symptoms, such as fibroids or adenomyosis. Beyond the ultrasound, patients with risk factors for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can cause pelvic inflammatory disease should be screened appropriately. This is typically enough of a work-up to <strong>clinically diagnose</strong> endometriosis and <strong>initiate medical treatment</strong> with <strong>hormonal contraceptives</strong>. If the patient desires <strong>immediate pregnancy</strong>, laparoscopy can be considered to confirm the diagnosis and treat any visible disease. In patients who do not desire immediate pregnancy, <strong>laparoscopy </strong>is reserved for patients who <strong>do not respond</strong> to medical management.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Laparoscopy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: With the exception of endometriomas, most endometriosis lesions are not visible on imaging.

Two criteria must be present to diagnose PCOS once alternative causes have been ruled out. Other causes of ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism must be ruled out, which is done primarily with serum laboratory testing. Laboratory results consistent with PCOS include <strong>elevated free total testosterone (FTT),</strong> normal 17-OHP, normal or mildly elevated DHEAS, and a<strong>&#160;cycle day 3 (CD3) FSH that is normal&#160;</strong>with an<strong>&#160;LH:FSH ratio that is typically greater than 2;</strong> this is consistent with <strong>answer A.</strong> Additionally, if ovulation does not occur, which is common in PCOS, CD21 progesterone will be low. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Evaluation for suspected PCOS consists of comprehensive history and physical, <strong>pelvic ultrasound, urine pregnancy test,&#160;</strong>and serum laboratory testing. This serum testing should include free total testosterone <strong>(FTT), 17-OHP,</strong> and <strong>DHEAS</strong>; this, in addition to confirming biochemical hyperandrogenism, can identify alternative causes of hyperandrogenism, such as non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) and androgen-secreting tumors. A <strong>CD3 FSH, LH, estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin&#160;</strong>should also be ordered to rule out alternative causes of oligo- or amenorrhea, which includes functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (with potentially low FSH, LH, and estradiol), primary ovarian insufficiency (with elevated FSH, LH, and estradiol), hyperprolactinemia, and thyroid disorders. A CD21 progesterone can provide additional information about ovulatory function; however, due to the inconvenience of testing and a high rate of indeterminate results, this test is often omitted. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Test result patterns expected for potential alternative diagnoses are detailed in the table below. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/G2fDuth5Tle7pQXNVDoSE-VzT-SyGehK/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;Cycle day 3 follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#160; &#160; &#160;Free total testosterone (FTT)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;17-hydroxy- progesterone (17-OHP)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Dehydroepi- androsterone sulfate (DHEAS)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Cycle day 21 progesterone (CD21P)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8595;&#160; &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong>&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Cycle day 3 follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#160; &#160; &#160;Free total testosterone (FTT)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;17-hydroxy- progesterone (17-OHP)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Dehydroepi- androsterone sulfate (DHEAS)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Cycle day 21 progesterone (CD21P)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#8593; &#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8595;&#160; &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>The elevated 17-OHP seen in these results suggests non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency as the cause of hyperandrogenemia, which is much less common but often clinically identical to PCOS.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Cycle day 3 follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Free total testosterone (FTT)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;17-hydroxy- progesterone (17-OHP)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Dehydroepi- androsterone sulfate (DHEAS)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Cycle day 21 progesterone (CD21P)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#8593;&#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;&#8595;&#160; &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:<strong>&#160;</strong>The&#160;most likely diagnosis&#160;in a patient with oligomenorrhea, male pattern hair growth, and&#160;numerous&#160;antral follicles is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); however, a severely elevated DHEAS suggests an androgen-secreting tumor of the ovary or adrenal gland instead of PCOS.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Cycle day 3 follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Free total testosterone (FTT)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;17-hydroxy- progesterone (17-OHP)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Dehydroepi- androsterone sulfate (DHEAS)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Cycle day 21 progesterone (CD21P)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160; &#160;&#160;Normal&#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160; &#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8595;&#160; &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>The&#160;</span><span>most likely diagnosis</span><span>&#160;in a patient with oligomenorrhea, male pattern hair growth, and&#160;</span><span>numerous</span><span>&#160;antral follicles is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); however, an elevated cycle day 3 FSH in the setting of low estrogen is seen in patients with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI).</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Cycle day 3 follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Free total testosterone (FTT)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;17-hydroxy- progesterone (17-OHP)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Dehydroepi- androsterone sulfate (DHEAS)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Cycle day 21 progesterone (CD21P)&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;Normal&#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;Normal&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160; &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>The&#160;</span><span>most likely diagnosis</span><span>&#160;in a patient with oligomenorrhea, male pattern hair growth, and&#160;</span><span>numerous</span><span>&#160;antral follicles is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

She most likely has <strong>uterine fibroids. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>The uterus is a pelvic organ. Its upper two-thirds are formed by the uterine body and fundus while its lower one-third is formed by the cervix. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The ligamentous attachments of the uterus include the broad ligaments, uterosacral ligaments, and round ligaments. The <strong>broad ligament</strong> is a fold of the peritoneum which attaches the lateral margin of the uterus on either side to the pelvic wall. The <strong>mesovarium&#160;</strong>is the portion of the broad ligament that suspends the ovaries. The broad ligament also extends from the superior pole of the ovary and the infundibulum of the fallopian tube to the lateral pelvic wall. This fold of the peritoneum is called the <strong>infundibulopelvic ligament</strong> of the ovary and contains the ovarian vessels. &#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Radical hysterectomy&#160;</strong>involves the removal of the uterus along with its ligamentous attachments (broad ligament, round, cardinal, and uterosacral ligaments), the cervix, the upper one-third of the vagina, and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Indications for radical hysterectomy include advanced cervical and endometrial cancers. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Total and subtotal hysterectomies&#160;</strong>differ based on the decision to retain or remove the cervix. In a total hysterectomy, the uterus and the cervix are removed. In contrast, a partial or a subtotal hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus alone without removing the cervix. &#160; <br><br>The only contraindication to a subtotal hysterectomy is a malignancy involving the cervix, which would necessitate its removal. Since both methods have similar outcomes, they manage multiple benign gynecological conditions, including uterine fibroids. &#160; <br><strong><br>Removal of adnexa (ovaries)</strong> may be indicated or elective. If the ovaries are to be removed, the broad ligament incision in a hysterectomy is extended to involve the infundibulopelvic ligament to remove the ovaries following ligation of the ovarian vessels.<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/fej0yCgUSpmxlV98RTlyk8K9RA6XnwAf/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Broad ligament&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Infundibulopelvic ligament&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The infundibulopelvic ligament extends from the superior pole of the ovary and the infundibulum of the fallopian tube to the lateral pelvic wall.

She most likely has a ureteral injury due to her recent abdominal hysterectomy. &#160;The uterine and ovarian arteries provide blood supply to the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Hysterectomies require ligation of the uterine artery in the broad ligament. Conditions like malignant ovarian tumors may require the ligation of the ovarian arteries in the infundibulopelvic ligament. The course of the ureter in the female pelvis is close to the uterine and ovarian vessels. Ligation of the uterine or ovarian vessels poses the risk of accidental ligation of the ureter. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The ureter lies anterior to the internal iliac artery and then continues posteriorly to the ovary in the ovarian fossa along with the uterine vessels. At this point, the ureter is at risk of injury during an oophorectomy and should be appropriately identified before ligation of the ovarian vessels. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The ureter then descends, crossing the ischial spine until it lies in the inferomedial portion of the broad ligament. In the broad ligament, the uterine artery is anterosuperior to the ureter (&#8220;=the bridge&#8221;) until it crosses the ureter in the lateral portion of the broad ligament. During a hysterectomy, the uterine artery is identified at the junction of the lower uterine segment and the cervix and ligated at the lateral border of the uterus.

Adenomyosis is caused by the implantation of <strong>endometrial glands within myometrial tissue</strong>, resulting in significant pain and bleeding during regular menses. The uterus may be mildly <strong>tender&#160;</strong>even outside of menses, which can lead to <strong>chronic pelvic pain</strong> and/or <strong>dyspareunia&#160;</strong>in some patients. Risk factors for adenomyosis include a history of uterine surgery, shorter menstrual cycles (&#8804; 25 days), and early menarche. On exam, the uterus may be <strong>globally enlarged&#160;</strong>and is often described as <strong>globular&#160;</strong>or <strong>boggy&#160;</strong>(i.e., the uterus feels squishy). Because there are no large masses, the uterus retains a <strong>smooth contour</strong> on exam. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Pelvic ultrasound&#160;</strong>should be performed in patients who present with HMB.

Most complex masses in postmenopausal patients require surgical excision. However, the recommended procedure is different for benign and malignant masses.

On exam, the uterus was <strong>enlarged&#160;</strong>and had a <strong>smooth contour.</strong> The patient in the vignette lacks risk factors for endometrial malignancy and has no additional symptoms to suggest an endocrine cause of her irregular bleeding (such as thyroid disease or polycystic ovary syndrome). Therefore, of the choices offered, <strong>adenomyosis&#160;</strong>is the most likely diagnosis. &#160;<strong>Adenomyosis&#160;</strong>refers to the implantation of endometrial glands within the myometrium which can lead to HMB, dysmenorrhea, and global uterine enlargement. The diagnosis is further suggested on ultrasound by a <strong>heterogeneous thickened myometrium</strong> with<strong>&#160;myometrial cysts</strong>; the <strong>posterior&#160;</strong>wall is often thicker than the anterior wall. &#160;Echogenic subendometrial<strong>&#160;lines radiating into the myometrium</strong> and an<strong> irregular endometrial-myometrial junctional zone</strong> are also relatively specific findings. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Uterine leiomyoma, or fibroid, is the other common cause of HMB and pelvic pain symptoms and can be difficult to differentiate from adenomyosis based on history and exam findings alone. While a subserosal fundal fibroid would have an irregular contour on exam, multiple smaller fibroids or larger submucosal fibroids could have exam findings like those in the vignette. Therefore, an ultrasound is recommended to confirm the underlying cause of HMB.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Heterogenous, thickened myometrium with myometrial cysts:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct: </strong></span><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Thickened endometrium:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>A thickened endometrium can be seen with endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, or malignancy.

She most likely has stress urinary incontinence secondary to <strong>pelvic organ prolapse</strong>. This condition results in the herniation of pelvic organs, including the bladder, rectum, or uterus, into the vaginal canal. Symptoms include a sensation of a mass in the perineum, urinary symptoms (stress incontinence, difficulty voiding, and retention), and bowel dysfunction (constipation or fecal incontinence). The perineal body is often implicated in pelvic organ prolapse. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>The perineal body</strong> is a fibromuscular node formed from the convergence of muscles of the perineum, including the levator ani, bulbospongiosus, superficial and deep transverse perinei, external anal sphincter, and the longitudinal muscle coat of the anal canal. It is located centrally in the perineum between the lower part of the vagina and the anal canal. It may be damaged during labor and delivery or abdominal surgeries such as hysterectomy. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Specific risk factors that lead to perineal injury during childbirth include <strong>nulliparity, macrosomia (weight &gt;3kg), shoulder dystocia, instrumental delivery, and precipitate labor.&#160;</strong>The perineal body remains important for supporting female pelvic organs, specifically the posterior wall of the vagina. A complication that arises from inadequate repairs of perineal body injury (second-degree perineal tears) is pelvic organ prolapse and urinary stress incontinence. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Treatment of pelvic organ prolapse includes weight loss, kegel&#8217;s exercises, and placement of a vaginal pessary or surgery.<strong>&#160;Kegel exercises</strong> refer to pelvic exercises that strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/H0fuPBBCTWGyxx3aqy0jhxaeSFma4vpY/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Perineal body &#160; &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Obturator nerve &#160; &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Obturator neuralgia usually occurs secondary to pelvic surgery, trauma, or tumors and presents with weakness in hip adduction and sensory loss over the medial aspect of the thigh.

This class of medication is an essential component of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).<br><br>NRTIs are prodrugs converted by host cell kinases to triphosphates. They <strong>inhibit nucleotide-binding from reversing transcriptase</strong> and <strong>terminating DNA chain elongation</strong>, given the NRTI molecules lack a 3&#8242;-OH group.

Examples of NRTIs include <strong>zidovudine</strong>, stavudine, <strong>lamivudine</strong>, didanosine, abacavir, and tenofovir. <br><br>Apart from being used in HAART, NRTIs can also be used in children born to mothers infected by HIV to reduce the risk of vertical transmission.

A key clinical finding that may differentiate epididymitis from other causes of testicular pain, is the <strong>Prehn sign</strong>, which refers to <strong>relief of pain upon elevation of the involved scrotum. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Epididymitis with urethritis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: See&#160;</strong>Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Testicular torsion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Testicular torsion is a urological emergency caused by the spermatic cord twisting with subsequent loss of blood flow to the testicle. It presents with sudden, severe testicular pain and swelling. Testicular torsion does not cause dysuria. A key clinical distinction between testicular torsion and epididymitis is that lifting the testicle does not relieve pain (Prehn sign) in testicular torsion. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cystitis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Cystitis refers to inflammation of the bladder, often caused by a urinary tract infection.

It is the <strong>most common cause</strong> of <strong>abnormal vaginal discharge</strong>. Patients typically report a thin watery discharge with an unpleasant odor, and the physical exam is positive for a thin gray-white vaginal discharge with a &#8220;<strong>fishy</strong>&#8221; odor. Diagnosis is made by meeting the <strong>Amsel criteria</strong>, which include: <br>&#160;<ol><li>&#160;<strong>Thin gray-white</strong> vaginal discharge on physical exam&#160;</li><li>&#160;Microscopy revealing <strong>more than 20% clue cells</strong> (epithelial cells covered in bacteria) &#160;</li><li>&#160;Vaginal fluid <strong>pH greater than 4.5</strong>&#160;</li><li>&#160;<strong>Positive KOH whiff</strong> test (i.e. smelling amine odor when KOH is dropped on vaginal discharge). &#160;</li></ol>If 3 out of the 4 criteria are met, then the patient can be diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis. This patient has 4 out of the 4 criteria needed for diagnosis. First line treatment is oral or vaginal metronidazole.
