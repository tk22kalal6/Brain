Together, these findings are consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, which must be treated emergently with <strong>surgical debridement</strong> of devitalized tissue.<br><br>Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but serious infection of deep soft tissues that results in rapid, progressive <strong>destruction of muscle fascia&#160;</strong>and overlying subcutaneous fat. Typically, bacteria (usually <strong>anaerobes</strong> or<strong><em>&#160;Streptococcus pyogenes</em></strong>) with appropriate toxin-carrying capabilities enter through broken skin and spread along the myofascial plane.

Therefore, prompt recognition and treatment are paramount. Clues to the diagnosis include <strong>pain out of proportion to physical exam findings</strong>, erythema without sharp margins, as well as skin bullae and necrosis.

Erythematous plaques covered by <strong>silvery-white scales</strong> are classic for psoriasis and are typically found on<strong>&#160;extensor surfaces.&#160;</strong>The rash is usually <strong>worse in the winter</strong> and better in the summer and may be associated with painful inflammation of the joints leading to sausage-shaped swelling of the fingers and toes, known as <strong>dactylitis</strong>. Removal of scales from a psoriatic plaque will often cause pin-point bleeding (Auspitz sign). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>The <strong>diagnostic workup of common skin rashes</strong> can be approached by first determining which of three main categories of rashes is present: <strong>cutaneous adverse medication reaction, infectious etiology, or inflammatory/autoimmune etiology.</strong> Features such as recent medication exposures, risk factors for infection, rash appearance, and associated features help narrow the differential. In this case, a<strong>&#160;localized rash,</strong> not associated with recent medication use, rules out cutaneous adverse medication rash. The absence of features suggestive of folliculitis (pustules over hair follicles, recent sweating or hot tub use), scabies (severe itching, worse at night, with serpiginous burrows and papules), shingles (vesicles in a dermatomal pattern with local hyperalgesia), tinea corporis (annular/ovoid itchy patches with a scaly edge and possible central clearing) and the lack of classic features of other common skin infections such as Lyme disease make an infectious cause unlikely. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>When adverse medication rash and infectious etiology have been ruled out, an <strong>inflammatory/autoimmune&#160;</strong>cause should be considered. Classic diagnostic features of conditions such as atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, rosacea, and psoriasis should be looked for, as the diagnosis of these conditions is primarily clinical.
