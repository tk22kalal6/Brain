The history of asthma and eczema favors an inflammatory/autoimmune process (atopic dermatitis), while his participation in wrestling increases his chance of having a fungal infection. &#160;Given the lack of a clear clinical picture, the best next step is to perform a <strong>potassium hydroxide (KOH)</strong>&#160;<strong>test&#160;</strong>on a skin scraping to confirm whether fungal elements are present. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Skin rashes can present a diagnostic challenge given the large differential and the variable and overlapping presenting features of different skin rashes. A helpful initial approach is to first consider whether the rash could be <strong>caused by medication</strong>. If no recent medications were used, a careful history and physical examination can help determine whether an <strong>infectious&#160;</strong>or an <strong>inflammatory/autoimmune etiology&#160;</strong>is more likely. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Often, a <strong>diagnosis can be made clinically&#160;</strong>with common skin rashes. However, laboratory testing and, if necessary, a skin biopsy can help in cases of atypical, severe, or overlapping conditions. <strong>Tinea corporis and nummular eczema</strong> are two conditions that can present with overlapping features on physical examination. A classic history of <strong>eczema</strong>, or <strong>atopic dermatitis,&#160;</strong>includes the<strong>&#160;&#8220;atopic triad&#8221; of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma.</strong> Patients with itchy, dry, erythematous patches on flexor surfaces, with these historic features can be diagnosed with eczema (atopic dermatitis). If the classic atopic history is absent, and itchy, raised, erythematous rings are present in a patient with <strong>frequent skin-to-skin contact with others,</strong> or with <strong>close contact with an infected individual,&#160;</strong>then<strong>&#160;tinea corporis&#160;</strong>can be diagnosed clinically. When the clinical picture is unclear, further testing with a KOH test can determine if fungal elements are present to guide treatment. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Potassium hydroxide test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing&#160;</span><span>of vesicular fluid&#160;</span><span>is commonly used to&#160;</span><span>confirm herpes zoster (shingles) by&#160;</span><span>testing for</span><span>&#160;the varicella-zoster virus.
