Additional measures that may decrease the risk of falls include removing loose rugs, using non-slip mats, and ensuring proper lighting in the home. <br><br>Providers should regularly ask older patients about recent falls and fall risks because of the high incidence and potential for fracture and hospitalization. All patients who have fallen or who have limited mobility that increases their risk for falls should be asked about contributing factors, such as polypharmacy and unsafe home environments.

Startling to loud sounds is considered a part of the <strong>language development</strong> of an infant, and also provides information about <strong>hearing status</strong>.<br><br>The <strong>developmental milestone assessment</strong> of an infant begins with a thorough history and physical examination. History-taking should begin with the <strong>birth history</strong>, including gestational age and birth weight, as well as whether there is a <strong>family history</strong> of developmental delays. Caregivers should be asked to provide details about what new skills their baby has learned since the last clinic visit, as well as whether they have any <strong>concerns&#160;</strong>about the child&#8217;s development. Important aspects to include in the history of a <strong>one-month-old infant</strong> include how the child is feeding and moving, and whether the infant <strong>responds to loud noises</strong> and can <strong>focus on an object</strong> placed a few inches from his or her face. If any of these areas are not met, or the child is not feeding well and <strong>gaining weight</strong> appropriately, it would be considered a <strong>red flag</strong>.<br><br>Typical physical examination findings for a one-month-old include <strong>lifting the head off of the exam table</strong> when placed prone, <strong>moving both arms and legs equally</strong>, and keeping the <strong>hands fisted and near the face</strong> most of the time. Young infants have a &#8220;startle&#8221; reflex known as the <strong>Moro reflex</strong>, where sudden movements, loud sounds, or a dropping feeling cause the baby to throw back his or her head, extend out the arms and legs, cry, and then pull the arms and legs back in (image below). Another important aspect to consider during an infant assessment, especially for very young infants, is to take note of any <strong>caregiver indifference</strong>, meaning a caregiver who is not responsive to their infant. Caregiver indifference is a <strong>red flag</strong> and should be investigated further. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/00TtcUd-TR23tgJVH5hoN_pRQ3qn9k70/_.png\"></div><br><sup><strong>&#160;Moro Reflex by tawamie is licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 DEED Reproduced from WikimediaCommons&#160;</strong>&#160;</sup><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ No response to loud sounds:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Moro reflex is present:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The Moro or &#8220;startle&#8221; reflex is present from birth until around 2-6 months of age. &#160;It would not be concerning for a one-month-old to still have a Moro reflex. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Holds fisted hands near the face most of the time:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Holding fisted hands near the face most of the time is expected for a one-month-old. &#160;This will typically decrease to about 50% of the time by two months old and further decrease after that. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inability to lift chest in tummy time:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A one-month-old is expected to be able to lift their head during tummy time, but an infant typically cannot lift the chest until two months of age. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inability to focus on an object three feet away:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A one-month-old infant should be able to focus on an object placed a few inches from his or her face. &#160;Infants begin to track objects and focus on objects further away after two months of age. &#160;</span></div>",

Regular phlebotomy</strong> is the mainstay of treatment for patients with primary hemochromatosis without heart failure or end-stage liver disease. The frequency of the phlebotomy is tailored to the iron profile. The target ferritin level is <strong>&lt; 300 &#956;g/L.&#160;</strong>Importantly, <strong>hemoglobin levels&#160;</strong>should be checked before each phlebotomy session with a target hemoglobin level of 12-13 g/dl. For patients with primary hemochromatosis who have a &#160;contraindication to phlebotomy (e.g., anemia, heart failure, poor venous access) or in cases where phlebotomy has been inadequate, chelating agents like deferasirox can be used. &#160; <br><br>An alternative treatment option to phlebotomy is <strong>erythrocytapheresis</strong>, which involves the selective removal of red blood cells without removing blood components, such as proteins and thrombocytes. Erythrocytapheresis should be considered in patients with thrombocytopenia or hypoproteinemia. In patients with <strong>end-stage liver failure,&#160;</strong>surgery should be consulted to evaluate for <strong>liver transplantation.</strong> In addition to phlebotomy, patients should be counseled on lifestyle modifications including avoidance of alcohol which can increase the risk of cirrhosis in an already susceptible liver, and avoidance of iron and vitamin C supplements. Genetic screening and counseling should be offered to all first-degree relatives of patients with primary hemochromatosis. &#160; <br><br>Patients with hemochromatosis have an increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and should have a thorough liver assessment. If liver fibrosis is indicated by persistently elevated liver function tests, or if the serum ferritin levels are greater than 1000 nanograms per milliliter, abdominal ultrasound with elastography, an MRI of the liver, or liver biopsy should be performed to determine the presence and degree of fibrosis, and to predict progression to cirrhosis. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Phlebotomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Dexrazoxane:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Dexrazoxane is an iron-chelating agent used to lessen the iron-mediated oxidative effect of doxorubicin (i.e., a chemotherapeutic agent) on cardiac muscle.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Desferasirox:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Deferasirox is an iron chelating agent used in patients with primary hemochromatosis when regular phlebotomy is contraindicated or inadequate (e.g., anemia, heart failure, poor venous access).</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Liver transplantation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: &#160;</strong>Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with end-stage liver disease.

      "solution": "This boy, who is coming in for a routine evaluation, likely has <strong>cystic fibrosis</strong> (CF). Previously considered lethal in infancy and early adolescence, patients with CF can now survive to a median age of 50 years. This improvement is mainly due to early diagnosis through neonatal screening, routine evaluation, and improved pharmacotherapies. &#160;<br><br><strong>Pulmonary function tests&#160;</strong>(PFTs) can be used to track CF progression. PFTs are used to determine the severity of pulmonary exacerbations as well as disease progression. Pulmonary exacerbations present with increased sputum production, chronic cough, and lung function decline noted by pulmonary function testing. &#160; <br><br>Additionally, <strong>chest x-rays</strong> (CXRs) are a common diagnostic tool to follow disease progression. CXRs are extremely useful for diagnosing chronic infection as well as preventing and managing pulmonary exacerbations. In patients with early disease, CXRs may show hyperinflation. As the disease progresses, <strong>bronchiectasis, air trapping</strong>, and <strong>hyperinflation&#160;</strong>become more prominent on radiographs.<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/5oVjC4GgQoqeBqxIAJUwT7sTQhKAgxHE/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Chest x-ray:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Echocardiogram:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Routine echocardiogram would be useful in patients with congenital heart defects.
