She also has <strong>caf&#233;-au-lait</strong>&#160;<strong>skin lesions</strong> and X-ray findings consistent with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia of bone. She is found to have <strong>prepubertal levels</strong> of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating (FSH) and estrogen. She most likely has <strong>McCune-Albright syndrome</strong>.<br><br><strong>Precocious puberty</strong> is defined as pubertal development of secondary sexual characteristics before age 8 in biological females and age 9 in biological males. Precocious puberty can be classified as <strong>central&#160;</strong>or <strong>peripheral</strong>. In peripheral precocious puberty, the HPG axis has not been activated, so lab work will show prepubertal results (i.e. low luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] levels with elevated estradiol and testosterone levels).<br><br><strong>McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS)</strong> is defined as a triad of <strong>peripheral precocious puberty, caf&#233;-au-lait skin pigmentation</strong>, and <strong>polyostotic fibrous dysplasia of bone (PFD)</strong>. It is associated with other endocrinopathies, including hyperthyroidism, growth hormone (GH) excess, renal phosphate wasting with or without rickets, and Cushing syndrome. Biological females presenting with premature episodic vaginal bleeding consistent with menstrual bleeding should be evaluated for features of MAS. In MAS, the cafe-au-lait spots have irregular borders with characteristic <strong>&#8220;coast of Maine&#8221; appearance</strong> and are often isolated to one side of the body. The skeletal disease (PFD) almost always involves the proximal femurs and the skull base. If the diagnosis of MAS is suspected based on skin findings and lab work consistent with <strong>peripheral precocious puberty</strong>, then <strong>X-rays or CT scans of the affected bones</strong> should be performed. If imaging demonstrates <strong>expanded bone</strong> with a <strong>ground glass appearance</strong>, this indicates fibrous dysplasia, and together, these findings confirm the diagnosis of MAS. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Congenital adrenal hyperplasia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency typically presents with virilization and ambiguous genitalia in females and salt wasting.

Patients with BWS can have transient or persistent hypoglycemia. <strong>Persistent hypoglycemia</strong> is due to <strong>islet cell hyperplasia&#160;</strong>and <strong>congenital hyperinsulinism</strong>. Other features of BWS are macrosomia, limb-length discrepancy, hemihypertrophy, abdominal wall defects (omphalocele, umbilical hernia), and organomegaly.

Chest X-ray shows a widened mediastinum. These findings are most consistent with <strong>aortic dissection</strong> secondary to <strong>Marfan syndrome</strong>. <br><br>Marfan syndrome is an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> disorder caused by mutations of the <strong><em>fibrillin-1 (FBN1)&#160;</em>gene</strong>. Patients often experience <strong>chronic joint pain</strong>, and some may develop <strong>ectopia lentis</strong> (dislocation of the optic lens), which can cause ocular pain, myopia, and diplopia. Physical examination typically reveals a <strong>tall, thin frame</strong> with an <strong>increased arm span-to-height ratio</strong>. Other common findings include <strong>arachnodactyly, pectus carinatum, pectus excavatum,&#160;</strong>and <strong>scoliosis</strong>. A heart murmur with a mid-systolic click is consistent with <strong>mitral valve prolapse</strong>, a condition frequently seen in patients with Marfan syndrome.<br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/tuulKQU_RsqrUP7EkAu3XthYQ8eb6bpc/_.jpg\"></div><sup><span>Marfanoid body habitus.

The classic presentation involves sudden, <strong>severe pain in the anterior chest </strong>that <strong>radiates to the back</strong>. However, patients may also present with <strong>stroke-like symptoms, limb weakness, </strong>or<strong> paresthesias</strong>. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings are often nonspecific, and <strong>chest X-ray</strong> may reveal a <strong>widened mediastinum</strong> and an <strong>abnormal aortic contour</strong>. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the diagnostic tool of choice for aortic dissection, although transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used in hemodynamically unstable patients or when CTA is unavailable.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Aortic dissection:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Heart failure:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Patients with heart failure typically present with dyspnea, orthopnea, and edema.

There is a <strong>positive Trousseau sign</strong> (flexion of the wrist and thumb with the extension of the fingers with application of the sphygmomanometer), which suggests <strong>hypocalcemia</strong>, most likely secondary to <strong>DiGeorge syndrome</strong>. The best next step in management is to obtain a serum calcium level and administer emergent intravenous (IV) <strong>calcium gluconate</strong>. <br><br>Patients with aneuploidies and microdeletions may develop critical illness and require acute management, making recognition paramount. In a patient presenting with seizures and characteristic facial features including hypertelorism, cleft lip and palate, and micrognathia, consider <strong>velocardiofacial/DiGeorge syndrome</strong>. Affected patients often exhibit the <strong>CHARGE </strong>association, which includes <strong>coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, restricted growth, genital abnormalities, </strong>and<strong> ear abnormalities</strong>. Some may also have a <strong>small or absent thymus, immunodeficiency</strong>, speech and language difficulties, and <strong>hypocalcemia-induced seizures</strong>. The exam often reveals a <strong>long face</strong> and a <strong>prominent nose with a broad root</strong>. If the chromosomal analysis shows a deletion on the long arm of chromosome 22 (<strong>22q11.2</strong>), velocardiofacial/DiGeorge syndrome can be diagnosed. <br><br>In a patient presenting with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong> should be performed. If the patient appears <strong>unstable</strong>, the first step is to <strong>stabilize </strong>the <strong>airway, breathing, and circulation</strong>. Continuous <strong>vital sign monitoring, IV access, </strong>and<strong> supplemental oxygen</strong> (if needed) should be established. Seizures may be acutely controlled with rapid-acting medications, like benzodiazepines. If hypocalcemia is suspected as the cause, calcium levels should be measured, and intravenous calcium should be administered.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Levetiracetam:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic medication commonly used for maintenance seizure control.

The kidneys treat sodium and lithium similarly, and any change in &#160;urinary sodium reabsorption (e.g., dehydration, renal insufficiency, excessive exercise) will also lead to increased reabsorption of lithium.

      "solution": "<strong>Acetaminophen poisoning</strong> is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. The recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 3 grams, with higher doses leading to increased risk of toxicity. <strong>N-acetylcysteine</strong> is the antidote if treatment is sought within 8 hours of ingestion. If a patient presents within 4 hours of ingestion, gastric decontaminating agents, such as oral activated charcoal, is indicated to decrease absorption from the stomach and small intestine.<br><br>Normally, the small amounts of toxic NAPQI produced via microsomal metabolism (CYP-450 enzymes) after therapeutic doses of acetaminophen are detoxified by binding to <strong>glutathione</strong>. NAPQI depletes glutathione, and once glutathione is depleted to approximately one-third of normal levels, NAPQI binds crucial cellular proteins. This results in hepatic cell death, necrosis, and subsequent fulminant liver failure. The amino acid, cysteine, is the main factor limiting the synthesis of glutathione. N-acetylcysteine is a cysteine precursor that is hydrolysed intracellularly to cysteine, thereby <strong>replenishing intracellular glutathione</strong>.<br><br>P.S.
