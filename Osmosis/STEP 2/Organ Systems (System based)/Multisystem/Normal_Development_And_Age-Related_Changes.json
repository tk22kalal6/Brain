Sinus openings and natal cleft pores may be visible along the intergluteal cleft and hair may be seen protruding from the opening.<br><br>Risk factors for the development of pilonidal disease include male sex, obesity, trauma to the area, sedentary lifestyle, hirsute body habitus, and poor hygiene.<br><br>In <strong>chronic pilonidal disease</strong>, patients often have <strong>recurrent or persistent fluid drainage</strong> from one or more sinus tracts along the gluteal cleft. The area may be tender and painful or not painful, but <strong>signs of acute infection will be absent</strong> in chronic disease. A common feature of chronic pilonidal disease is a history of <strong>prior abscess</strong> in the area.

A <strong>sphincter-sparing procedure</strong> should then be performed after the patient&#8217;s infection has cleared, typically in about 6 weeks.<br><br>The classification of a simple or complex fistula is made by determining the <strong>level of external sphincter involvement on imaging</strong>.

Patients with a simple fistula should be treated with <strong>incision and drainage</strong> and a <strong>primary sphincter-sparing procedure</strong>, such as a fistulotomy or fistulectomy. <strong>Fistulotomy </strong>involves opening the fistula lengthwise and destroying the internal lining of the fistula tract; this is usually performed in patients with no anal sphincter involvement. <strong>Fistulectomy </strong>involves the removal of the fistula with reconstruction of anal sphincters; this is used in patients with fistulas that involve external or internal anal sphincters.<br><br>If a patient has a <strong>complex fistula</strong>, a <strong>seton</strong>, which is a surgical thread, should be placed to aid fistula drainage, prevent premature fistula closure, and preserve the anal sphincter function. After the infection has cleared with the use of antibiotics in about 6 weeks, a sphincter-sparing procedure (e.g., an advancement flap, Modified Hanley procedure, ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract, fibrin sealant, fistula plug) should be performed. Following surgery, all patients should keep the area clean and perform Sitz baths frequently in order to help alleviate any residual pain and to prevent infection and future recurrence. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sigmoidoscopy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Sigmoidoscopy may be used in evaluating a perianal fistula if an internal opening cannot be seen during anoscopy.

Children are<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>first vaccinated against varicella at 12 months and then again at 4 years</strong><strong>.</strong>&#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Vaccinations are essential in preventing infection in children. They work by activating an immune response and producing antibodies. The antibodies produced as a result of vaccines help fight off future invading microbes. Vaccinations are given throughout childhood, starting with the Hepatitis B vaccine which is given within the first 24 hours of life. This child would have received a vaccination against Hepatitis B at birth. Hepatitis B is a 3-dose series and is also given at 2 months and 6 months. She would also have received RSV immunoprophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies if mom did not receive the vaccination between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation. At 2 months she would have received Hepatitis B, rotavirus, DTaP, Hib, pneumococcal conjugate (PCV), and inactivated poliovirus (IPV). Rotavirus is a 2 or 3-dose series (depending on the manufacturer) given at 2, 4, and +/- 6 months. DTaP is a 5-dose series given at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 months, and 4 years. Hib is a 2 or 3-dose series (depending on the manufacturer) given at 2, 4, and +/- 6 months. A booster dose is given at 12 months. PCV is a 4-dose series given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. Lastly, IPV is a 4-dose series given at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 4 years. In addition to MMR, Varicella, PCV13, and Hib at 12 months, patients also receive Hepatitis A. The second dose of Hepatitis A is given 6 months later at 18 months. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>The <strong>CDC provides guidelines</strong> regarding the <strong>vaccination schedule.</strong> The timing for each dose of a vaccine was determined by looking at age-specific risks for disease, risks for complications, and responses to vaccination, as well as maternal immunity transmitted to newborns/infants. In general, the recommendation is to vaccinate as early as possible as long as vaccine efficacy and safety have been proven. Most <strong>children receive vaccinations following the standardized CDC schedule&#160;</strong>but, as mentioned above, there are certain scenarios such as international travel, immunocompromised state, cochlear implants, and prematurity which may alter which vaccines are given and when.

      "solution": "This patient has developed an elevation in serum creatinine after kidney transplantation. Absence of significant findings on urinalysis and the elevated BUN/creatinine ratio suggests a prerenal cause. This is most likely due to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction caused by cyclosporine. &#160; <br><br>Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that is used frequently to prevent transplant rejection and can also be used in treatment of certain autoimmune disorders. Normally, after T-cells are exposed to an antigen, calcineurin gets activated and dephosphorylates a transcription factor known as the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT). NFAT then translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription of immune mediator cytokines; most importantly interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 provides the signal needed for T-cell activation and proliferation. Cyclosporine inhibits the transcription of IL-2 by inhibiting calcineurin, thereby halting T cell proliferation and protecting the transplanted organ from T cell-mediated injury. &#160; &#160;<br><br>One of the major limitations of cyclosporine use is its severe nephrotoxic effects. Acute nephrotoxicity is related to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, which decreases the glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and creatinine clearance. As there is no intrinsic kidney injury, the urinalysis is usually bland. This is usually reversible with cyclosporine dose reduction. Long-term use can cause chronic nephrotoxicity marked by tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which is usually irreversible. Cyclosporine can also cause hypertension, gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-JoTbcv5SKOTjUF-N9G1ZHf6TOex1HJX/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cyclosporine side effect:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sirolimus side effect:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant that is frequently used in combination with cyclosporine as a prophylaxis for transplant rejection.
