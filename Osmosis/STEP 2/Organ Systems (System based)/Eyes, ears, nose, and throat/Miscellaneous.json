The patient has no past medical history, takes no medication, and has no family history of venous thromboembolism. He has not experienced dyspnea, cough, or fever. Temperature is 36.8 &#176;C (98.2 &#176;F), blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. On examination, he has pitting edema of the left lower leg up to the mid-calf, without erythema, warmth, or tenderness. The circumference of the left calf is 2 cm greater than the right. Examination of the right leg is unremarkable. Which of the following diagnostic studies should be obtained next? &#160;",

      "solution": "This patient&#8217;s left leg pitting edema after a recent prolonged flight raises suspicion for <strong>deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</strong>. <br><br>Calculating the <strong>pretest probability of DVT with Wells criteria</strong> as listed below can help guide the diagnostic workup. Patients' risk of DVT can be determined to be &#8220;unlikely&#8221; or &#8220;likely&#8221; based on factors obtained from the history and physical examination. Patients in the <strong>&#8220;unlikely&#8221; category, like the patient in this case, should undergo d-dimer testing</strong>. A low d-dimer level (&lt; 500 ng/dL) can rule out DVT, while a high level (&#8805; 500 ng/dL) warrants further testing with lower extremity venous ultrasonography. Patients falling in the &#8220;likely&#8221; category for DVT should proceed directly to ultrasound testing.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/7LvpR8XdRZ_OHD2HcWbtqcp-TcmtVyUs/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ D-dimer:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See main explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ CT pulmonary angiography:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The patient&#8217;s history and examination are concerning for a deep vein thrombosis.

DVT is an important complication of prolonged hospital stays, particularly in bed-bound patients. <br><br>Management of DVT involves <strong>3&#8211;6 months of anticoagulation</strong> to prevent propagation, embolism, or recurrence. Medications for management include <strong>unfractionated heparin</strong>, <strong>low molecular weight heparin</strong>, <strong>direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and warfarin</strong>. However, contraindications to the standard anticoagulation therapy should be considered.<br><br><strong>Contraindications to anticoagulation include active bleeding (e.g., GI bleed), acute intracranial hemorrhage, severe thrombocytopenia, recent high-risk surgery/procedures, and major trauma</strong>. When any of these conditions are present, the risk of life-threatening bleeding from anticoagulation often outweighs the benefits. In this setting, consultation with interventional radiology for placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be necessary. It is important to note that <strong>IVC filters do not treat a DVT, but they do reduce the risk of embolization</strong>.<br><br>Complications of DVT include extensive proximal DVTs which cause severe symptoms or limb-threatening swelling (phlegmasia cerulea dolens). Such cases may warrant advanced therapies, including thrombolysis or thrombectomy. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Observation with vital signs monitoring &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s history, examination, and ultrasound findings are indicative of a deep vein thrombosis.

      "solution": "This patient presents with fatigue, recurrent bacterial infections, and easy bruising. Complete blood count shows <strong>pancytopenia</strong>. Given this patient&#8217;s age and pancytopenia, <strong>myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)</strong> should be suspected. A <strong>bone marrow biopsy</strong> is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other causes.<br><br>Patients presenting with <strong>cytopenias </strong>should be <strong>evaluated for secondary causes</strong>, such as nutritional deficiencies, consumptive processes, chronic diseases, or medication side effects. Anemia may be caused by iron deficiency, splenic sequestration, hemolysis, or chronic disease. Thrombocytopenia may be caused by certain medications or cirrhosis. Neutropenia may result from the use of certain medications or from HIV infection. Peripheral blood smear can provide evidence of abnormal or <strong>dysplastic cells</strong> in patients with MDS. A bone marrow biopsy is essential for making the diagnosis. It can assess which <strong>cell lineages are dysplastic</strong> and low and to what degree, evaluate for hypercellularity or hypocellularity, and for the presence of blasts. It can also provide a sample for <strong>cytogenetic analysis</strong>.
