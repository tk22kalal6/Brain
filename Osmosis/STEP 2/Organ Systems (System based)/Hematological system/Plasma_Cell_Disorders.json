      "solution": "<strong>Dyspepsia&#160;</strong>is typically associated with benign acid reflux, although it can be a sign of more concerning conditions such as gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), esophagitis, myocardial infarction, hiatal hernia, and <strong>cancer</strong>. The history and physical exam are important elements to help determine the underlying etiology. This patient presents with burning abdominal pain refractory to antacids in the setting of significant unintentional weight loss and iron deficiency anemia. <strong>Unintentional weight loss and iron deficiency anemia</strong> are <strong>alarm features</strong> in patients presenting with dyspepsia, and should prompt further investigation with a <strong>gastroenterology consult for upper endoscopy with biopsies</strong> given the concern for <strong>gastric cancer</strong>.<br><br>Gastric cancer is a malignant tumor of the stomach and the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. History should be focused on qualifying the dyspepsia and identifying <strong>risk factors</strong> associated with gastric cancer. These include a history of <strong>H. pylori</strong> and Epstein-Barr virus infections, pernicious anemia, <strong>chronic gastritis</strong>, <strong>smoking</strong>, diet of smoked or pickled foods, high-salt diet, or a <strong>family history of gastric cancer</strong>. Ethnicity might also be a risk factor, especially if patients are of Eastern Asian, Eastern European, and South American descent. The physical exam is usually unremarkable; however, it is important to do a thorough examination of the lymph node basins to evaluate for metastatic disease. Lab work often shows <strong>new onset anemia</strong>.<br><br><strong>Upper endoscopy with biopsies</strong> of esophageal, gastric, or duodenal lesions can provide a <strong>tissue diagnosis</strong>. Any suspicious gastric ulcer should be biopsied multiple times for higher diagnostic accuracy (one (70%) versus seven (98%) sensitivity). Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at this time to evaluate the depth of invasion which is important for TNM staging.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/8kREoa7KShOGxL-qv2UdMmcIQfeWLmV1/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Barium esophagram:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A barium esophagram is usually performed to assess frequent heartburn, gastric reflux, aspiration, and difficulty eating, drinking, or swallowing. This patient&#8217;s weight loss and microcytic anemia are alarm features that are concerning for gastric cancer, and while an esophagram can diagnose an intraluminal obstruction secondary to cancer, it is not the first choice for diagnosis and does not provide biopsy for tissue diagnosis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Esophageal pH testing:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: An esophageal pH test measures how often stomach acid enters the esophagus and how long it remains there. It is often used to diagnose acid reflux or to evaluate gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD) refractory to first line antacid therapy. This patient&#8217;s weight loss and microcytic anemia are alarm features that are concerning for gastric cancer, and therefore an endoscopy with biopsies is required for diagnosis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Upper endoscopy with biopsies:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pantoprazole:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Antisecretory therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) can relieve dyspepsia symptoms.

In patients over 65, they are preferred to PPI due to their decreased risk of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection. However, given this patient&#8217;s alarm features for gastric cancer, additional workup is required prior to treatment. &#160;</span></div>",

For patients with <strong>Stage III disease</strong> who are otherwise medically fit and have <strong>resectable tumors</strong>, the most appropriate next step is a <strong>diagnostic laparoscopy with cytology</strong>. A pretreatment diagnostic laparoscopy can be used to <strong>detect occult metastases</strong>. Metastatic disease (M1) can be detected via diagnostic laparoscopy in up to 30% of patients in whom metastatic disease was missed on CT. In addition, <strong>cytology&#160;</strong>testing of <strong>peritoneal fluid</strong> can help improve laparoscopic staging through identification of occult carcinomatosis. <br><br>If diagnostic laparoscopy does not find any evidence of metastatic disease, patients are referred to a medical oncologist for <strong>perioperative chemotherapy</strong>. First line chemotherapy is generally a <strong>two-agent cytotoxic regimen</strong> consisting of a <strong>fluoropyrimidine and platinum alkylating agent</strong> (i.e., fluorouracil and oxaliplatin). &#160;After perioperative chemotherapy is completed, the patient is then re-staged via CT imaging. If they have resectable disease, <strong>surgery&#160;</strong>is recommended.<br><br>The standard of care for surgical management of gastric cancer is a <strong>gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy</strong>.
