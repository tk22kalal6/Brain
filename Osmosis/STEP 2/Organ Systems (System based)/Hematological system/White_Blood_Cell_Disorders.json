These findings are suggestive of a <strong>subphrenic abscess caused by recent abdominal surgery</strong>. The most appropriate next step in evaluating a suspected subphrenic abscess in this patient is to confirm the diagnosis with a <strong>CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast</strong>. CT is the best imaging for detecting left-sided subphrenic abscesses and all other intra-abdominal abscesses. Abdominal ultrasound can also be used to diagnose right-sided subphrenic abscesses. <br><br>On a CT scan, an intra-abdominal abscess appears as an <strong>intra-abdominal fluid collection outside the bowel lumen</strong> with possible contrast-enhancing rim, bubbles, or air-fluid levels. Once the diagnosis of intra-abdominal abscess has been made, <strong>complicating features</strong> on imaging should be assessed to determine the management approach. The presence of one or more of the following features is considered a complicating feature:<br><br><ul><li>Percutaneously inaccessible abscess</li><li>Poorly localized or multifocal abscess</li><li>High-density fluid indicating hematoma</li><li>Multi-loculated abscess</li><li>Presence of anastomotic leak</li><li>Presence of free hollow organ perforation</li></ul><br>If an anastomotic leak or free hollow organ perforation is also seen, the patient will likely have signs of peritonitis and an acute abdomen with diffuse abdominal tenderness, abdominal rigidity, and rebound and guarding.

Tyrosine kinases are enzymes responsible for signal transduction cascades responsible for cell proliferation. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases selectively inhibits the proliferation of cancers that overexpress them. The KIT kinase is structurally&#160;similar to&#160;the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase.

Now, using imatinib is&#160;established&#160;as first-line therapy in treating metastatic GIST. A common side effect of imatinib therapy is fluid retention, hepatotoxicity, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.

The two main subtypes of anal cancer are <strong>squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)</strong> which is the most common type, and <strong>adenocarcinoma</strong>. Although rare, the incidence of anal cancer has been increasing over the last two decades likely due to the spread of <strong>human papillomavirus (HPV)</strong> which is the <strong>primary cause of anal SCC</strong>. A <strong>history of anogenital warts</strong>, which HPV causes, is a significant risk factor for the development of anal cancer. <br><br>Patients with suspected anal cancer should have a thorough history taken to evaluate for risk factors. Anal cancer is strongly associated with a <strong>history of HPV infection (anal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar)</strong>, particularly the high-risk strains <strong>HPV 16 </strong>and <strong>18</strong>. HPV-related anal cancers often arise from precursor lesions, and individuals with a history of <strong>anogenital warts</strong> are at increased risk of developing these lesions and subsequently anal cancer. HPV is transmitted sexually therefore a <strong>high lifetime number of sexual partners</strong>, as well as <strong>receptive anal intercourse</strong>, increase the likelihood of contracting the virus and developing anal cancer. Patients who are <strong>immunocompromised</strong>, including those living with HIV infection, are also at an increased risk for anal cancer, and <strong>cigarette smoking</strong> increases the risk.<br><br>Patients may present with anal pain, rectal bleeding, and a sensation of a mass within or around the anus. On <strong>digital rectal exam</strong> (DRE) the clinician may note a <strong>palpable perianal or anal mass</strong>, which can be firm, fixed, or ulcerated.

Which of the following additional findings can be seen in this patient? &#160;<br><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/aiseaX_gRZCCTc4_1wGF3KNSTUCCZjiy/_.jpg\"></div><br>Reproduced from&#160;Radiopedia",

      "solution": "This patient with obstructive jaundice and a mass of the head of pancreas, most likely has <strong>pancreatic cancer. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>The most common type is the <strong>cancer of the pancreatic head,</strong> which accounts for the most cases of <strong>hepatobiliary obstruction</strong>. Because of the posterior relationships of the pancreas, cancer of the head often compresses and obstructs the bile duct and/or the hepatopancreatic ampulla. This causes obstruction, resulting in the retention of bile pigments, <strong>painless enlargement of the gallbladder</strong> (Courvoisier sign), and obstructive jaundice. <strong>Courvoisier&#8217;s law</strong> states that an enlarged and non-tender gallbladder accompanied by mild jaundice is unlikely caused by gallstones and rather caused by pancreatic or gallstone cancer. Weight loss can occur due to high tumor metabolism or to pancreatic insufficiency. &#160; <br><br>Among others, pancreatic cancer can invade major arteries, like the <strong>superior mesenteric artery,</strong> which lies posterior to the neck of the pancreas. When the superior mesenteric artery is invaded, it usually means that the cancer cannot be surgically resected. On the other hand, cancer of the neck and body of the pancreas may cause hepatic portal or inferior vena caval obstruction because the pancreas overlies these large veins. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/XyxjaSH_SD_Q_UxPe7NnR7n6ScKHanbA/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Renal artery bruit:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Renal artery bruit can be heard in patients with renal artery stenosis, which is characterized by resistant hypertension. This patient&#8217;s vitals are within normal limits, and the CT scan abdomen is significant for the mass of the head of the pancreas. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased liver span:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Increased liver span is a nonspecific finding that can be seen in a number of infectious (e.g., hepatitis and infectious mononucleosis), biliary (e.g., biliary sclerosing cholangitis) and neoplastic (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma) conditions. This patient&#8217;s yellow skin and sclera and association with a mass of the pancreatic head is suggestive of pancreatic cancer. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Dark rings that encircle the iris of the eyes:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Kayser&#8211;Fleischer rings, characterized by dark rings that encircle the iris of the eyes, are pathognomonic of Wilson disease, which results from accumulation of copper in the liver and decreased excretion in bile. It is characterized by fatigue, abdominal pain, and uncontrolled or poorly coordinated movements. Pancreatic head involvement, as seen in this abdominal CT scan, is not a feature of Wilson disease. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Palpable non-tender gallbladder:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Palpable nodule bulging into the umbilicus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The Sister Mary Joseph sign, characterized by a palpable nodule bulging into the umbilicus, is typically seen in patients with gastric cancer. Although it can cause weight loss and abdominal pain, a pancreatic mass in this patient is suggestive of pancreatic carcinoma. &#160;</span></div>",
