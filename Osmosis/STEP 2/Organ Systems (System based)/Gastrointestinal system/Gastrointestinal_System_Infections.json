      "solution": "This patient most likely has <strong>acute diverticulitis</strong>, characterized by diverticulum inflammation due to micro-perforation and bacterial seeding in the diverticulum wall. It most commonly occurs in Western societies in the sigmoid colon, where there is the highest intraluminal pressure. Risk factors for acute diverticulitis include older age, obesity, a diet high in red meat and low in fiber, a sedentary lifestyle, and aspirin and NSAID use. Patients with acute diverticulitis usually report <strong>acute, constant, crampy abdominal pain localized to the left lower quadrant</strong>. Other symptoms include fevers [typically below 39&#176;C (102 &#176;F)], nausea, change in bowel habits (e.g., constipation, diarrhea), and urinary symptoms (e.g., dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency) due to bladder irritation from the inflamed sigmoid colon. Abdominal examination typically shows hypoactive bowel sounds and <strong>tenderness localized to the LLQ</strong>. <br><br>Laboratory evaluation typically shows <strong>leukocytosis </strong>with a left shift and an <strong>elevated CRP</strong>. The most appropriate test for diagnosis is a <strong>CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast</strong> (water-soluble if perforation is suspected), which can show areas of <strong>inflamed diverticula</strong> with <strong>localized thickening of the bowel wall, pericolonic fat stranding</strong>, and potential findings of complications of acute diverticulitis (e.g., abscess, fistula, obstruction, perforation).

Risk factors for this condition include advanced age, hospitalization with severe illness, trauma or surgery, electrolyte imbalances, and certain medications (e.g. opioids). <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/v5svflCjSoGGOxSoBg9V8mJeTMWHHNCh/_.png\"></div><br>In stable patients without evidence of complicated disease (e.g., ischemia, perforation), <strong>supportive care</strong> is most appropriate. This includes fluid hydration, electrolyte replacement, <strong>bowel decompression via nasogastric tube</strong> if nausea and vomiting is present, and <strong>discontinuation of motility-inhibiting medications (e.g. opioids). Serial abdominal examinations</strong> and abdominal <strong>radiographs&#160;</strong>can help to monitor for signs of improvement or worsening. In patients who do not respond to initial therapy, a trial of a <strong>cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g. neostigmine)</strong> may stimulate bowel motility.<br><br>In patients <strong>who do not respond</strong> to supportive care and a cholinesterase inhibitor, or <strong>clinically worsen</strong>, <strong>surgical consultation for exploratory laparotomy</strong> is recommended.

The most common cause is <strong>recent abdominal surgery</strong>. Monitoring a patient&#8217;s abdominal examination and ability to pass flatus and stool is critical in the postoperative period.<br><br>Management of postoperative ileus includes supportive care with <strong>bowel rest, nasogastric tube decompression, IV fluid hydration,&#160;</strong>and <strong>electrolyte monitoring/replacement</strong>. Patients are encouraged to <strong>ambulate&#160;</strong>and avoid <strong>medications&#160;</strong>that can inhibit peristalsis (e.g., opiates) Monitoring involves <strong>serial abdominal exams&#160;</strong>and <strong>abdominal X-rays</strong> to gauge response to therapy. Once improvement is seen, patients should have a trial of oral intake. If patients do not respond appropriately, develop signs of sepsis, or worsen clinically, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis should be ordered to look for complications. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Nasogastric tube decompression:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Metoclopramide:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Administering a prokinetic agent, such as metoclopramide, is not the first-line management for ileus.

The incidence of an anal fistula developing from an anal abscess ranges from 15 to 38%. <strong>Over 90% of fistulas are cryptogenic,</strong> but the remaining 10% are due to Crohn&#8217;s disease, obstetric injuries, foreign bodies, or malignancy. To further examine a fistula and characterize the tract, patients require an <strong>exam under anesthesia (EUA).&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Patients with an anorectal fistula usually present with a <strong>\"nonhealing\" anorectal abscess</strong> following drainage or with <strong>chronic purulent drainage</strong> and a pustule-like lesion in the perianal or buttock area. It can be painless or patients may experience <strong>intermittent rectal pain, particularly during defecation,</strong> or with sitting and activity. Patients may also experience intermittent and<strong>&#160;malodorous perianal drainage and pruritus.</strong> Physical examinations vary, but typically the external opening can be seen. &#160;<br><br>To further examine the fistula and characterize the tract prior to surgery, patients require an<strong>&#160;exam under anesthesia (EUA).</strong> Anal fistulas are classified in terms of their <strong>relationship to the anal sphincter muscles</strong> (see image above). <strong>Complex anal fistulas</strong> include high transsphincteric fistulas that involve<strong>&#160;&#8805;30 percent of the external sphincter;</strong> suprasphincteric, extrasphincteric, or horseshoe fistulas; and fistulas associated with Crohn&#8217;s disease, radiation, malignancy, or existing fecal incontinence. <strong>Simple anal fistulas</strong> do not have any of the above attributes and generally include superficial, intersphincteric, and low transsphincteric fistulas that involve &lt;30 percent of the external sphincter.&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Fistulotomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A fistulotomy is a surgical procedure for simple fistulas that unroofs the fistula and allows the tract to scar over and heal within a matter of weeks.

      "solution": "<strong>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</strong> (NAFLD) is a condition wherein hepatic steatosis develops in individuals who drink little or no alcohol. It is the most common cause of <strong>incidental elevations in serum transaminases</strong>, and most individuals with steatosis are asymptomatic. NAFLD most commonly occurs in patients with <strong>metabolic syndrome</strong>, which consists of hypertension, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. NAFLD initially begins as <strong>steatosis&#160;</strong>(fatty infiltration), and it can progress to active steatohepatitis (fatty infiltration and inflammation) and then cirrhosis; however, the incidence of progression is low. &#160; <br><br>Risk factors for NAFLD include <strong>obesity&#160;</strong>and <strong>insulin resistance</strong>; both of these factors increase the mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, which are eventually taken up by hepatocytes. As intrahepatic lipids and their metabolic intermediates accumulate, hepatocytes become sensitized to the toxic effects of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, the accumulation of lipid metabolism byproducts increases the production of <strong>reactive oxygen species</strong>, which disrupt mitochondrial function, cause liver injury, and trigger <strong>stellate cell activation</strong>. &#160; <br><br>A liver biopsy would show hepatocellular lipid accumulation, with various degrees of inflammatory infiltrates, depending on the stage of the disease. Treatment is directed towards<strong>&#160;weight reduction</strong> and <strong>reversal of insulin resistance</strong>, as these are the primary drivers of NAFLD. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/eBY9Se2rTOuwI0L7uir2WQ6RRM2LX7Y7/_.jpg\"></div><br>Image reproduced from<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-xVO1TywRauRquMbKOBDLafOQq6FJQVw/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Education on weight loss strategies:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Initiation of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir therapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are medications commonly used to treat chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection.
