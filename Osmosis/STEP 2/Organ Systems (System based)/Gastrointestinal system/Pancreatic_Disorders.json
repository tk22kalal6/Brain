Additionally, hemodynamic instability (tachycardia and hypotension), absent bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness, and guarding are concerning for <strong>bowel perforation or ischemia</strong>. <br><br>Mechanical large bowel obstruction occurs when a blockage in the colon or rectum prevents the passage of intraluminal contents (e.g., gas, chyme). This results in distention of the bowel proximal to the obstruction and subsequent complications such as bowel ischemia and perforation. The most common mechanical causes of large bowel obstruction are colorectal cancer, colonic volvulus, and diverticular disease.<br><br>The first step in the evaluation and management of large bowel obstruction is to perform an <strong>ABCDE&#160;</strong><strong>assessment</strong>. If the patient is found to be unstable, measures to stabilize their airway, breathing, and circulation should be performed. These include <strong>establishing IV access, administering IV fluids, and continuous monitoring of vital signs</strong>. Vasopressors may be required for refractory hypotension. If the patient is unable to protect their airway or has evidence of respiratory failure, endotracheal intubation is indicated.<br><br>Once stabilization measures are initiated, supportive care may be started which can include bowel rest, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and electrolyte replacement. Laboratory studies (e.g., CBC, CMP, lactic acid) and imaging (e.g., plain radiograph, CT) may also be ordered.

      "solution": "This patient presents with acute, stable <strong>appendicitis </strong>symptoms, including right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and a positive <strong>Rovsing sign</strong>. A <strong>Rovsing sign</strong> is positive when the patient&#8217;s left lower quadrant is palpated, and the patient feels pain in the right lower quadrant. This finding is indicative of right-sided peritoneal irritation. Of the physical examination findings listed, the <strong>psoas sign</strong> is the most likely to also be present. Psoas sign is positive when <strong>passive extension of the patient&#8217;s right hip</strong> causes right lower quadrant pain. This finding indicates inflammation of an appendix that is <strong>retrocecal</strong>, or situated behind the cecum.<br><br>Patients with acute appendicitis typically develop pain <strong>around the umbilicus</strong> that <strong>migrates toward the right lower abdominal quadrant</strong>. Patients often experience associated nausea, anorexia, vomiting, and fevers. Additional symptoms may include diarrhea, bowel irregularity, indigestion, and malaise. A focused history and physical examination should be obtained for stable patients with suspected appendicitis, explicitly noting the pain's timing, duration, and migration.<br><br>Most patients with appendicitis will demonstrate focal, right lower quadrant tenderness to palpation at <strong>McBurney point</strong>, one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. Additional physical examination findings that can aid in diagnosing appendicitis include the <strong>Rovsing</strong>, <strong>psoas</strong>, and <strong>obturator </strong>signs. The <strong>obturator sign</strong> is positive when <strong>internal rotation of the hip</strong> with the knee and hip flexed induces pain in the patient&#8217;s right lower quadrant. This finding may indicate an appendix located in the pelvis. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Psoas sign:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Chandelier sign:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Chandelier sign is a term to describe cervical motion tenderness.

This finding is indicative of cholecystitis, not appendicitis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Absent cremasteric reflex:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The cremasteric reflex is a normal physical examination sign. It describes how stroking the inner thigh causes the ipsilateral testicle to pull upwards toward the inguinal canal. The absence of a cremasteric reflex may be seen in acute testicular torsion, but not in appendicitis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hamman sign:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hamman sign describes a rasping crunching sound heard over the precordium that is synchronous with the heartbeat.

They most commonly present in pediatrics and middle-aged patients, although they can present in any age group. They are divided into two types: <strong>typical anal fissures</strong>, which are caused by local trauma due to constipation, straining during defecation, vaginal delivery, prolonged diarrhea, or anal intercourse; and <strong>atypical anal fissures</strong> which are caused by an underlying secondary disease such as Crohn disease and other granulomatous diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, sarcoidosis), malignancy, or communicable diseases (e.g., HIV infection, syphilis). &#160;<br><br>Patients with anal fissures typically present with anal pain during and after defecation and bright red blood with wiping or on the stool surface. Patients may also report a history of local trauma in typical anal fissures or signs and symptoms related to the underlying etiology in atypical anal fissures.<br><br>Physical examination typically reveals a <strong>linear midline longitudinal laceration in the anal canal</strong>, most commonly in the posterior midline.
