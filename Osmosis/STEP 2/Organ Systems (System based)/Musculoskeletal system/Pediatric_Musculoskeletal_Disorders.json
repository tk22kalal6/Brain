Postural tremors can occur with lithium therapy, even in therapeutic ranges. However, it can also indicate <strong>lithium toxicity</strong>, so obtaining a <strong>lithium level</strong> can help guide dose adjustments. If the lithium level is therapeutic, and there are no indications of an alternate cause of the tremor, the most likely diagnosis is a lithium-induced postural tremor.

      "solution": "This patient presents with muscle rigidity, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and tachypnea shortly after administration of anesthesia and initiation of surgery. These findings are most suggestive of <strong>malignant hyperthermia</strong> (MH).<br><br><strong>MH</strong> is a rare but life-threatening condition that often arises secondary to <strong>mutations in voltage-sensitive ryanodine receptors</strong> (<em>RYR1</em> gene) that result in the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the sarcoplasmic reticulum on exposure to <strong>inhaled anesthetics </strong>or <strong>succinylcholine</strong>. The sudden release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum removes the inhibition of troponin and causes sustained muscle contractions. The sustained muscle contractions lead to increased <strong>adenosine triphosphatase activity</strong>, resulting in an uncontrolled hypermetabolic state characterized by significantly increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, severe lactic acidosis, hyperthermia, and sometimes rhabdomyolysis.<br><br>Treatment involves discontinuation of the causative agent and immediate administration of intravenous <strong>dantrolene</strong>. Dantrolene is a hydantoin derivative that directly <strong>interferes with muscle contraction</strong> by <strong>blockading ryanodine receptors</strong> and inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.<br><br>MH susceptible individuals should not have anesthesia with triggering agents and are advised to avoid exercise in excessive heat or humidity, as these environmental factors may trigger an episode. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Ryanodine receptor antagonist:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#945;2-receptor agonist:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Tizanidine, an &#945;<sub>2</sub>-receptor agonist, is effective in managing muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and cerebral palsy.

However, their coadministration with statins increases the risk of muscle injury. This complication is thought to result from the <strong>inhibition of statin glucuronidation</strong>, a process that assists in the renal excretion of stains. <strong>Serum CPK</strong> can be measured periodically in patients undergoing combination therapy to evaluate for muscle injury and rhabdomyolysis. <br><br>Notably, <strong>fenofibrate </strong>is rarely reported to interact with statins to cause muscle injury. As a result, it is preferred over other fibrates (e.g. gemfibrozil) when <strong>combination therapy</strong> with a statin is required. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Serum creatine phosphokinase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Abdominal ultrasound:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: An abdominal ultrasound can be performed to look for gallstones, a complication of fibrate therapy, in symptomatic patients.

Although fibrates can cause mild elevations in aminotransferase, acute liver injury is rare, and monitoring is not indicated. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Renal function test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Gemfibrozil rarely affects serum creatinine levels (unlike fenofibrate) and does not potentiate statin-induced nephrotoxicity. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Random blood glucose:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Statin and fibrate therapy do not significantly affect blood glucose levels. Niacin, however, can cause hyperglycemia and should be used cautiously in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. &#160;</span></div>",

Current medication includes lisinopril. Family history is significant for type II diabetes mellitus in her mother and myocardial infarction in her father. She drinks 2-3 beers on the weekends and does not smoke or use illicit drugs. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Her recent fasting lipid profile revealed an elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The physician prescribes a lipid-lowering drug that prevents lipolysis by inhibiting hormone-sensitive lipase in adipose tissue. Which of the following is a potential adverse effect of this drug? &#160;",
