This includes <strong>exercise, weight loss, Tai Chi,&#160;</strong>and <strong>assistive devices</strong>. Weight loss is recommended for patients with <strong>BMI &gt; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup></strong> because it <strong>relieves stress</strong> on weight-bearing joints, leading to a reduction in pain and increased mobility. Exercise increases muscle strength and improves range of motion. Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese mind-body practice that improves strength and balance. Patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis with difficulty ambulating may benefit from the use of assistive devices such as braces, canes, or walkers.<br><br>If patients do not respond to non-pharmacologic treatment or if they want to add pharmacologic treatment to non-pharmacologic therapy, <strong>NSAIDs (either topical or oral)</strong> can be added if the patient does not have contraindications. Topical NSAIDs can be prescribed initially for pain management and do not carry the same risks as an oral NSAID. Oral NSAIDs are the recommended initial oral medication; however, there is an increased risk for adverse effects in patients with chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with intolerance or contraindication to NSAIDs, duloxetine may be used as an alternate oral therapy.<br><br>If patients do not respond to first-line pharmacologic management with NSAIDs or duloxetine, second-line treatment with intra-articular injections (glucocorticosteroids or hyaluronic acid) can be offered. Intra-articular glucocorticosteroids reduce inflammation within the joint leading to a reduction in pain and improvement in joint function; however, they are associated with adverse risks to the joint.

Patients typically present with over 6 weeks of <strong>joint stiffness that is worse in the morning</strong> or after prolonged periods of inactivity, <strong>lasting 30 minutes or longer</strong>; with associated <strong>joint swelling and pain</strong>. Patients may also report nonspecific systemic symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, depressed mood, and poor appetite. &#160;Rheumatoid arthritis involves the small, peripheral joints with the most commonly affected joints being the <strong>proximal interphalangeal or PIP joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of the hands</strong>. The small joints of the feet can also be involved as can larger joints.

Warmth and erythema are not typically seen. <br><br>The underlying joint inflammation in RA causes the surrounding structures to shorten and stiffen, this can eventually result in <strong>contractures</strong>. Common contractures seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis include ulnar deviation of the MCP joints; Boutonniere deformities, where there is persistent flexion of the PIP joints and hyperextension of the DIP joints; and <strong>Swan-neck deformities</strong>, where there is persistent hyperextension of the PIP joints and flexion of the DIP joints. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Swan-Neck deformities:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Bouchard nodes:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Bouchard nodes are bony enlargements of the proximal interphalangeal joints that can be seen in patients with osteoarthritis.

Afterwards, pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy with <strong>allopurinol or febuxostat</strong> should be administered to prevent future episodes of acute gouty attack. &#160; <br><br><strong>Allopurinol&#160;</strong>is a purine analog that works via <strong>competitive inhibition of xanthine oxidase</strong> (XO).

In PsA inflammation causes <strong>joint pain, swelling,</strong> and <strong>stiffness&#160;</strong>most commonly in the<strong>&#160;fingers and toes,</strong> but other joints can be affected as well (e.g., elbows, knees, sacroiliac joints). Patients with PsA are typically negative for rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and<strong>&#160;have elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).&#160;</strong>They may also be <strong>positive for HLA-B27</strong> (in ~10% of cases). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Involved joints are typically swollen and tender. Dactylitis is a specific sign of psoriatic arthritis that presents as swelling of the entire digit of the fingers or toes termed &#8220;sausage digit&#8221;. The inflammation can eventually lead to joint destruction that can be seen on imaging. Because of the association of PsA with psoriasis, the characteristic dry, thick,<strong>&#160;silvery-white scaly plaques</strong> of psoriasis may be seen on the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees, along with <strong>pitting of the nails.</strong> Radiographic findings of affected joints may show<strong>&#160;joint space narrowing</strong> and <strong>juxta-articular new bone formation. &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>CASPAR (Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis) were designed to select patients to enroll in research trials and not for diagnostic purposes.

TNF inhibitors are members of a class of medications called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that can be used in rheumatoid arthritis to decrease joint damage. Apart from rheumatoid arthritis, TNF inhibitors can also be used in the treatment of psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disorders, and ankylosing spondylitis. The discovery of TNF inhibitors was a major step in the therapeutic approach to rheumatic disease.<br><br>TNF is a major proinflammatory cytokine that is mainly produced by activated macrophages but can also be produced by lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Soluble TNF then binds to its receptors and signals the production of other cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6). TNF plays an important role in many autoimmune disorders and inflammatory disorders, but also is involved in the defense against infections (e.g., tuberculosis) and tumors.<br><br>There are 5 TNF inhibitors in use today, four monoclonal antibodies against TNF (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab), and one soluble TNF receptor (etanercept). <br><br>TNF inhibitors are associated with significant side effects, some of which can be lethal. The most common side effects include:<br><br><ul><li>Infections: TNF inhibitors increase the risk of many infections, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. These infections can sometimes be lethal. In addition, it has been shown that the use of TNF inhibitors can lead to the reactivation of tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C. Therefore, it is recommended that all patients be tested for active/latent TB, HIV, and hepatitis B, and C before starting the treatment with TNF inhibitors.</li><li>Hepatotoxicity: Which can be severe and lead to fulminant hepatic failure.</li><li>Malignancies: TNF inhibitors increase the risk of malignancy, especially lymphomas.</li><li>Congestive heart failure: although TNF inhibitors do not lead to CHF, patients with preexisting CHF taking TNF inhibitors can develop worsening of cardiac function and increased mortality. Therefore, TNF inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe CHF.</li><li>Demyelinating disorders: This includes optic neuritis, myelitis, transverse myelitis, and guillain-barre syndrome.

The main effect of methotrexate is inhibiting the <strong>conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase</strong> (DHTFR). Tetrahydrofolate is the active form of folate needed to make purines and pyrimidine bases and thus make DNA and RNA. By inhibiting DHFTR, methotrexate inhibits the synthesis of DNA and RNA required for cellular division and immune response, inhibiting the proliferation of immune cells. This is also the mechanism by which methotrexate can be used to treat some cancers. It can also inhibit protein synthesis.<br><br>Adenosine has anti-inflammatory effects and suppresses T- and B-cell proliferation and response.
