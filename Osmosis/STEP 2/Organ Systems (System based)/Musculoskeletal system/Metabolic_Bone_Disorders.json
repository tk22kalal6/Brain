In CPPD, calcium pyrophosphate crystals deposit in the joints and soft tissue causes joint pain and swelling. It most commonly affects the knees, wrists, and ankles. It predominantly affects older patients (age &gt; 60 years); therefore, this patient&#8217;s<strong>&#160;age over 60 years</strong> is the most likely contributing risk factor. &#160; <br><br>Pseudogout, or calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), may be asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging. It also can present as <strong>a</strong><strong>cute or chronic joint pain and swelling.</strong> It typically presents as acute monoarticular or polyarticular joint pain and swelling. However <strong>chronic pseudogout</strong> can involve the <strong>bilateral wrists and small joints of the hands&#160;</strong>and has been called <strong>&#8220;pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis\" (pseudo-RA)&#160;</strong>when there is a<strong>&#160;non-erosive, inflammatory arthritis&#160;</strong>with CPP crystals found in joint fluid. Patients with chronic pseudogout can also present with<strong>&#160;chronic, degenerative arthritis,</strong> resembling osteoarthritis. &#160; <br><br>Hypomagnesemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hemochromatosis have been associated with CPPD.

One of the classic dermatological manifestations of SLE is a <strong>discoid rash</strong>, which is considered <strong>chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus</strong>. The lesions of <strong>discoid lupus erythematous</strong> are typically erythematous indurated plaques with scale that may lead to scarring. They occur most often on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, neck, and scalp. <br><br>SLE is a complex, multisystem autoimmune disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical features. Key dermatological manifestations include the characteristic <strong>malar rash</strong>, appearing as <strong>butterfly-shaped erythema</strong> over the cheeks and bridge of the nose sparing the nasolabial folds, and <strong>discoid lupus erythematous</strong>. <strong>Joint symptoms</strong> are prevalent, with patients frequently experiencing pain and swelling, particularly in the small joints of the hands. <strong>Hematological abnormalities</strong> in SLE include anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. <strong>Lupus nephritis</strong> is considered a <strong>severe complication of SLE</strong> and patients present with, manifests as proteinuria and hematuria.

These medications reduce the production of uric aci, and prevent future attacks.

To prevent this, patients should take low-dose anti-inflammatories for 2 to 4 weeks prior to the initiation of ULT.<br><br><strong>Serum urate levels</strong> should be checked one month after initiating therapy with ULT.

Adjustments include increasing the dose of the current xanthine oxidase inhibitor, switching to a different xanthine oxidase inhibitor, or adding a uricosuric agent such as probenecid.
