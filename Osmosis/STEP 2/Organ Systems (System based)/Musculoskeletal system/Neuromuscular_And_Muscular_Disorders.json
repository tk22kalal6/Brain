      "text": "A 25-year-old man comes to the office to be evaluated for right buttock pain for three months. The patient describes the pain as dull with intermittent radiation to the right thigh and leg. The pain increases with prolonged sitting. He is currently training for a marathon that requires downhill running. The patient does not have back pain, bowel or bladder symptoms, or trauma history. Past medical history is unremarkable. Vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination demonstrates tenderness to palpation of the right buttock. Lower extremity strength is 5/5 bilaterally, and sensation is intact. Deep tendon reflexes are +2 bilaterally. Straight leg raise is positive on the right lower extremity. Forceful internal rotation at the hip with the thigh extended reproduces the pain. Plain radiographs and an MRI of the spine and pelvis are unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

This, in combination with a positive <strong>Freibergs test</strong> (reproduction of pain with forceful internal rotation of the hip with the thigh extended), is suggestive of <strong>Piriformis syndrome. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Piriformis syndrome refers to a musculoskeletal condition that results from <strong>compression of the sciatic nerve</strong> as it passes <strong>through the piriformis.</strong> Compression can result from shortening, hypertrophy, or spasm of the piriformis muscle secondary to <strong>trauma or overuse.</strong> Symptoms include pain in the buttock area, accompanied by sciatica-like pain, numbness, and weakness that traverses the back of the thigh, calf, and foot. Pain from piriformis syndrome is often worse when walking upstairs, after sitting, or while walking or running. Physical examination demonstrates<strong> tenderness in the sciatic notch</strong> and often with direct palpation over the piriformis. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lumbar spinal stenosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Lumbar spinal stenosis presents with neurogenic claudication (i.e. buttock and leg pain, discomfort, sensory loss, and weakness with walking, standing, or maintaining certain postures). This patient&#8217;s unilateral buttock pain exacerbated with sitting and tenderness to palpation at the buttocks is consistent with piriformis syndrome.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ L1 radiculopathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> L1 radiculopathy results from intervertebral disc herniation at the L1 level. Symptoms involve pain, paresthesias, sensory loss in the inguinal region, and slight weakness with hip flexion. Unilateral buttock pain with a positive Freibergs test is suggestive of piriformis syndrome.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Piriformis syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Femoroacetabular impingement:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome can result from abnormal contact between the anterior femoral head and the acetabular rim. Patients present with insidious onset of groin pain that worsens with activity. Symptoms are most noticeable after sitting with hips flexed to 90 degrees for a &#160;prolonged period (e.g a plane ride). Buttock pain is less common, and plain radiographs can often identify the impingement.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Iliotibial band syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Iliotibial band (ITB) syndrome refers to an overuse injury of the lateral knee that occurs primarily in runners.

MRI imaging demonstrates a <strong>complete tear of the supraspinatus tendon</strong>. Of the physical examination techniques listed, the one most likely to demonstrate a positive finding is the <strong>empty can test</strong>. <br><br>The shoulder is made up of the rotator cuff muscles, the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular ligaments, and connective tissue. In the assessment of shoulder pain, several tests can aid in the diagnosis of a specific injury. For instance, the <strong>empty can test&#160;</strong>(also termed <strong>Jobe test</strong>) has a high specificity for supraspinatus injuries. In this test, the patient is placed in a standing or sitting position, and the arm is raised parallel to the ground in the scapular plane and fully internally rotated. Once rotated, the clinician pushes down on either the wrist or elbow, and the patient is instructed to resist the downward force. Weakness or pain in the tested shoulder represents a positive test result. <br><br>Another test known as the <strong>full can test</strong> also assesses for supraspinatus instability. It is performed in the same manner as the empty can test, with the only difference being that the patient's arms are not rotated to full internal rotation (e.g. thumbs are up).<br><br>Additional tests include the <strong>Neer test</strong> and <strong>Hawkins-Kennedy test</strong>, which assess for subacromial impingement syndrome. The <strong>Scarf test</strong> assesses for stability of the acromioclavicular joint and is commonly positive with partial or full tears of the acromioclavicular or coracoclavicular ligaments. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Empty can test &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lift off test &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The lift off test is performed to assess for instability of the subscapularis.

Physical examination demonstrates a positive <strong>McMurray test</strong> with external rotation of the right knee and valgus stress applied. These findings are consistent with a <strong>medial meniscus injury</strong>.<br><br>Meniscal injuries are a common injury in athletes. This injury often arises from a <strong>twisting force</strong> applied to the knee while the foot is planted. Patients experience varying degrees of pain following the injury, with some patients seeking care immediately while others seek care weeks to months after the inciting event. Patients often recall a sensation of the knee &#8220;popping,&#8221; &#8220;clicking,&#8221; and a feeling that the knee &#8220;gives way&#8221; with specific movements. Additionally, movements that involve twisting, such as pivoting while running, often exacerbate the pain. &#160; <br><br>Clinically, patients may have joint line tenderness, inability to squat or kneel, loss of smooth passive knee motion, and joint effusion if presenting soon after the injury. In addition, patients may have a positive <strong>McMurray test</strong>. This test is performed when the examiner flexes the knee to maximal flexion beyond 90&#176; and then extends the knee with internal rotation of the tibia and a varus stress, then returns the knee to maximal flexion and extends the knee with external rotation of the tibia and a valgus stress. Pain or catching/locking with internal rotation and varus stress indicates a lateral meniscal tear, whereas pain or catching/locking with <strong>external rotation and valgus stress</strong> as seen in this patient indicates a <strong>medial meniscus tear</strong>. An additional physical examination maneuver to test for meniscal tears is the <strong>Thessaly test</strong>. The patient stands on the affected leg with the knee flexed at 5&#176; and then 20&#176; while the patient actively rotates the knee and the whole body externally and internally using the knee as the pivot point. Joint line pain or discomfort or clicking indicates a positive test. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Medial meniscus injury:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lateral meniscus injury:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A lateral meniscus injury would be suspected if the McMurray test reproduces pain or clicking with internal rotation of the right knee and varus stress not external rotation and valgus stress as seen in this patient. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Anterior cruciate ligament injury:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient has a negative Lachman test making it unlikely that he has an underlying anterior cruciate ligament injury.
