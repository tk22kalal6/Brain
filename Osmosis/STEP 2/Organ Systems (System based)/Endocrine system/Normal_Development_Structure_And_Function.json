      "solution": "This patient has a <strong>family history of elevated cholesterol</strong> and <strong>premature coronary artery disease</strong> in her father. The combination of her family history and an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL suggests a diagnosis of <strong>familial hypercholesterolemia</strong>, which is characterized by extremely high LDL-C and early onset atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. This condition is caused by mutations in genes responsible for the catabolism of LDL-C.<br><br>When evaluating a patient with dyslipidemia, it is important to obtain a detailed medical history, which can reveal a history of atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD), such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease. Risk factors for ASCVD, such as smoking, diabetes, and hypertension should be asked about. Along with family history of dyslipidemia or ASCVD. <br><br>Physical examination findings in patients with dyslipidemia may be unremarkable or can reveal findings that correlate with risk factors. For example, a patient with hypertension may have elevated blood pressure on examination. In some cases of very high cholesterol, <strong>cutaneous xanthomas</strong> may be present. These are <strong>lipid deposits</strong> within the skin and can include <strong>xanthelasmas&#160;</strong>(which are common and may be present with or without hyperlipidemia) and tendinous xanthomas (which are specific to inherited or acquired dyslipidemia). Although not present in all patients with hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia, their presence can serve as a unique indicator of an underlying lipid disorder.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/opTDlHJ0Qmi6VEyY5faViDhiRoanDJIq/_.png\"></div><br><strong><sup>Tendinous xanthomas; Image reproduced from Wiki Commons</sup></strong><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/WA9M9DPZTO24a4tWCZC9XwcVTEqZLVj_/_.jpg\"></div><br><sup><strong>&#160;Xantheslesmas; Image reproduced from Flickr Commons&#160;</strong>&#160;</sup><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Xanthomas:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acanthosis nigricans:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient likely has familial hypercholesterolemia. Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterized by dark, thick, and velvety patches of skin that appear on the neck, armpits, groin, and other areas where the skin folds or creases.

A risk score less than 5% is low risk and managed with <strong>lifestyle modifications</strong>. A risk score between 5-7.5% is borderline risk. This is also managed with lifestyle modifications; however, the patient should be counseled on the option for statin therapy if it aligns with their goals. A risk score between 7.5-20% is moderate risk, and moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated. A risk score greater than 20% is high risk, and high-intensity statin should be initiated.

      "solution": "This patient presents for management of his cholesterol. Lipid panel shows LDL-C of 210 mg/dL. When determining the treatment for hyperlipidemia, <strong>assessment for clinical ASCVD</strong> should be done. Clinically significant ASCVD includes acute coronary syndrome, history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, history of revascularization, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. If present, patients with hyperlipidemia qualify for treatment with a high-intensity statin. For patients like this one without clinical ASCVD and <strong>severe dyslipidemia (LDL-C &#8805; 190 mg/dl)</strong>, treatment with statins can reduce the risk of developing ASCVD; therefore, they should be started on a <strong>high-intensity statin</strong>. All patients with severe dyslipidemia should have a work up for <strong>familial hypercholesterolemia</strong>.<br><br>All patients with hyperlipidemia should receive guidance on lifestyle modifications to their diet and physical activity. Dietary recommendations should include increasing intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Physical activity recommendations should aim for moderate to vigorous physical activity three to four times a week for at least 40 minutes.<br><br>All patients with hyperlipidemia on therapy should have their lipid levels <strong>rechecked 4-12 weeks</strong> after initiating statin treatment. If the LDL-C level remains <strong>equal to or greater than 100 mg/dl</strong>, it is important to check for any challenges the patient may be having with taking the statin medication. If the patient is taking the medication as prescribed and is on the maximal amount of statin medication they can tolerate, adding <strong>ezetimibe </strong>is a reasonable option. Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor. If the LDL-C level on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe remains greater than 100 mg/dl, a <strong>PCSK-9 inhibitor</strong> (like alirocumab or evolocumab) can be considered. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ High-intensity statin with lifestyle modifications:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s LDL-C is 210 mg/dl which means he has severe dyslipidemia.
