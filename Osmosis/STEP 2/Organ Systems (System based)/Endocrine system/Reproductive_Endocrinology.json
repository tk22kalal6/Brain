She has a history of less severe recurrent painful episodes in her long bones since childhood, and she had frequent middle ear infections as a child. She was adopted; she knows her biological mother was a Black woman of Nigerian descent who had a history of anemia, but she is unsure of the details. She is not sexually active. Her temperature is 39.2&#176;C (102.5&#176;F), blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, respiratory rate is 21/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Physical examination reveals pallor and scleral icterus. The left thigh is swollen, erythematous, warm, and tender to palpation. Blood culture reveals gram-negative rods. MRI of the thigh shows a focal area of increased signal intensity with surrounding edema. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism?",

Hemoglobin electrophoresis</strong> can be used to diagnose SCD and will show the <strong>presence of HbS and reduced or absent hemoglobin A levels. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>SCD is an <strong>autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy</strong> caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene, which leads to the <strong>synthesis of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS)&#160;</strong>instead of normal hemoglobin A, which results in sickling of red blood cells. The severe pain in this patient&#8217;s lower back and hips indicates a <strong>vaso-occlusive crisis,&#160;</strong>which is a hallmark of SCD, caused by obstruction of small blood vessels by sickled RBCs leading to tissue ischemia and infarction.
