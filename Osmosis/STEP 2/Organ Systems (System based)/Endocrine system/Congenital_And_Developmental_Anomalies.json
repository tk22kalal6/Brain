      "text": "A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency department for evaluation of palpitations. A screening electrocardiogram demonstrates supraventricular tachycardia at a heart rate of 160. While the patient is being attached to the monitor, the physician instructs the patient to forcefully exhale against a closed mouth while pinching the nose, which results in termination of the arrhythmia. Stimulation of which of the following nerves is responsible for the change in this patient&#8217;s clinical course? &#160;",

      "solution": "This patient who presents with supraventricular tachycardia is able to abate the arrhythmia via stimulation of the <strong>vagus nerve (CN X)</strong> in the middle and inner ear. The auricular branch of the vagus nerve is also known as <strong>Alderman's nerve&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;Arnold's nerve</strong>.<br><br>In the context of ear anatomy, the vagus nerve supplies the inferior and posterior aspects of the external auditory canal, the concavity of the concha, as well as the lateral surface of the tympanic membrane in a subset of the population. Stimulation of these anatomic structures via valsalva maneuver, cerumen impaction, or tactile stimulation can concurrently <strong>stimulate associated reflexes of the vagus nerve</strong>. Ultimately, this may produce symptoms such as coughing, vomiting, syncope, or bradycardia. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ CN X &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ CN IX &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>In the context of ear anatomy, CN IX supplies the mastoid air cells, middle ear, and medial surface of the tympanic membrane.
