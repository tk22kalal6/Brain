Examination of the eyes may reveal conjunctival injection and clear drainage. <strong>Infectious features are typically absent;</strong> however, allergic rhinitis increases the risk of sinusitis and otitis media. Some medications, such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists can induce nasal symptoms that mimic those of allergic rhinitis.
