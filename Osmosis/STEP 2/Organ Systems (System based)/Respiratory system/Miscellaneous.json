Together, these findings are concerning for <strong>flail chest</strong>. Given he is hemodynamically stable and without signs of active bleeding, the next best step includes <strong>adequate analgesia</strong>. <br><br>A flail chest occurs when <strong>three or more ribs fracture in two or more places</strong>, allowing a segment of the thoracic wall to move freely. During normal inspiration, the thoracic wall expands outwards and increases its diameter, whereas during expiration, it decreases its diameter to expel air. With flail chest, <strong>paradoxical movement</strong> occurs such that during inspiration, the free segment moves inward, and during expiration, it moves outward. A flail chest is an extremely painful injury and may induce hypoventilation due to a patient&#8217;s reluctance to breathe adequately through the pain.<br><br>Management wise, the first step is to ensure <strong>adequate pain control</strong> and provide <strong>supplemental oxygen</strong> if needed. <strong>Positive pressure ventilation</strong> can be used to force the flail chest segment out during inspiration, should the patient decompensate.

These findings are consistent with a<strong>&#160;traumatic pneumothorax. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>In traumatic pneumothorax, air can pass from the outside atmosphere into the pleural space, resulting in a compressive force on the lung. Patients typically present with <strong>tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, diminished breath sounds,&#160;</strong>and signs of trauma. &#160;<br><br>In the absence of tension physiology (discussed below), patients with pneumothorax should have a tube thoracostomy performed, with the placement of a chest tube on the affected side at the <strong>fourth or fifth intercostal space, midaxillary line</strong>. This landmark can be approximated by following the nipple line to the midaxillary line on the affected side. With the correct placement, a gush of air is often audible. Subsequent lung re-expansion leads to improvement in oxygenation, heart rate, and blood pressure. &#160;<br><br>When performing this procedure, care should be taken to identify the appropriate anatomic space. If placed too high, there is a risk of damage to the brachial plexus and subclavian vasculature. If placed too low, there is an increased risk of damage to intra-abdominal organs.

Among the answer choices, only <strong>coronary artery bypass surgery</strong> is typically performed via a median sternotomy. <br><br>A median sternotomy is a surgical approach in which the sternum is split in the median plane and retracted. This allows surgeons to access organs within the thoracic cavity, such as the heart and lungs. Procedures that may involve a median sternotomy include <strong>heart transplantation, surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects,&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;pneumonectomy</strong>.

First, secure the <strong>A</strong>irway while stabilizing the cervical spine. If patients can speak clearly, their airway is secured. Once you have secured the airway, ensure adequate <strong>B</strong>reathing or ventilation by assessing oxygenation, ventilation, and chest wall injuries and by providing supplemental oxygen or other necessary measures (ie thoracostomy for tension pneumothorax). Next, assess <strong>C</strong>irculation and obtain 2 large bore IVs or IO access while continuously monitoring vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure. Then, assess <strong>D</strong>isability and neurologic status by calculating the <strong>Glasgow coma scale</strong> (GCS) and examining the pupils, spine, and assessing for sensory and motor deficits.
