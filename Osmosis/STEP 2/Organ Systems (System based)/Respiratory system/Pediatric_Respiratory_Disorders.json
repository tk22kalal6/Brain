In unstable patients, initial priorities include airway and breathing support, circulatory stabilization with <strong>IV fluids</strong>, establishing <strong>vascular access</strong>, and initiating <strong>broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics</strong>. Continuous <strong>vital sign monitoring</strong> is essential, and <strong>supplemental oxygen</strong> should be provided if indicated. Once the patient is stabilized, a focused history, physical examination, and laboratory studies including CBC, urinalysis, and urine culture should be obtained. <br><br>When a patient does not improve or worsens despite appropriate therapy, further evaluation is warranted. Less common etiologies should be considered, and targeted diagnostic testing pursued.

She most likely has a pudendal nerve injury due to compression of the nerve fibers during delivery. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The pudendal nerve arises from the sacral plexus's<strong>&#160;S2, S3, S4</strong> ventral rami. It originates in the pelvis, courses through the greater foramen to enter the gluteal region, then enters the perineum through the lesser sciatic foramen. It is related to the<strong>&#160;ischial spine,</strong> which serves as the bony landmark for transvaginal pudendal nerve block for episiotomies during the second stage of labor. The perineum courses through the pudendal canal and terminates into its branches in the ischioanal fossa. The pudendal nerve carries sensory, motor, and autonomic fibers and supplies the <strong>skin of the perineum</strong> (including the anal canal below the pectinate line) and the clitoris with muscular branches to the anterior external anal sphincter and the urogenital muscles. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In the second stage of labor, the descent of the fetal head causes significant compression and stretching of the pudendal nerve, resulting in <strong>pudendal neuralgia.</strong> This is especially prevalent in cases of difficult or prolonged labor. It is more likely to be encountered following an operative delivery or an extensive perineal tear. Symptoms of pudendal neuralgia include pain, numbness, and paresthesias in the distribution of the pudendal nerve in addition to urinary and anal sphincter dysfunction resulting in urinary and fecal incontinence and dyspareunia. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Pudendal nerve injury&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypoestrogenism due to prolactinemia&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Patients who breastfeed have elevated prolactin levels that suppress GnRH release from the hypothalamus. &#160;This results in low levels of estrogen, FSH, LH, and vulvovaginal atrophy. &#160; Atrophic vulvovaginal changes can cause dyspareunia.

She most likely has postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. PPH (Postpartum hemorrhage) is a postpartum complication and an obstetric emergency. PPH is classically defined as blood loss &gt;500 ml within 24 hours of birth. However, it is clinically assessed by blood loss that is significant enough to cause signs and symptoms of hypovolemia. &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>The most common causes of postpartum hemorrhage include an atonic uterus or trauma to the birth canal. Atonicity of the uterus relates to the failure of contraction and retraction of the uterine sinuses by the uterine musculature following delivery of the fetus and the placenta. Risk factors for an atonic uterus include multiparity, overdistention of the uterus as seen in multiple pregnancies, hydramnios and macrosomia, prolonged labor, anesthesia, and precipitate labor. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Initial management includes fluid replacement, uterine massage, and the cervix and vagina inspection to rule out traumatic PPH. Oxytocin and misoprostol are administered to promote uterine contraction. If the uterus remains atonic, surgical intervention may be warranted. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The blood<strong>&#160;supply of the uterus&#160;</strong>is primarily provided by the <strong>uterine arteries and the ovarian arteries</strong>. The uterine artery is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. It runs medially towards the cervix in the broad ligament, crosses the ureter at the lateral border of the cervix and the lateral fornix of the vagina, and ascends towards the hilus of the ovary to anastomose with the ovarian artery. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Surgical intervention in PPH can involve selective ligation/embolization of<strong>&#160;bilateral uterine arteries&#160;</strong>at the lateral border between the upper and lower uterine segment. If bleeding continues,<strong>&#160;ligation of the ovarian arteries</strong> is done at the infundibulopelvic ligaments. If this fails, ligation of the <strong>anterior division of the internal iliac artery</strong> may be done to reduce distal blood flow. Abdominal aortic compression is a temporizing measure to reduce blood flow to the uterus. If the uterus fails to contract and to bleed continues despite the above measures, the decision to perform a <strong>hysterectomy&#160;</strong>may be necessary. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Uterine artery in the broad ligament&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ovarian artery in the infundibulopelvic ligament&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The blood supply of the uterus includes the uterine arteries and ovarian arteries.

Given her history of gestational hypertension, she was started on <strong>methyldopa</strong>, which is one of the four medications commonly used to treat hypertension in pregnancy (hydralazine, methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine). Methyldopa is associated with drug-induced lupus.<br><br>Methyldopa works via a complex mechanism of action. First, methyldopa is converted into methyldopamine by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. Second, it moves into synaptic vesicles, where methyldopamine is converted to methylnorepinephrine. Third, methylnorepinephrine accumulates within the vesicles and pushes norepinephrine into the cytoplasm.

In mixed deficiency anemia, both iron deficiency and vitamin B12 or folate deficiency can also lead to a normal MCV. Pregnant patients with macrocytic anemia are most likely to have <strong>B12/folate deficiency. &#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Anemia of chronic disease</strong> develops in patients with significant medical comorbidities or prolonged inflammation. It is common in patients with<strong> advanced renal disease</strong> as well as in patients with autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Chronic inflammation results in upregulated hepcidin levels, which inhibit iron release from macrophages and intestinal absorption of iron. Patients have low circulating iron but sufficient storage of iron, leading to<strong> low serum iron levels, low total iron-binding capacity, low to normal transferrin saturation (TSAT),</strong> and normal to<strong> high ferritin levels </strong>(as ferritin is a proinflammatory marker). Treatment is aimed at controlling the underlying disease or cause of inflammation. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ High ferritin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ HIgh serum total iron binding capacity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A low serum total iron-binding capacity is seen with anemia of chronic disease, which is the most likely cause of anemia in this patient with chronic kidney disease and normocytic anemia.`</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ HIgh transferrin-saturation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A low to normal transferrin saturation (TSAT) is seen with anemia of chronic disease, which is the most likely cause of anemia in this patient with chronic kidney disease and normocytic anemia.`</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Low folate level:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A low folate level generally results in macrocytic anemia.

The pelvic ultrasound finding of a <strong>complex, heterogeneous intrauterine mass containing multiple small cysts</strong> supports this diagnosis. The cysts result from the swelling of chorionic villi.

Although definitive diagnosis requires histopathologic examination of evacuated uterine contents, ultrasound can be a useful diagnostic modality. Besides intrauterine findings consistent with a molar pregnancy, the presence of thin-walled <strong>multilocular cysts,</strong> suggestive of <strong>theca-lutein cysts</strong>, in the ovaries further supports the diagnosis.

Management of preterm labor depends on the&#160;<strong>gestational age</strong>&#160;and is detailed in the table&#160;above. At&#160;33 weeks&#160;EGA, the most&#160;appropriate initial&#160;medication regimen includes&#160;<strong>betamethasone, nifedipine, and penicillin</strong>. A neonatal consult is also recommended.&#160;<br><br>There are 4 primary categories of medications&#160;to consider for preterm labor patients. First,&#160;<strong>steroids&#160;</strong>are&#160;indicated&#160;in all patients&#160;in preterm labor&#160;with a potentially&#160;viable&#160;fetus&#160;to promote fetal lung maturation and reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intracranial hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and death. Options include&#160;<strong>betamethasone and dexamethasone</strong>.&#160;<br><br>The second category is&#160;<strong>tocolytics</strong>. These medications are used to slow contractions for up to&#160;48 hours&#160;in patients with a potentially&#160;viable&#160;fetus at &lt;&#160;34 weeks&#160;EGA&#160;to&#160;get the maximum benefit from the course of steroids. The primary tocolytics used are&#160;<strong>indomethacin&#160;</strong>and&#160;<strong>nifedipine</strong>; terbutaline can also be considered. Importantly,&#160;<strong><span>indomethacin is contraindicated after&#160;</span><span>3</span><span>2 weeks</span></strong>&#160;due to the risk of constriction of the ductus arteriosus in utero, oligohydramnios, and NEC.&#160;<br><br>The final two categories are&#160;<strong>magnesium sulfate</strong>,&#160;which is&#160;indicated&#160;to reduce the risk of cerebral palsy in patients &lt;&#160;32 weeks, and&#160;<strong>GBS prophylaxis</strong>, which is&#160;indicated&#160;for all patients who have an unknown GBS status or are known to be positive.&#160;&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Betamethasone, nifedipine, and penicillin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Dexamethasone, indomethacin, magnesium sulfate, and penicillin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;This regimen would be&#160;appropriate for&#160;patients less than 32 weeks EGA.
