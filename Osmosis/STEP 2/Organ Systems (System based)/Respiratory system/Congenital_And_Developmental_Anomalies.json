When toxoplasmosis is suspected, as in this patient who has a cat and obstetric ultrasound, findings of intracranial calcifications, microcephaly, and fetal growth restriction, <strong>IgM and IgG antibody testing</strong> is indicated. However, following an acute infection, high titers of <strong>both IgG and IgM</strong> can persist for years; therefore, <strong>IgG avidity testing</strong> and/or <strong>serial IgG titers</strong> are needed to differentiate acute from remote infections. Avidity assays measure the binding strength between the IgG antibodies and the virus, which increases over time. <strong><span>Low IgG&#160;</span><span>avidity</span></strong> or <strong>increasing IgG titers</strong> indicates a <strong>recent&#160;</strong>infection, while <strong>high IgG avidity</strong> or <strong>stable titers</strong> indicates a <strong>remote&#160;</strong>infection. <br><br>Toxoplasmosis is caused by the intracellular parasite <strong><em>Toxoplasma gondii</em></strong>, which can be contracted from <span>raw</span><span>&#160;or&#160;</span><span>undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk, contaminated soil or water</span><strong>,&#160;</strong>and <strong>exposure to cat feces</strong>.

They should be treated with <strong>antimicrobial&#160;</strong>therapy to <strong>reduce the risk of vertical transmission</strong>. <strong>Spiramycin&#160;</strong>is indicated for infections in the first trimester, while <strong>pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine</strong> should be used after 14 weeks. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ IgG avidity testing&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Amniocentesis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s clinical presentation is most consistent with toxoplasmosis.

Temperature is 36.5&#176;C (97.8&#176;F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 118/76 mmHg. On physical exam, the fundal height reaches the umbilicus. Pelvic ultrasound shows an enlarged cystic placenta and a non-viable fetus. The patient undergoes suction dilation and curettage (D&C). The pathology report shows the fetus had a 69,XXY karyotype, and multiple focal areas of villous edema and mild atypia of trophoblast cells. Following the procedure, the obstetrician/gynecologist recommends weekly bloodwork, with results shown in the table below.

Therefore, hCG levels are followed <strong>every 1 to 2 weeks</strong> after uterine evacuation of a molar pregnancy. <strong>Rising or plateauing levels</strong> indicate persistent trophoblastic tissue and confirms GTN. <br><br>Once GTN is diagnosed, patients must be evaluated for signs of metastasis, which is common. GTN typically originates in the uterus and spreads first to the vagina and/or lungs, which is why the initial evaluation should include a pelvic exam, ultrasound, and CXR. <strong>Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis </strong>and/or<strong> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain</strong> are indicated if there are signs of metastasis on the initial evaluation (e.g., vaginal lesions, abnormal findings on CXR, neurologic exam, liver function tests).<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Comprehensive exam, pelvic ultrasound, and chest radiograph:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Comprehensive exam, pelvic ultrasound, imaging of brain, chest, and abdomen/pelvis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The patient&#8217;s plateauing hCG levels meet criteria for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).

This condition refers to varying degrees of abnormal placental adherence to or invasion through the uterine wall. Ultrasound findings include <strong>loss of the hypoechoic clear zone</strong> between the <strong>placenta and myometrium, placental location over prior uterine scars</strong>, multiple placental vascular lacunae, retroplacental <strong>myometrial thinning</strong>, and <strong>placental invasion</strong> into the myometrium and/or bladder. <br><br>A detailed sonographic evaluation of the placenta is warranted in any patient with risk factors for PAS, the most significant being <strong>placenta previa</strong> and history of <strong>multiple cesarean deliveries</strong>. However, <strong>a normal antenatal ultrasound does not exclude PAS</strong>. Occasionally, patients with an unremarkable antenatal ultrasound will develop profuse vaginal bleeding during the third stage of labor (i.e. placental separation) with failure to deliver the placenta. In that scenario, unexpected PAS should be considered, and a bedside ultrasound may reveal a <strong>hypervascular echogenic intrauterine mass</strong>, consistent with retained placental tissue.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Loss of the hypoechoic clear zone between the placenta and myometrium:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Retroplacental fluid collection:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This finding suggests placental abruption, for which this patient does not have relevant risk factors.

This anatomic variant increases the risk of vasa previa, umbilical cord rupture, and fetal loss.

Because this patient has placenta previa and multiple prior cesarean deliveries, the risk of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) is elevated. &#160;On antenatal ultrasound, PAS is most likely to manifest as loss of the hypoechoic clear zone between the placenta and myometrium.</span></div>",
