Assessment should include&#160;whether&#160;there is movement of the forehead, eyebrow sagging, or inability to raise the eyebrow or close the eye.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Upper motor neuron innervation is&#160;<strong>bilateral for the upper facial muscles&#160;</strong>and <strong>unilateral for the lower facial muscles.</strong>&#160;Therefore, <strong>forehead sparing</strong> is indicative of an <strong>upper motor neuron lesion</strong>, or <strong>central cause,&#160;</strong>which warrants prompt neuroimaging.&#160;A brain MRI is preferred given its lack of associated radiation exposure. Once a central etiology is suspected, further neurodiagnostic investigations can identify the underlying etiology; these may include CSF analysis in the case of infection or demyelination or a blood culture or biopsy in the case of an abscess or tumor. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>When the&#160;<strong>forehead is involved</strong> in the deficit and there is weakness in both the upper and lower portions of the face on the involved side, this&#160;indicates&#160;<strong>p</strong><strong>eripheral facial palsy.&#160;</strong>Further investigation for a <strong>lower motor neuron lesion&#160;</strong>of the facial nerves should be performed. Peripheral facial nerve palsy can be caused by Guillain-Barre syndrome, Lyme disease, Ramsay-Hund syndrome, or Bell palsy. &#160; <br><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>While acute ischemia and intracranial hemorrhage are&#160;in&#160;the differential diagnosis for this patient with stroke risk factors&#160;and a&#160;unilateral&#160;facial droop,&#160;this patient may&#160;have a peripheral cranial nerve&#160;VII&#160;palsy, which could be&#160;determined&#160;by initially&#160;performing a&#160;more robust physical examination&#160;including assessment of the&#160;frontalis and orbicularis oculi function bilaterally&#160;to determine if there is forehead involvement indicating a peripheral nerve palsy.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Assessment of frontalis and orbicularis oculi function bilaterally:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Oral corticosteroids:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Corticosteroids</span><span>&#160;</span><span>are used</span><span>&#160;in the management&#160;</span><span>of</span><span>&#160;</span><span>idiopathic</span><span>&#160;</span><span>peripheral</span><span>&#160;cranial nerve&#160;</span><span>VII</span><span>&#160;palsy</span><span>&#160;(</span><span>Bell palsy</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>While this&#160;</span><span>is&#160;</span><span>in</span><span>&#160;the differential diagnosis,&#160;</span><span>a detailed&#160;</span><span>evaluation&#160;</span><span>to&#160;</span><span>det</span><span>ermine</span><span>&#160;if there is forehead sparing&#160;</span><span>is necessary since this would&#160;</span><span>indicat</span><span>e</span><span>&#160;</span><span>upper motor nerve involvement</span><span>&#160;</span><span>necessitating</span><span>&#160;brain imaging</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Examination of the skin and external auditory canal on the left side:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Examination of the skin may reveal skin lesions&#160;</span><span>cons</span><span>istent with</span><span>&#160;left-</span><span>sided</span><span>&#160;herpes</span><span>&#160;zo</span><span>s</span><span>ter</span><span>&#160;</span><span>O</span><span>ticus</span><span>&#160;(</span><span>R</span><span>amsay</span><span>&#160;Hunt syndrome</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;which&#160;</span><span>can&#160;</span><span>cause&#160;</span><span>peripheral&#160;</span><span>cranial</span><span>&#160;nerve VII</span><span>I&#160;</span><span>deficit</span><span>&#160;b</span><span>ecause of its proximity to cranial nerve VII</span><span>&#160;</span><span>ips</span><span>i</span><span>lateral</span><span>&#160;facial paralysis.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>However,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>e</span><span>valuation of upper motor nerve involvement&#160;</span><span>with a</span><span>ssessment of frontalis and orbicularis oculi function</span><span>&#160;</span><span>to</span><span>&#160;</span><span>determine</span><span>&#160;if the deficit is central or peripheral should be performed first.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head without contrast:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong>&#160;MRI of the brain&#160;would help&#160;determine&#160;the cause of&#160;central&#160;etiologies&#160;of&#160;unilateral facial palsy&#160;but would be unnecessary in a patient with&#160;evidence of&#160;peripheral&#160;cranial nerve VII palsy.&#160;Therefore,&#160;this patient should first have&#160;an&#160;assessment&#160;of frontalis and orbicularis oculi function bilaterally to&#160;determine&#160;if the palsy is central or peripheral.&#160;</span></div>",

In some individuals, vertebral compression occurs slowly over time and is asymptomatic. Those with acute fractures usually present with an acute onset of midline back pain which may radiate to the flank, anterior abdomen, or posterior superior iliac spine. Radiation to the legs, as seen in disc herniation, is uncommon. &#160; <br><br>Vertebral compression fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fracture.

Plain X-rays can detect bony abnormalities like spinal fractures, spondylolysis, and spondylolisthesis. Spondylolysis often presents with a \"Scotty dog\" sign on oblique X-rays, while spondylolisthesis shows vertebral displacement.

These include thoracic and sacral kyphosis. Kyphosis is an increased front to back curve of the spine giving a convex curve in the spine (i.e., convexity towards the back of the spine). in those areas.

These findings raise concern for an <strong>abdominal aortic aneurysm</strong> (AAA). An abdominal <strong>ultrasound&#160;</strong>can establish the diagnosis. &#160; <br><br>AAA is the most common type of true arterial aneurysm, which is defined as a segmental, full-thickness dilation of a blood vessel that is greater than 50% of the normal diameter. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves alterations in the vascular wall, which leads to a loss of vascular structural proteins and reduction of wall strength. Risk factors include older age, male gender, cigarette smoking, Caucasian race, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and family history of large artery aneurysms (e.g., iliac, femoral, popliteal). &#160; <br><br>The majority of patients are asymptomatic and diagnosis is made via screening or is discovered incidentally on routine physical examination. Those with symptoms often present with abdominal, back, or flank pain. When a rupture occurs, the classic presentation is severe pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. When addressing back pain, it is important to keep in mind visceral pain as a differential diagnosis. Current guidelines include a single screening for AAA in men ages 65 to 75 who: 1) have smoked, or 2) have never smoked but have a 1st-degree relative who had an AAA repair or died from an AAA rupture. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Prostate biopsy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Prostate cancer can metastasize to the spine, causing pain and compression fractures.
