Hypoxic-ischemic injury is a common consequence of cardiac arrest and can lead to loss of consciousness, absence of motor responses to stimuli, and loss of brainstem reflexes, such as <strong>absent cough or gag reflexes</strong>. Among these findings, <strong>absent brainstem reflexes</strong> are the most specific indicator of a poor neurologic outcome. <br><br>Brain death is defined as the irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem. It can result from various etiologies, such as trauma, stroke, mass effect from a lesion, infection, or severe toxic and metabolic disturbances. <br><br>On physical examination, patients with brain death are <strong>unconscious and unresponsive</strong> to visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli. They <strong>lack cerebrally-mediated motor responses</strong>, such as eye-opening or purposeful movement to painful stimuli like nail bed pressure or sternal rub. <strong>Brainstem reflexes are absent</strong>, including the <strong>pupillary, corneal, oculocephalic, oculovestibular, gag, and cough reflexes</strong>. However, spinally mediated reflexes may persist despite brain death. These can include deep tendon reflexes and movements like the Lazarus sign, characterized by spontaneous arm flexion and elevation, followed by the arms falling onto the chest. <br><br>P.S.

The key historical feature is the transiently preserved neurologic state followed by rapid deterioration, which suggests a lucid interval and is most characteristic of an <strong>epidural hematoma</strong>. <br><br>Symptoms such as <strong>headache, nausea, altered mental status</strong>, and a <strong>declining Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)</strong> score can signal rising ICP. Physical exam features may include the Cushing triad <strong>(bradycardia, hypertension, irregular respirations)</strong>, unilateral or bilateral <strong>pupil dilation, papilledema, </strong>and <strong>cranial nerve palsies</strong>. <br><br>While other intracranial pathologies such as subdural hematoma, ischemic stroke, or infection may also cause increased ICP, the <strong>tempo of symptom progression</strong> and <strong>trauma history</strong> are essential diagnostic clues. Subdural hematomas may progress more slowly. Ischemic strokes often lack an initial trauma trigger. Infectious causes usually involve fever or systemic signs. Computed tomography <strong>(CT) imaging</strong> is critical to confirm the diagnosis and identify features such as a biconvex (lentiform) hyperdensity confined by suture lines, which is classic for an epidural hematoma.

      "solution": "This patient sustained a head injury after she was struck from behind and fell backward onto the hood of a car. Notably, she was wearing a helmet. The mechanism of injury in this scenario involves anterior displacement of her neck due to the impact of the car and backward momentum of her head due to the increased weight of her head with her helmet. This pattern of injury, similar to a whiplash injury, can also cause fractures of the C2 vertebrae known as a <strong>Hangman&#8217;s fracture</strong> or <strong>traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis</strong>.<br><br>Understanding the physiopathology of a Hangman&#8217;s fracture requires an appreciation of the unique features of the C1 and C2 vertebrae. Unlike the subaxial spine, the C1 and C2 vertebrae <strong>do not possess an intervertebral disc</strong>. Stabilization of these vertebrae, therefore, occurs via unique ligaments which allow for the support and rotational flexibility of the cranium. In a fracture of C2, this specialized anatomy becomes a great obstacle due to the physical instability of the fragments, which leads to impaired healing of the fracture and the potentially life-threatening complication of spinal cord laceration if the unstable bone fragments come in contact with the spinal cord posteriorly. Cervical orthostasis is usually achieved through a Halo-vest device.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Instability of the fracture &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Avascular necrosis of the cervical foramen &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The vertebral bodies typically have abundant access to arterial blood flow, even in the setting of fractures.

      "solution": "The initial workup and management of both<strong>&#160;blunt and penetrating head trauma</strong> consists of <strong>primary and secondary surveys.</strong> In this patient, the primary survey demonstrates altered mental status (GCS 7) with an appropriately secured airway (intubated), but also reveals <strong>hypotension, tachycardia</strong>, and<strong>&#160;faintly palpable distal pulses,&#160;</strong>which is concerning for <strong>hypovolemic/hemorrhagic shock.</strong> Significant blood loss can occur in patients with <strong>penetrating head injuries,</strong> as in this patient who reportedly had significant blood loss at the scene of the injury. This is in contrast to <strong>blunt head injuries</strong> with <strong>intracranial bleeding,</strong> in which case bleeding is contained within a fixed space, and is therefore likely to result in <strong>intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation&#160;</strong>and its sequelae before there is sufficient blood loss to cause hemorrhagic shock. &#160; <br><br>In cases of <strong>penetrating traumatic brain injury (TBI),&#160;</strong>history may reveal a gunshot or foreign body, like shrapnel, penetrating trauma with loss of consciousness, amnesia, post-traumatic seizures, headaches, nausea, or vomiting. Upon examination, an open wound is present, often with exposed skull or brain matter. Neurologic exam typically demonstrates altered mental status with <strong>GCS below 15</strong> and may show dilated, unequal, non-responsive, or slowly reactive pupils. There may also be <strong>focal neurologic deficits like sensory or motor deficits.</strong> CT can help identify the foreign object and determine the extent of the injury including associated skull fractures, hematoma or intracranial bleeding, parenchymal edema, or herniation due to increased ICP. &#160; <br><br>If <strong>I</strong><strong>CP is increased,</strong> either due to parenchymal swelling,<strong>&#160;intracranial hemorrhage,</strong> or a combination of the two, you may see dilated, unequal, non-reactive, or slowly reactive pupils. You may also see a <strong>combination of hypertension and bradycardia,</strong> known as the <strong>Cushing reflex.</strong> If a patient is demonstrating signs of acutely elevated ICP, then ICP-lowering treatments such as hyperosmolar therapy and/or hyperventilation should be prioritized, as should neurosurgical intervention. However, in a patient without signs of ICP elevation, these therapies are not indicated and may cause harm.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Transfuse packed red blood cells (pRBCs):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Initiate hyperosmolar therapy&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>While hyperosmolar therapy (i.e. mannitol, hypertonic saline) is used to lower intracranial pressure (ICP), this patient is not showing signs of acutely elevated ICP and is in hemorrhagic shock.

Before proceeding with the rest of the trauma survey, it is important that all trauma patients have <strong>cervical spine stabilization/immobilization during endotracheal intubation</strong>. It should be presumed that all trauma patients have a cervical spine injury until proven otherwise and manipulation of the neck during procedures (e.g. intubation) could worsen the injury from an unstable C-spine. <br><br>Traumatic injuries to the abdomen can occur from <strong>blunt forces</strong> like <strong>shearing from rapid deceleration</strong>, or <strong>penetrating mechanisms</strong> like gunshot or stab wounds. The <strong>liver, spleen, and intestine</strong> are the most commonly injured organs when there is blunt force abdominal trauma. The most common injury when there is a traumatic abdominal penetrating injury is <strong>a major abdominal vasculature injur</strong><strong>y</strong>. Although the majority of blunt and penetrating abdominal injuries can be managed non-surgically, it is important to quickly identify life-threatening injuries like <strong>intraabdominal hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, intraabdominal visceral organ injury</strong>, unstable pelvic fracture, and diaphragmatic injury or rupture, to provide timely operative intervention. <br><br>Regardless of the injury, all patients presenting with blunt and penetrating abdominal trauma require the same approach for the <strong>primary survey</strong>. First, the <strong>airway </strong>should be assessed, and if it is compromised, it should be secured via <strong>endotracheal intubation or surgical cricothyrotomy</strong>. Next, the patient&#8217;s <strong>breathing </strong>should be assessed. Absent or diminished breath sounds suggest traumatic pneumothorax that requires chest tube placement. <strong>Circulation </strong>should be assessed, and 2 large bore IVs (or intraosseous access) should be placed while continuously monitoring vitals. If the patient is <strong>hypotensive</strong>, administering <strong>intravenous fluids or blood products</strong> should be given. Finally, the patient should be exposed to assess for additional injuries and the <strong>Glasgow coma scale</strong> should be determined.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cervical spine stabilization followed by rapid sequence intubation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Rapid sequence intubation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Rapid sequence intubation, without attention to cervical spine stabilization in a trauma patient, could potentially worsen a cervical spine injury, if one is present.

While clinical history and physical exam findings associated with each type of ICH can vary widely, certain key elements should raise suspicion for each type. These are identified during the <strong>secondary survey,</strong> which includes a <strong>brief patient history</strong> and a thorough<strong>&#160;physical exam</strong>, including a <strong>complete neurologic exam. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Epidural hematomas</strong> typically occur with blunt trauma to the<strong>&#160;temporal bone,&#160;</strong>leading to fractures. Because the middle meningeal artery is close to the temporal bone, sharp bone fragments or blunt trauma itself can injure it and cause bleeding into the epidural space. It is more common in <strong>patients who are younger than 50</strong> because, in older individuals, the dura is firmly attached to the skull. Typically, patients present with<strong>&#160;initial loss of consciousness, then a lucid period,</strong> after which their <strong>mental status deteriorates. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>In contrast, <strong>subdural hematomas</strong>, which are more common in<strong>&#160;older patients</strong> (particularly those taking <strong>anticoagulant medications)</strong> and patients with <strong>alcohol use disorder</strong>, often result from a <strong>fall with a head strike</strong>, and typically present with <strong>progressive changes in mental status</strong> (i.e. confusion, drowsiness, somnolence). <strong>Subarachnoid hemorrhages</strong> can be caused by blunt trauma to the head as well as <strong>sudden acceleration-deceleration</strong> (i.e. motor vehicle accident) and may present with <strong>severe headache</strong> and/or <strong>neck pain</strong> in addition to changes in mental status, including loss of consciousness. <strong>Intraparenchymal hemorrhages</strong> can be caused by blunt or penetrating head trauma and are often associated with focal neurologic deficits on physical exam. While not a type of ICH, <strong>diffuse axonal injury</strong> is another type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to consider, and is typically caused by <strong>sudden acceleration-deceleration</strong> and is often associated with <strong>severely depressed mental status</strong> (i.e. loss of consciousness with prolonged unresponsiveness) without focal neurologic deficits. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The modality of choice for <strong>patients with head trauma is CT,&#160;</strong>which is fast, highly sensitive, and <strong>specific for intracranial bleeds.</strong> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful in certain scenarios, such as in cases of suspected diffuse axonal injury which is less easily seen on CT; however, it is not the initial imaging modality of choice for adults with traumatic brain injuries.

A critical component of acute management for pediatric patients with TBI is to <strong>calculate a Glasgow coma scale (GCS).</strong> This score's results guide further management, including the need for advanced imaging or airway support (e.g. intubation). &#160; &#160; <br><br>TBI refers to brain damage that results from an external mechanism, like a fall, motor vehicle accident, or non-accidental trauma. When a pediatric patient presents with a TBI, it is important to stabilize them urgently, assess the severity of the injury, and determine the need for imaging. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Primary survey should be performed by assessing the <strong>airway, breathing,</strong> and <strong>circulation</strong>; and <strong>immobilization of the neck and spine&#160;</strong>should be performed. Additional supportive measures should include obtaining intravenous (IV) access, starting IV fluids, continuously monitoring vital signs, and providing supplemental oxygen if needed. Next, a <strong>Glasgow Coma Scale</strong>, or GCS should be calculated. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>This scale assesses the<strong>&#160;patient&#8217;s eye opening</strong> in addition to their <strong>motor and verbal responses</strong>, to determine their <strong>level of consciousness</strong> and need for imaging or additional airway support. In general, patients with a <strong>GCS of less than 8 should be considered for intubation</strong> (a helpful rhyme is <em>&#8220;GCS of eight means you intubate!&#8221;</em>). In addition, the GCS provides an objective measurement to assess the degree of brain injury. For children under two years of age, a modified Pediatric GCS can be used instead. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/iXtHL3UBTFKCPt7Vobzsap56T4CQuKiH/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Calculate Glasgow coma scale:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Correct</span><span>:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>See Main Explanation</span><span>.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intubate the patient&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong>&#160;</span><span>This patient, while confused, is currently protecting&#160;</span><span>his</span><span>&#160;</span><span>airway</span><span>&#160;and therefore does not need intubation.

      "solution": "This unconscious patient presents after a motor vehicle collision while cycling without a helmet and likely has a <strong>traumatic brain injury.</strong> The <strong>disability assessment&#160;</strong>in the <strong>primary survey</strong> (ABCDEs) reveals zero eye-opening, incomprehensible moaning, and the withdrawal of his extremities to painful stimuli. Therefore, he has a <strong>Glascow Coma Score (GCS) of 7,&#160;</strong>and the next step in management is <strong>endotracheal intubation. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>The initial management of any traumatically injured patient should begin with the <strong>Primary Survey,</strong> which consists of assessing the <strong>ABCDEs.</strong> First, secure the <strong>A</strong>irway and consider endotracheal intubation or a surgical airway if the patient cannot protect or maintain their airway. Be sure to immobilize the cervical spine and maintain immobilization during endotracheal intubation until a cervical spine fracture has been ruled out. Next, ensure adequate <strong>B</strong>reathing (or ventilation). Then, assess <strong>C</strong>irculation and place 2 large bore IVs or IO access while continuously monitoring vitals. Next, assess the patient&#8217;s Disability and neurologic status by calculating their GCS and assessing pupillary reflex. Keep in mind that the patient&#8217;s GCS can change rapidly. Also,<strong>&#160;remember that a GCS of 8 (or lower)&#160;</strong>means that you should <strong>intubate if you haven&#8217;t already.</strong> Finally, <strong>E</strong>xpose the patient and remove all clothing to assess for any other associated injuries, and then cover the patient with warm blankets to prevent hypothermia. &#160; <br><br><strong>Traumatic brain&#160;</strong>injury is caused by penetrating or blunt force trauma to the head, resulting in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function. The degree of injury ranges from mild to severe as classified by the Glasgow Coma Scale. This scale measures eye-opening, verbal, and motor responses to stimuli on a scale from 3 to 15, with 3 representing a comatose state, and 15 being normal. Traditionally, a GCS score of 13 to 15 represents mild TBI, 9 to 12 indicates moderate injury, and a<strong>&#160;score of 8 or below is considered to be severe. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>This patient was noted to have <strong>no eye-opening</strong>, even to painful stimuli (e.g. sternal rub), meaning his score on the &#8220;Eyes&#8221; component of the GCS was 1 (1 is the lowest score for each component of the GCS and 3 is the lowest overall GCS score). The patient<strong>&#160;moaned incomprehensibly</strong> but did not form any words, giving him a score of 2 on the &#8220;Verbal&#8221; component of the GCS. Finally, he <strong>withdrew his extremities from painful stimuli&#160;</strong>(e.g. nail bed pressure), giving him a score of 4 on the &#8220;Motor&#8221; component of the GCS. Taken together, his total GCS is 7. With a<strong>&#160;GCS of 7</strong>, this patient is at<strong>&#160;risk for aspiration or apnea</strong> and is therefore considered to have an <strong>unprotected airway.</strong> Therefore, the best next step in management is to intubate the patient before moving on to the rest of the primary survey. <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/NeFP31DVRpmMba0Fl6RjCqVFS9CIo3Ko/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ GCS 6, intubate the patient:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>While it is true that if this patient had a GCS of 6, the best next step would be to protect his airway with intubation and mechanical ventilation; however, this patient has a GCS of 7.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ GCS 7, intubate the patient:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong><strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</strong></span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ GCS 7, remove the patient&#8217;s clothing and assess for signs of injury&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This patient has a GCS of 7 and the next step should be to intubate the patient.

      "solution": "This patient presents with multiple risk factors for developing vitamin B12 deficiency (cobalamin), including <strong>chronic alcohol use</strong> and <strong>metformin</strong> use. Additionally, the physical examination demonstrates dysfunction of the <strong>spinocerebellar, lateral corticospinal, and dorsal column pathways</strong>, consistent with <strong>subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. &#160;&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Several spinal cord pathologies can be identified via a careful neurological examination to reveal the affected spinal cord tract(s). For example, <strong>subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord</strong> results when vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is absent or deficient. It may become deficient due to malabsorptive disease (e.g., Crohn disease, pernicious anemia), dietary restriction (e.g. veganism), or medications that interfere with cobalamin absorption (e.g., metformin, proton pump inhibitors). When physiologic stores of vitamin B12 are low, levels of methylmalonic acid increase, which causes degeneration of the myelin sheath of the <strong>spinocerebellar, lateral corticospinal,&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;dorsal column pathways,</strong> resulting in subacute combined degeneration (SCD). SCD manifests with symptoms of gait ataxia, paresthesias, and impaired position/vibration sense. Furthermore, SCD can cause psychiatric symptoms, including <strong>worsening depression</strong> or signs of <strong>dementia</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Additional noteworthy patterns of spinal cord pathologies include Brown-Sequard syndrome, syringomyelia, and tabes dorsalis. <strong>Brown-Sequard syndrome</strong> is a rare asymmetrical spinal cord injury pattern that occurs following a stab wound, penetrating injury, or, less commonly, fracture or blunt trauma. It results in <strong>ipsilateral loss</strong> of motor function, vibration, and proprioception due to the <strong>dorsal columns and corticospinal tract damage.</strong> In addition, contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation occurs at one or two levels below the lesion due to injury of the <strong>spinothalamic tracts</strong> (which decussate at the anterior commissure). Brown-Sequard syndrome may also be associated with <strong>Horner syndrome</strong> (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) if the lesion occurs <strong>above the T1 level</strong> and causes damage to the <strong>oculosympathetic pathway</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Syringomyelia</strong> describes a <strong>cystic cavity</strong> within the spinal cord, usually within the <strong>central canal,</strong> that can expand over time and compress the <strong>anterior white commissure,</strong> a structure directly anterior to the cervical canal. The anterior white commissure is the decussation site for the spinothalamic tracts, relaying pain and temperature sensation. As a result, syringomyelia causes a \"<strong>c</strong><strong>ape-like,\" bilateral, symmetrical loss of pain and temperature sensation</strong> in the <strong>upper extremities</strong>. Syringomyelia is associated with Chiari I malformation, a congenital condition characterized by abnormally shaped cerebellar tonsils that herniate below the level of the foramen magnum. &#160; <br><br>Lastly, <strong>tabes dorsalis</strong> arises due to infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by <em>Treponema</em> <em>pallidum</em>, the spirochete that causes syphilis. Tertiary infection of the spinal cord leads to demyelination and degeneration of the <strong>dorsal column and roots,</strong> resulting in findings of gait ataxia and incoordination. The condition takes nearly 20 years to develop after the initial infection. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Spinocerebellar tracts, lateral corticospinal tracts, and dorsal columns &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Anterior white commissure &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Chiari I malformation is characterized by cerebellar tonsillar ectopia and is most commonly associated with a syrinx within the spinal cord.

Therefore, <strong>primidone&#160;</strong>should be the preferred treatment. &#160; <br><br>Tremor is defined as a rhythmic, involuntary, oscillatory movement of a body part caused by either alternating or synchronous antagonist muscle contractions. ET is the most common cause of action tremor in adults. Classically, ET involves the hands and becomes apparent by arm movement during an activity (intention tremor) or sustained antigravity postures. The tremor can be quite disabling, affecting daily activities such as writing, drinking from a glass, and using utensils. The tremor is typically slowly progressive, bilateral, slightly asymmetric with moderate to high frequency (6 to 12 Hz). ET may also affect the head, voice, and less commonly, the face or trunk. A helpful clue often seen on USMLE exams is that ET is often <strong>relieved by small amounts of alcohol</strong> intake, and therefore, patients often self-medicate with alcoholic beverages. &#160; <br><br>The neuropathologic basis of ET remains poorly understood, but involvement of the cerebellum and brainstem (locus coeruleus) has been suggested. ET has a strong genetic component, often referred to as &#8220;familial tremor.&#8221; The diagnosis of ET is based purely upon the clinical features according to the following criteria:<br><br><ul><li>&#160;Isolated, bilateral upper limb action tremor, without other motor abnormalities&#160;</li><li>&#160;At least three years in duration&#160;</li><li>&#160;With/without a tremor in other locations (e.g., head, voice, or lower limbs)&#160;</li><li>&#160;Absence of other neurologic signs (e.g., parkinsonism, ataxia)&#160;</li></ul>First-line treatment consists of beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) or certain barbiturates (e.g. primidone).&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Levodopa/carbidopa:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Levodopa in combination with carbidopa is useful in the treatment of parkinsonian tremors but not essential tremors.

      "solution": "This patient presents with hyperkyphosis, postural instability, hypokinesia (small steps), resting tremor, and personality changes (anxiety or depression). Together, these findings are consistent with <strong>Parkinson disease</strong> (PD). PD is caused by degeneration of the substantia nigra, and disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway, thus decreasing striatal dopamine levels. Treatment of PD involves several medications that increase dopamine levels within the brain. &#160; <br><br>Initial treatment often involves a combination of <strong>carbidopa/levodopa.</strong> Unlike dopamine, levodopa can cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), which gets converted to dopamine in the CNS via decarboxylases. Dopamine decarboxylase inhibitors, like <strong>carbidopa</strong>, prevent the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery, allowing for more levodopa to cross the BBB. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Over time, dopamine becomes more efficiently metabolized by different enzymes in the brain, leading to a <strong>&#8220;wearing-off&#8221; phenomenon</strong>&#8211;where the patient&#8217;s symptoms improve when they take the medication, with effects rapidly ending after one or two hours. People also experience the <strong>&#8220;on/off&#8221; phenomenon</strong>, where patients experience sudden oscillations of symptomatic improvement followed by a rapid return to rigidity and hypokinesia. Chronic use of levodopa can also cause dyskinesias, which are uncontrolled, involuntary movements. These motor complications occur as the disease progresses, as<strong>&#160;nigrostriatal neurons lose their capacity to store and recycle dopamine.</strong> This phenomenon requires higher doses of levodopa and subsequent over-excitation of striatal neurons. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Reemergence of parkinsonism symptoms between doses:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Worsening of impulse control disorder:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Worsening of impulse control disorders (e.g., gambling, compulsive buying) can be seen in patients taking dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole and ropinirole.
