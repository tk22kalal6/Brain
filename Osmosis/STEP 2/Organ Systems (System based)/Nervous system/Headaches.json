These findings suggest <strong>greater trochanteric pain syndrome, . &#160; &#160;</strong><br><strong><br>Hip pain</strong> is a common reason for patients to seek medical care, both in the clinic and the emergency department. Patients may develop hip pain from<strong>&#160;hip joint pathology&#160;</strong>or <strong>local musculoskeletal issues causing radiation into the hip joint&#160;</strong>(e.g., lumbar or knee issues). In many cases, the history and physical examination are sufficient to make a diagnosis.&#160;Imaging (e.g., radiographs, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) is sometimes necessary when the diagnosis is unclear.&#160; &#160; <br><br>Patients with hip pain should have a thorough history evaluating the <strong>onset of pain</strong> (e.g., abrupt, or gradual, trauma, obvious inciting event), <strong>activity level, characteristics of the pain</strong> (e.g., type, severity, radiation), and <strong>any exacerbating or remitting factors.</strong> Rapid weight gain or pregnancy can be triggers for hip pain in cases such as meralgia paresthetica or lumbar radiculopathy. <strong>Obesity </strong>can predispose to pathologies such as greater trochanteric pain syndrome, as seen in this patient. Physical examination should include <strong>joint inspection and palpation, active and passive range of motion, strength testing, special tests, and maneuvers.</strong> The <strong>FABER </strong>(flexion, abduction, external rotation) and <strong>FADIR </strong>(flexion, adduction, internal rotation) maneuvers can help determine if the pain originates from the hip joint.

Baroreceptors are located within the <strong>carotid sinus</strong> and <strong>aortic arch</strong>. The glossopharyngeal nerve carries afferent impulses from the carotid sinus, whereas the vagus nerve carries afferent signals from the aortic arch. Signals from these receptors are relayed to the <strong>nucleus tractus solitarius</strong> (NTS) in the medulla. Autonomic output from the NTS is distributed via parasympathetic fibers of the vagus nerve or the sympathetic nervous system, depending on whether the body is trying to increase or decrease blood pressure. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/dsjyXTrVTVW24mE9Fk-atkPoQP_avXFN/_.png\"></div><br><br>Baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch are activated and send afferent impulses to the NTS. Efferent sympathetic fibers then relay signals from the NTS to the rest of the body, causing alterations in vasoconstriction, heart rate, and cardiac contractility. For instance, in cases of hypotension, there is diminished arterial stretch, which is noted by the baroreceptors, prompting a sympathetic response. &#160;<br><br>In contrast, <strong>hypertension&#160;</strong>causes increased stretching of the arterial walls and baroreceptors.

Afferent signals of the gag reflex are sent via the glossopharyngeal nerve, which is also responsible for sensation in the posterior one-third of the tongue. &#160;<br><br>A reflex arc typically consists of sensory receptors, the afferent sensory nerve that sends an impulse to the central nervous system, and an efferent motor nerve that transmits a motor response. The gag reflex is mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve and the vagus nerve. The <strong>gag reflex</strong> is triggered via contact with the posterior pharynx, tonsillar area, or tongue base. Afferent nerve impulses (sensory limb) are sent through the <strong>glossopharyngeal nerve</strong> (IX), which also aids in swallowing by supplying the stylopharyngeus muscle and carries taste from the posterior third of the tongue. Efferent nerve impulses (motor limb) are then sent through the pharyngeal branches of the <strong>vagus nerve</strong> (X), which also innervates muscles of the pharynx and larynx and helps regulate blood pressure. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/5EWPRNFzSg2ypj5CzOpZML5hRmGtKNgU/_.png\"></div><br><br>The gag reflex is assessed when there is reason to suspect reduced palatal strength or sensation (e.g. clinical symptoms of stroke).

Over the past six months, she mentions trouble hearing from her left ear which is more pronounced when she uses that side for a phone call. The patient also reports a ringing sensation in the ear that started around the same time. Past medical history is significant for melanoma on her back which was resected after imaging was negative for metastatic lesions. Vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Rinne test is normal. When a vibrating tuning fork is placed on the middle of the forehead, the patient hears the sound louder in the right ear. Imaging reveals an intracranial mass; histopathology of the sample is shown. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/XeZwrp3ES7W3kojlk_92cAPbSWqT3X29/_.png\"></div><br>Reproduced from Wikimedia Commons&#160; &#160;<br><br>The cells show diffuse S-100 immunoreactivity.

      "solution": "This patient with an intracranial mass, <strong>tinnitus</strong>, and <strong>sensorineural hearing loss</strong> likely has involvement of the vestibulocochlear nerve (<strong>CN VIII</strong>). The histopathology finding of <strong>highly cellular areas</strong> intermixed with <strong>myxoid&#160;</strong>regions of low cellularity, with <strong>S-100 positivity</strong>, confirms a vestibular schwannoma diagnosis. &#160;<br><br>Vestibular schwannomas are the third most common primary brain tumor in adults. They arise from the Schwann cells of the vestibular portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve (<strong>CN VIII</strong>). These benign tumors often compress the nerves originating from the cerebellopontine angle, including <strong>CN V</strong> and <strong>VII</strong>. Symptoms can vary based on the pattern of nerve involvement and include: &#160;<br><br><ul><li>&#160;Sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, disequilibrium, and ataxia (CN VIII)&#160;</li><li>&#160;Loss of ipsilateral facial sensation with interruption of the corneal reflex (CN V)&#160;</li><li>&#160;Ipsilateral facial muscle paralysis (e.g., asymmetric smile, facial droop) (CN VII)&#160;</li></ul>On magnetic resonance imaging (<strong>MRI</strong>), a well-circumscribed and encapsulated <strong>mass </strong>is usually seen near the <strong>cerebellopontine angle</strong> and the internal auditory meatus. Microscopically, vestibular schwannomas appear <strong>biphasic </strong>with areas of <strong>spindle cells</strong> that form a palisading pattern (<strong>Antoni A</strong> pattern) with a <strong>myxoid </strong>region of low cellularity (<strong>Antoni B</strong> pattern). Immunohistochemical staining for <strong>S-100</strong> is usually <strong>positive </strong>and confirms the <strong>neural crest </strong>origin of the tumor.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Oligodendrocyte:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Oligodendroglioma is a rare, slow-growing tumor that originates from oligodendrocytes. It usually grows in the frontal lobe and is calcified on morphology. Histopathology reveals neoplastic cells with round nuclei and clear cytoplasm (&#8220;fried egg cells&#8221;) with chicken-wire-like capillary pattern in between.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Schwann cells:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Astrocytes:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Low-grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma originate from astrocytes. The former most often occurs in the posterior fossa and appear as bipolar cells with hair-like projections on histopathology. Glioblastoma occurs in the cerebrum and appears as pleomorphic tumor cells with a central area of necrosis. They are glial-fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) positive.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Meningothelial cells:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Meningiomas are slow-growing extra-axial tumors arising from meningothelial cells of the arachnoid mater. Histologically, they appear as whorls of cells with or without psammoma bodies (laminar calcification).</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Melanocyte:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Melanoma is an aggressive skin tumor that tends to metastasize to the brain. Being neural crest in origin, it is also S-100 positive. Metastatic lesions typically form well-circumscribed masses along the gray-white matter junction. However, histologically, there is often necrosis with areas of gliosis and edema.</span></div>",
