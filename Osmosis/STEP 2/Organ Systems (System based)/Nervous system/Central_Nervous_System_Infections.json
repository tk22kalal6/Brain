On examination, there is evidence of muscle atrophy, spasticity, fasciculations, and hyperreflexia. Sensation is intact. Electromyography (EMG) shows evidence of acute and chronic denervation with reinnervation, and a nerve conduction study shows normal sensory nerve action potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is also normal. Which of the following additional historical findings is most likely to be present in this patient?",

The extra glutamines in HD cause the mutated protein to aggregate within the neuronal cells of the caudate and putamen, leading to neuronal cell death and a decrease in inhibitory neurotransmitters like<strong>&#160;GABA</strong> and an increase in stimulatory neurons like <strong>dopamine&#160;</strong>in these regions. This imbalance is responsible for chorea and athetosis. &#160; <br><br>Since dopamine is increased in the affected regions of the brain, medications that lower dopamine levels, such as <strong>tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine,&#160;</strong>are usually used to manage <strong>chorea</strong>, these medications work on both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. In the presynaptic neuron, they <strong>block vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT)</strong> found on the vesicles, inhibiting the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft. On the postsynaptic neuron, these medications act as a weak dopamine receptor antagonist, where they bind to the receptors and prevent dopamine from binding. &#160; <br><br>Tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine are also useful for treating <strong>Tourette syndrome.</strong> Side effects include <strong>sedation&#160;</strong>and <strong>pseudoparkinsonism</strong>.

Together, these findings are consistent with<strong>&#160;Parkinson disease&#160;</strong>(PD). PD is caused by degeneration of the substantia nigra, and disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway, thus decreasing striatal dopamine levels. Treatment of PD involves several medications that increase dopamine levels within the brain. &#160; <br><br>Initial treatment often involves a combination of <strong>carbidopa/levodopa</strong>. Unlike dopamine, levodopa can cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), which gets converted to dopamine in the CNS via decarboxylases. Dopamine decarboxylase inhibitors, like <strong>carbidopa</strong>, prevent the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery, allowing for more levodopa to cross the BBB. Thus, levodopa is often administered in combination with carbidopa to increase the bioavailability of levodopa within the brain and decrease its peripheral side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Once converted to dopamine by centrally acting DOPA decarboxylase, the availability of intraneuronal dopamine levels within the substantia nigra increase substantially.

The normal comprehensive metabolic panel rules out a metabolic derangement as the cause of this patient's abnormal movements with tremor, and medication history reveals a potential cause.

If the symptoms resolve, then the diagnosis of <strong>medication-induced parkinsonism</strong> can be made. <br><br>For patients presenting with involuntary movements and a normal comprehensive metabolic profile, a careful medication use history should be taken next to rule out medication-induced parkinsonism. If it is determined that the movement disorder is not medication-induced and a tremor is a significant feature, then either <strong>essential tremor&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;Parkinson disease</strong> (<strong>or Parkinsonism</strong>) is the most likely diagnosis, and a trial of carbidopa-levodopa can help differentiate the two. <br><br>If tremor is not the main feature of the involuntary movement disorder, then tic-suppressing medications can be tried. If they are not helpful, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), Huntington disease, or (in the case of pediatric patients) Sydenham chorea should be considered, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, genetic testing, or Group A strep antibody testing should be performed based on the likely cause.

Treatment of PD involves several medications that increase dopamine levels within the brain. &#160; <br><br>Levodopa is peripherally metabolized by dopamine decarboxylase and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Levodopa (L-DOPA) is commonly given in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa) to prevent its peripheral metabolism to dopamine, as peripherally active dopamine leads to various adverse effects (e.g.nausea, vomiting). &#160; &#160;<br><br>When levodopa is co-administered with a decarboxylase inhibitor, the medication is converted by peripheral <strong>COMT </strong>to the inert metabolite 3-O- methyldopa (3-OMD). Only 10% of a given dose of levodopa reaches the brain for subsequent conversion to dopamine. Two medications that<strong> inhibit COMT</strong> are <strong>tolcapone </strong>and <strong>entacapone</strong>, which can be used as adjunctive therapies to treat PD. Both COMT inhibitors exert their therapeutic effects by inhibiting the peripheral metabolism of levodopa and increasing its bioavailability for the central nervous system. In addition, they reduce the formation of 3-OMD, which competes with L-DOPA for transport into the brain. Tolcapone inhibits both peripheral and, to a lesser extent, central COMT, whereas entacapone acts only in the periphery. &#160; <br><br>COMT inhibitors are often combined with levodopa when patients develop motor complications. In addition, they improve the therapeutic response to levodopa and reduce the &#8220;wearing-off&#8221; phenomenon.

It is most commonly associated with <strong>first- and second-generation antipsychotics&#160;</strong>(e.g., haloperidol and olanzapine, respectively), as well as <strong>antiemetics&#160;</strong>such as metoclopramide and prochlorperazine. &#160; &#160; <br><br>In this patient, tardive dyskinesia was most likely precipitated by concurrent use of an antipsychotic and metoclopramide. Tardive dyskinesia can manifest with <strong>orofacial dyskinesia,&#160;</strong>which includes repeated<strong>&#160;tongue protrusion and twisting, cheek bulging</strong>, as well as <strong>lip smacking, and pouting.</strong> Additional symptoms include <strong>chorea </strong>and <strong>athetosis</strong>. It is very important to recognize tardive dyskinesia as the symptoms can become permanent if the offending agent is not quickly stopped. In this patient, metoclopramide should be immediately discontinued. &#160; &#160; <br><br>Tardive dyskinesia develops since antipsychotics and certain antiemetics (e.g., prochlorperazine, metoclopramide) block dopamine receptors in the brain. Tardive dyskinesia is thought to arise due to an<strong> imbalance of dopamine receptor antagonism, </strong>where there is D2-receptor antagonism, excessive D1-receptor activity, and resulting movement disorders. In contrast, second-generation antipsychotics (e.g. aripiprazole, olanzapine) have a slightly lower risk of tardive dyskinesia, compared to first-generation antipsychotics since they block both D1- and D2-receptors. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Manic episode:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Manic episodes can occur in patients with bipolar disorder, either due to inadequate treatment or antidepressant use without a mood stabilizer.

Over the past two months, the patient has become increasingly withdrawn, exhibiting confusion, memory loss, and a noticeable reduction in both speech and movement. Recently, the patient has not spoken at all and has developed intermittent, quick jerks of the bilateral upper extremities. Past medical history includes gastroesophageal reflux managed with omeprazole. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 118/76 mmHg. Liver, kidney, and thyroid function tests are normal, and a urine toxicology screen is negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain shows cortical ribboning on diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, and continuous video electroencephalography (EEG) shows periodic sharp wave complexes. Which of the following additional tests is most likely to confirm the underlying cause of these symptoms?",
