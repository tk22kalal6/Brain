She most likely has <strong>fibromyalgia&#160;</strong>and can be started on a <strong>serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor&#160;</strong>(SNRI). &#160; <br><br>Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome most commonly affecting women between 20-50 years old. It presents with chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain, stiffness, and paraesthesias. Physical examination is likely to reveal tender points on bony prominences. Laboratory investigations, including creatinine kinase and TSH, are typically within normal limits. Treatment of fibromyalgia includes patient education, sleep hygiene, regular aerobic exercise, and initiation of SNRI or tricyclic antidepressant therapy. &#160; <br><br><strong>Duloxetine&#160;</strong>is an SNRI used in the management of fibromyalgia. It <strong>inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine transporters&#160;</strong>on the presynaptic neuronal membrane, thereby increasing the levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. Dulotxetine also has <strong>analgesic properties,</strong> which makes it beneficial in treating chronic pain syndromes. &#160; &#160;<br>Other indications for duloxetine include diabetic neuropathic pain, stress urinary incontinence in women, and major depressive disorder. &#160; &#160;<br><br>P.S.
