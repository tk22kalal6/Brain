This diagnosis is further supported by the presence of an elevated ESR and a positive HLA-B27. <strong>Spinal stiffness and reduced range of motion of the spine</strong> would also be expected. <br><br><strong>Ankylosing spondylitis</strong> is a <strong>chronic, inflammatory condition</strong> that primarily affects the <strong>spine and sacroiliac joints</strong>, resulting in erosion of bone and destruction of articular tissue. This ultimately leads to fibrosis and calcification, causing <strong>fusion of the involved vertebrae and loss of range of motion</strong>. The disease is <strong>more common in males</strong>, and age of onset is usually <strong>&lt; 40 years</strong>. Important risk factors include having a first-degree relative with the disease and <strong>HLA-B27</strong> positivity.<br><br>Patients typically present with <strong>back pain of insidious onset</strong> that is <strong>worse at night or with inactivity</strong>, and <strong>improves with exercise</strong>. On physical examination, <strong>tenderness in the sacroiliac joints</strong> indicates sacroiliitis. <strong>Diminished range of motion of the spine</strong> is often present as the disease progresses, and can be evaluated using the <strong>Schober test</strong> as shown below. Arthritis of peripheral joints can also be seen in about half of patients, as well as enthesitis, tendonitis, and dactylitis. Extra-articular manifestations can include pulmonary fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis, and aortitis.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/qxh7f0e0Tm6Gcr13gyEtW7PpQh2rnVtO/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Spinal stiffness:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hyperlordosis, or an excessive inward curve of the lumbar spine above the buttocks, is more commonly associated with conditions like obesity, inactivity, and spondylolisthesis.

The shoulder radiograph is unremarkable. Together, these findings suggest <strong>adhesive capsulitis</strong> (also termed <strong>frozen shoulder syndrome</strong>). <br><br>Adhesive capsulitis is a poorly understood condition that results in global stiffness and pain of the glenohumeral joint. Current research postulates the condition results from spontaneous inflammation of the joint capsule, followed by the development of adhesions and fibrosis of the synovial lining. Clinically, patients present with subacute symptoms including deep, nagging shoulder pain and associated <strong>limitations in passive and active range of motion</strong> (particularly external rotation and abduction). The condition is often idiopathic but has been associated with a history of shoulder injury, diabetes, dyslipidemia, Parkinson disease, immobilization, and antiretroviral therapy. <br><br>The disease progresses through three distinct phases. First, patients experience an acute phase characterized by severe disabling shoulder pain that worsens at night, with some associated stiffness. This phase lasts 2-9 months. Next, an intermediate phase occurs wherein pain decreases but stiffness and severe loss of shoulder motion ensues. This phase lasts 4-12 months. Finally, a recovery phase occurs, wherein patients regain shoulder mobility.<br><br>Diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis is primarily clinical, as imaging findings are generally noncontributory, and <strong>radiographs are often normal</strong>.

Patients may show&#160;an <strong>improved </strong>range of motion&#160;soon&#160;after the use of&#160;<strong>NSAIDS</strong>.&#160;Most patients can bear weight on the affected extremity, though they may show a limp.&#160;History will often reveal a&#160;<strong>recent upper respiratory infection</strong>&#160;or episode of acute gastroenteritis.&#160;Physical&#160;examination&#160;typically reveals a&#160;<strong>well-appearing</strong>&#160;patient with possible joint effusion, in combination with&#160;limited range of motion&#160;of&#160;the affected joint due to pain.&#160;&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Refusal of active and passive range of motion of the affected joint:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Fever&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: Both transient synovitis and septic arthritis can present with fevers</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>Generally,</span><span>&#160;the</span><span>&#160;fever&#160;</span><span>in</span><span>&#160;patients with septic arthritis is higher</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>H</span><span>owever</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;it does not serve as a clear clinical differentiator</span><span>&#160;between the two disorders.</span><span>&#160;Refusal of active and passive range of motion of the affected joint is&#160;</span><span>more concerning</span><span>&#160;</span><span>for septic arthritis</span><span>.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Limping:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: <strong>Limping occurs in transient synovitis and septic arthritis</strong>.&#160;Refusal of active and passive range of motion of the affected joint is&#160;more&#160;concerning for septic arthritis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Monoarticular involvement:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: <strong>Monoarticular involvement occurs in patients with transient synovitis and septic arthritis</strong>.&#160;This clinical feature cannot be used to distinguish the two conditions.&#160;Refusal of active and passive range of motion of the affected joint is&#160;more&#160;concerning for septic arthritis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ History of recent URI:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;History of a recent upper respiratory tract infection is&#160;suggestive of transient synovitis as opposed to septic arthritis.&#160;Transient synovitis is&#160;usually a&#160;benign condition&#160;and is not secondary to a bacterial infection.&#160;Refusal&#160;of active and passive range of motion of the affected joint is&#160;more&#160;concerning for septic arthritis.&#160;</span></div>",

He has multiple clinical features suggestive of <strong>transient synovitis</strong>. Blood work shows a mildly elevated white blood cell count and there is evidence of a moderate effusion on hip ultrasonography. Arthrocentesis of the hip involved demonstrates no evidence of septic arthritis with no growth on culture. The findings are consistent with transient synovitis which is typically <strong><span>s</span><span>elf-limited</span></strong> and resolves on its own within 2 weeks. The initial recommended treatment for this condition involves <strong>rest and NSAIDs</strong>.<br><br><strong>Septic arthritis</strong> refers to a <strong>bacterial infection</strong> of the <strong>synovium and joint space</strong>. <strong>Transient synovitis (toxic synovitis) is noninfectious synovial inflammation</strong> and can present similarly. Differentiating the two is important since the treatment is different. <br><br>If there is enough suspicion, formal diagnosis of septic arthritis and transient synovitis can be confirmed via <strong>joint aspiration</strong>, with evaluation of synovial fluid cell count with differential, gram stain, and culture. When children present with hip pain and there is concern for septic arthritis, arthrocentesis should be performed. In patients with <strong>septic arthritis</strong>, synovial fluid analysis will typically reveal <strong>bacterial growth, cloudy or purulent fluid</strong>, as well as a <strong>cell count &gt; 50K WBC/mm<sup>3</sup></strong>. These patients will also typically have positive blood cultures. In contrast, patients with <strong>transient synovitis</strong> will have a <strong>negative gram stain and culture, clear or yellow fluid</strong>, and a <strong>cell count of 5K - 15K WBC/mm<sup>3</sup></strong>. <br><br>Treatment of&#160;<strong>septic arthritis</strong>&#160;involves&#160;<strong>empiric intravenous antibiotics</strong>&#160;based on the&#160;patient's&#160;age, clinical status,&#160;and risk factors.&#160;Antibiotics&#160;are&#160;tailored&#160;to the synovial fluid&#160;culture and sensitivity results.&#160;<strong>Arthrocentesis </strong>is both diagnostic and therapeutic and is necessary to decompress the joint space and&#160;remove inflammatory&#160;debris.&#160;<strong>Surgical consultation</strong>&#160;may be necessary for&#160;arthroscopic drainage or arthrotomy.&#160;In contrast,&#160;<strong>transient synovitis</strong>&#160;is managed conservatively, with&#160;treatment focused on&#160;<strong>pain control</strong><strong><span>, rest,</span><span>&#160;and supportive care</span><span>.&#160;</span>&#160;</strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Administer ibuprofen:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Admit for observation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;This patient has&#160;transient synovitis&#160;and there is no&#160;indication&#160;for observation.&#160;This patient can be discharged&#160;home.

He has had a <strong>recent viral illness</strong>, which, along with the other clinical features, is suggestive of <strong>transient synovitis</strong>. <strong>Hip effusion</strong> is seen on ultrasound. Given that the patient has a <strong>white blood cell count over 15,500</strong> and a slightly elevated c-reactive protein, he should have an <strong>arthrocentesis </strong>on this joint to formally rule out <strong>septic arthritis</strong>.<br><br><strong>Septic arthritis</strong> refers to a <strong>bacterial infection</strong> of the <strong>synovium and joint space</strong>. <strong>Transient synovitis (toxic synovitis) is noninfectious synovial inflammation</strong> and can present similarly. Differentiating the two is important since the treatment is different. Transient synovitis is a benign and self-limited illness, whereas septic arthritis requires drainage of the joint and antibiotics to prevent permanent bone, joint damage, and multisystem involvement.<br><br>If there is enough suspicion, <strong>formal diagnosis</strong> of septic arthritis or transient synovitis is confirmed via <strong>joint aspiration</strong>, with evaluation of synovial fluid cell count with differential, gram stain, and culture. In patients with <strong>septic arthritis</strong>, synovial fluid analysis will typically reveal <strong>bacterial growth, cloudy or purulent fluid</strong>, as well as a <strong>cell count &gt; 50K WBC/mm<sup>3</sup></strong>. Patients can also have positive blood cultures. In contrast, patients with transient synovitis will have a <strong>negative gram stain and culture, clear or yellow fluid</strong>, and a <strong>cell count of 5K - 15K WBC/mm<sup>3</sup></strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Perform hip arthrocentesis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Order hip x-ray:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>An x-ray of the hip may&#160;</span><span>identify</span><span>&#160;fracture, osteomyelitis, or other causes of pain</span><span>&#160;and swelling</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;but is not the best next step in</span><span>&#160;management</span><span>.

The symptoms are generally more severe in the morning and at night, often lasting for more than an hour, and they typically improve after activity.

Patients with fibromyalgia present with <strong>chronic widespread pain</strong> that most often presents at<strong>&#160;points where muscles attach to the bone.</strong><br><br>Diagnosis of fibromyalgia is based on a few factors. First, the diagnosis can be made if there is<strong>&#160;pain in at least seven or more areas of the body</strong>, termed &#8220;tender points,&#8221; with a symptoms severity scale score of at least five points out of a possible twelve. The symptoms severity scale gives points for a wide range of symptoms from difficulty concentrating and remembering things&#8212;sometimes called &#8220;fibro fog&#8221;&#8212;to fatigue and unrefreshing sleep. Alternatively, the diagnosis can be made if there is <strong>pain in at least five or more areas of the body</strong>, with a symptoms severity score of at least nine points out of a possible twelve. Additionally, the symptoms need to be present for<strong>&#160;at least 3 months.&#160;</strong><strong>&#160;</strong><br><br>Treatment of fibromyalgia requires a holistic approach. <strong>Cardiovascular exercise</strong> can help by reducing pain and fatigue. <strong>Relaxation techniques&#160;</strong>and <strong>good sleep hygiene&#160;</strong>can also help. If these approaches fail, medications can be used. <strong>Tricyclic antidepressants</strong>, such as amitriptyline, are the <strong>first-line therapy</strong>.

Red flags that can signal motor delay in a three-year-old include <strong>difficulty using stairs</strong> and <strong>inability to catch a ball</strong>. &#160;<br><br>When assessing development milestones in a child, it is important to understand normal development. At <strong>three-years</strong>, a child is expected to <strong>walk upstairs</strong> with alternating feet, <strong>pedal a tricycle</strong> and <strong>catch a ball</strong>. In the area of language and communication, a three-year-old should have a <strong>vocabulary of over 200 words</strong>, make <strong>three-word sentences</strong>, and have about <strong>75% of their speech understood</strong> by strangers. Self-help skills appropriate for this age include eating independently, toilet training, and putting on their own shoes. They should be able to identify their age and gender, take turns and enjoy imaginative play. <br><br>Pediatric patients with <strong>gross motor delays</strong> should be evaluated for <strong>neuromuscular disorders</strong>. <strong>Prematurity </strong>and <strong>low birth weight</strong> are known risk factors for developmental delays. Cerebral palsy may be diagnosed in patients with a history of hypoxic ischemic insults, central nervous system infections, stroke, or kernicterus. A positive family history can suggest genetic or metabolic disorders. In patients with a history of prematurity and <strong>gross motor delays</strong>, if the physical exam also reveals <strong>low to normal tone </strong>or<strong> weakness</strong>, brain imaging should be performed to rule out other causes like cerebral palsy.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Gross motor delay:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Global developmental delay:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Global developmental delay is present when two or more of the major categories show delay.

The examiner should test the frontalis strength by asking the patient to wrinkle his forehead or raise his eyebrows. Orbicularis oculi strength is tested by asking the patient to close the eyes tightly while the examiner tries to open them. Procerus function is assessed by asking the patient to furrow the brow. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Other&#160;historical and examination characteristics can help differentiate between the most likely cause&#160;of peripheral facial nerve palsy.
