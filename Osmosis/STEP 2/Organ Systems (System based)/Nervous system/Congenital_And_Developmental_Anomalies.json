      "solution": "Based on her presenting symptoms and lab work, this patient most likely has rheumatoid arthritis. &#160;Her physician chose to prescribe a TNF inhibitor to prevent further joint damage.<br><br>Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that causes permanent damage to joints if not treated properly. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) causes inflammation and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, TNF inhibitors can be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and are associated with decreased joint damage and inflammation with improved overall joint function. There are two types of TNF inhibitors, divided according to the mechanism by which these drugs inhibit TNF:<br><br><ul><li>The first class of TNF inhibitors are soluble TNF receptors, like Etanercept. &#160;When given, etanercept binds to circulating TNF, preventing it from binding to receptors and activating the immune system. This class ends with the suffix -cept which indicates a receptor fusion protein.</li><li>The second class of TNF inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies against TNF. These monoclonal antibodies bind directly to TNF, inhibiting it from binding to its receptor and inducing its function. Examples of monoclonal antibodies against TNF include infliximab and adalimumab. Because they are monoclonal antibodies, they end with the suffix -mab (short for Monoclonal AntiBody). &#160;</li></ul><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Etanercept:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Infliximab:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF that binds TNF and inhibits it from binding to its receptor. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Adalimumab:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Adalimumab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF that binds TNF and inhibits it from binding to its receptor. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Eculizumab:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Eculizumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks the activation of C5, thereby inhibiting the formation of membrane attack complexes (MAC).

Although its immunomodulating mechanism of action is not entirely understood, it is believed to be due to increased intracellular pH in macrophages. Increased intracellular pH suppresses lysosomes, inhibiting antigen processing and expression. This subsequently prevents antigen presentation to and activation of T-cells. This unique mechanism of action allows it to complement other immunomodulatory medications.<br><br>Hydroxychloroquine has a relatively safe side effect profile. The most common side effects are skin rash and diarrhea. Retinopathy, which is dose-dependent and often not seen until more than five years of continuous use, is the most critical side effect.
