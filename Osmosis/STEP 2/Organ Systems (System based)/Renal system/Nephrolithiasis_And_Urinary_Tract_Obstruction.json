On physical exam, the patient may be either euphoric or sedated, with slurred speech, hyporeflexia, perioral dermatitis, epistaxis, and nasal ulcers. Paint may be observed on the hands, nose, or mouth, or a strong odor may be noted on clothing if a liquid was used.

Naloxone is an <strong>opioid antagonist</strong> that can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or via an endotracheal tube.<br><br><strong>Opioid exposure</strong> in the pediatric population can present along a continuum from mild symptoms of <strong>constipation</strong>, <strong>euphoria</strong>, or <strong>altered mental status</strong>, to life-threatening <strong>respiratory&#160;</strong>and <strong>central nervous system depression</strong>. Prompt recognition of a potential opioid overdose is critical to the patient&#8217;s survival. Patients with an opioid overdose are often unable to relay a history on their own, and bystanders, as well as objects found at the scene may be needed to suggest opioid involvement. Common physical examination findings in opioid overdose are respiratory depression with a <strong>decreased respiratory rate</strong> and <strong>shallow breathing, stupor,&#160;</strong>and <strong>miosis</strong>. &#160;<strong>Naloxone&#160;</strong>is an opioid antagonist that rapidly reverses the effects of opioids. It has a low risk of adverse effects and should be administered as quickly as possible to any patient with a <strong>suspected opioid overdose</strong>. Acute opioid overdose can be diagnosed clinically and obtaining laboratory studies to confirm exposure should not delay the administration of naloxone.<br><br>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available around the clock for consultation on patients with known or suspected poisoning, and those who may be critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222). <br><br>P.S.

Phenobarbital acts by increasing the duration of&#160;</span><span>gabanergic</span><span>&#160;potentiation, allowing chloride to pass through the channel and creating a postsynaptic inhibitory effect that produces sedation. Whenever possible, barbiturates need to be tapered off to minimize the chances of developing withdrawal and restoring CNS tone. When patients have developed withdrawal, it is imperative to institute a long-term tape</span><span>r with drugs that have&#160;</span><span>gabanergic</span><span>&#160;cross-reactivity. The first line is benzodiazepines due to their wider therapeutic window.</span>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br><span>In the case of this patient, taking high doses of pentobarbital (a more potent barbiturate) caused a barbiturate overdose. Barbiturate overdose occurs quickly and&#160;</span><span>presents as</span><span>&#160;excessive thirst, lightheadedness, confusion, hypotension, and even loss of consciousness/coma. As there is no specific antidote for barbiturate overdose, the mainstays of treatment include supportive care, especially cardiopulmonary support. Flumazenil is not effective in treating barbiturate overdose. Several case studies&#160;</span><span>report</span><span>&#160;acti</span><span>vated charcoal&#160;</span><span>as</span><span>&#160;useful in decreasing the half-life of barbiturates and accelerating recovery from overdose.</span>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br><span>P.S.

Pentobarbital is more potent than phenobarbital in producing&#160;gabanergic&#160;potentiation and elevating motor cortical thresholds. Switching this patient to pentobarbital would not treat barbiturate dependence and may cause more harm.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Benzodiazepines with a gradual taper&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong><strong>: </strong>See Main&#160;Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Flumazenil&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong> Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, which blocks the actions of benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists (NBBRAs). Flumazenil only binds these benzodiazepine-specific sites and does not work for barbiturate overdose or withdrawal.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Carbamazepine&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong> Carbamazepine is a sodium channel blocker often used as an anticonvulsant. While it may be&#160;an appropriate medication&#160;for this patient&#8217;s seizure disorder, it has no effect on&#160;gabanergic&#160;potentiation and thus would not treat barbiturate dependence.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 12 step&#160;program&#160;for alcohol use disorder&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>: </strong>Initially, this patient is experiencing symptoms of barbiturate withdrawal followed by a barbiturate overdose. Ethanol (&#8220;alcohol&#8221;) weakly binds between the alpha and gamma subunits of the GABA receptor and can cause effects&#160;similar to&#160;benzodiazepines and barbiturates. This patient&#8217;s history&#160;indicates&#160;barbiturate withdrawal, not alcohol withdrawal.&#160;</span></div>",
