      "text": "A 27-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of severe anxiety for the past eight months. The patient experiences intense anxiety when near dogs, and she often goes out of the way to avoid them, which at times has resulted in being late for work. The patient is unable to identify other triggers for anxiety aside from exposure to dogs while walking to work. Although the patient can articulate that this fear is illogical, it is uncontrollable. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 60/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. The mental status exam shows a well-groomed adult with an anxious affect and avoidant eye contact. Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and thyroid panel are unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
