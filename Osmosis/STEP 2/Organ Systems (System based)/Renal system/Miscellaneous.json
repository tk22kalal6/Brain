AKI is defined by <strong>any</strong> of the following criteria:<br><br><ul><li>Increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours</li><li>Increase in serum creatinine by at least <strong>1.5 times baseline</strong> (which is known or presumed to have been drawn within the prior 7 days)</li><li>Decreased urine output of less than 0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 hours</li></ul>AKI can be characterized as <strong>prerenal</strong>, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. Prerenal AKI, also known as prerenal azotemia, refers to AKI that occurs when <strong>renal perfusion diminishes</strong>, impairing the kidney&#8217;s ability to remove nitrogenous waste from the blood. Causes of prerenal AKI can be grouped into four main categories: medications, <strong>hypovolemia</strong>, systemic vasodilation, and decreased cardiac output.<br><br>Patients with pre-renal AKI from volume depletion often have a history of <strong>vomiting</strong>, <strong>diarrhea</strong>, or bleeding. Physical examination may reveal signs of dehydration, like dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, and hypotension. This patient is suffering from <strong>acute gastroenteritis</strong> causing him to have nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Treatment should be focused on addressing the underlying cause of hypovolemia and intravascular volume <strong>resuscitation with intravenous fluids</strong>. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Consult nephrology for hemodialysis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hemodialysis is reserved for patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and life-threatening complications such as hyperkalemia, volume overload, or acidemia. This patient's presentation suggests prerenal AKI due to volume depletion, which is primarily treated with intravascular volume repletion. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administer intravenous loop furosemide:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Intravenous loop diuretics increase urine output by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

This patient with prerenal acute kidney injury secondary to dehydration has no specific indication for albumin administration. Instead, isotonic saline is the preferred initial fluid for volume repletion. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Administer intravenous isotonic saline:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Start oral rehydration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: In acute cases of severe dehydration with prerenal AKI, rapid intravascular volume expansion with intravenous isotonic saline is the initial step in management. &#160;</span></div>",

Physical examination is notable for bilateral lower extremity edema; and a tender, healing surgical site without signs of infection. Laboratory evaluation reveals a rise in serum creatinine to 3.4 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL, and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 30 mg/dL. Urinalysis shows muddy brown granular casts. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient&#8217;s acute kidney injury? &#160;",

Aminoglycosides like <strong>gentamicin</strong> can be <strong>nephrotoxic&#160;</strong>and cause ATN. Gentamicin can lead to ATN by accumulating in the renal tubular cells, causing cellular damage and dysfunction.<br><br>Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) results in a <strong>sudden decline in kidney function</strong>, evidenced by reduced urine output and a rise in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Clinically, patients may present with symptoms of uremia such as nausea, fatigue, and confusion, with physical signs like edema and hypertension due to fluid overload. Urinalysis will show the presence of <strong>muddy brown granular casts</strong>, often accompanied by renal tubular epithelial cells or cell casts. A <strong>BUN/Cr ratio &lt;15 and a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) greater than 2%</strong> confirms a tubular source of kidney injury. Management of ATN centers on supportive care, addressing fluid and electrolyte imbalance, discontinuing nephrotoxic agents, and providing renal replacement therapy if indicated.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/EcjHysIRRBi_Q_PcSZd9zDm8StWMh3Th/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Gentamicin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Omeprazole:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient with muddy brown casts in the urine likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like omeprazole can cause acute interstitial nephritis; however, this condition typically presents with fever, rash, and eosinophilia. The absence of these findings and the presence of muddy brown granular casts is more suggestive of ATN from gentamicin. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lisinopril:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient with muddy brown casts in the urine likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from gentamicin ACE inhibitors like lisinopril, which can contribute to acute kidney injury (AKI) by reducing the glomerular filtration rate&#8211; especially in the setting of renal artery stenosis, heart failure, or diuretic use. However, they are less likely to cause ATN and muddy brown casts. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Iodinated contrast dye:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient with muddy brown casts in the urine likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from gentamicin. While iodinated contrast dye can cause ATN, it generally leads to a rise in serum creatinine within 48 hours post-exposure not 4-5 days later. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Furosemide:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient with muddy brown casts in the urine likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Furosemide can lead to intravascular volume depletion and prerenal azotemia but is less likely to cause ATN with muddy brown casts unless there is significant hypotension. &#160;</span></div>",
