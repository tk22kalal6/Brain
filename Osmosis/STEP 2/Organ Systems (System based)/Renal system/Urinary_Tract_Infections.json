LSD does not typically cause the severe agitation or aggression associated with stimulants such as phencyclidine (PCP), cocaine, or amphetamines. However, it may lead to <strong>insomnia, restlessness, </strong>and <strong>heightened alertness</strong>. LSD lacks anticholinergic effects, distinguishing it from deliriogenic substances like datura.

Alcohol withdrawal is a <strong>clinical diagnosis</strong>. It usually occurs within 6 hours of patients having their last drink. Some patients in alcohol withdrawal will have <strong>delirium tremens</strong> which typically begins 48 to 96 hours after the last drink. The presence of <strong>visual hallucinations</strong> in this patient who has other signs of <strong>severe withdrawal</strong> (e.g. disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, low-grade fever, agitation, diaphoresis) and <strong>delirium</strong>, indicates that he is experiencing <strong>delirium tremens from alcohol withdrawal</strong>.

Serum electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, calcium, complete blood count, and urinalysis and urine culture should be ordered for most patients who present with delirium when a cause is not immediately obvious. Drug levels should be ordered where appropriate. Toxicology screening of blood and urine should be obtained when a cause is not known. Blood gas determination is often helpful. Respiratory alkalosis can be caused by early sepsis, liver failure, early salicylate intoxication, and cardiopulmonary disease. Metabolic acidosis can be seen with uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, late phases of sepsis or salicylate intoxication, and with toxins including methanol and ethylene glycol.

In severe cases, damage to the renal blood vessels can trigger thrombosis, occluding the glomerular capillaries. This causes rapid deterioration in renal function, resulting in scleroderma renal crisis.

A history of urinary retention, weak stream, or pelvic discomfort may suggest postrenal obstruction due to conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or nephrolithiasis.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>On&#160;physical examination,&#160;signs of hypovolemia, such as dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, or hypotension, suggest&#160;a prerenal&#160;etiology. In contrast, edema, hypertension, or jugular venous distension may&#160;indicate&#160;fluid overload due to heart failure or intrinsic renal injury like glomerulonephritis. Palpable bladder distension, suprapubic tenderness, or flank pain suggests postrenal obstruction.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recent use of anticholinergics&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect</span><span>: </span></strong><span>Anticholinergics can cause acute urinary retention, leading to post-renal&#160;</span><span>acute kidney injury (AKI)</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>H</span><span>owever</span><span>,&#160;</span><span>this patient has no symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., weak stream, hesitancy) or evidence of hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.</span></span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Recent use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong><strong>: </strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Worsening symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect</span><span>: </span></strong><span>While BPH can cause post-renal&#160;</span><span>acute kidney injury (AKI)</span><span>, this patient&#160;</span><span>has no suprapubic pain or bladder distension on physical exam and</span><span>&#160;no hydronephrosis or bladder distension on imaging.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recent use of antibiotics:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong>&#160;Certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides or vancomycin) can&#160;cause&#160;intrinsic&#160;acute kidney injury (AKI)&#160;from&#160;acute tubular necrosis&#160;and others can cause acute interstitial&#160;nephritis.&#160;Both of these would lead to&#160;more&#160;active urine sediment&#160;with casts and cells on&#160;urine microscopy.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recent sore throat:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong>&#160;A recent sore throat may suggest poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
