Given this patient&#8217;s Y-BOCS score is 24, they appear to have <strong>severe OCD</strong>. For severe OCD, <strong>combining cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with medication</strong> is the preferred first-line treatment. <br><br><strong>Exposure and response prevention (ERP)</strong> is a specific type of <strong>CBT</strong> that uses graded exposure to feared stimuli. For example, ERP might involve encouraging this patient to engage in their compulsions only twice instead of three times, with the goal of gradually reducing the behavior further. <br><br>Validated rating scales, such as the <strong>Y-BOCS</strong>, help quantify <strong>the level of impairment</strong> and guide recommended therapy options&#8212;including CBT, clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A Y-BOCS score of <strong>8-15 indicates mild</strong> OCD, <strong>16-23 indicates moderate</strong> OCD, and a score of <strong>24 or higher suggests severe</strong> OCD. Patients with mild OCD may be effectively managed with either medications or CBT alone, while moderate OCD may benefit from medications alone or in combination with CBT. In contrast, severe OCD generally requires a combined approach of CBT and medication. The Y-BOCS is also valuable for <strong>tracking treatment response</strong>. For instance, a patient whose Y-BOCS score improves from 24 to 4 after starting an SSRI and CBT demonstrates a significant reduction in symptoms.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cognitive behavioral therapy plus clomipramine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cognitive behavioral therapy alone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Cognitive behavioral therapy is very effective in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

This heightened sense of fear or anxiety often causes significant distress, impacting daily life and function. The first-line treatment for both includes CBT and exposure therapy. <br><br><strong>CBT</strong> focuses on <strong>identifying and challenging negative or distorted perceptions and thought processes</strong> to reduce or eliminate undesirable associated behavior patterns.<br><br><strong>Exposure therapy</strong>, on the other hand, involves <strong>gradual exposure to the phobic stimulus</strong> with the goal of reducing or eliminating the fear and avoidance response. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors <strong>(SSRIs)</strong> and selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors <strong>(SNRIs)</strong> can be considered as adjunctive treatments in addition to CBT for social anxiety disorder. In cases where there is suboptimal response to these options, beta blockers (e.g. propranolol), anticonvulsants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or benzodiazepines may be considered.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cognitive behavioral therapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reassurance&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Reassurance is important for rapport-building but is not sufficient in managing social anxiety disorder when there is functional impairment.

However, psychotherapy, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy, remains the first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder. Additionally, SNRIs can exacerbate anxiety in some patients due to their effects on norepinephrine.

When considering a diagnosis of OCD, it is important to gather information about <strong>functional impairment</strong>; for example, this patient arrives late for school and work due to these symptoms. A key detail that helps distinguish OCD from other anxiety disorders is the presence of <strong>repetitive behaviors that lead to a reduction in anxiety</strong>, as seen when this patient experiences less anxiety after repeatedly washing their hands.

This heightened sense of fear or anxiety often causes significant distress, impacting daily life and function.

The patient&#8217;s partner recalls that he got a &#8220;stomach bug&#8221; a few days ago and has had severe diarrhea with voluminous watery stools multiple times a day. The patient&#8217;s past medical history is notable for bipolar disorder, for which he has been taking lithium for many years. He also takes ibuprofen as needed. Temperature is 37.8&#176;C (100.0&#176;F), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respiratory rate is 15/min. On physical examination, the patient is oriented only to self, is dysarthric, and has nystagmus. There are bilateral upper extremity tremors. Laboratory findings are significant for a lithium level of 4.5 mEq/L (normal reference range: 0.6-1.2 mEq/L) and creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL. The patient is started on intravenous fluids for volume resuscitation. What is the next best step in the management of this patient? &#160;",

      "solution": "This patient has findings of severe <strong>lithium toxicity</strong> including altered mental status, hypotension, and markedly elevated serum lithium levels. He most likely became acutely volume-depleted over the last few days due to viral gastroenteritis. These changes precipitated acute kidney injury (AKI), which impaired <strong>renal excretion</strong> of lithium and caused a <strong>toxic buildup</strong>. Given the severity of symptoms, the patient should be started on hemodialysis.<br><br>Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window. Toxicity can be caused by either <strong>excessive ingestion</strong> or <strong>decreased excretion</strong>. The risk of overdose is increased in patients with impaired renal function or who take medications that reduce glomerular filtration rates (GFR), such as thiazides, NSAIDs, loop diuretics, and ACE inhibitors. Other risk factors include decreased circulating volume, infection, fever, decreased oral fluid intake, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.<br><br>The work-up of lithium toxicity should include a fingerstick blood glucose, serum lithium concentration, a basic metabolic panel to assess renal function, as well as serum acetaminophen, and salicylate levels to rule out other ingestions.<br><br>Initial management of lithium toxicity is similar to that of patients suffering from other types of drug toxicities. The airway should be secured, especially in patients with altered mental status. Most patients should receive intravenous fluid resuscitation. Additional treatment depends on the degree of severity of the toxicity. <strong>Mild or moderate toxicity</strong> can be treated by <strong>decreasing or stopping lithium</strong>. <strong>Severe toxicity&#160;</strong>is treated via the removal of lithium from the body through <strong>gastric lavage or hemodialysis</strong>.<br>&#160; &#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/04iyBD3aRnKTtVbYXwzaRJBdQXWAyBgJ/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Hemodialysis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Observation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient presents with worsening psychomotor changes secondary to lithium toxicity.

Lead chelators include dimercaprol, EDTA, and succimer. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ N-acetylcysteine administration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is administered in acetaminophen overdose. It is most effective when given within 8 hours of ingestion. It acts by replenishing glutathione, which inactivates NAPQI (a highly toxic metabolite of acetaminophen) and thereby detoxifies it. This patient has no history of acetaminophen use and is likely suffering from lithium toxicity given a markedly elevated lithium level. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Flumazenil administration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Flumazenil is administered in benzodiazepine overdose and acts as a competitive benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Benzodiazepine overdose can present with drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, respiratory depression, and cardiopulmonary arrest.
