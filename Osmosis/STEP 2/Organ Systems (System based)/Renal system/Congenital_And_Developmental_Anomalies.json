      "solution": "This patient&#8217;s frequent panic attacks, social avoidance, nightmares, emotional blunting, and intrusive thoughts of losing his remaining limb over the <strong>past eight months</strong> raise concern for <strong>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</strong>. The vignette states that the patient underwent an amputation following a motor vehicle accident, and his current symptoms are rooted in that traumatic experience. <br><br>The timing of symptom onset is essential when considering a diagnosis of PTSD. If a patient has a history of psychiatric symptoms before experiencing a traumatic event, the trauma may have exacerbated an existing condition. However, a trauma-related disorder is more likely if a patient with no prior psychiatric history develops symptoms following the trauma. It is important to recognize that patients can, and often do, meet criteria for both a trauma-related disorder and another psychiatric disorder. <br><br>Another factor to consider when diagnosing PTSD is the overlap of trauma-related symptoms with those of other psychiatric conditions. Patients with trauma-related disorders <strong>experience symptoms specifically tied to the traumatic event</strong>. In contrast, conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder lack a single, identifiable focal point and involve more generalized symptom patterns. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Obsessive-compulsive disorder:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although both post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder can involve repetitive, distressing thoughts, this patient&#8217;s intrusive thoughts are tied to his traumatic experience.

In this case, the patient&#8217;s concerns about losing a limb, his avoidance of social interactions, and his dissociative experiences are all directly linked to his recent traumatic experience, making post-traumatic stress disorder the most likely diagnosis.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Borderline personality disorder:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Both borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder can induce dissociative states and social avoidance, with dissociation often occurring as a coping mechanism for overwhelming negative emotions.
