      "text": "A 10-year-old girl is brought to the psychiatric clinic by caregivers for difficulty interacting with peers and repetitive behaviors that have worsened over the past 10 months. These behaviors have been present for as long as the caregivers can remember but appear to have intensified since starting at a new school. Caregivers report the patient does not make eye contact, shows little interest in imaginative play, and becomes irritable if meals change. Recently, the patient became irate when the classroom was rearranged for a holiday party. The teacher notes her struggles in communicating with classmates and a preference for reading books about the ocean. Although speech onset was later than expected, the patient currently speaks and reads at an 8th grade level. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status exam reveals a limited range of affect, poor eye contact, and repetitive foot tapping. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

To meet diagnostic criteria, these symptoms must cause clinically significant <strong>impairment in academic, social, or adaptive functioning</strong> and must be present in early childhood, with some patients showing symptoms before the age of three years old. &#160;<br><br><strong>Pragmatic communication disorder</strong> and ASD share similar symptoms related specifically to interpersonal communication. However, patients with pragmatic communication disorder are not expected to have the inflexible adherence to routine and restricted interests associated with ASD. Additionally, while ASD can coexist with intellectual disabilities and specific learning disabilities, many patients with ASD have normal intellectual and adaptive functioning and do not meet the criteria for those diagnoses. Childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering) also commonly co-occurs with ASD, and both can be diagnosed if patients experience significant stuttering. <br><br>ASD remains a clinical diagnosis made by a psychiatrist or other qualified mental health professional. However, neuropsychological testing can be valuable in identifying specific areas of need, which can guide treatment planning and inform recommendations for school-based accommodations and support services.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Childhood-onset fluency disorder &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering) involves disruptions in the normal fluency and pattern of speech.

      "solution": "This patient was started on <strong>clonidine</strong>, which can be used to treat hypertension, Tourette syndrome, and ADHD. Clonidine, along with <strong>guanabenz&#160;</strong>and <strong>guanfacine</strong>, is an &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist. These medications stimulate &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), especially those in the medulla. This decreases norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, which leads to lower blood pressure. As a result, these medications can be used to treat <strong>hypertension</strong>.<br><br>Likewise, &#945;<sub>2</sub>-receptor agonists (clonidine in particular) act on &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors present in the prefrontal cortex, where they exert the same inhibitory effect on norepinephrine release. Moderating the amount of norepinephrine in this part of the brain helps &#8220;tune out&#8221; irrelevant stimuli and sharpens focus. As a result, clonidine is helpful in the treatment of <strong>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</strong> (ADHD) and tics in <strong>Tourette syndrome</strong>.<br><br>Another &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist is <strong>alpha-methyldopa</strong>, which is converted to methyl norepinephrine centrally to decrease the adrenergic outflow by &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist action from the central nervous system, leading to reduced total peripheral resistance and decreased systemic blood pressure. Therefore, this medication is occasionally used in the treatment of hypertension.<br><br>Another commonly used &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist is <strong>tizanidine</strong>, a centrally acting &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist. Tizanidine&#8217;s alpha-2 receptor-mediated inhibition of inter-neuronal activity underlies its anti-spasmodic activities and is therefore used to treat spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries.<br><br>The main side effect of these medications is <strong>hypotension</strong>. Also, if a patient abruptly stops taking them, severe <strong>rebound hypertension</strong> may occur. Other side effects include sedation, fatigue, and nausea/gastric upset.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/z6JJgke6RGO3IF-l-kJVsxtBS5G-3rS2/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Medications such as prazosin and terazosin are &#945;<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonists.

The DSM-5 requires <strong>at least six symptoms</strong> of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity to be present in <strong>two or more settings for at least six months</strong>. Because this patient&#8217;s symptoms have only been present for four months, the most appropriate next step is <strong>close follow-up</strong> to determine whether the duration criterion is met.
