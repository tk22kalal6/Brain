      "solution": "This patient is presenting with fever, headaches, and new onset of a seizure. The MRI shows hyperintensities in the <strong>temporal lobes,</strong> including the hippocampus, which is highly suggestive of <strong>herpes simplex virus&#160;</strong> (HSV) <strong>encephalitis</strong>. Due to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with the condition, <strong>empiric intravenous acyclovir</strong> therapy should be started immediately when HSV encephalitis is suspected. <br><br>HSV encephalitis is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis. Most cases are caused by type HSV-1, but type 2 is also seen. Patients often present with rapid onset of fever and at least one of the following: altered mentation, focal cranial nerve deficits, hemiparesis, dysphasia, aphasia, ataxia, focal seizures, headache, focal neurologic signs. IV acyclovir should be administered empirically in any patient that is suspected of HSV encephalitis, due to the high mortality and morbidity rates. High level of suspicion includes patients with CSF pleocytosis and encephalitis, focal findings on examination, imaging, or electroencephalography. CSF analysis typically shows a <strong>lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased number of erythrocytes</strong> (due to hemorrhage), and <strong>elevated protein</strong>. However, the CSF profile can be normal early in the course of the disease and therefore is not diagnostic. CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to identify HSV-1, HSV-2, and enteroviruses. Identification of HSV-1 in the CSF is an efficient, rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic test for HSV-1 encephalitis and, therefore, is the test of choice. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are required for further evaluation of this patient.

      "solution": "The patient presents with typical symptoms of <strong>orthostatic hypotension</strong>, including <strong>light-headedness</strong> and <strong>syncope&#160;</strong>upon standing. This older patient may have autonomic dysfunction that may have been further exacerbated by <strong>fluid depletion</strong> (e.g. dry mucous membranes) from his recent gastrointestinal illness, leading to orthostatic hypotension. <strong>Fluid replacement</strong> is the best next step in management. <br><br><strong>Syncope</strong>, defined as a transient, self-limited loss of consciousness, is caused by a <strong>temporary decrease in cerebral blood flow</strong>. Based on the underlying cause, syncope can be categorized into several types. These include <strong>cardiogenic syncope</strong> caused by heart-related issues; <strong>reflex-mediated syncope</strong> triggered by various stimuli like neck pressure; syncope due to <strong>orthostatic hypotension</strong>; and <strong>neurologic syncope</strong>, which is associated with neurological conditions. If a patient presents with a chief concern suggesting syncope, an ABCDE assessment should be performed to determine if they are unstable or stable, followed by a systematic investigation to determine the most likely cause. The normal physiologic response to standing up with blood pooling in the legs is an increase in heart rate and constriction of blood vessels. This is <strong>blunted by orthostatic hypotension</strong> resulting in <strong>decreased cerebral blood flow and syncope</strong>. Etiologies of orthostatic hypotension include <strong>medications&#160;</strong>(e.g., vasodilators, inotropic/chronotropic blockade, diuretics), <strong>autonomic dysfunction</strong> (e.g., advanced age, neurodegenerative disease), and <strong>hypovolemia&#160;</strong>(e.g., fluid restriction, GI losses, fever).<br><br>Orthostatic hypotension is a common cause of syncope, particularly in older adults. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in <strong>systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg</strong> or a decrease in <strong>diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg</strong> within 2-5 minutes of standing. Treatment depends largely on the underlying etiology but can include modifying postural transition, such as rising slowly when standing, increasing fluid and salt intake, or discontinuing/decreasing the dose of causative medications. This patient should receive <strong>intravenous fluids</strong>, as he appears clinically hypovolemic. Consideration could be given to <strong>lowering the dose of his beta-blocker</strong> or discontinuing the medication, as it is likely to be a contributing factor. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Intravenous fluids:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increase dosage of losartan:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Increasing the dosage of antihypertensives (e.g. losartan) in a patient with orthostatic hypotension could further exacerbate the patient&#8217;s symptoms. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cardiology consult for pacemaker placement:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Pacemaker placement is not indicated in this scenario as the patient&#8217;s history, symptoms, and ECG findings are consistent with orthostatic hypotension, and not with bradyarrhythmia or heart block that would warrant such an intervention. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ MRI of the brain:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: An MRI of the brain is not indicated in this scenario, as this patient&#8217;s history and physical examination are more consistent with orthostatic hypotension than an acute stroke or other brain pathology. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Transthoracic echocardiography:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is typically used to assess structural cardiac abnormalities.

It is characterized by a transient loss of consciousness and muscle tone due to a <strong>sudden decrease in heart rate and blood pressure</strong>, leading to reduced cerebral perfusion. The patient's 2 documented episodes occurred while standing in line at the grocery store, suggesting a potential trigger from standing or a stress-related event. Classic <strong>prodromal symptoms</strong> associated with syncope and presyncope, particularly the vasovagal form of reflex syncope, include <strong>lightheadedness</strong>, a feeling of <strong>warmth&#160;</strong>or cold, <strong>sweating</strong>, <strong>palpitations</strong>, pallor, <strong>nausea</strong>, <strong>visual blurring</strong>, and diminution of hearing and/or occurrence of unusual (often \"whooshing\") sounds. <br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/uu_7s-VuRqu8l99HbfL-WQP9QGONHiJC/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recent uptitration of amlodipine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s blood pressure is not significantly low and there is no evidence of orthostatic hypotension.

Family members have noted irritability, especially when difficulty arose with cooking a familiar dish. Past medical history includes gastroesophageal reflux managed with omeprazole.

The neurological examination reveals no focal abnormalities, and gait is normal. The patient&#8217;s Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score is 23/30, and depression screening suggests no symptoms of depression. Which of the following historical elements should be elicited to evaluate for a reversible cause of these symptoms?",

Thus, patients with injury to the trigeminal root will have <strong>absent sensory information over the entire ipsilateral face and weakness or wasting of the muscles of mastication</strong>.
