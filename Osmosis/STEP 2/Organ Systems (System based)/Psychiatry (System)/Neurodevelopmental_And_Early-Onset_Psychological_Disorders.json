The headache occurs over the left side of his head and is associated with nausea, photophobia, and vomiting. The headache is often preceded by a tingling sensation in the right arm and face. The pain improves with resting in a dark, quiet room. Past medical history is significant for a previous suicide attempt, major depressive disorder, and asthma, for which he occasionally uses an albuterol inhaler. The patient stopped taking his sertraline two months ago. The patient drinks 4-6 glasses of wine every day and does not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Vital signs are within normal limits. Laboratory evaluation reveals transaminitis. The patient insists on a prescription for dihydroergotamine to manage his headache. Which of the following is a contraindication to the administration of this medication? &#160;",

      "solution": "This patient, who has recently started on ciprofloxacin, likely developed theophylline toxicity and resultant seizure due to drug-drug interaction. &#160; <br><br><strong>Theophylline&#160;</strong>is an oral methylxanthine. It <strong>inhibits phosphodiesterase,</strong> converting cAMP into an inactive form called 5-AMP. Blocking this enzyme increases the cAMP level within the cell, causing smooth muscle relaxation in the bronchial airways. Blocking <strong>adenosine receptors&#160;</strong>throughout the body blocks adenosine typically increases smooth muscle contraction in the respiratory tract. This mechanism could explain some of its bronchodilator effects. &#160;<br><br>Methylxanthines are metabolized by cytochrome p450. This medication is sometimes considered in patients with mild asthma or as an add-on long-term control medication in moderate to severe asthma after the failure of other medications. Its use in patients with COPD is controversial, with only a few studies showing improvement in functional impairment. However, theophylline is generally avoided because it has a narrow therapeutic index and is very easy to reach supratherapeutic levels. This could cause insomnia, nausea, and vomiting, but the most dangerous side effects include <strong>overstimulation&#160;</strong>of the <strong>central nervous and cardiovascular systems</strong>, leading to seizures and arrhythmias. Medications that inhibit these enzymes (e.g., fluoxetine or ciprofloxacin) should be avoided.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lisinopril:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.
