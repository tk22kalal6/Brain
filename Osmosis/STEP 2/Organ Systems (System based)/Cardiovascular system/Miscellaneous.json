Temperature is 38.3&#186;C (101.0&#186;F), pulse is 108/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, blood pressure is 81/50 mmHg, and SpO<sub>2</sub> is 92% on 3 liters nasal cannula oxygen. On physical examination, the patient appears listless. There is no accessory muscle use. Small tender nodules on multiple fingers and non-tender red spots on the soles of both feet are seen. Small dark lines are present in several nailbeds. Mucous membranes are moist. Cardiac auscultation reveals a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left fifth intercostal space. There is no lower extremity edema. Intravenous (IV) access is established, and laboratory studies are obtained. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",

This patient&#8217;s shortness of breath, <strong>hypotension</strong>, and <strong>new murmur</strong> are likely due to <strong>acute valvular regurgitation</strong> (either mitral or tricuspid regurgitation), which has likely been caused by the infective endocarditis. The next step is to assess the valves with an <strong>emergent transthoracic echocardiogram</strong>, which can help guide resuscitation efforts to stabilize this patient. <br><br><strong>Valvular insufficiency</strong> (regurgitation) refers to the state of a cardiac valve being &#8220;leaky&#8221; and causing forward blood flow to move backward through the incompetent valve into the previous cardiac chamber. All four cardiac valves can become insufficient, leading to various common pathologies such as <strong>pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias, </strong>or<strong> heart failure</strong>. Transthoracic echocardiogram is generally sufficient to diagnose valvular disorders. In some cases, transesophageal echocardiogram may be necessary, especially if there are plans for surgical or transcatheter intervention.<br><br>Treatment of unstable patients with valvular insufficiency involves an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong> and stabilizing any acute issues. Intravenous (IV) access should be established, and patients may need IV fluids or diuretics depending on the underlying issue. Emergent echocardiogram should be performed, and in some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary. Endotracheal intubation should be pursued if there is <strong>severe respiratory failure</strong>, but extreme caution should be exercised as patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and/or right ventricular failure can have a cardiac arrest upon initiation of anesthesia or mechanical ventilation.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Transthoracic echocardiogram:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Transesophageal echocardiogram:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient is unstable with low blood pressure and is at elevated risk for further decompensation.
