ECG shows a new left bundle branch block and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows new wall motion abnormalities and a dilated, poorly functioning left ventricle. These findings associated with chest pressure are highly concerning for <strong>postoperative myocardial infarction</strong>. Thus, <strong>left heart catheterization</strong> is warranted. <br><br>Postoperative hypotension is relatively common. <strong>Acute cardiopulmonary issues</strong> that cause postoperative hypotension are life-threatening and may include tension pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and cardiac tamponade. <strong>Anaphylaxis&#160;</strong>can occur during anesthesia induction or postoperatively. <strong>Severe blood loss</strong> may occur and lead to <strong>hemorrhagic shock</strong>. Urgent but usually not life-threatening causes of postoperative hypotension include <strong>significant intraoperative fluid loss</strong>, poor sympathetic tone from <strong>neuraxial analgesia</strong>, and <strong>adrenal crisis</strong> in patients with underlying adrenal insufficiency.<br><br>Management of postoperative hypotension always begins with an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong>. Patients should be given <strong>IV fluid resuscitation</strong> and may need to be started on vasopressors to stabilize their blood pressure. Laboratory studies should be checked, including a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel.<br><br>If a cardiopulmonary cause is suspected, then a chest X-ray is indicated, which may reveal pulmonary edema or a pneumothorax. CT imaging of the chest should be performed if pulmonary embolism is suspected. &#160;Serum troponin levels, electrocardiogram, and transthoracic echocardiogram can diagnose cardiac causes (e.g., myocardial infarction, pericardial tamponade).

This position (seated, leaning forward) reduces pressure on the parietal pericardium, alleviating the pain. Exertion does not affect the chest pain, in comparison to anginal pain. The pain often radiates to the trapezius ridge, which is a fairly specific finding of pericarditis. On physical examination, cardiac auscultation may reveal a <strong>friction rub</strong>.

A <strong>transthoracic echocardiogram</strong> should be ordered next to help determine if diagnostic criteria for HCM are met. <br><br><strong>HCM</strong> refers to a genetic condition associated with <strong>left ventricular hypertrophy</strong> that cannot be attributed to another cardiac, systemic, or metabolic cause. It should always be considered in pediatric patients with exertional chest pain or dyspnea, especially if a systolic ejection murmur is heard on physical examination.

Findings on exam of a <strong>systolic ejection murmur, heard best at the left lower sternal border, that is louder with Valsalva</strong>. Would&#160;raise concerns for HCM. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Once a murmur is identified in a pediatric patient, a focused history and physical examination should be performed. Patients and parents should be asked about&#160;<strong>chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, palpitations,</strong>&#160;or <strong>syncope</strong>. Newborns with a murmur should be assessed for<strong>&#160;difficulty feeding</strong> and <strong>cyanosis.

In addition to cardiac auscultation, bilateral pulses&#160;should be palpated. Once innocent murmurs are ruled out, pathologic murmurs can be differentiated based on various characteristics.

Diastolic murmurs are further differentiated by whether they occur in <strong>early diastole</strong> (e.g., aortic regurgitation and pulmonic regurgitation) or <strong>mid-to-late diastole</strong> (e.g., mitral stenosis and tricuspid stenosis).

He has had <strong>ventricular fibrillation</strong> and has a <strong>family member with sudden cardiac death</strong> likely from HCM. Therefore, he meets criteria for an <strong>implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)</strong> to be placed. This should be done before medical or surgical therapy to treat HCM is considered. <br><br>All patients diagnosed with HCM should have a <strong>risk assessment for sudden cardiac death</strong> performed, and patients with one or more risk factors should have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator placed. Risk factors include history of ventricular fibrillation, greater than 2 syncopal episodes, as well as certain findings on echocardiogram like reduced ejection fraction. All patients should also have genetic counseling provided to first degree relatives. <br><br>Patients without risk factors for sudden cardiac death should have a stress echo to assess for resting and dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Patients with risk factors should have the ICD placed and then proceed to stress echo. <br><br>Treatment depends on whether patients have symptoms, whether they have LVOO, and the measured ejection fraction. <strong>Symptomatic </strong>patients without LVOO or patients who are asymptomatic without LVVOO but with a low EF should be started on <strong>beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers</strong> and should have annual screening with <strong>electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.</strong> Patients with LVOO who are asymptomatic should be considered for medical therapy, while patients with LVOO who are symptomatic should start on medical therapy. If medical therapy is insufficient to control symptoms or repeat echo shows worsening obstruction, surgery should be consulted for possible myotomy. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Implantable cardiac defibrillator:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Nitroglycerin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Nitroglycerin&#160;should be avoided&#160;in&#160;patients with&#160;hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&#160;as it can decrease&#160;preload&#160;and&#160;worsen the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Furosemide:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>Loop diuretics like&#160;</span><span>f</span><span>urosemide</span><span>&#160;</span><span>should be avoided</span><span>&#160;in&#160;</span><span>patients</span><span>&#160;with&#160;</span><span>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</span><span>&#160;as&#160;</span><span>they</span><span>&#160;can decrease preload&#160;</span><span>and&#160;</span><span>worsen the left ventricular ou</span><span>tflow tract obstruction.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Septal myotomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:</span><span>&#160;Septal myotomy is a therapeutic&#160;</span><span>option</span><span>&#160;for patients&#160;</span><span>with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</span><span>&#160;</span><span>and LVOO&#160;</span><span>that is&#160;</span><span>refractory to medical management</span><span>&#160;or that worsens despite medical therapy</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;This procedure involves surgical removal of the hypertrophied left ventricular&#160;</span><span>segment</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>Beta blockers and an implantable cardiac&#160;</span><span>defibrillator</span><span>&#160;should first be prescribed</span><span>&#160;for this patient</span><span>.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Amiodarone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Amiodarone is&#160;not&#160;indicated&#160;as first line management for patients with&#160;hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
