      "solution": "This patient presents with a sudden, severe, &#8220;tearing&#8221; chest pain in the setting of cocaine use and severely elevated blood pressure, which is highly suggestive of an <strong>aortic dissection</strong>. This life-threatening condition occurs when blood enters the medial layer of the aortic wall through a tear in the intimal layer, creating a false lumen. Cocaine use is a known risk factor due to its hypertensive effects. The best next step in the evaluation of this hemodynamically stable patient is to obtain a <strong>CT angiography of the chest</strong> for diagnosis and classification. &#160; <br><br>CT angiography (CTA) of the chest serves as the primary diagnostic method for suspected acute aortic dissections in stable patients as it provides detailed visualization of the aorta. If a patient cannot undergo CTA due to a contrast allergy or severe renal impairment, an MRI angiogram (MRA) can be used instead. If the CTA or MRA reveals a normal aorta without any signs of dissection, alternative causes should be considered such as myocardial infarction, pericarditis, or pulmonary embolism. &#160; <br><br>If imaging reveals an intimal flap and a <strong>double lumen involving the ascending aorta</strong>, regardless of whether it extends to the descending aorta, <strong>Stanford type A</strong> aortic dissection is diagnosed. If the imaging reveals an intraluminal flap and a <strong>double lumen in the descending aorta only</strong>, this is indicative of a <strong>Stanford type B&#160;</strong>aortic dissection. Management differs depending on the type of aortic dissection, with type A requiring emergent surgery and type B often requiring medical management first. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/5QaSQu7CSm_r2wADbuCLlfk4QymORpOk/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ CT angiography of the chest:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Serum troponin levels:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Serum troponin levels will likely be part of the diagnostic workup.
