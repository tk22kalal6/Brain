It is most likely to occur <strong>within the first 5 days post-MI&#160;</strong>but can occur up to 2 weeks later. The patient initially develops severe chest pain due to the tearing of the left ventricular wall, followed by very rapid accumulation of blood in the pericardium, resulting in acute cardiac tamponade characterized by hypotension and distant heart sounds. Most patients enter into cardiac arrest, and thus the mortality rate for left ventricular free wall rupture is very high. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Mechanical complications of myocardial infarction are summarized in the table below. &#160;Other complications that occur after myocardial infarction (MI) include ventricular arrhythmias (the most common cause of the death 24 hours post-MI), postinfarction acute pericarditis (occurs within 1-3 days), Dressler syndrome (weeks to months after MI), and left ventricular aneurysm (occurs several months after MI). &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/qic8nsP6Q_CDXZhWc2Y4EU6aQtGuN8hf/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Left ventricular free wall rupture&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Interventricular septum rupture&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Interventricular septum rupture is another possible complication of STEMI involving the left anterior descending artery; however, a holosystolic murmur is heard on exam in these patients.

      "solution": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is an emergency condition that requires immediate management. A precise and focused history and physical examination is critical in patients with suspected ACS as it helps rule out other differential diagnoses and can also indicate the severity of the condition. &#160; <br><br>The most common presenting symptom of acute coronary syndrome is chest pain. The pain is usually localized to the substernal region and described as pressure-like or crushing in nature, with radiation to the jaw, left shoulder, or both. Pain can sometimes be in the epigastric region rather than the chest. Sharp, stabbing chest pain that is affected by movement or palpation is non-ischemic and suggests an alternative diagnosis. Other common symptoms of acute coronary syndrome include nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, lightheadedness, and fatigue. &#160; <br><br>Acute coronary syndrome does not have many consistent, characteristic physical exam findings, but a detailed physical exam is important in considering all possible differential diagnoses for patients presenting with chest pain. For example, pain that is reproducible with palpation or movement during the physical examination is more suggestive of non-ischemic conditions, such as costochondritis or pericarditis. &#160; <br><br>Most commonly, patients with ACS usually appear anxious and diaphoretic. Third and/or fourth heart sounds can sometimes be heard on auscultation in cases of ACS. While it can be physiologic, a pathologic S3 is most commonly caused by ventricular dysfunction and is predictive of adverse cardiac outcomes. The pathologic fourth heart sound (S4) is generated by forceful atrial contraction in the setting of decreased ventricular compliance as a result of conditions such as ischemic heart disease, diastolic dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. If congestive heart failure develops as a result of acute coronary syndrome, bibasilar crackles and hypotension can be present as well.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/jArqo1D7RYGlrpCQxGC8NJ6LQISmbr4a/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sharp chest pain that decreases with leaning forward:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Sharp chest pain that decreases with leaning forward is a feature of acute pericarditis.

These medications are most commonly used to treat hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, and angina pectoris (also called stable angina), pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Of note, this patient has chest pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest as well as a normal resting EKG, which is consistent with angina pectoris. &#160; &#160;<br><br>As its name suggests, CCBs work by<strong>&#160;blocking voltage-gated calcium channels.</strong> This decreases the frequency with which calcium channels open, hence reducing calcium influx and intracellular calcium concentrations. In the sinoatrial node, CCBs are able to slow down cellular depolarization, which in turn decreases heart rate. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Moreover, by reducing calcium influx, CCBs reduce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, ultimately impairing muscle contractions. In the heart, this phenomenon causes decreased myocardial contractility as well as vasodilation of the coronary vessels. &#160; <br><br>Ultimately, CCBs treat angina via two mechanisms: <strong>1) decreasing the heart&#8217;s oxygen demand</strong> by reducing heart rate and contractility, and <strong>2) increasing its oxygen supply</strong> via coronary artery vasodilation. Side effects of CCBs include peripheral edema, headaches, flushing, reflexive tachycardia, and gingival hyperplasia. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/XqEAuLpnQ16poc8SZBfwTwNxRoCoeHaE/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Blockade of L-type calcium channels:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Stimulation of intracellular guanylyl cyclase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Medications such as nitrates promote vasodilation via this mechanism.

The vasodilation results in <strong>peripheral blood pooling</strong>, which reduces <strong>blood volume returning to the heart (preload)</strong>. The result is <strong>decreased myocardial oxygen demand,</strong> improving the symptoms of angina. Dilatation of arteries and arterioles (at a higher dose) decreases the systemic vascular resistance, reducing the afterload. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Blockade of L-type calcium channels in the heart and smooth muscle:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem, and amlodipine) act by blocking L-type calcium channels in the heart and peripheral vessel, thereby reducing smooth muscle contractility. However, they are not used to treat acute anginal symptoms and are more commonly used to prevent the onset of angina-like symptoms through vasodilation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Stimulation of dopamine-1 (D1) receptor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Fendolapam stimulates D1 receptors and acts by the vasodilation of coronary, peripheral, renal, and splanchnic vessels. It is mainly used in hypertensive crises or the management of postoperative hypertension. It is not indicated in this patient with chest discomfort. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Beta-adrenergic blockers reduce the heart rate and blood pressure by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and blood vessels. Although considered first-line therapy to prevent the recurrence of anginal episodes, they are not the treatment of choice for managing acute episodes of chest discomfort. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Venous smooth muscle relaxation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Arterial smooth muscle relaxation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Hydralazine causes vasodilation by relaxing the arterial smooth muscle and is typically indicated in managing severe acute hypertension and heart failure (in combination with nitrates). It is not indicated in the management of acute chest discomfort. &#160;</span></div>",
