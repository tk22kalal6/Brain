      "solution": "This patient with a history of latent tuberculosis (currently undergoing treatment) presents with seizure activity refractory to typical medical management. In this case, the most likely cause of the seizure is <strong>vitamin B6 deficiency,</strong> which is a <strong>common side effect of isoniazid. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Isoniazid depletes the body&#8217;s levels of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), which is an important cofactor in the synthesis of the inhibitory modulator gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Decreased GABA activity lowers the seizure threshold, resulting in seizures refractory to typical medical management. For this reason, patients on isoniazid <strong>must be given supplemental pyridoxine.</strong><br><br>Isoniazid can be used as monotherapy for treating latent tuberculosis or in conjunction with rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for active tuberculosis. It works by<strong>&#160;inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis</strong> and only works in tuberculosis, as it needs to be processed by mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase in order to be activated. In fact, mutations of mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase in certain strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are known to cause isoniazid resistance.

Ammonia needs to bind with hydrogen ions in order to become trapped in the collecting tubules as ammonium (NH4+). In type 4 RTA, impaired hydrogen secretion leads to less trapping. As a result, the small amounts of hydrogen that do enter the urine are able to significantly affect pH.

Thyroid hormone biosynthesis and secretion are strictly maintained by a regulatory mechanism that is highly sensitive to small changes in hormone concentrations. In healthy individuals, exposure to excess iodine inhibits the organification of iodide and diminishes hormone biosynthesis, a phenomenon known as the <strong>Wolff-Chaikoff effect</strong>. Iodine also acutely (hours) inhibits hormone secretion by <strong>inhibiting thyroglobulin proteolysis</strong>. However, the Wolff-Chaikoff effect is only temporary, and thyroid hormone biosynthesis returns to normal within a few weeks. &#160; <br><br>Iodine solution is indicated for preoperative preparation before thyroidectomy in Graves disease, for adjunctive therapy in Graves disease, and for the treatment of thyroid storm.

Given the presented medical history and pharmacologic treatment, the most likely diagnosis is <strong>acute dystonia</strong>, (specifically <strong>torticollis</strong>) secondary to antipsychotic use. Antipsychotics (especially first-generation antipsychotics) antagonize dopamine receptors and lead to an imbalance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the basal ganglia. Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary, sustained or intermittent muscle contractions that result in repetitive movements or an abnormal fixed posture. Since acute dystonia results in an elevated level of acetylcholine in the basal ganglia, first-line treatment for acute dystonia secondary to antipsychotics includes benztropine, an anticholinergic drug that blocks M1 receptor, and diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine that blocks H1 receptor and M1 receptors. &#160;<br><br>Antipsychotic medications are first-line medication treatment for schizophrenia and are used in a variety of other psychiatric illnesses. While they effectively reduce behaviors and symptoms associated with the conditions, the trade-off is their significant side effect profile. All antipsychotic medications are capable of causing <strong>extrapyramidal symptoms</strong> (EPS), but these are more common with 1st generation antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine).

Additional side effects include <strong>hepatotoxicity&#160;</strong>and a <strong>red-orange tinge</strong> to bodily fluids (e.g., urine, sweat, saliva) that is completely benign. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/kb0xwgnKSqu6-OD2qi_29pLxS_enyYR8/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Inhibition of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA synthesis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inhibition of arabinosyl transferase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient has a normal prothrombin time despite taking warfarin.

Treatment mainly consists of long-term medications called<strong>&#160;disease modifying antirheumatic drugs</strong> (DMARDs), which can be non-biological or biological. Since persistent inflammation in affected joints can cause permanent, irreversible damage, prompt diagnosis and early recognition of active disease are important. <strong>DMARDs should be used in all RA patients</strong> to maintain control of inflammation and the underlying disease process, with the goal of remission or low disease activity in order to improve disease outcome. &#160;<br><br>Most individuals are started on <strong>non-biological DMARDs</strong>. The most common is <strong>methotrexate</strong>, a folic acid analog that <strong>inhibits dihydrofolate reductase</strong>. The enzyme participates in tetrahydrofolate synthesis, so its inhibition reduces DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Its use in the treatment of RA is that it inhibits proliferation of the lymphocytes and other cells responsible for inflammation in the joints. Side effects include <strong>pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, stomatitis/mouth ulcers,</strong> and nephrotoxicity. Moreover, methotrexate can cause folate deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, and myelosuppression. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/S-WrrsEkSv2c4SoXBeeAiksLRnaEvPiO/_.png\"></div><br>Another DMARD is <strong>leflunomide</strong>, which reversibly inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, preventing pyrimidine synthesis and suppressing T-cell proliferation.

Arachidonic acid can be metabolized via two different pathways: the<strong>&#160;5-lipoxygenase</strong> (5-LO) <strong>pathway&#160;</strong>and the<strong>&#160;cyclooxygenase-1</strong> (COX-1) <strong>pathway</strong>. The 5-LO pathway produces leukotrienes from arachidonic acid (e.g., leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4), whereas the COX-1 pathway produces prostacyclins, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid.

During these hypotensive episodes, the pituitary lacks sufficient blood supply and can undergo ischemia and necrosis (Sheehan syndrome). This patient lacks the history consistent with severe postpartum hemorrhage, such as requiring blood transfusions after delivery.

She most likely has <strong>gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</strong> and is started on <strong>omeprazole</strong>, a <strong>proton pump inhibitor (PPI)&#160;</strong>that is considered a <strong>first-line&#160;</strong>agent for treating GERD. &#160; <br><br>Physiologically, when food enters the stomach, it causes the stomach walls to distend. These changes lead to the activation of branches of the vagus nerve and the release of <strong>acetylcholine</strong>, thereby activating <strong>M3 receptors</strong> on<strong>&#160;parietal cells</strong> of the stomach. Next, the<strong>&#160;G-cells</strong> in the gastric antrum release <strong>gastrin</strong>, activating <strong>CCK2 receptors</strong> on parietal cells. Gastrin and acetylcholine activate the <strong>enterochromaffin-like</strong> (ECL) <strong>cells</strong>, which release <strong>histamine&#160;</strong>and cause activation of <strong>H2 receptors</strong> on gastric parietal cells. Activation of M3, CCK2, and H2 receptors increases the conversion of water and CO2 to H+ and HCO3- by<strong>&#160;carbonic anhydrase.</strong> The <strong>H+</strong> is then <strong>pumped out</strong> of the parietal cells and the stomach via the <strong>H+/K+ ATPase pump.</strong> These H+ ions combine with Cl- ions to form hydrochloric acid and help <strong>decrease the stomach pH. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>PPIs work by<strong>&#160;irreversibly inhibiting&#160;</strong>the<strong>&#160;H+/K+ ATPase pump,</strong> thereby inhibiting the release of hydrogen ions into the stomach.

RAS activates the <strong>renin-angiotensinogen-aldosterone system (RAAS)</strong> which helps increase renal blood flow (RBF) to the stenotic kidneys and improves the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This can lead to volume expansion, sodium retention, and subsequent hypertension. &#160; <br><br>Patients with <strong>bilateral RAS</strong> are<strong>&#160;dependent upon angiotensin II&#160;</strong>for maintaining adequate GFR. <strong>The use of angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs),&#160;</strong>such as lisinopril, blocks the angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction, which can reduce systemic blood pressure and reduce RBF. In addition, it also causes renal efferent arteriole dilation and a reduction in GFR and renal filtration fraction. Therefore, ACEIs can precipitate renal failure and are <strong>relatively contraindicated in patients with bilateral RAS.</strong>&#160; The medication, however, can be continued if the rise in serum creatinine remains acceptable (i.e. &lt;30 %).

Together, these findings are consistent with <strong>Parkinson disease</strong> (PD). PD is caused by degeneration of the substantia nigra, and disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway, thus decreasing striatal dopamine levels. Treatment of PD involves several medications that increase dopamine levels within the brain. &#160; <br><br>Initial treatment often involves a combination of <strong>carbidopa/levodopa.</strong> Unlike dopamine, levodopa can cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), which gets converted to dopamine in the CNS via decarboxylases. Dopamine decarboxylase inhibitors, like <strong>carbidopa</strong>, prevent the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery, allowing for more levodopa to cross the BBB. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Over time, dopamine becomes more efficiently metabolized by different enzymes in the brain, leading to a <strong>&#8220;wearing-off&#8221; phenomenon</strong>&#8211;where the patient&#8217;s symptoms improve when they take the medication, with effects rapidly ending after one or two hours. People also experience the <strong>&#8220;on/off&#8221; phenomenon</strong>, where patients experience sudden oscillations of symptomatic improvement followed by a rapid return to rigidity and hypokinesia. Chronic use of levodopa can also cause dyskinesias, which are uncontrolled, involuntary movements. These motor complications occur as the disease progresses, as<strong>&#160;nigrostriatal neurons lose their capacity to store and recycle dopamine.</strong> This phenomenon requires higher doses of levodopa and subsequent over-excitation of striatal neurons. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Reemergence of parkinsonism symptoms between doses:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Worsening of impulse control disorder:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Worsening of impulse control disorders (e.g., gambling, compulsive buying) can be seen in patients taking dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole and ropinirole.

Following treatment, she develops palpitations and ECG changes that include ST segment depression and T wave inversions (U-waves) indicative of <strong>amphotericin-induced hypokalemia. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>Amphotericin B can induce nephrotoxicity via tubular injury and vasoconstriction, which ultimately results in hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and the RTA (normal anion gap acidosis). In fungal cells, amphotericin B binds to ergosterol, a component of the fungal cell membrane, and creates micropores. Similarly, it binds to cholesterol in host cell membranes (with lesser affinity) and increases membrane permeability. As a result, membrane electrochemical gradients are reduced, particularly between the renal tubular cells and the lumen. Potassium subsequently moves down this concentration gradient, resulting in a loss of potassium and limitated hydrogen ion secretion. Renal magnesium loss can also occur secondary to amphotericin nephrotoxicity. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Acute kidney injury is typically the first sign of amphotericin B induced nephrotoxicity. Normally, as the sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule increases, more NaCl diffuses into the macula densa. Tubuloglomerular feedback is initiated and afferent arteriole vasoconstriction occurs to limit NaCl losses. With amphotericin B use, permeability of macula densa cells increases and results in profound afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, a fall in GFR, and a subsequent rise in creatinine. &#160;<br><br>In order to limit amphotericin B associated nephrotoxicity, <strong>lipid formulations (liposomal and lipid complex) are used. Salt loading or volume expansion</strong> has also been found to be effective in limiting the fall in GFR as it reduces the sensitivity of the tubuloglomerular feedback system. Preventive measures to reduce nephrotoxicity include <strong>administering lower doses</strong> and <strong>avoiding co-administration of other nephrotoxic agents </strong>such as aminoglycosides or cyclosporine. Other adverse effects include fever, chills, and body aches.

They most often occur in the <strong>small intestines</strong> but can also develop in the appendix, pancreas, and lungs. &#160; <br><br>Carcinoid tumors produce excess <strong>serotonin</strong>. Most serotonin is transported to the liver via portal circulation and broken down by first-pass hepatic metabolism. Therefore, the serotonin does not reach the systemic circulation to cause symptoms. However, <strong>carcinoid syndrome</strong> develops when serotonin escapes first-pass hepatic metabolism and enters the systemic circulation, such as when cancer <strong>metastasizes to extraintestinal sites</strong> (e.g. liver). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Clinical features of carcinoid syndrome are due to serotonin&#8217;s effects on various tissues. Serotonin stimulates gut motility in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in secretory <strong>diarrhea</strong>. In the skin, serotonin&#8217;s vasodilatory effects cause <strong>skin flushing</strong>, lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes. The flushing can be precipitated by emotional or physical stress and alcohol use. In the lungs, serotonin causes bronchoconstriction, leading to <strong>wheezing&#160;</strong>and <strong>dyspnea</strong>. Finally, serotonin stimulates fibroblast growth in cardiac tissues, resulting in plaque-like fibrous deposits on the valves, cardiac chambers, and major vessels.

The cancerous cells produce antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which leads to excessive free water retention and hyponatremia.<br><br><strong>Vaptans </strong>(e.g., conivaptan, tolvaptan) are <strong>direct ADH receptor antagonists</strong> that are used in the treatment of SIADH due to their efficacy in correcting hyponatremia. These drugs block V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, resulting in excessive loss of free water with minimal loss of electrolytes. These changes help normalize serum sodium levels.<br><br>Vaptans should be used cautiously to avoid rapid correction of serum sodium, which can result in a form of devastating central nervous system injury known as <strong>osmotic demyelination syndrome</strong>. Vaptans are otherwise relatively safe drugs, with side effects including <strong>excessive thirst, dry mouth, </strong>and <strong>increased urinary frequency</strong>.<br><br><strong>Demeclocycline </strong>is a tetracycline derivative that can also be used in SIADH treatment due its ability to induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

The kidneys respond by secreting renin into the bloodstream. Renin is a proteolytic enzyme that breaks down a protein made in the liver called angiotensinogen, and this gives rise to angiotensin I. When angiotensin I reaches the lungs, angiotensin I is converted into <strong>angiotensin II</strong> by an enzyme called <strong>angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)&#160;</strong>in the pulmonary vessels. Angiotensin II binds to receptors in vascular smooth muscle and causes them to constrict, which increases the blood pressure. Finally, angiotensin II also stimulates the release of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys, which also increases water reabsorption.

The first step in this process involves <strong>tyrosine</strong>, a precursor of norepinephrine, being transported into the noradrenergic nerve terminal by a Na+-dependent carrier. Tyrosine is converted to DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase. DOPA is then converted to dopamine. Afterward, dopamine is transported into synaptic vesicles with assistance from <strong>vesicular monoamine oxidase transporters</strong> (VMAT). Within the vesicles, dopamine is converted by dopamine &#946;-hydroxylase into norepinephrine.

The latter phenomenon is because charged particles have a more challenging time back-diffusing across the renal epithelium into the systemic circulation. &#160; &#160;<br><br>P.S.

      "solution": "<strong>Desensitization and tolerance</strong> are important concepts in pharmacodynamics and refers to a decreased effect of a drug (e.g. alcohol, heroin) or medication over time following subsequent doses. Over time, as an agonist binds to its cellular receptor, it may lose its ability to produce a robust response within cells via secondary messengers. Desensitization (also called tachyphylaxis) generally occurs rapidly and can occur after the first dose of a medication. On the other hand, tolerance occurs always after repeated doses and may take weeks or months. In this patient, he is likely experiencing desensitization (tachyphylaxis) to epinephrine, so repeated doses exert a weaker effect than the original dose.<br><br>Desensitization and tolerance can occur via many mechanisms, with several of the most common mechanisms outlined below:<br><br><ol><li><strong>Downregulation of receptor expression</strong>. For example, chronic opioid use results in downregulating the number of receptors available to bind the opioid or may increase the degradation or sequestration of receptors. This results in stronger doses of opioids needed to produce the same effect.</li><li><strong>Uncoupling of receptors to secondary messengers</strong>. This is often mediated by proteins called <strong>arrestins</strong>, which bind to G-protein-coupled receptors to prevent interaction with secondary messengers. They can also tag these receptors for endocytosis. <strong>This is common in desensitization (tachyphylaxis)</strong>.</li><li><strong>Exhaustion of intracellular intermediary molecules</strong>. This can occur with drugs such as amphetamines, which eventually leads to the depletion of secondary messengers within cells.</li><li><strong>Increased breakdown of agonists</strong>. For example, this can occur with chronic alcohol use, as &#8220;tolerance&#8221; increases with repeated chronic use due to more rapid degradation of ethanol.</li><li><strong>Physiologic adaptation in the body</strong>.

Patients with onset of labor before 34 weeks of gestation are administered <strong>tocolytics&#160;</strong>to delay labor and provide time for corticosteroid administration to stimulate fetal lung maturation.<br><br><strong>Tocolytics&#160;</strong>are a group of medications that delay the onset of labor in patients presenting with preterm labor. Specifically, <strong>Terbutaline&#160;</strong>is a beta-agonist that is used for tocolysis. Beta-2 receptors are found in the walls of the uterine smooth muscles. These are Gs protein-coupled receptors and, once activated, induce cyclic AMP formation (cAMP) by activating adenylyl cyclase. Once cAMP is formed, it phosphorylates protein kinase A and deactivates myosin light-chain kinase, inhibiting smooth muscle contraction. <br><br>Terbutaline is a selective Beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist used to delay labor by inhibiting uterine contractions. It is used for short-term tocolysis and uterine tachysystole.<br><br>Adverse effects of terbutaline occur secondary to its effects on beta-receptors. In the mother, terbutaline can cause tachycardia, arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, hypotension, and pulmonary edema.

Before starting either of these chemotherapy regimens, it is now common to &#8220;prime&#8221; the patient&#8217;s immune system with targeted monoclonal antibodies, which help the patient&#8217;s immune system increase the immune visibility of tumor cells. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Approximately 60-80% of cancer cells in colorectal tumors overexpress the EGFR receptor.

Panitumumab is a human monoclonal antibody, whereas Cetuximab is a chimeric mouse monoclonal antibody. Both Cetuximab and Panitumumab have similar side effects, including rash, elevated LFTs, and diarrhea. Neither therapy is more efficacious in the treatment of colorectal cancer. A key difference between the two drugs is the role that cetuximab plays in immunological priming. Cetuximab has been shown to increase ADCC and other immunostimulatory activities such as cell maturation, T-cell recruitment to the tumor, increased antigen presentation, and cytotoxic NK T-cell priming. On the other hand, Panitumumab notably does not engage in cytotoxic NK T-cell priming. It does, however, engage in immune cytotoxicity at a much lower extent via neutrophil-driven ADCC. While it remains to be seen which of these drugs are superior in clinical efficacy, it&#8217;s clear that cetuximab has robust effects in modulating immune cytotoxic effects in cancer cells. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ VEGF:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> This patient initially received cetuximab, which targets EGFR.

This segment of the nephron reabsorbs sodium and chloride via <strong>the Na+/Cl&#8211; carrier</strong> on the apical surface of the tubule and is responsible for 5% of filtered sodium reabsorption. The cotransporter moves Na+ in the direction of its concentration gradient and uses that energy to move a chloride against its concentration gradient.

Ca++ ions can diffuse across the apical surface into the tubule cells, down their concentration gradient, and then move across the basolateral surface into the interstitium against their concentration gradient as 1 Na+ moves from the interstitium into the tubule cells. <strong>Calcium reabsorption</strong> is regulated by the <strong>parathyroid hormone (PTH)</strong>. Moreover, the Na+/K+ ATPase on the basolateral surface keeps the intracellular Na+ level low, and that allows more Na+ to flow into the tubule, down its concentration gradient on the basolateral surface through the Na+/Ca++ channels, and on the apical surface through the Na+/Cl- cotransporter. <br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/aWLDF5ZUQKO1UCWl9mX5WiJESqCo11Qh/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Major site for sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate reabsorption&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) carries out isosmotic reabsorption of amino acids, glucose, and&#160;numerous&#160;ions.

It is primarily used to alleviate constipation by acting as an <strong>osmotic laxative</strong> but can also relieve indigestion and heartburn. When taken orally, the osmotic force of the magnesia suspension draws fluids from the intracellular compartment and retains those already within the intestinal lumen. These changes distend the bowel, thus stimulating nerves within the colon wall, inducing peristalsis and <strong>diarrhea</strong>.

      "solution": "This patient presents with <strong>abnormal serologic results (elevated activated partial thromboplastin time and positive VDRL)&#160;</strong>combined with<strong> two prior spontaneous abortions</strong> and is most likely suffering from <strong>antiphospholipid syndrome (APS),</strong> which requires anticoagulation to decrease the risk of thrombosis and associated pregnancy complications. <strong>Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)&#160;</strong>is the anticoagulant of choice in pregnant patients&#8211;other alternatives include unfractionated heparin or aspirin. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Warfarin</strong>, a vitamin K antagonist, is <strong>contraindicated&#160;</strong>in pregnancy except in those considered high risk (e.g. mechanical heart valve). It easily<strong> crosses the placenta</strong> and is a known <strong>teratogen</strong>, with the highest risk occurring when administered between 6 to 12 weeks of gestation. Warfarin exposure in pregnancy can cause<strong> fetal death, neonatal death, and fetal warfarin syndrome,&#160;</strong>which refers to developmental abnormalities including nasal hypoplasia, a &#8220;stippled&#8221; appearance to the ends of long bones, and intrauterine growth restriction, cardiac anomalies, and developmental delay. Furthermore, the <strong>risk of miscarriages or stillbirths</strong> in pregnant women exposed to warfarin <strong>increases&#160;</strong>significantly. Women on warfarin who become pregnant should be informed of the potential risks to the fetus.&#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Warfarin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Low-molecular-weight heparin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient most likely suffers from anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) and should be initiated anticoagulation as soon as possible to prevent thrombotic complications.
