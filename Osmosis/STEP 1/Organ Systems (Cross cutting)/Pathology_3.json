      "solution": "<strong>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)&#160;</strong>should be considered in any older individual presenting with sudden onset abdominal, low back, or flank pain and a history of syncope with hypotension. &#160;Risk factors for AAA include significant age <strong>&gt;65 years, smoking, male gender, family history</strong> of AAA, and other risk factors for coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease including hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are <strong>true aneurysms</strong>, meaning all three layers of the blood vessel - the intima, media, and adventitia - are dilated. The pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysms is a complex, multifactorial process that involves alterations in the structure of the vascular wall due to inflammatory changes, abnormal collagen remodeling and cross-linking, as well as loss of elastin and smooth muscle cells. This ultimately results in progressive thinning and weakening of the aortic wall and enlargement of the aortic diameter to a dilation <strong>50% greater than the normal diameter</strong> of the aorta. &#160; <br><br>AAAs commonly occur at the <strong>infrarenal&#160;</strong>level, or below the level of the renal arteries. People with near rupture or rapid expansion of a AAA commonly present with sudden onset back, flank, or abdominal pain and associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, mimicking a myriad of other conditions. Other associated symptoms may include <strong>diminished peripheral pulses</strong> due to expansion of the aneurysm compressing the internal iliac arteries. Although a <strong>pulsatile abdominal mass</strong> is a classic presentation, it may not always be detectable, especially if the patient is obese, such as in this vignette. If left untreated, AAAs can rupture, leading to severe hypotension, hemodynamic instability, and death. In a case where rupture has not occurred, <strong>repair&#160;</strong>should be offered when the aneurysm is<strong>&#160;&gt;5 cm</strong>. <br><br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/nHMW_VVESfKJL3GyfeDFa6kESGu3DghW/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Renal colic:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Renal colic commonly causes flank pain radiating to the groin with associated nausea and vomiting; however, it rarely causes syncope.

      "solution": "This previously healthy <strong>pregnant woman</strong> most likely has a <strong>cavernous hemangioma.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Cavernous hemangioma, also called hepatic hemangioma, is the<strong>&#160;most common benign tumor of the liver.</strong> Hemangiomas are tumors composed of large, dilated vascular channels that can arise throughout the body (e.g., liver, brain, eye). Their etiology is incompletely understood, but they are thought to arise from vascular malformations or hamartomas of congenital origin. A hemangioma can be diagnosed at any age but occurs most commonly in women between 30-50 years of age. Similar to adenomas, they tend to increase in size in response to estrogen exposure, but they can also occur in its absence. In contrast to hepatic adenoma, a cavernous hemangioma is <strong>unlikely to regress with estrogen withdrawal</strong>. Most tumors are asymptomatic and are often found as an incidental mass on imaging. When symptoms are present, right upper quadrant pain and abdominal fullness are common. Additional symptoms may include nausea, anorexia, and early satiety, due to compression of adjacent structures. &#160;<br><br>Diagnosis is typically based on imaging, clinical presentation, and patient history. Ultrasound typically reveals a <strong>well-demarcated, hyperechoic, homogeneous mass.</strong> A biopsy is relatively contraindicated because of the risk of bleeding. Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment and are observed for the development of symptoms. When symptoms arise, surgery with resection or enucleation may be considered. &#160; &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/zvCq1ClITnaMH-C_Ks6rqXCxRjW12SpU/_.png\"></div><br><br>Retrieved from: Wikimedia Commons<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hepatic adenoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Hepatic adenomas are rare, benign liver tumors arising from hepatocytes. The most common symptom is pain due to compression of adjacent structures. Hepatic adenomas tend to bleed and may result in life-threatening intra-abdominal bleeding. Hepatic adenomas carry some risk for malignant transformation. They have been associated with estrogen exposure (e.g. OCP and pregnancy). Although it is difficult to differentiate an adenoma from a hemangioma, the former often presents on ultrasound with central heterogeneous material and calcifications from bleeding. Also, adenomas are likely to regress in size with estrogen withdrawal, unlike this case. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Focal nodular hyperplasia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Focal nodular hyperplasia, the second most common tumor of the liver, is thought to arise from a hyperplastic hepatocyte reaction to an underlying arteriovenous malformation. Ultrasound often shows a central scar, a highly suggestive finding for focal nodular hyperplasia. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hepatocellular carcinoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver. Patients may present with jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, ascites, and anorexia. Risk factors include chronic hepatitis B or C infections, alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune disease, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, and specific carcinogens (e.g. aflatoxin). On ultrasound, HCC typically presents with poorly-defined margins and coarse, irregular internal echoes. This patient has none of those risk factors and her imaging results favor another diagnosis. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cavernous hemangioma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Metastatic colon cancer:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Patients with any type of metastatic disease are likely to be more symptomatic from the primary cancer.

      "solution": "This patient most likely has <strong>squamous cell carcinoma</strong> of the cervix. It is the most common subtype of cervical cancer. In the early stages, the condition is largely asymptomatic. However, if symptoms are present, they may include <strong>abnormal vaginal bleeding</strong>, especially after sexual intercourse, which is known as postcoital bleeding. Vaginal discomfort and a <strong>foul-smelling discharge</strong> might be also present. In general, tumors with a depth of invasion less than 3 mm will present with only local symptoms, since lymphovascular invasion is rare at this point.<br><br>In advanced cases, the cancer can spread to neighboring tissues. When the cancer has spread to the bladder, there may be symptoms such as <strong>urinary frequency, dysuria,</strong> and <strong>hematuria</strong>. If the ureters are obstructed, <strong>hydronephrosis&#160;</strong>and reduced urine output may manifest. If the cancer has spread to the rectum, there may be <strong>constipation</strong>. If the cancer damages the local lymphatics or blood vessels, <strong>lower extremity edema&#160;</strong>may manifest. Lastly, flank pain and sciatica may indicate pelvic wall invasion. &#160;<br><br>In a symptomatic individual, diagnosis begins with a pelvic examination, where a lesion suggestive of cervical cancer, which may look like an<strong> ulceration or mass</strong>, is identified. In some cases, the cervix might be enlarged and indurated with a smooth surface. This is often termed a &#8220;barrel-shaped cervix.&#8221; Diagnosis will be confirmed with a <strong>biopsy</strong>. &#160;Afterwards, a CT or MRI can be done to look for evidence of metastasis. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Swelling of the lower extremities:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This may be seen in patients with late-stage cervical cancer that has spread to the lymphatics.

Gastroparesis is defined as impaired neural control of gastric function and is caused by damage to the nerves of the upper gastrointestinal tract from chronic hyperglycemia. This condition leads to delayed gastric emptying (which can be quantified by a scintigraphic gastric emptying study) and produces symptoms of <strong>nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and bloating</strong>. The presence of diarrhea suggests an alternate diagnosis. &#160;<br><br>Gastroparesis is one of the clinical manifestations of diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Just as hyperglycemia damages peripheral nerve fibers, causing symmetric polyneuropathy of the hands and feet, it also damages autonomic nerves, leading to a wide range of conditions: &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/fmMlUwViQRStOXLjIZ4rjqaaT3e0UbeJ/_.png\"></div><br><br>Cardiovascular dysregulation leads to orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia on standing (postural tachycardia). Gastrointestinal effects other than gastroparesis include esophageal dysmotility and altered lower gut motility, which can cause symptoms that mimic irritable bowel syndrome.

While the pathogenesis of this disease is not fully understood, current theories postulate that endothelial injury caused by circulating cytokines due to pro-inflammatory states (such as systemic lupus erythematosus) causes the deposition and aggregation of large platelet thrombi. The acute injury caused by cytokines results in platelet deposition and migration of inflammatory mononuclear cells to form thrombi interwoven with fibrin and immune complexes. It is important to note that these vegetations are always sterile, in contrast to infective endocarditis.

The diagnosis of DLB is based upon the presence of core clinical features, history, and physical examination. MRI will likely show nonspecific diffuse cortical atrophy. The hallmark of the disease is the presence of<strong>&#160;Lewy bodies&#160;</strong>on pathological examination of the brain; these are eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions containing aggregated alpha-synuclein in the deep cortical layers. &#160;<br><br>The differentiation of Parkinson disease from DLB is typically based on the timeline in which symptoms occur. If Parkinsonian motor symptoms are present for more than 1 year before dementia, the diagnosis is Parkinson disease dementia, whereas if dementia occurs concomitantly with or before parkinsonian motor signs, or no more than a year after onset, it is considered dementia with Lewy bodies. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Several neurodegenerative conditions may present with the classic signs of PD (e.g., tremor, rigidity) which may be hard to differentiate.

      "solution": "This patient has<strong>&#160;overflow incontinence</strong> secondary to <strong>diabetic neuropathy.</strong> To understand the mechanism behind the patient&#8217;s condition, it is important to first understand urinary tract and pelvic physiology. &#160;<br><br>The bladder is connected to the urethra via the urethrovesical junction. At the junction are two sphincters, the <strong>internal sphincter&#160;</strong>which is regulated by the autonomic nervous system, and<strong>&#160;external sphincter&#160;</strong>which is regulated by the somatic nervous system. &#160;<br><br>Neurological control of the bladder and internal urethral sphincter is provided by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.<strong>&#160;Sympathetic signals ensure continence</strong> by preventing detrusor muscle contraction and promoting internal sphincter contraction (increases bladder outlet resistance). In contrast, <strong>parasympathetic signals promote micturition</strong> by inducing contraction of the detrusor and relaxing the internal sphincter. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Another line of regulation involves controlling<strong>&#160;blood flow to the urethra</strong>. Increased urethral blood flow increases intraurethral pressure, ultimately preventing urine loss. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In this vignette, the patient has poorly controlled diabetes that has caused somatic and autonomic neuropathy. The patient&#8217;s symptoms of suprapubic fullness, continuous dribbling of urine, and increased postvoid residual volume are consistent with those of overflow incontinence.

The sympathetic nervous system prevents micturition by contracting the internal urethral sphincter and relaxing the detrusor. As a result, reduced sympathetic innervation would cause increased detrusor activity and reduced sphincter tone, resulting in symptoms more consistent with those of urge incontinence.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Peripheral vascular disease causing reduced blood supply to the urethra:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus can lead to peripheral vascular disease.

This is because increases in abdominal pressure will be transmitted more to the bladder and less to the urethra. As a result, pressure within the bladder will exceed that within the urethra, resulting in urine expulsion. Stress incontinence typically presents as loss of urine with activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, sneezing, laughing), which is inconsistent with this patient&#8217;s presentation.</span></div>",

Patients with the condition usually present with <strong>mild microcytic, hypochromic anemia</strong> and are asymptomatic. Most patients are unaware that they are carriers; oftentimes, the mild microcytic anemia is incorrectly attributed to iron deficiency, but iron supplements do not benefit these patients since they have sufficient levels of iron. &#160;<br><br>Normal adult hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1) consists of 2 alpha chains and 2 beta chains (&#945;&#945;&#946;&#946;) along with heme.

In patients with B-thalassemia minor, the mildly reduced synthesis of B-globin chains results in increased production of hemoglobin that does not involve incorporation of B-globin, such as hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) and fetal hemoglobin (HbF).

Signs and symptoms of CB include <strong>productive cough</strong> (due to excess mucus secretion) and wheezing (due to airway narrowing). &#160;<br><br>CB is characterized by inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree, which leads to<strong>&#160;increased mucus production</strong>.

In addition, the patient has <strong>exophthalmos</strong>, which is a characteristic finding in patients with <strong>Graves disease</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Graves disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is an autoimmune condition caused by the production of autoantibodies to the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TRAb). These antibodies imitate the action of TSH and activate the receptor, leading to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, as well as the development of a diffuse goiter (thyroid growth). &#160; <br><br>TSH receptors are expressed mainly in the thyroid but are also found in adipocytes, fibroblasts, and other tissues throughout the body. In the eye, the presence of TRAb and activated T cells leads to the activation of retro-ocular fibroblasts and adipocytes. This activation results in the infiltration of mononuclear cells, inflammatory edema, swelling of the extraocular muscles, <strong>accumulation of hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans</strong> (e.g. hyaluronic acid), and increased numbers of adipocytes (fatty infiltration) in the retro-ocular space. Ultimately, these changes displace the eyeball forward and interfere with extraocular muscle function. Of note, Graves disease and exophthalmos are not synonymous.

This subtype of distributive shock, or &#8220;warm shock,&#8221; is due to systemic release of <strong>histamine&#160;</strong>and <strong>bradykinin&#160;</strong>in response to an allergen. &#160; <br><br>Anaphylaxis is the most extreme physiologic response to an allergen. Common triggers include peanut allergies or bee stings. It is classified as a <strong>type I hypersensitivity reaction</strong>, wherein the antigen cross-links performed IgE on presensitized mast cells, resulting in immediate degranulation of histamine and bradykinin. These mediators further trigger an inflammatory response that results in <strong>massive vasodilation and soft tissue edema</strong>. Edema of the airway causes bronchoconstriction, wheezing, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Vasodilation subsequently <strong>decreases systemic vascular resistance</strong>, <strong>venous return</strong>, and <strong>pulmonary capillary wedge pressure</strong>. These changes can result in inadequate tissue perfusion. In response, the body compensates by increasing heart rate and cardiac output. &#160; <br><br>Emergent treatment of anaphylaxis involves <strong>intramuscular epinephrine</strong>, which reverses these pathologic effects via vasoconstriction (by stimulating alpha-1 receptors) and bronchodilation (by stimulating beta-2 receptors).

Pneumonia can be characterized by the location in which the infection occurs. In <strong>bronchopneumonia</strong>, the infection is patchy throughout the lungs and involves the bronchioles as well as alveoli. In atypical or<strong>&#160;interstitial pneumonia</strong>, the infection is mainly outside the alveoli and in the interstitium. Finally, in <strong>lobar pneumonia</strong>, the infection causes <strong>consolidation</strong> within a lobe of the lung, meaning the entire consolidated area is filled with fluid. The patient in this vignette has lobar pneumonia, and the area of consolidation is identified by the red circle (Figure 1). <br><br>Usually, lobar pneumonia is described as having 4 stages:<strong>&#160;</strong><br><br><ol><li>&#160;The first stage is <strong>congestion.</strong> It occurs between days 1-2, when blood vessels and alveoli start filling with excess fluid. &#160;</li><li>&#160;The next stage is<strong>&#160;red hepatization</strong> and occurs between days 3-4, when exudate, which contains red blood cells, <strong>neutrophils</strong>, and <strong>fibrin</strong>, starts filling airspaces, making them more solid. The name hepatization refers to the lungs taking on a liver-like appearance due to the accumulation of reddish-brown exudate. &#160;</li><li>&#160;The third stage is <strong>gray hepatization</strong>, which occurs around days 5-7. In this stage, the lungs are still firm but become pale gray because the red blood cells in the exudate begin breaking down. &#160;</li><li>&#160;The last stage is resolution, which occurs around day 8 and can continue for 3 weeks.

Upper motor neuron lesions result in disinhibition of lower motor neurons, resulting in excitatory symptoms including <strong>increased muscle tone, spastic paralysis, hyperactive reflexes,</strong> and<strong>&#160;postive Babinski sign.</strong> In contrast, lower motor neuron lesions result in inhibition of muscle contraction and cause<strong>&#160;flaccid paralysis, muscle atrophy, decreased deep tendon reflexes,</strong> and <strong>fasciculations</strong>.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/e7otinZuRCypGOat85lCM6MUQQqjAqZm/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Fasciculations:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Spastic paresis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Spastic paresis is a complex condtion characterized by paralysis and muscle spasms. It is associated with etiologies leading to upper motor neuron disease, such as strokes, intracranial bleeding, or cerebral palsy. In contrast, this patient&#8217;s symptoms are more concerning for Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is a lower motor neuron disease.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Increased muscle tone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Increased muscle tone is associated with upper motor neuron disease. This phenomenon occurs since upper motor neuron damage leads to loss of inhibition of lower motor neurons, resulting in sustained muscle contraction.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Babinski reflex:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The Babinski reflex is a normal reflex in infants, characterized by upgoing toes when the sole of the foot is stimulated with a blunt instrument. In adults, this finding is pathologic and consistent with upper motor neuron disease. However, this patient&#8217;s history of muscle weakness and shortness of breath after a recent respiratory infection is more consistent with Guillain-Barre syndrome, which leads to lower motor neuron symptoms.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Clonus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Clonus refers to a series of rhythmic repeating muscle contractions and relaxations in response to reflex stimulation. This finding is more commonly observed in patients with upper motor neuron lesions. In contrast, this patient most likely has Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes lower motor neuron symptoms.&#160;</span></div>",

Early-onset AD accounts for 5-10% of cases. The association exists because patients with trisomy 21 have three copies of the <strong>amyloid precursor protein</strong> (APP) gene (located on chromosome 21).

The condition is characterized by the accumulation of Lewy bodies, which are composed of alpha-synuclein. <strong>Alpha-synuclein</strong> is a protein found at presynaptic terminals and is involved in neurotransmitter release. In times of increased oxidative stress and under pathologic conditions, alpha-synuclein undergoes a structural change, forming oligomers and beta sheet structures which ultimately deposit as <strong>Lewy bodies</strong>. The accumulation of Lewy bodies leads to myelin and glial dysfunction with subsequent neuronal degeneration. On histological analysis, Lewy bodies are seen as<strong>&#160;round, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions</strong> inside neurons. &#160;<br><br>Clinically, DBL can cause <strong>REM sleep behavior disorders,</strong> wherein patients physically act out dreams since they lack the muscle atonia that characterizes normal REM sleep. Additional symptoms include<strong>&#160;fluctuating cognitive function&#160;</strong>(characterized by variation in attention and episodes of drowsiness), <strong>visual hallucinations</strong>, and <strong>Parkinsonism&#160;</strong>(muscle rigidity, tremors, bradykinesia). In some patients, the abnormalities with REM sleep can precede the other symptoms by several years. This phenomenon likely arises due to early deposition of alpha-synuclein in the pontine and medullary nuclei, which control REM sleep. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/bBmRVo80TM_wjnl0eu1WlVqZQ1K1cS_U/_.png\"></div><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/t4mIX8Z4SVqYDgmoPspqzktMQbKf2nYY/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Visual hallucinations:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Episodes of disinhibited behavior in public:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is characterized by early changes in personality and behavior.

Streptococcal pharyngitis presents with a rash, sore throat with exudates, and fever. Although this child has the fever, rash, and oral pain which can occur in streptococcus infection, the rash seen with streptococcal infection is a flushed sandpaper-like rash. Additionally, GN occurs approximately two weeks after the streptococcal infection has been resolved, not during the acute stage. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a possible complication of measles. Measles presents with a confluent rash which begins at the head and moves downward, cough, coryza and blue white spots on the buccal mucosa (Koplik spots). This child&#8217;s presentation with pain during feeding suggests mucositis, which is more consistent with Kawasaki disease. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome arises from exotoxin-producing <em>S. aureus</em> strains (exfoliative toxin). It typically occurs with bacterial conjunctivitis, iatrogenic wounds, staphylococcal pneumonia, pyomyositis, septic arthritis, or endocarditis. This child does not have any of these conditions, making staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome less likely. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reye syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This syndrome of unknown etiology is characterized by a rash, vomiting, and liver damage.

Her long-term history of<strong>&#160;watery diarrhea</strong> and <strong>abdominal pain</strong> is suggestive of ongoing<strong>&#160;inflammatory bowel disease</strong> (IBD).<br><br>IBD is an immune-mediated condition that is divided into two types; ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease (CD). CD is characterized by immune-mediated transmural inflammation that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to anus, though it usually involves the <strong>terminal ileum</strong> and <strong>colon</strong>. Clinically, it can present with<strong>&#160;chronic</strong>&#160;<strong>watery diarrhea</strong> and<strong>&#160;abdominal pain</strong>. The prevalence of gallstones is increased in patients with ileal CD. In this condition, gallstones are caused by the malabsorption of bile acids in the terminal ileum, which results in <strong>loss of their enterohepatic circulation</strong>. The end-result is depletion of bile salts, causing the buildup of lithogenic bile. Overtime, the stones can cause inflammation of the gallbladder or obstruction of the cystic duct, leading to acute calculous cholecystitis as seen in this patient. Other extraintestinal manifestations of IBD include pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, uveitis, and peripheral arthritis.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/LaPEq2X0TUmX8X8Ebqk0CnByTg2Seb3-/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Formation of adhesions after recent surgery:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Formation of adhesions are a normal response to the injury of peritoneal surfaces during surgery that can lead to intestinal obstruction.

During pregnancy, increased circulating estrogen causes hyperplasia of lactotrophs in order to prepare for the increased hormonal demands during and following pregnancy. This increased size of the pituitary, however, is not associated with increased blood flow, which makes the pituitary gland especially susceptible to ischemia during <strong>low-volume states</strong> (e.g. prolonged or severe postpartum bleeding).<br><br>The onset of clinical features of the ensuing <strong>hypopituitarism&#160;</strong>is dependent on the severity of blood loss and can occur any time from the immediate postpartum period to years after delivery. Severe cases usually present as<strong>&#160;failure to lactate, fatigue,</strong> and<strong>&#160;lethargy</strong> within the first days or weeks after delivery. All pituitary hormonal deficiencies can occur, but the sudden onset of ACTH (and therefore, cortisol) deficiency is the most serious because it can cause life-threatening hypotension.<br><br>Diagnosis is clinical.

The usual mechanism of injury is an upward force on the arm, such as pulling a toddler upward by the hand or wrist. The radial head in children younger than 6 years has a more cylindrical shape, allowing it to slip more easily from the annular ligament which normally holds the bone in place. <br><br>The affected arm is often held in <strong>extension and pronation</strong>, and the child may refuse to move the arm secondary to pain. Tenderness is typically present at the radial head, and the patient will resist forearm pronation, supination, flexion, and extension. Without a concomitant injury, ecchymosis, erythema, edema, or signs of trauma will be absent. The diagnosis is clinical, and imaging is not required unless additional injuries are suspected. A plain radiograph of the affected arm will be normal.<br><br>Treatment of radial head subluxation involves closed reduction via <strong>hyper-pronation</strong> or supination/flexion at the elbow.

Of note, the hyperlipidemic state is thought to be a method of compensating for the reduction in plasma oncotic pressure due to protein loss via urine. &#160; <br><br>The condition arises since hyperglycemia secondary to diabetes mellitus causes nonenzymatic glycation, which leads to mesangial expansion, basement membrane thickening, and podocyte damage. The increased permeability causes glomerular hyperfiltration, which eventually progresses to glomerular hypertrophy and scarring (glomerulosclerosis). &#160;<br><br>Biopsy will reveal <strong>eosinophilic nodular glomerulosclerosis</strong> (<strong>Kimmelstiel-Wilson</strong> lesions), which arise due to mesangial matrix expansion. These lesions are<strong>&#160;Periodic acid&#8211;Schiff (PAS)</strong> stain positive. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Light chain nephropathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Light chain nephropathy, which can be seen in patients with multiple myeloma, is a cause of nephrotic syndrome. It occurs when light chains precipitate with uromodulin (formerly termed Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein) and obstruct the renal tubular lumen. On light microscopy, these casts can be seen as amorphous material within the renal tubular lumen. However, light chain nephropathy would not manifest with the Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions seen on this patient&#8217;s biopsy.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in patients of Hispanic and African-American descent. It can be a primary condition or arise secondary to HIV, sickle cell disease, obesity, or interferon treatment. Biopsy results under light microscopy will show segmental sclerosis and hyalinosis. In other words, only part of the glomerulus is affected. However, the condition would not lead to the formation of Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions, which are seen on this patient&#8217;s biopsy.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis is a condition that often presents concurrently with both nephrotic and nephritic syndrome. It is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The condition can lead to nephrotic range proteinuria (i.e. &gt;3.5 g/day) and clinical features of nephritic syndrome (e.g., hematuria, RBC casts in the urine). A biopsy under light microscopy will show wire looping of capillaries. In contrast, this patient has neither hematuria nor wire looping.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Diabetic glomerulonephropathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Amyloidosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Amyloidosis is a cause of nephrotic syndrome.

Along with the chest x-ray findings showing classic &#8220;<strong>egg on a string</strong>&#8221; appearance and<strong>&#160;increased pulmonary markings</strong>, the most likely diagnosis is<strong>&#160;D-transposition of the great vessels (D-TGA).</strong>&#160;<br><br>D-TGA is a congenital heart defect in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle, resulting in<span>&#160;</span><strong>2 parallel circulations</strong>. The condition is not well understood but is thought to occur due to<span>&#160;</span><strong>failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to spiral</strong>. Due to this parallel circuitry, blood from the right ventricle leaves through the aorta to the body, and then flows back to the right atrium and ventricle (blood never becomes oxygenated). Then, blood from the left ventricle leaves through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where it flows through to the pulmonary veins, left atrium and left ventricle (the oxygenated blood never gets delivered to the organs). &#160;<span>&#160;</span>&#160;<br><br>The postnatal clinical features are dependent on the degree of mixing between the two circulations and the presence of other cardiac anomalies.

The presentation is variable and depends on the degree of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Chest radiograph in a newborn with TOF will likely show a &#8220;boot-shaped&#8221; heart and decreased pulmonary markings, unlike here, as the right ventricular outflow obstruction leads to decreased pulmonary flow.

Diabetes is diagnosed by quantifying the amount of glucose present in the blood at various points in time. In the clinic, a common screening test for diabetes is the fasting glucose level; this blood work is done after the patient has had no calories to eat or drink for at least eight hours.

Another test is called an <strong>oral glucose tolerance test</strong>, where a person is given a glucose tab (usually 75 mg), and then blood samples are taken at timed intervals to determine how well the glucose is being cleared from the blood. A glucose level over 200 mg/dL after 2 hours indicates diabetes. &#160;<br><br>When blood glucose levels get high, the glucose molecules can also attach to proteins that are present in the blood or in cells. <strong>Hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c)</strong> values indicate the proportion of hemoglobin in red blood cells that has glucose attached to it; HbA1c levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes, while levels from 5.7% to 6.4% indicate pre-diabetes.

Patients may present <strong>weeks or even months after iodine administration</strong>. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is usually a self-limited condition, lasting 1 to 18 months.

This, together with a family history of autoimmune disease, suggest a diagnosis of <strong>type 1 diabetes mellitus.</strong> Upon further questioning, this patient would likely endorse frequent urination and thirst due to glycosuria. &#160;Along with chronic complications (atherosclerosis, neuropathy, nephropathy), diabetes can also cause <strong>cataracts&#160;</strong>from <strong>osmotic cellular damage. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>In the eye, glucose enters the cell and is immediately converted to sorbitol by aldose reductase.

Relative to glucose and fructose, sorbitol is a more polar molecule that is unable to diffuse out of the cell.

Differentiation between supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias remains an important diagnostic consideration, as the treatment and risk of degeneration into ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest rises substantially with arrhythmias of ventricular origin. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/3YfWmLcHSjOKGEn3kuYibM7BT7yJRaKj/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ QRS complex duration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ QT interval&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The QT interval can provide information regarding the presence of concomitant metabolic disturbances, medication side effects, and inherited QT channelopathy.

Identifying atrial flutter is dependent on the recognition of characteristic \"<strong>flutter waves,</strong>\" which are most commonly found in the inferior leads and take on a saw-tooth appearance. Atrial flutter will also demonstrate an <strong>atrio-ventricular conduction ratio</strong>, meaning that every X number of atrial beats results in a single ventricular depolarization.

The disease was colloquially referred to as <em>bird fancier disease</em>, as antigens in <strong>pigeon or bird droppings</strong> were the common offending agent. It is divided into an acute and chronic form. Acute disease often presents with fevers, cough, and shortness of breath within hours of exposure to the antigen and then subsequent resolution of symptoms after removal of the exposure. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis presents similarly, but with a more insidious onset over years of exposure. These patients often have sustained shortness of breath, weight loss, a pattern of restrictive lung disease, and, in its worse case, respiratory failure. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Diagnosis of the disease rests on compatible clinical, radiographic, physiologic, and histopathologic findings. Radiographic findings include <strong>diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities</strong> on CT-scan as well as numerous, <strong>poorly defined small opacities throughout both lungs</strong>&#8212;sparring the apices and the bases.

This change contributes to decreased intravascular oncotic pressure and leads to fluid extravasation and <strong>peripheral edema</strong>. &#160; <br><br>As the liver becomes fibrotic, blood flow through the organ is impaired, resulting in backflow of blood into the portosystemic anastomoses and subsequent elevation of portal pressure. This phenomenon is termed <strong>portal hypertension</strong> and can manifest with engorged <strong>paraumbilical veins</strong> (caput medusae) and <strong>splenomegaly</strong>. &#160; <br><br>In contrast, <strong>hepatic steatosis</strong> and <strong>acute hepatitis</strong> are milder conditions that can be reversed if the underlying trigger for hepatocellular injury is removed. Furthermore, these conditions do not typically present with abnormalities in clotting parameters or serum albumin levels. &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/bQdyOHyETvCxpymK1bgh7yuWTp2qumd8/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> These findings can be seen in patients with acute hepatitis, since the synthetic function of the liver is mainly intact.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) occurs since liver dysfunction results in insufficient elimination and subsequent accumulation of metabolic products (e.g. <strong>ammonia</strong>). As ammonia accumulates, it is able to cross the blood-brain-barrier, resulting in astrocyte swelling, dysfunction, and <strong>impaired neurotransmitter synthesis</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Anything that increases ammonia production or reabsorption in the gut can trigger HE. These include <strong>gastrointestinal bleeding</strong>, constipation, or infections. Decreased ammonia elimination via the kidneys can also be a trigger. Finally, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) used to treat portal hypertension can also be a trigger since ammonia-rich blood from the intestines bypasses the liver completely. &#160; <br><br>Hepatic encephalopathy presents with symptoms like insomnia or hypersomnia, mood changes, along with confusion, and even coma in some cases. <strong>Asterixis</strong>, a flapping tremor of the hand that appears when the wrist is extended, is commonly seen. &#160; <br><br>Treatment typically involves administering <strong>antibiotics&#160;</strong>(e.g. rifaximin) to kill ammonia-producing bacteria and <strong>lactulose&#160;</strong>to decrease ammonia absorption in the bowel.

After undergoing surgical resection of the tumor, loss of ACTH production results in loss of cortisol production, which manifests with a glucocorticoid crisis and <strong>tertiary adrenal insufficiency</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Tertiary adrenal insufficiency is characterized by hypothalamic dysfunction and decreased CRH production. Overall, the most common etiology is the <strong>sudden withdrawal of chronic glucocorticoid therapy</strong>, since exogenous steroid use suppresses CRH release. When steroids are abruptly withdrawn, the now dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can no longer produce endogenous cortisol. Abrupt removal of an <strong>ACTH producing tumor</strong>, as in the case of this patient, can also result in tertiary adrenal insufficiency via a similar mechanism. Other etiologies of tertiary adrenal insufficiency include suprasellar lesions, trauma, hypothalamic/pituitary tumors, and abrupt removal of CRH or cortisol producing tumors. &#160; <br><br>Laboratory testing will reveal reduced CRH, ACTH, and cortisol levels. Aldosterone levels will be normal since adrenal gland synthetic function is unaffected. &#160; <br><br>Diagnosis is achieved through obtaining levels of CRH, ACTH, and cortisol in association with clinical features. Most patients with tertiary adrenal insufficiency will have a stable blood pressure, no hyponatremia or hyperkalemia, due to normal aldosterone production.

It can be triggered by infections, surgery/anesthesia, pregnancy, and medications such as beta-blockers. The condition manifests with <strong>dyspnea&#160;</strong>and <strong>respiratory insufficiency,</strong> which can quickly progress to respiratory failure. &#160;<br><br>It is important to distinguish a myasthenic crisis from a <strong>cholinergic crisis</strong>, which occurs due to overtreatment of MG by acetylcholinerase inhibitors (e.g. pyridostigmine). In a cholinergic crisis, too much acetylcholine is present at the neuromuscular junction. Both cholinergic crisis and myasthenic crisis manifest with similar symptoms, so an <strong>edrophonium test</strong> is needed to distinguish the two. Administration of edrophonium briefly blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine, temporarily increasing its levels at the neuromuscular junction. In myasthenic crisis, the increased acetylcholine levels are enough to overcome the symptoms caused by the decreased number of available receptors, so muscle weakness improves.

The patient in this vignette has two risk factors: <strong>advanced age&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;reduced estrogen&#160;</strong><strong>levels&#160;</strong>secondary to menopause. Estrogen normally decreases osteoclast resorption of bone; therefore, decreased estrogen levels leave the patient vulnerable to breakdown of bone. In addition, the rate of bone deposition by osteoblasts decreases with age. A combination of the two factors accounts for the pathophysiology behind this patient&#8217;s reduced bone mineral density, which is quantified using the T-score. A T-score of 2.5 SD or more below the young adult mean (more than -2.5 SD) indicates the presence of osteoporosis. &#160;<br><br>Additional risk factors include hypocalcemia, low weight, alcohol consumption, smoking, and drugs like corticosteroids. Moreover, there is a genetic element to the disease, which explains why some individuals develop osteoporosis earlier than others. Physical inactivity can also lead to osteoporosis because it causes decreased bone deposition. Lastly, some diseases that can predispose to osteoporosis include Turner syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, Klinefelter syndrome, and hyperparathyroidism. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/HM-aowLQTTONd3XKAxe1WBgUTcOR3Tam/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased mineralization of osteoid seam:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This answer describes osteomalacia, a condition wherein osteoid can be deposited but cannot subsequently be mineralized.

One is a membranous portion, which is the upper one-third, and the other is a muscular portion, which is the lower two-thirds. Defects usually occur in the <strong>membranous portion</strong>. Most VSDs are small and close on their own. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Individuals with VSDs are<strong>&#160;asymptomatic at birth</strong> but can develop symptoms several weeks later. This delay is because after delivery, there is a gradual decline in pulmonary vascular resistance which results in a decrease in right ventricular pressure. Blood is then able to pass more readily from the left heart through the VSD into the right heart, producing a <strong>holosystolic murmur</strong>. &#160; <br><br>On auscultation, the murmur can be heard at the <strong>left lower sternal border.</strong> Of note, the smaller the defect, the louder the murmur. This finding is because when blood rushes through a narrower opening, it produces more turbulence and hence more noise. In addition, because the defect allows oxygenated blood to move into the right heart, cardiac catheterization will show<strong>&#160;increased oxygen saturation&#160;</strong>in the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/jJFRyhQvRuiSANwFlYy1oLYUSfG2dfIt/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Impaired growth of the septum primum&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This answer describes an atrial septal defect (ASD).

As a result, he most likely has <strong>familial adenomatous polyposis</strong> (FAP). FAP is an<strong>&#160;autosomal dominant</strong> disorder marked by the appearance of hundreds of colorectal adenomas by the teenage years. If untreated, most patients will die from colorectal cancer by the 4th decade of life. &#160; &#160;<br><br>FAP is caused by mutations of the <em><strong>adenomatous polyposis coli&#160;</strong>(APC)</em> gene located on chromosome 5. APC is a tumor suppressor protein that plays a central role in Wnt signaling by regulating the degradation of &#946;-catenin. Normally, in the presence of wild-type APC protein, &#946;-catenin is degraded. However when APC is mutated, &#946;-catenin and its target genes (e.g. <em>c-myc</em>) are overexpressed, resulting in uncontrolled cellular proliferation and eventual progression to cancer. Therefore, patients with FAP should receive annual screening colonoscopies and, if polyps are found, undergo <strong>prophylactic colectomy.&#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>Since FAP is inherited in an<strong>&#160;autosomal dominant&#160;</strong>fashion, only 1 mutant copy of the <em>APC</em> gene is sufficient to cause the disorder.

Horner syndrome consists of ipsilateral <strong><u>p</u></strong>tosis, <strong><u>a</u></strong>nhidrosis, and <strong><u>m</u></strong>iosis (remembered with the mnemonic <strong>PAM</strong>). It is caused by compression of the paravertebral sympathetic chain and the inferior cervical (stellate) ganglion.

The ultrasound finding of polycystic ovaries further supports the diagnosis.<br><br>PCOS is caused by dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. The anterior pituitary makes too much LH (the mechanism is not well known), which can exceed twice the level of FSH. <strong>Excessive LH</strong> causes the theca cells to produce excess amounts of androstenedione, which is converted into estrone by aromatase in the adipose tissue, and reduced levels of sex-hormone binding globulin. <strong>High estrone levels</strong> cause high pulses of GnRH from the hypothalamus. The <strong>high pulses of GnRH</strong> produce an<strong>&#160;imbalance of LH/FSH&#160;</strong>release from the pituitary which results in a lack of LH surge. This leads to the <strong>failure of follicle maturation</strong> and oocyte release. As a result, <strong>ovulation does not occur</strong>. However, an elevated LH-to-FSH ratio is not a criterion for the diagnosis of PCOS, as their levels fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle.<br><br>High levels of androstenedione from polycystic ovary syndrome can cause hirsutism.

A common cause is a hypermobile urethra, which causes increases in abdominal pressure to be transmitted more to the bladder and less to the urethra. As a result, pressure within the bladder will exceed that within the urethra, resulting in urine expulsion. Other causes of stress incontinence include weak pelvic floor muscles and reduced urethral sphincter tone. &#160; <br><br>Stress incontinence can be diagnosed by performing a history & physical exam. During the physical exam, <strong>urethral mobility can be assessed using a Q-tip</strong>. In addition, <strong>a bladder stress test</strong>, which involves observing for urine leakage while the patient coughs or performs the Valsalva maneuver, can be done.

      "solution": "This patient has an <strong>esophageal perforation</strong>, which can cause chest pain radiating to the back, vomiting, hematemesis, and melena. In addition, once esophageal perforation has occurred, it can lead to <strong>mediastinitis&#160;</strong>(inflammation of the mediastinum), <strong>pneumomediastinum&#160;</strong>(air surrounding the heart), and <strong>subcutaneous emphysema</strong> (presence of air in the subcutaneous tissue). Specifically, in this patient&#8217;s case, air has left the esophagus and accumulated in the mediastinum. This explains why crackles were heard during heart auscultation and why mediastinal air pockets are seen on CT (Figure 1). &#160; &#160;<br><br>The causes of esophageal perforation can be divided into <strong>iatrogenic&#160;</strong>and <strong>non-iatrogenic&#160;</strong>causes. Perforation during endoscopic procedures is the most common iatrogenic cause. Non-iatrogenic causes include spontaneous rupture, trauma, foreign body ingestion, and malignancy. &#160;<br><br>Diagnosis of esophageal rupture can be made using <strong>x-ray</strong>, which will show air that has escaped the esophagus, followed by a <strong>contrast esophagram</strong>, which will confirm the diagnosis, as well as determine the size and location of the perforation. A <strong>CT scan</strong> can be used in cases when a contrast esophagram cannot be performed (e.g. if a patient is hemodynamically unstable or uncooperative) or if the results come back inconclusive.

The diagnosis of BPPV can be confirmed by the <strong>Dix-Hallpike maneuver</strong>, in which the physician extends the patient's neck and turns it to one side while the patient is sitting, followed by rapidly placing them in a supine position so that their head hangs over the edge of the bed. On a positive test there will be nystagmus or vertigo. &#160;<br><br>BPPV is one of the most common causes of peripheral vertigo; it is characterized by episodes of spinning sensation provoked by head rotation and position changes which last approximately 30 seconds. The condition is attributed to <strong>calcium debris</strong> within the <strong>semicircular canals</strong>, known as canalithiasis. This debris likely represents loose calcium carbonate crystals originating from the utricular sac. Under normal conditions, the semicircular canals detect angular head accelerations. Debris accumulation in the canal causes inappropriate movement of the endolymph with linear accelerations, creating a false sensation of spinning when the head shifts.

Diabetic neuropathy refers to the gradual loss of function of large and small myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers, starting distally, leading to symptoms of numbness, weakness, tinging, and pain. The process starts in the feet first, and typically once it reaches halfway up the calves, it begins in the fingers, leading to a &#8220;stocking-glove&#8221; distribution. Diabetic neuropathy should be suspected in patients with type 1 diabetes 5 years after diagnosis and in all patients with type 2 diabetes, and it is screened for by monofilament testing. &#160;<br><br>The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes damages nerves through multiple mechanisms, but an especially important mechanism is through <strong>osmotic cellular damage</strong>. Normally, when glucose enters cells, it can be converted to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase. Sorbitol is an osmotic agent, meaning it attracts water into the cells. As a protective mechanism, cells are able to convert sorbitol to fructose with the enzyme<strong>&#160;sorbitol dehydrogenase</strong>; however, the cells of the <strong>lens</strong>, the<strong>&#160;pericytes in the retina, Schwann cells</strong> and <strong>renal epithelial cells lack this enzyme</strong>.

Patients may be homozygous or heterozygous. &#160;<br><br>Factor V is a procoagulant clotting factor that is synthesized as an inactive form and activated by thrombin at the wound site. Activated factor V then functions as a cofactor in the production of more thrombin from prothrombin. However, thrombin also halts its own production via a negative feedback loop. It does so by <strong>activating protein C&#160;</strong>(aPC), a protease that deactivates factor Va and factor VIIIa, thereby reducing thrombin production. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Factor V Leiden deficiency is caused by a single point mutation in the factor V gene in which guanine is switched to adenine. The corresponding mRNA codon forms a polypeptide chain in which arginine is replaced by glutamine at position Arg506. Consequently, <strong>the cleavage site&#160;</strong>is altered and factor V can no longer be degraded by protein C. &#160;<br><br>Patients are at increased risk for venous or arterial thromboembolism, MI, stroke, and obstetric complications.

Protein S also functions as a cofactor for activated protein C in augmenting fibrinolysis. Deficiency of protein S may occur due to mutations and leads to hypercoagulability, resulting in pulmonary embolism. Although protein S deficiency is difficult to distinguish from factor V Leiden deficiency, the former is far rarer and therefore less likely. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Prothrombin gene mutation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Prothrombin, also known as factor II, is the precursor of thrombin, the end product of the coagulation cascade. Thrombin&#8217;s main role is to proteolytically cleave fibrinogen to fibrin, which in turn crosslinks to form a fibrin clot. It also interacts with other hemostatic components. The G20210A point mutation in the prothrombin gene results in a gain-of-function of prothrombin that leads to hypercoagulability. However, the failure to change PTT after adding purified protein C favors another diagnosis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Antiphospholipid syndrome &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) refers to an autoimmune condition characterized by venous and/or arterial thrombosis due to the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-&#946;2 glycoprotein I antibodies).

Antithrombin is a natural anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin (factor IIa), factor Xa, and other factors in the coagulation cascade. A variety of mutations have been recognized. AT has no direct effect on the PT, PTT, or thrombin time. Instead, it diminishes the increase in PTT following heparin administration. This phenomenon exists since heparin, an indirect inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa, requires functional AT to be effective. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Factor V Leiden deficiency:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div>",

Other causes of constrictive cardiomyopathy include post-cardiac surgery or radiation, connective tissue disorder, and miscellaneous causes (e.g., malignancy, trauma, drug-induced, sarcoidosis, uremic pericarditis). Note that some of the causes are common to both restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis. &#160;<br><br>The fibrous thickening of the pericardium forms a rigid, noncompliant cover of the heart, resulting in progressive impairment in cardiac filling with subsequent low cardiac output. The impaired heart filling leads to progressive signs and symptoms of predominantly right heart failure (e.g., pitting edema of the lower extremities, hepatomegaly). Patients often present with fluid overload, ranging from peripheral edema to anasarca, and symptoms related to low cardiac output, such as fatigability and dyspnea on exertion. On physical examination, the majority of patients display elevated jugular venous pressure. Other less common features include pulsus paradoxus, <strong>Kussmaul sign</strong> (increase or lack of decrease in JVP during inspiration), pericardial knock, peripheral edema, ascites, and/or cachexia. <strong>Pericardial knock</strong> is a unique feature that can be heard during early diastole.

      "solution": "This adolescent girl presents with poorly localized anterior knee pain and clinical features suggestive of <strong>patellofemoral pain syndrome</strong> (PFPS). The pathogenesis of this condition is poorly understood but is likely due to anatomical variants that increase chronic contact pressure between the patella and the femur, resulting in knee pain. In addition, muscular imbalance(s) between the quadriceps and hamstrings decrease the stability of the patellofemoral joint with normal weight-bearing activities. This condition is primarily related to overuse but can also occur acutely following trauma. <br><br>Clinical features of PFPS include <strong>anterior knee pain</strong> directly under or around the patella. The pain is often worsened with activity or with <strong>walking up and down stairs</strong>. It is relieved with rest, although pain may be noted after prolonged periods of knee flexion (e.g. sitting in a chair). Diagnosis of PFPS is primarily based on patient history and examination findings. The pain is often provoked by maneuvers that involve contraction of the quadriceps with the knee in flexion (e.g. squatting). PFPS is most common in adolescent females.<br><br>Nonoperative medical management and <strong>physical therapy</strong> is the most common initial treatment course. Therapy focuses on stretching and strengthening of the quadriceps muscle. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Chronic avulsion of the secondary ossification center of the tibial tuberosity &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) refers to a traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle due to repetitive strain and chronic avulsion of the secondary ossification center at the tibial tuberosity.

      "solution": "&#160;This female patient, who is <strong>multiparous&#160;</strong>and has <strong>obesity</strong>, is presenting with <strong>right upper abdominal pain, positive Murphy sign</strong> and a <strong>thickened gallbladder</strong> on abdominal ultrasound; she most likely has acute cholecystitis due to <strong>cholesterol gallstones. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>In classic cholecystitis, gallstones obstruct the cystic duct, leading to a buildup of pressure and inflammation of the gallbladder. The typical presentation of cholecystitis includes <strong>right upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,&#160;</strong>and occasionally <strong>fever</strong>. On physical examination, patients may demonstrate a positive Murphy sign, which is sudden inspiratory pause upon palpation of the RUQ. Similarly, a positive sonographic Murphy sign can be elicited with an ultrasound probe. Risk factors for cholesterol gallstones include female sex, pregnancy and oral contraceptive pills, obesity, and age, especially after 40. These can be remembered by the 4 F&#8217;s: female, fertile, fat, and forty. &#160; <br><br>Bile production is the main pathway for elimination of excess cholesterol from the body, either as &#160;bile salts or as free cholesterol. Cholesterol is secreted by the liver into the gallbladder and is rendered water-soluble within the bile by lecithins and bile salts. When cholesterol concentrations exceed the capacity of bile to solubilize it (supersaturation), cholesterol crystallizes and forms stones. Any condition that increases cholesterol and/or bilirubin, decreases bile salts, or promotes gallbladder stasis can cause gallstone formation. The enzyme <strong>7&#945;-hydroxylase</strong> converts cholesterol to 7-alpha-hydroxycholesterol, the rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme (e.g. by <strong>fibrates&#160;</strong>medication) can lead to the building up of cholesterol, its supersaturation, and stone formation. &#160;<br><br>There are 2 types of stones, cholesterol stones (80% of cases) and pigment stones (black and brown). Cholesterol stones are associated with obesity, Crohn disease, advanced age, estrogen therapy, multiparity, and rapid weight loss. The characteristics of each stone type are depicted in the table below. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/2NFtkttgTxmmDXjmvU1AI9GnQgOy8-WJ/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased activity of HMG-CoA reductase enzyme:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>HMG-CoA reductase is the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Inhibition of this enzyme, such as by a statin, will result in decreased production of cholesterol and subsequently decreased risk for cholesterol gallstones. &#160; &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased activity of aromatase enzyme:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Aromatase is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgen to estrogen. Increased level of estrogen increases the risk for cholesterol gallstones by increasing the hepatic secretion of biliary cholesterol. Therefore, decreased activity aromatase will reduce the risk for gallstones. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Decreased activity of 7&#945;-hydroxylase enzyme:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased activity of &#946;-glucuronidase enzyme &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>&#946;-glucuronidase is a brush border enzyme that converts conjugated bilirubin to an unconjugated form for reabsorption. Any process that results in increased unconjugated bilirubin in the bile will increase the potential for pigment gallstone formation. However, this patient, who is multiparous and has obesity, is much more likely to have cholesterol gallstones, rather than pigment gallstones. &#160;&#160;</span></div>",

It can be exacerbated by exposure to sunlight, alcohol intake, or eating spicy foods. Rosacea is differentiated from acne vulgaris by the absence of comedones and the presence of telangiectasia in the former. <br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/17s6FCpkRje-2Lv2Vqsg63TaQjGSm_Jf/_.jpg\"></div><br>Reproduced from Wikimedia Commons</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sebaceous hyperplasia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Sebaceous glands enlargement is termed sebaceous hyperplasia.

      "solution": "This patient has <strong>macrocytic anemia</strong> secondary to <strong>vitamin B9 (folate) deficiency</strong>. Common causes include <strong>poor diet, medication side-effects, and excessive alcohol consumption</strong>. Folate is obtained by consuming leafy greens and fortified foods. It is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF), which plays an important role in the synthesis of nitrogenous bases that are incorporated into DNA and RNA. As a result, folate deficiency <strong>impairs DNA synthesis</strong> and hinders the maturation of hematopoietic cell lines. &#160; <br><br>Folate deficiency causes <strong>macrocytic anemia</strong>. This is because RBC precursors are normally big (MCV &gt; 100 &#181;m3) and undergo cell divisions as they mature, resulting in normal, smaller RBCs. With folate deficiency, RBC maturation is impaired. This causes megaloblasts (structurally abnormal immature RBCs) to be released into the bloodstream. The net result is <strong>macrocytic megaloblastic anemia</strong>. Likewise, folate deficiency impairs white blood cell (WBC) maturation, resulting in <strong>immature hypersegmented neutrophils</strong> (greater than 5 lobes), as seen on this patient&#8217;s peripheral smear. &#160;<br><br>Folate deficiency causes <strong>fatigue, pallor, and glossitis</strong>. Diagnosis relies on a peripheral blood smear, which shows large red blood cells and hypersegmented neutrophils.

Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn typically occurs in an Rh(+) fetus born to an Rh(-) mother previously exposed to Rh(+) blood through either a blood transfusion or fetomaternal hemorrhage from a previous pregnancy. During the pregnancy, preformed maternal anti-D IgG, which were produced as a result of the prior exposure, cross the placenta and opsonize fetal erythrocytes.

The pathogenesis is thought to be related to impaired inhibitory innervation, which leads to premature and rapid contractions of the distal esophagus secondary to altered synthesis and/or degradation of endogenous nitric oxide. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/RR19pwS6Qj2KGllaQ2jOdzPLR5qWOctD/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Irregular mass on endoscopy &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>These findings are consistent with esophageal cancer, which typically presents with progressively worsening dysphagia (dysphagia to solids initially, followed by liquids later in the course) accompanied by weight loss.
