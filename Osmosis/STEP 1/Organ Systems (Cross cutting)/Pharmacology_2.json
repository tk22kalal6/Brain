      "solution": "This woman&#8217;s skin lesions in the setting of <strong>warfarin initiation are likely due to warfarin-induced skin necrosis&#160;</strong>as a result of the<strong> sudden depletion of protein C</strong>. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that interferes with the normal synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X), and is used for both the treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolic events. However, warfarin also inhibits <strong>proteins C and S,&#160;</strong>which are factors that function as anticoagulants (these proteins are thought of like the brakes on the coagulation cascade). &#160; <br><br>Specifically, <strong>inhibition of protein C leads to a hypercoagulable state since it has the shortest half-life of all factors inhibited by warfarin.&#160;</strong>At therapeutic doses, the anticoagulant effects of warfarin outweigh the hypercoagulable ones, but protein C is depleted before the other factors during the initiation of the medication. This creates a temporarily hypercoagulable state during which the patient is more prone to clotting. This factor imbalance manifests in paradoxical pro-coagulation, resulting in microthrombules of blood vessels in the skin and subsequent purpura and necrosis. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis can be avoided by administering a heparin bridge when initiating warfarin therapy.&#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Factor II:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This woman&#8217;s skin lesions are likely due to the paradoxical pro-coagulant effects following a decrease in protein C.

      "solution": "This patient presents with crampy abdominal pain and intermittent non-bloody diarrhea that is exacerbated by consuming lactose containing foods. These findings are suggestive of lactose intolerance, which is a type of osmotic diarrhea. Affected patients lack the enzyme lactase. As a result, lactose cannot be broken down and remains in the intestinal lumen, where it is osmotically active and prevents water absorption by the intestines.<br><br><strong>Osmotic diarrhea</strong> occurs due to the presence of unabsorbed solutes (e.g. lactose) in the intestinal lumen. These unabsorbed solutes exert an osmotic power, trapping water in the lumen as well as drawing water into the lumen. Osmotic diarrhea is watery, non-bloody, and typically resolves when the causative substance (e.g., food, medication) is discontinued.<br><br>Another type of diarrhea is <strong>secretory diarrhea</strong>, which can occur in certain infections (e.g. <em>Vibrio cholera</em>) and some gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. VIPoma). It results from excessive secretion of ions into the intestinal lumen, which exerts an osmotic effect and sucks fluid from the surrounding tissues into the intestinal lumen. Secretory diarrhea is also watery, and non-bloody, but unlike osmotic diarrhea, persists even with decreased oral intake.<br><br>Moreover, there is <strong>inflammatory </strong>(exudative) <strong>diarrhea</strong>. This type of diarrhea is typically seen in patients with certain autoimmune disorders (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease) or bacterial (e.g. <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>) invasion of the intestinal wall. These conditions lead to an inflammatory process that damages the intestinal epithelium. The diarrhea is usually purulent, bloody, and persists during fasting. Systemic symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, and weight loss may also be seen.<br><br>Finally, diarrhea can occur due to <strong>increased gastrointestinal motility</strong>, which causes water and nutrients to reach the colon too fast without adequate time for proper digestion and absorption.

The main effect of methotrexate is inhibiting the <strong>conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase</strong> (DHTFR). Tetrahydrofolate is the active form of folate needed to make purines and pyrimidine bases and thus make DNA and RNA.

As a result, individuals with this condition cannot produce endogenous insulin. Administration of <strong>exogenous insulin</strong> is needed to treat type I diabetes, as well as late-stage type II diabetes. &#160; <br><br>Insulin reduces blood glucose levels via two main mechanisms. First, it <strong>upregulates the GLUT4 transporter</strong> protein, allowing more glucose to enter and be stored in cells. Second, insulin<strong>&#160;prevents the breakdown of existing glycogen</strong> into glucose (glycogenolysis), thereby preventing new glucose from being released into the blood. In addition to its effect on glucose, insulin also promotes lipogenesis (synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides) and protein synthesis. &#160;<br><br>Insulin is typically administered <strong>subcutaneously&#160;</strong>via <strong>syringes or pens</strong> because it can be broken down in the GI tract. When injected into the abdominal region, absorption is the quickest, followed by arms, thighs, and buttocks.

Rather than developing constipation, overweight and obese adolescents may be more likely to have fecal incontinence. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lack of exercise:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: There is a long-held belief that bowel frequency increases in proportion to increased exercise; however, these findings are not evidence-based. Physical exercise has been shown to dramatically increase physical fitness; however, no consistent effect on large bowel function has been found. Therefore, while this patient should partake in more daily exercise, it should not have an impact on his recent symptoms of constipation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diabetes mellitus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Constipation is reported in nearly 60% of adults with diabetes mellitus. The cause of constipation remains poorly understood and likely involves long-term autonomic and enteric neuropathy. Patients with diabetes frequently suffer from enteropathic diarrhea and bloating due to the same pathophysiology. The child in this vignette has neither been diagnosed with diabetes nor does he present with any classical symptoms of diabetes such as polyuria, polydipsia, polyphasia or fatigue. Children with new-onset diabetes frequently present with nocturnal enuresis. &#160;</span></div>",

However, medical treatment is available for patients who are poor fit for surgery, refuse surgery, or have an unresectable adenoma. The options of medical treatment for acromegaly include: &#160;<br><br><ul><li><strong>Somatostatin analogs</strong> (e.g., octreotide, lanreotide): Somatostatin analogs are effective in the treatment of acromegaly. These agents <strong>inhibit growth hormone secretion</strong>, thus controlling the symptoms and complications of excessive growth hormone. Furthermore, somatostatin analogs have been shown to induce shrinkage of pituitary adenomas. Side effects of this drug class include <strong>bloating, loose stools, fat malabsorption</strong>. In addition, there is increased risk of <strong>gallstones</strong> due to gallbladder hypomotility. &#160;</li></ul><br><ul><li><strong>GH-receptor antagonist</strong> (e.g. pegvisomant): Pegvisomant is a newly developed medication that has been shown to be efficacious in treating acromegaly. It binds to GH receptors and prevents their activation. Also, as it blocks GH receptors in hepatocytes, it <strong>prevents the production of IGF-1</strong>. Since pegvisomant does not suppress GH hormone production, a minority of patients may experience an increase in the size of the adenoma due to increased GH production. It can rarely cause <strong>increased liver enzymes</strong>, which usually normalizes after stopping the medication.&#160;</li></ul><br><ul><li><strong>Dopamine agonists</strong> (e.g. cabergoline): Dopamine agonists have been shown to <strong>decrease growth hormone secretion</strong> from pituitary adenomas. It can be used alone or in combination with somatostatin analogs. Side effects include <strong>nausea, lightheadedness, depression&#160;</strong>and <strong>constipation</strong>. &#160;</li></ul><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Decreased insulin like growth factor-1 levels. &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased growth hormone levels &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Pegvisomant is a growth hormone receptor antagonist that leads to decreased insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels.

Given her history of gestational hypertension, she was started on <strong>methyldopa</strong>, which is one of the four medications commonly used to treat hypertension in pregnancy (hydralazine, methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine). Methyldopa is associated with drug-induced lupus.<br><br>Methyldopa works via a complex mechanism of action. First, methyldopa is converted into methyldopamine by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. Second, it moves into synaptic vesicles, where methyldopamine is converted to methylnorepinephrine. Third, methylnorepinephrine accumulates within the vesicles and pushes norepinephrine into the cytoplasm. Monoamine oxidases degrade the norepinephrine, and over time, the <strong>presynaptic norepinephrine stores become depleted</strong>. Lastly, when a signal comes, methylnorepinephrine is released into the synapse. It cannot activate adrenergic receptors in the postsynaptic neuron but can act on <strong>&#945;<sub>2</sub>-receptors</strong>, further decreasing norepinephrine release.<br><br>However, methyldopa is associated with many side effects.

These findings are consistent with a <strong>deep vein thrombosis (DVT).</strong> One treatment for acute DVT involves <strong>anticoagulation&#160;</strong>with <strong>heparin&#160;</strong>in combination with <strong>warfarin for ten days,&#160;</strong>followed by a three-month course of warfarin alone. <strong>Warfarin inhibits vitamin K- dependent &#611;-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. <br></strong><br>Normally, vitamin K is required for the hepatic synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as protein C and S. These clotting factors are activated by the addition of carboxyl groups to glutamic acid residues within the proteins&#8217; structure. In this process, reduced vitamin K (active) is converted to oxidized vitamin K (inactive), which is then subsequently reduced by <strong>vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1). Warfarin inhibits vitamin K- dependent &#611;-carboxylation of glutamic acid by inhibiting VKOR complex,&#160;</strong>thus depleting functional vitamin K reserves and reducing the synthesis of active clotting factors. &#160; <br><br>Warfarin is the most commonly used oral anticoagulant worldwide.

Approximately half of this variability is known to be caused by clinical or lifestyle factors (e.g., a patient&#8217;s age, weight, BMI, gender, smoking status, existing conditions, and concomitant medications), as well as by <strong>genetic factors&#8211;including variants in the <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>or <em>CYP2C9&#160;</em>gene. &#160;</strong><br><br>The <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>and <em>CYP2C9&#160;</em>genotypes are the most critical genetic determinants of warfarin dosing. Warfarin targets the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme (VKORC1), catalyzing the rate-limiting step in vitamin K recycling (converting vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K). This, in turn, inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. &#160;<br><br>A common non-coding variant, <em>VKORC1</em>, c.-1639G&gt;A, is associated with increased sensitivity to warfarin. <strong>Patients with this variant require lower doses of warfarin, as standard doses may result in a supratherapeutic INR and subsequent bleeding complications.</strong> The polymorphism occurs in the promoter region of the VKORC1 gene and is thought to alter a transcription factor binding site, leading to lower protein expression. As a result, patients starting warfarin therapy who are carrying at least one &#8220;A&#8221; (mutated) allele at the -1639 locus require lower initial and maintenance doses compared with patients carrying a G/G (wild type) genotype at this locus. &#160;<br><br>Less commonly, <strong>missense mutations in <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>can lead to warfarin resistance&#160;</strong>and higher dose requirements.

Ingested medications have varying amounts of bioavailability, thus making IV medications more effective in many cases. However, some oral medications have such high bioavailability that they are almost equivalent to IV doses. As a medication passes through the GI tract, some of it may be delivered to the liver and partially metabolized, leaving less medication available for later delivery to the target tissue.

      "solution": "<strong>Parkinson disease&#160;</strong>(PD) is caused by degeneration of the substantia nigra, disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway and thus, decreases in striatal dopamine levels. Treatment of PD involves several medications that increase dopamine levels within the brain. &#160; <br><br>Levodopa is peripherally metabolized by dopamine decarboxylase and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Levodopa (L-DOPA) is commonly given in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa) to prevent its peripheral metabolism to dopamine, as peripherally active dopamine leads to various adverse effects (e.g.nausea, vomiting). &#160; &#160;<br><br>When levodopa is co-administered with a decarboxylase inhibitor, the medication is converted by peripheral <strong>COMT </strong>to the inert metabolite 3-O- methyldopa (3-OMD). Only 10% of a given dose of levodopa reaches the brain for subsequent conversion to dopamine. Two medications that<strong> inhibit COMT</strong> are <strong>tolcapone </strong>and <strong>entacapone</strong>, which can be used as adjunctive therapies to treat PD. Both COMT inhibitors exert their therapeutic effects by inhibiting the peripheral metabolism of levodopa and increasing its bioavailability for the central nervous system. In addition, they reduce the formation of 3-OMD, which competes with L-DOPA for transport into the brain. Tolcapone inhibits both peripheral and, to a lesser extent, central COMT, whereas entacapone acts only in the periphery. &#160; <br><br>COMT inhibitors are often combined with levodopa when patients develop motor complications.

      "solution": "This patient has developed an elevation in serum creatinine after kidney transplantation. Absence of significant findings on urinalysis and the elevated BUN/creatinine ratio suggests a prerenal cause. This is most likely due to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction caused by cyclosporine. &#160; <br><br>Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that is used frequently to prevent transplant rejection and can also be used in treatment of certain autoimmune disorders. Normally, after T-cells are exposed to an antigen, calcineurin gets activated and dephosphorylates a transcription factor known as the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT). NFAT then translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription of immune mediator cytokines; most importantly interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 provides the signal needed for T-cell activation and proliferation. Cyclosporine inhibits the transcription of IL-2 by inhibiting calcineurin, thereby halting T cell proliferation and protecting the transplanted organ from T cell-mediated injury. &#160; &#160;<br><br>One of the major limitations of cyclosporine use is its severe nephrotoxic effects. Acute nephrotoxicity is related to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, which decreases the glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and creatinine clearance. As there is no intrinsic kidney injury, the urinalysis is usually bland. This is usually reversible with cyclosporine dose reduction. Long-term use can cause chronic nephrotoxicity marked by tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which is usually irreversible. Cyclosporine can also cause hypertension, gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-JoTbcv5SKOTjUF-N9G1ZHf6TOex1HJX/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cyclosporine side effect:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sirolimus side effect:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant that is frequently used in combination with cyclosporine as a prophylaxis for transplant rejection.

Cytochrome p450 is an enzyme that&#160;contains&#160;heme. In patients taking p450 inducers (e.g.&#160;barbiturates), circulating levels of heme are reduced as more p450 enzymes are produced. Lack of circulating heme reduces the negative feedback of ALA synthase-1, promoting the production of more heme (see image below). The underlying etiology of acute intermittent porphyria is an impairment in the activity of porphobilinogen deaminase, which leads to an&#160;accumulation of porphobilinogen (PBG).

Of patients that do experience a&#160;porphyric&#160;attack, they are usually precipitated by three main factors &#8211; cytochrome p450 inducers, prolonged fasting, or acute infection (see image below).&#160;Porphyric&#160;attacks occur with varying symptomatology and usually include some combination of abdominal pain, back pain, neuropathic limb&#160;pain, and&#160;nausea and vomiting.

      "solution": "This patient presents with ventricular tachycardia after having an acute myocardial infarction. He is given a medication that<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>decreases the slope of phase 0 of depolarization</strong><strong>,</strong> which leads to termination of the arrhythmia. This mechanism of action is consistent with that of <strong>class I antiarrhythmics</strong>. These medications work primarily via <strong>selective blockade of fast sodium channels. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br></strong><br>Class I antiarrhythmics are divided into three major classes: A, B, and C. However, all of them work via the same mechanism of action. Sodium channel blockade <strong>slows the upstroke of the sodium-dependent action potential&#160;</strong>(phase 0) and prolongs the QRS duration. However, each group has a different affinity for the fast sodium channel, resulting in group 1A prolonging the action potential duration, 1B shortening the actional potential duration, and 1C having no effect on the action potential duration. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>These medications have a predilection to slow conduction in ischemic and depolarized cells. For this reason, class I antiarrhythmics are said to exhibit <strong>&#8220;state-dependent&#8221;</strong> action, meaning that they bind to sodium channels when they are open or inactivated and much less readily when they are fully repolarized and resting. This phenomenon means these medications will selectively depress tissue that is frequently depolarized, making them useful in treating reentrant tachycardias and ventricular tachycardias. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/5nYgx2-mTY6B8T7XerjKR1pNSKGYG2kd/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Selective blockade of fast sodium channels&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct: </strong></span><span>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decrease in SA and AV nodal activity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>&#42933;</span><span>-blockers work via selective &#42933;-blockade, decreasing intracellular cAMP, and&#160;</span><span>subsequently</span><span>&#160;decreasing Ca</span><span>2+</span><span>&#160;current.
