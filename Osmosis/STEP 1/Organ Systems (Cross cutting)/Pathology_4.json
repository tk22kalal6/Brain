      "solution": "This patient has an<strong>&#160;invasive ductal carcinoma</strong> (IDC), the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for up to 80% of invasive cancers. It is important to note that the term IDC is used for all carcinomas that are not subclassified into specialized types (e.g., mucinous, tubular). The tumor usually arises from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and crosses the basement membrane. Ductal carcinoma typically produces an <strong>extensive desmoplastic response</strong>, which is the growth of fibrous or connective tissue that surrounds the tumor and replaces the normal breast tissue. This reaction leads to an identifiable mammographic and sonographic density, and a hard, palpable irregular mass upon examination. On histology, its appearance ranges from tumors with well-developed tubules to sheets of anaplastic cells. About 60% of the tumors are ER-positive, 20% HER2 positive, and 15% are negative for both. <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/nWNPi9H5Rqe8IIAf8i2aOYO2Rpic90ZG/_.png\"></div>&#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lobular carcinoma in situ:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a noninvasive breast cancer which arises from the terminal duct lobular unit, spreads into the lobules, and does not cross the basement membrane. Unlike ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), it is rarely associated with calcifications on mammography. On histology, the tumor has a homogeneous appearance. The cells are monomorphic with round nuclei and are found in clusters within the lobules. LCIS is not associated with an extensive desmoplastic response and is unlikely to be observed on mammography. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Comedo carcinoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>A comedocarcinoma is a subtype of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) which is characterized by extensive necrosis, aggressive behavior, and increased risk for recurrence. On histology, the lesion plugs the lactiferous duct and exhibits necrosis. Transected ducts produce toothpaste-like necrotic tissue that extrudes when gentle pressure is applied to the breast. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tubular carcinoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Tubular carcinoma is a rare type of ER-positive/HER2- negative cancer accounting for up to 2% of invasive breast cancers. The majority of cases are detected on mammography as a small irregular mass. On histology, cells are arranged in well-formed tubules. Metastases to the lymph nodes are rare, and the prognosis is excellent. In about 3/4 of the cases, a low grade associated ductal carcinoma in situ is present. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Invasive ductal carcinoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Mucinous carcinoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Mucinous (colloid) carcinoma is an ER-positive/HER2- negative tumor that constitutes up to 2% of invasive breast cancers. On gross examination, it has a gelatinous appearance and is well-circumscribed. On histology, nests of tumor cells dispersed in extracellular mucin can be seen. It is considered a prognostically favorable variant among invasive breast cancers. &#160;&#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "This patient&#8217;s presentation of progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, jugular venous distension, and pulsus paradoxus following a viral illness is consistent with <strong>cardiac tamponade. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Cardiac tamponade occurs when large amounts of fluid accumulate between the layers of the pericardium (pericardial effusion), resulting in compression of the heart. Common etiologies include infectious, trauma, metabolic, autoimmune, cancer or idiopathic. The presentation may be acute and develop over minutes (e.g. trauma) or subacute, which develops over hours to days (e.g., uremia, post-viral) when enough fluid accumulates. The<strong>&#160;classic triad&#160;</strong>of symptoms, known as the <strong>Beck triad</strong>, consists of <strong>hypotension, distended neck veins,&#160;</strong>and <strong>muffled heart sounds</strong>. Other signs and symptoms include syncope, chest pain, and pulsus paradoxus. &#160;<br><br><strong>Pulsus paradoxus&#160;</strong>refers to an abnormal decrease in the systolic blood pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) observed during inspiration. It is important to note, however, that pulsus paradoxus can also be seen in some cases of hypovolemic shock and acute and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease. Pulsus paradoxus occurs as a result of the limited outward expansion of the right ventricle as the preload is increased during inspiration. This leads to bulging of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle with reduction in left ventricular filling, which decreases the stroke volume. The reduced stroke volume manifests as a drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration. &#160; <br><br>Patients suspected of cardiac tamponade should be promptly evaluated with an electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and echocardiography. Electrocardiogram typically shows normal <strong>sinus tachycardia </strong>and <strong>electrical alternans</strong>, which is characterized by beat-to-beat variations in the amplitude of the QRS complex. Echocardiography plays a major role in identification of pericardial effusion. Definitive treatment includes drainage by needle (pericardiocentesis) or surgery. &#160; <br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Viral myocarditis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The clinical presentation of myocarditis is highly variable, ranging from subclinical disease to fatigue, chest pain, heart failure, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and sudden death. Weak pulses may be observed in patients with myocarditis, as the dilated heart cannot efficiently pump out the blood; however, pulsus paradoxus is not observed. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Myocardial infarction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Acute myocardial infarction typically presents with chest pain that radiates to the jaw and left shoulder, diaphoresis, and dyspnea. It may progress to cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by tachycardia, hypotension, jugular venous distention, and pulmonary edema. However, it does not cause pulsus paradoxus, and this patient's age favors another diagnosis. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cardiac tamponade:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pulmonary embolism:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Pulmonary embolism can present with shortness of breath, hypotension, and jugular venous distension.

Constrictive pericarditis can occur as a result of viral, post-cardiac surgery, post-radiation therapy, connective tissue disorder or idiopathic. However, it is unlikely to develop after 1 week of viral illness, and other features would be expected (ascites, pulsatile hepatomegaly). &#160;&#160;</span></div>",

Horseshoe kidney is the most common fusion anomaly and usually occurs due to fusion of the<strong>&#160;lower poles of the kidneys.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Normally, during fetal development, the future kidneys develop in the pelvis as a structure called the metanephros and subsequently migrate upward to their normal position in the retroperitoneal renal fossa.

CMT affects the <strong>peripheral nervous system</strong> and is characterized by defective protein production in Schwann cells or the peripheral neuron&#8217;s axon.

Motor symptoms are also common and occur due to damage to the common peroneal nerve, which can lead to <strong>foot drop</strong>. Weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the foot can result in <strong>pes cavus</strong>, as characterized by a high arching foot that does not flatten with weight bearing (seen in the image).

Patients often present with painless vaginal bleeding upon rupture of membranes, accompanied by fetal heart rate abnormalities such as bradycardia or sinusoidal pattern. <strong>Fetal exsanguination</strong> can occur within minutes. The exact pathogenesis of vasa previa is unknown. Risk factors for developing vasa previa include velamentous cord insertion, umbilical cord insertion in the lower uterus, placenta previa or low-lying placenta, succenturiate placental lobe or bilobed placenta, in vitro fertilization, and multiple gestations. Diagnosis of vasa previa is made by demonstrating the fetal vessels passing across the internal cervical os by transvaginal ultrasound examination with color Doppler. Delivery is usually made via planned cesarean delivery at 34 to 35 weeks of gestation or by emergency cesarean delivery if a rupture occurred. Vasa previa is often associated with velamentous umbilical cord insertion, in which the umbilical inserts to the chorioamniotic membranes instead of the placenta and therefore is not protected by Wharton's jelly. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/hZ6xpjwtTp2Te5o6n_n1kArSTWuqTN3N/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Placenta accreta:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Placenta accreta refers to a placenta that attaches to the myometrium without penetrating it.

Note that this patient has multiple risk factors for developing gallstones, including female sex, age, multiparity, and obesity. &#160; <br><br>Biliary colic refers to episodic pain caused by<strong>&#160;temporary obstruction</strong> of the cystic duct by stone during gallbladder contraction. Common presentations include epigastric/right upper quadrant pain which may radiate to the right shoulder. The pain is often associated with diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. Following a fatty meal (although it can happen after any meal), neurohormonal activation with <strong>cholecystokinin&#160;</strong>triggers the contraction of the gallbladder, forcing the stone into the cystic duct. When the contractions subside, the stone is displaced from the duct, relieving the obstruction. Biliary colic is a misnomer because the pain is usually constant and not colicky. The pain of biliary colic usually lasts less than 6 hours, compared to cholecystitis which is usually longer. Note that a fever will not be present in biliary colic, since there is no inflammatory process occurring, unlike in cholecystitis. &#160;<br><br>During an episode of biliary colic, <strong>laboratory values should demonstrate normal values;</strong> this is because there is no inflammatory process occurring (unlike in cholecystitis), and therefore, no enzymatic markers should be elevated.

Stable angina most commonly occurs secondary to <strong>atherosclerosis</strong>. The onset of stable angina symptoms typically occurs when there is<strong>&#160;&#8805;70%</strong> coronary artery occlusion. Atherosclerosis leads to mismatch between oxygen demand and consumption, which becomes more pronounced during exertion. &#160;<br><br><strong>Nitrates (nitroglycerin)&#160;</strong>work by increasing <strong>nitric oxide (NO)</strong> release in vascular smooth muscle cells, which causes elevation of cGMP and smooth muscle relaxation. This process results in vasodilation of veins and arteries, leading to <strong>increased peripheral venous capacitance&#160;</strong>and <strong>decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR),</strong> respectively. When blood pools in the venous system, less blood flows back to the heart (<strong>decreased preload</strong>), which reduces myocardial wall stress and oxygen consumption. This mechanism is believed to be responsible for the antianginal effects of nitrates. The reduction in SVR also decreases cardiac wall stress, since the heart has to overcome less resistance to pump blood out (<strong>decreased afterload</strong>). In addition, nitrates also mildly vasodilate the coronary arteries, leading to increased oxygen delivery to the myocardium. However, the vasodilation of arteries only has a minor contribution, because nitrates affect veins more than arteries.

The malar (butterfly) rash, the most common skin lesion that characterizes acute SLE, was likely triggered by ultraviolet light exposure at the park. Combined with the inflammatory arthritis and laboratory abnormalities (leukopenia), SLE should be suspected. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/nlYI3j6QRAuscFaAAkyHV17iTmub1kGv/_.png\"></div><br>SLE is caused by a combination of factors that predispose to an abnormal immune response leading to autoantibody immune complex deposition, inflammation, and end-organ damage. Pathogenesis begins when environmental triggers cause cell damage and apoptosis, exposing nuclear material to the immune system. Genetic susceptibility can lead to poor clearance of these <strong>nuclear antigens</strong> and to recognition of their moieties as foreign. Dendritic cells present these antigens to B-cells, which then start producing autoimmune antibodies, known as <strong>antinuclear antibodies (ANA)</strong>. These antibodies spread through the bloodstream, forming<strong>&#160;immune complexes&#160;</strong>with antigens encountered in the blood, and deposit within various organs. &#160;<br><br>These deposited immune complexes activate the complement cascade, leading to enzyme-mediated cell damage, referred to as a <strong>type III hypersensitivity reaction</strong>. End-organ damage (e.g., rash, nephritis, synovitis) occurs as a result. When complement is activated and used up, <strong>serum complement levels (C3 and C4) fall</strong>. Another high-yield fact is that because early complement proteins like C1q, C2 and C4 are all involved in removing immune complexes, individuals that lack any of these proteins are predisposed to developing SLE. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients can also develop antibodies to antigens found on hematologic cells, including erythrocytes and leukocytes, and certain molecules, like phospholipids. Binding of these antibodies triggers complement activation via the classical complement pathway, leading to cell lysis and death. This process represents a type II hypersensitivity reaction and can cause hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) refers to the speed at which red blood cells drop to the bottom of a test tube.

ARDS most commonly occurs due to sepsis but can also occur as a complication of <strong>acute pancreatitis,</strong> major trauma, shock, drug overdose, severe burns, pneumonia and massive hemorrhage. Patients with severe acute pancreatitis have systemic circulation of activated pancreatic enzymes and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, platelet activating factor). ARDS can then be the result of microvascular thrombosis (a result of the inflammatory environment) and systemic active phospholipase A (lecithinase) digesting lecithin, a major component of surfactant, which then results in alveolar capillary damage.

It occurs most often due to <strong>lipoprotein lipase</strong> deficiency. A rarer cause is a defect in<strong>&#160;apolipoprotein C-II</strong>, a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase. Without a functional lipoprotein lipase, the breakdown of chylomicrons and their triglyceride content is prevented, resulting in massive triglyceride accumulation within the blood. &#160;<br><br>The massive triglyceride content in the blood results in cutaneous deposition and rapid development of xanthomas on the back and buttocks that can be pruritic. Due to the rapid nature of their development, they are called <strong>eruptive xanthomas</strong>. In addition, the high concentration of serum triglycerides can lead to <strong>acute pancreatitis</strong>. This is because when pancreatic cells encounter triglycerides, they release lipase to break the triglycerides down into free fatty acids; excess free fatty acids can injure the pancreas. Lastly, patients can develop <strong>hepatosplenomegaly.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Of note, patients with type I hyperlipidemia are not at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This is because the development of atherosclerotic plaques is related to the elevation of other lipoproteins such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and not related to the elevation of chylomicrons. &#160;<br><br>Laboratory testing will show markedly <strong>elevated triglyceride levels</strong> and <strong>normal/mildly elevated cholesterol levels</strong>.

The symptoms of polymyositis overlap with those of the other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (e.g., dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis). A combination of the patient&#8217;s history, physical examination, and laboratory testing can be used to diagnose patients with polymyositis and distinguish it from similar conditions. &#160;<br><br>Definitive diagnosis is based on identifying autoantibodies, like <strong>anti-signal recognition particle</strong> (anti-SRP), and <strong>anti-Jo-1 antibodies</strong>. Of note, <strong>anti-SRP is most specific for polymyositis</strong> whereas <strong>anti-Mi-2 is most specific for dermatomyositis</strong>. Anti-Jo-1 antibodies are non-specific and are often found in patients with either condition. All of the inflammatory myopathies can cause elevated serum levels of muscle enzymes such as aldolase or creatine kinase. Additionally, <strong>electromyography&#160;</strong>can be used to detect regions of dead muscle cells that cause abnormal electrical signals conduction.

A similar condition is <strong>osteomalacia</strong>, which describes inadequate bone mineralization in adults. Both conditions can be due to a deficiency or impaired metabolism of<strong>&#160;vitamin D</strong>, <strong>phosphate</strong>, or <strong>calcium</strong>. Of note, breast milk contains low vitamin D levels, and exclusively breast-fed children are at risk of developing vitamin D deficiency. When these elements are missing, osteoblasts do not have enough calcium and phosphate to deposit into the organic matrix.<br><br>In children, since the growth plates have not closed, this leads to cartilaginous growth plates, impaired growth of bones, and bone malformations. In adults, where the epiphyseal plates have already closed, it only causes defective mineralization of osteoid, resulting in weak bones that are fracture-prone. <br><br>Both conditions can cause diffuse bone and joint pain, proximal muscle weakness, and increased risk of fragility fractures. Rickets-specific symptoms include<strong>&#160;thin and soft skull bones</strong> (termed craniotabes), delayed fontanelle closure, and <strong>bow legs</strong> (also termed genu varum).

Taking into account her mother&#8217;s history of endometrial cancer at a young age, as well as genetic testing revealing a mutation in the <em>MLH1</em> gene, this patient likely has <strong>hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</strong> (HNPCC). HNPCC, also termed <strong>Lynch syndrome,</strong> is caused by an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> mutation in one of four <strong>DNA mismatch repair genes:</strong>&#160;<em>MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2.&#160;</em>These mutations cause subsequent DNA mismatches to occur in regions of repetitive nucleotide sequences (microsatellites), resulting in <strong>microsatellite instability.</strong> Microsatellite instability likely affects genes that control cell growth, and accumulation of mutations drives the process of carcinogenesis. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Colon cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome is usually <strong>right-sided&#160;</strong>and occurs in adults under 50 years of age. Right-sided colon cancers grow as exophytic masses but do not typically cause colon obstruction because the right-sided colon has a larger diameter than the left. Instead, right-sided tumors tend to cause chronic bleeding, eventually causing iron-deficiency anemia.

His clinical presentation reveals non-specific abdominal pain, vomiting, altered consciousness,<strong>&#160;Kussmaul respirations</strong>, signs of dehydration (e.g. low blood pressure, reduced skin turgor), and hyperglycemia. These findings reflect the classic presentation of <strong>diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)&#160;</strong>secondary to undiagnosed<strong>&#160;type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)</strong>.<br><br>DKA can occur due to <strong>insulin noncompliance</strong> or <strong>increased insulin requirements</strong> (e.g. infection). The absent/low insulin leads to <strong>lipolysis&#160;</strong>to generate free fatty acids, which are then converted to <strong>ketone bodies&#160;</strong>(e.g. acetoacetate, &#946;-hydroxybutyrate) to meet energy requirements. These ketone bodies lead to a <strong>high anion gap metabolic acidosis</strong>. It is important to note that DKA occurs in T1DM rather than T2DM because the endogenous insulin in T2DM is sufficient to prevent lipolysis.<br><br>Laboratory findings supporting DKA include <strong>high glucose, hyperkalemia&#160;</strong>(but decrease in total body K+ due to urine loss), and elevated urine and blood <strong>ketone bodies. Arterial blood gas (ABG)</strong> shows a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, including a <strong>low pH, low HCO<sup>3</sup></strong><sup>&#8211;</sup> (trying to buffer the excess acid), and often a <strong>low PaCO<sub>2</sub></strong>&#160; due to respiratory compensation (Kussmaul respirations to exhale extra CO2 in an attempt to normalize the pH).<br><br>To calculate the anion gap, use the following formula: <strong>anion gap = Na+ &#8211; (Cl-+ HCO<sup>3&#8211;</sup>)</strong>. This patient's anion gap is 138 - (95+20)= 23, which is above the<strong>&#160;normal value of 8-12</strong>. The anion gap represents the difference between the cations and anions, and the additional ketone bodies in the serum are responsible for this difference.<br><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/C14gsvW-SYetCd8H6OjYjrjgT1al9MJM/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Arterial PaCO2&#160; (mEq/L)&#160;&#160;Arterial HCO3&#8211;&#160; (mEq/L)&#160;&#160;Na+&#160; &#160;(mEq/L)&#160;&#160;Cl-&#160; (mEq/L)&#160;&#160;52&#160;&#160;32&#160;&#160;135&#160;&#160;95&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>High PaCO2, high bicarbonate high and normal anion gap (135-(95+32)=8) are consistent with respiratory acidosis and metabolic compensation.

      "solution": "This patient is most likely experiencing<strong>&#160;graft-versus-host disease&#160;</strong>(GVHD), which is a common complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although GVHD is mostly seen in bone marrow transplantation, it can also occur in solid organ transplantation with rich lymphocytes (e.g., liver) or even when giving un-irradiated blood. &#160;<br><br>Graft-versus-host disease is a systemic disorder that occurs after the <strong>graft&#8217;s immune cells recognize the antigens of the host cells</strong> and induce damage to the recipient&#8217;s tissues. For GVHD to occur, three components must be met: &#160;<br><br>&#160;1. &#160; &#160; &#160;The graft (transplanted organ) must contain<strong>&#160;immunocompetent cells&#160;</strong>(e.g. bone marrow transplant). &#160;<br>&#160;2. &#160; &#160; &#160;The recipient must be <strong>immunocompromised&#160;</strong>and thus incapable of mounting an immune response to eliminate the transplanted immunocompetent cells. <br>&#160;3. &#160; &#160; &#160;The transplanted immune cells must recognize the alloantigens of the host cells as foreign or non-self.<br><br>GVHD is a type<strong>&#160;IV hypersensitivity reaction</strong> that is mediated by T-cells &#8211; specifically, both T-helper cells (CD4+) and cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+) cells. It develops when these donor T-cells recognize antigens on the recipient&#8217;s cells due to a mismatch between the major and/or minor histocompatibility antigens between the host and recipient. GVHD develops when the donor T-cells recognize the recipient&#8217;s MHC proteins as foreign and induce an inflammatory response damaging the host cells. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/RsORAAXjQz6tXoVgh6NB7l5aQlKKWFZp/_.png\"></div><br><br>Patients with acute GVHD usually present with a pruritic or painful <strong>erythematous maculopapular rash.</strong> The rash typically involves the shoulders, nape of the neck, palms, and soles. However, in severe cases, the rash may be generalized, and patients may have blisters and ulcers. In addition, patients usually have <strong>gastrointestinal manifestations</strong>, including secretory watery diarrhea that persists during fasting and may progress to bloody diarrhea if ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract develop. Some patients may also have vomiting and nausea. Finally, the <strong>liver&#160;</strong>is usually involved (unless the transplanted organ is the liver), which manifests as elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. &#160; <br><br>Finally, despite the harmful consequences of GVHD, it can sometimes be used for beneficial effects in leukemia patients, wherein the donor lymphocytes attack the recipient's malignant cells, a process known as<strong>&#160;graft versus leukemia effect. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/nNiXyciHTq2UCKM90GC9-tQISSCaJYC7/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Immune response of graft T-cells against recipient&#8217;s cells:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Immune response of graft B-cells against recipient&#8217;s antigens&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Graft-versus-host disease is due to host T-cells attacking the recipient&#8217;s antigens; B cells are not involved in GVHD.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Immune response of recipient&#8217;s T-cells against graft antigens&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>In graft-versus-host disease, the graft T-cells attack and damage the antigens in the recipient.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Infection with cytomegalovirus&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Patients with immunodeficiency (like this patient) are susceptible to CMV infection, which can lead to colitis.

If an ultrasound is inconclusive, a HIDA scan (cholescintigraphy) can be performed, in which a radioactive tracer is injected intravenously; normally, the radioactive tracer would fill the gallbladder, but in cases of cystic duct obstruction, the gallbladder would not be visualized. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Choledocholithiasis&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of gallstones obstructing the common bile duct.

Ballism is often unilateral (hemiballism), present at rest, and worsened by activity. Traditionally, hemiballism was pathognomonic of a lesion of the <strong>contralateral subthalamic nucleus</strong> (STN). However, recent evidence suggests that other locations are often involved, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, and globus pallidus. Most stroke lesions causing hemichorea/hemiballism seem to involve a common functional network connected to the posterolateral putamen. &#160; &#160;<br>The basal ganglia system is important in regulating movement. Damage or malfunction of these structures disrupts the balance between the indirect and direct pathways in the basal ganglia circuitry, leading to excessive dopaminergic activity. Disruption to the indirect pathway results in loss of inhibition to the globus pallidus, which in turn allows hyperkinetic movements to occur. Chorea, athetosis, and ballism often coexist in the same patient and are considered to be a part of the choreiform spectrum. &#160; &#160;<br><br><em><strong>High-yield note:&#160;</strong>For the purposes of USMLE examinations, keep in mind the association between the subthalamic nucleus and contralateral hemiballismus.&#160;</em><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Dystonia&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle contractions that result in repetitive movements or an abnormal fixed posture.

He later develops bleeding from his urinary catheter, and the laboratory findings demonstrate prolonged PT/PTT, low fibrinogen, and low factor VIII levels. Together these findings are consistent with<strong>&#160;disseminated intravascular coagulation</strong> (DIC). &#160;<br><br>DIC refers to a widespread consumptive coagulopathy resulting in hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, and end-organ ischemia. It has multiple triggers including <strong>trauma, sepsis</strong> (due to lipopolysaccharides found in bacteria),<strong>&#160;pregnancy related complications, malignancies&#160;</strong>(acute promyelocytic leukemia, mucinous tumors), and<strong>&#160;transfusion reactions. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Regardless of the trigger, DIC causes unchecked activation of the coagulation cascade and deposition of platelet-rich or fibrin-rich thrombi in the microvasculature. Over time, this process consumes <strong>all&#160;</strong>coagulation factors, causing <strong>an elevated PT/PTT&#160;</strong>and <strong>decreased fibrinogen levels</strong>. DIC also causes fibrinolysis resulting in <strong>elevated d-dimer levels</strong>, depleted platelets resulting in <strong>thrombocytopenia</strong>, and <strong>schistocytes&#160;</strong>on peripheral blood smear. &#160;<br><br>Clinically, patients will often develop <strong>bleeding from catheters, venipuncture sites,</strong> or other means of invasive access.

When suspected, coagulation studies including PT/PTT, d-dimer, and fibrinogen levels should be obtained.

Damage to the vascular endothelium activates the coagulation cascade via exposure of tissue factor and release of procoagulant enzymes or phospholipids.

One way to make the distinction would be to check a factor VIII level, which will be normal or elevated in coagulopathy due to liver failure, since it is synthesized outside of hepatocytes.

The adnexal mass is likely an endometrioma, a blood-filled &#8220;chocolate cyst&#8221; that results from implantation of endometrium within the ovary. &#160; <br><br>Endometriosis refers to the implantation of endometrial glands and stroma outside the endometrial cavity, most commonly in the pelvis, peritoneum, and ovary (may be bilateral). There are several different hypotheses that explain the growth of endometrial glands outside of the uterus, but the most widely accepted one is the <strong>retrograde flow of menstruation</strong>. Patients often present with cyclic pelvic pain, heavy bleeding, <strong>dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia</strong> (the 3D&#8217;s), infertility, and a normal-sized uterus. Physical examination findings are variable and depend upon the size and location of the implants. Findings may include tenderness with a digital exam, <strong>nodularity in the posterior fornix</strong>, adnexal masses, and <strong>immobility of the cervix</strong> or uterus (due to inflammation and scarring). Imaging may show ovarian cysts (endometriomas) and rectovaginal or bladder nodules. Definitive diagnosis and treatment are done by histologic evaluation with laparoscopy. During laparoscopy, the appearance of the lesions is variable but sometimes blue/brown lesions have been described as \"powder burns&#8221; lesions. Treatment includes <strong>NSAIDs</strong>, <strong>oral contraceptives</strong>, and <strong>laparoscopic removal</strong> in refractory cases. &#160;<br><br><strong>Endometrioid carcinoma</strong> of the ovary is believed to arise from endometriosis. They are usually malignant tumors, but benign and borderline types also exist. On histology, they are composed of tubular glands, similar to that of the endometrium. They often occur bilaterally, and up to 30% of cases have a concomitant endometrial carcinoma. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/WbNYXkAHSa64jkmSGevjCLo_Rq_zcH_g/_.png\"></div><br>Reproduced from: Wikimedia Commons<br>Endometriosis lesions in the pouch of Douglas<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/VkrxaoOcRXG6daOEf-Tm81myQSe-LYRm/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ovarian germ cells:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Germ cell tumors include dysgerminoma, teratoma, and yolk sac tumors.

AS is a type of <strong>seronegative spondyloarthritis</strong> (negative rheumatoid factor), a group of autoimmune conditions characterized by arthritis and a strong association with HLA-B27 (MHC class I serotype). These include psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, reactive arthritis, juvenile spondyloarthropathy, and ankylosing spondylitis. HLA-B27 testing is part of the diagnostic evaluation. &#160; <br><br>These conditions share common features including inflammation of the axial joints (especially the sacroiliac joint), asymmetric oligoarthritis, dactylitis (sausage digits), uveitis, and <strong>enthesitis&#160;</strong>(inflammation at the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone). AS is also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including aortic root disease, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and conduction abnormalities. Patients with AS often have elevated ESR and CRP, as well as characteristic changes in the sacroiliac joint on a plain radiograph (erosions, ankylosis, changes in joint width, and sclerosis).

PNH is an intrinsic, intravascular hemolytic anemia. Extrinsic anemia is defined as hemolysis resulting from a problem outside of the erythrocyte and is typically acquired (e.g., autoimmune, infections, microangiopathic), whereas intrinsic anemia is defined as hemolysis resulting from a problem with the erythrocyte itself and is typically caused by enzyme deficiencies, commonly seen in congenital conditions (e.g., PNH, sickle cell disease, G6PD, hereditary spherocytosis). &#160; <br><br>The type of hemolysis can be determined based on symptoms and laboratory findings. In intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobin that is released inside vessels gets bound by haptoglobin, and both molecules are removed together. Therefore, haptoglobin levels decrease. Once the haptoglobin gets overwhelmed, the remainder of the hemoglobin travels via the blood to the kidneys. Here, it is excreted in the urine and causes hemoglobinuria. While passing through the renal tubules, some of the hemoglobin is reabsorbed by the cells lining the tubule. The iron component of the heme is stored in these cells as hemosiderin for a few days. Eventually, these cells slough into the urine and cause hemosiderinuria. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/uLsMbuvTQgG_1hp9MuZTb3qrQtGWUdEG/_.png\"></div><br>In extravascular hemolysis, erythrocytes are destroyed outside of the blood vessels, typically in the liver or spleen.

The most common accessory pathway in this disorder is the <strong>bundle of Kent,</strong> which rests on the infero-lateral aspect of the right atrium. Ventricular pre-excitation via this pathway can result in reentrant tachycardias, since it does not have the same physiologic brakes as the AV node.

Over time, deposition of granulomas results in fibrous scar formation in affected organs&#8212;for example, causing restrictive lung disease in the lung or cardiomyopathy in the heart. Less commonly, granuloma formation in the liver can result in cholestatic liver disease and cirrhosis. Nervous system involvement commonly manifests with<strong>&#160;Bell's palsy.</strong><br><br>Most patients with sarcoidosis are completely asymptomatic, but when symptoms do arise, they are usually constitutional. Symptoms include fever, weight loss, fatigue, arthropathy, shortness of breath and coughing. More specific signs and symptoms include<strong>&#160;erythema nodosum, lupus pernio</strong> (a lupus like rash), and <strong>uveitis.&#160;</strong><strong>&#160; &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Non-caseating granulomas:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Caseating granulomas:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> infection is associated with caseation necrosis and presents with fevers, night sweats, weight loss, as well as risk factors for acquisition such as travel to endemic areas.

Hyperpigmentation stems from increased levels of ACTH, which stimulate melanin stimulating hormone (MSH) production and subsequent melanin synthesis. Loss of aldosterone leaves the kidneys with an inability to adequately retain sodium, excrete potassium, and maintain intravascular volume--leading to salt craving, orthostatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis. Additional clues to this diagnosis include a family history of autoimmune disorders (e.g., Hashimoto thyroiditis, type I &#160;diabetes mellitus). &#160; <br><br>In contrast, <strong>chronic secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency</strong> is more commonly due to hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction -- and thus does not affect levels of aldosterone.

These findings are concerning for <strong>myasthenia gravis (MG)</strong>. MG is often associated with thymic abnormalities (e.g., thymic hyperplasia or <strong>thymoma</strong>), as seen in this patient with recent diagnosis of mediastinal mass on CT scan. &#160;<br><br>MG is a <strong>type II hypersensitivity</strong> reaction that develops when B-cells begin producing antibodies against <strong>nicotinic acetylcholine</strong> (ACh) receptors on muscle cells. Myasthenia gravis causes muscle weakness via two mechanisms. First, the antibodies block the binding of ACh to its<strong>&#160;receptors.</strong> Second, the antibodies can activate the <strong>classical complement pathway,&#160;</strong>resulting in destruction of ACh receptors.<br><br>Due to the reduced number of available ACh receptors, ACh released at the nerve terminal is unable to generate the postsynaptic potential needed to induce muscle contraction, resulting in muscle weakness. The weakness is more pronounced with the repeated use of a muscle group, since it causes depletion of the ACh store in the neuromuscular junction. &#160;<br><br>A minority of people with MG produce another type of antibody against <strong>muscle-specific tyrosine kinase</strong> (MuSK).

Given his positive RPR test, the most likely etiology is<strong>&#160;tabes dorsalis</strong> secondary to a tertiary syphilis infection. &#160; <br><br>Tabes dorsalis arises due to infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by <em>Treponema pallidum</em>, the spirochete that causes syphilis. The condition takes nearly 20 years to develop after initial infection. Infection of the spinal cord leads to demyelination and degeneration of the <strong>dorsal column and roots</strong>, resulting in findings of gait ataxia and incoordination. &#160; <br><br>The most specific finding for tabes dorsalis is the <strong>Argyll-Robertson pupil</strong>, which is characterized by small bilateral pupils that do not constrict when exposed to bright light, but do constrict when focused on a nearby object. This finding is also termed <strong>light-near dissociation.</strong> Other common symptoms include <strong>lancinating pains, neurogenic urinary incontinence,&#160;</strong>and signs of <strong>dementia</strong>.

Normally, after exposure to bright light, a pupil constricts. A MGP, on the other hand, has a relative afferent pupillary defect. As a result, when light is rapidly transferred from the normal eye to the eye with MGP, the MGP dilates instead of constricting. However, MGP is not typically associated with tertiary syphilis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cranial nerve III palsy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Cranial nerve (CN) III nerve palsy refers to a &#8220;down and out pupil,&#8221; wherein the pupil is enlarged and shifted inferolaterally. Etiologies include uncal herniation and microvascular disease. In contrast, this patient has a positive Romberg sign, dysmetria, and absent deep tendon reflexes, which is more consistent with neurosyphilis. Neurosyphillis would not typically cause a CN III palsy.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Loss of pain and temperature sensation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Tabes dorsalis rarely affects the spinothalamic tract, which is an afferent pathway in the anterior spinal cord that relays pain and temperature sensation.

The first step in management is to initiate<strong>&#160;lifestyle changes&#160;</strong>such as engaging in physical activity as well as ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. <br><br><strong>Bisphosphonates,&#160;</strong>such as alendronate and risedronate, are the first-line drugs to manage osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogs that bind to hydroxyapatite in the bone and inhibit osteoclast activity. Side effects include <strong>jaw osteonecrosis, atypical stress fractures,</strong> and, if taken orally, they can cause <strong>pill-induced esophagitis.</strong> To prevent this last side-effect, patients are advised to take the medication with water and remain upright for 30 minutes afterwards. Bisphosphonates should also be used with precaution in individuals with renal failure, since they are eliminated via the kidneys. &#160; <br><br>For advanced cases of osteoporosis, <strong>teriparatide</strong>, a recombinant parathyroid hormone, can be used. Although parathyroid hormone stimulates bone resorption, it has been found that pulsatile injections with teriparatide activate osteoblasts more than osteoclasts. The net result is increased bone formation. Its side effects include transient hypercalcemia and increased risk of osteosarcoma.

It is hypothesized that environmental risk factors modify normal articular proteins in the synovial joints. The modified proteins are targeted by the immune system, since it fails to recognize them as part of the normal body, causing the proteins to become self-antigens. Antigen presenting cells then pick up the self-antigens and activate CD4+ T-cells. T-helper cells then stimulate nearby B-cells to produce autoantibodies.<br><br>T-cells eventually enter the joints and secrete inflammatory cytokines. Likewise, autoantibodies bind to their targets and trigger the complement cascade. The inflammation causes synovial cells to proliferate. This increase in synovial and immune cells creates a <strong>pannus</strong>, a layer of granulation tissue and inflammatory cells. Over time, cytokines released in the pannus start to break down the articular cartilage, exposing the underlying bones, leading to bone erosion.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/YYts3liGQJ_eiP5Dsa85Inn4RCWltwB_/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Uq7a7N9tRDqPMzQCGHXYZT4zTtmt-I4t/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Autoimmune inflammation and destruction of the joints:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Infection by tick-transmitted spirochete:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This answer describes Lyme disease, which is prevalent in the Northeastern and upper Midwestern United States.

The age of beginning CRC screening varies, depending on the patient&#8217;s risk factors and family history. Patients who have a <strong>first-degree relative diagnosed with colon cancer before the age of 60&#160;</strong>should begin screening at the age of 40 or 10 years prior to their relative&#8217;s diagnosis, whichever is earlier. In all patients with <strong>inflammatory bowel disease</strong> (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease) a screening colonoscopy should be performed eight years after disease or symptom onset. Additionally, patients with <strong>hereditary syndromes</strong>, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), require screening starting at an early age.<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/l1c0iGE_SSmdBrf1d-nZC5yaSDWJFOev/_.png\"></div>&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis diagnosed at age 33.:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The patient&#8217;s father developed colorectal cancer at age 70.:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Patients with a family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a first-degree relative are at increased risk of developing the condition.

Regurgitant volume backs up into the venous system, resulting in <strong>jugular venous distention, hepatosplenomegaly (hepatic congestion), ascites and lower extremity edema</strong>. The characteristic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation is<strong>&#160;holosystolic</strong> and best heard over the <strong>4th left intercostal space</strong> (tricuspid area).

      "solution": "This patient with a significant smoking history is presenting with <strong>peripheral edema</strong>, <strong>hepatic congestion</strong>, <strong>jugular venous distension</strong>, as well as a<strong>&#160;loud P2</strong> on auscultation. These characteristics, in the absence of features of left sided heart failure (e.g., orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) all favor the diagnosis of cor pulmonale. <strong>Cor pulmonale</strong> refers to <strong>isolated right heart failure (RHF)</strong> secondary to a pulmonary condition. For example, this patient most likely has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to chronic smoking, which is contributing to his dyspnea on exertion. COPD causes <strong>hypoxia</strong>, leading to <strong>vasoconstriction&#160;</strong>in the pulmonary vasculature. This elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes a backup of pressure into the <strong>right&#160;</strong>ventricle that eventually leads to <strong>right ventricular hypertrophy</strong>. &#160;The loud P2 heard on cardiac auscultation reflects the increased closing pressure of the valve against pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease. As the condition progresses, it can lead to isolated RHF. It is important to note that the most common cause of RHF is <strong>left heart failure (LHF)</strong>. &#160; &#160;Since the right side of the heart cannot overcome the pressure in the pulmonary circulation, backward pressure leads to<strong>&#160;jugular venous distention</strong>, <strong>increased portal blood pressure</strong>, and <strong>peripheral edema</strong>. Increased pressure in the portal system presents with <strong>hepatosplenomegaly</strong>, <strong>hepatic pulsation</strong>, <strong>ascites&#160;</strong>and, in severe cases, <strong>cardiac cirrhosis</strong> (i.e., liver cirrhosis due to cardiac causes). On gross morphology, the congested liver is called a <strong>nutmeg liver&#160;</strong>due to congested centrilobular areas surrounded by paler, non-congested parenchyma. &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/4q0a6nNNQ0Cv-C9nDHLDH5B6QR_aSGhJ/_.jpg\"></div><br><br>It is important to distinguish RHF and LHF based on the causes, history, clinical examination, and diagnostic investigations: &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Hiu5_Kj5RzWngbB4-5VlxcswT3K2o1Sz/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypertension:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Prolonged hypertension can result in left ventricular concentric hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction (the heart can not fill properly) due to reduced compliance. This can eventually lead to left-sided heart failure. Symptoms of left-sided heart failure include dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea due to pulmonary edema. This patient has clinical features of right-sided heart failure.

This mutation leads to asymmetric septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve which results in outlet obstruction. Presentation is variable and may include dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, atypical or anginal chest pain, palpitations, syncope, sudden cardiac death. This condition usually affects younger athletes.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tuberculosis&#160;&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Tuberculosis is a cause of constrictive pericarditis, which can eventually lead to diastolic dysfunction and right heart failure. Constrictive pericarditis can present with signs of right heart side failure as seen in this patient.

Although most cases of appendicitis develop due to obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by a fecalith, some rare cases arise due to an <strong>obstructing tumor</strong>. This patient&#8217;s tumor is likely of neuroendocrine origin based on histological analysis. &#160; <br><br><strong>Neuroendocrine tumors</strong> are a rare type of cancer. They arise from neuroendocrine cells, which have characteristics of both nerve and endocrine cells and can produce hormones in response to nerve stimuli. &#160; &#160; <br><br>Neuroendocrine tumors can be divided into functional and nonfunctional tumors. <strong>Functional&#160;</strong>tumors produce hormones, which are responsible for the majority of their symptoms. On the other hand, <strong>nonfunctional&#160;</strong>tumors are often asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Most neuroendocrine tumors are found within the gastrointestinal tract. <strong>Carcinoid tumors</strong> can develop in organs such as the small intestines (most commonly), large intestine, and appendix. <strong>Insulinomas, glucagonomas,</strong> and <strong>VIPomas&#160;</strong>arise in the pancreas. Furthermore, tumors such as <strong>pheochromocytoma&#160;</strong>can arise from the adrenal medulla. &#160; <br><br>Histologically, neuroendocrine tumors can be divided into well-differentiated and poorly-differentiated neoplasms.<strong>&#160;Well-differentiated&#160;</strong>tumors are likely benign and characterized by small round cells with round to oval nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and cytoplasmic granules staining positive for <strong>synaptophysin&#160;</strong>or <strong>chromogranin</strong>.

      "solution": "This elderly patient with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors presents with sudden-onset, painless monocular vision loss, a carotid bruit, and fundoscopic findings consistent with <strong>central retinal artery occlusion</strong> (CRAO). An occluding embolism may originate from the ipsilateral carotid artery or the heart. In older patients, carotid atherosclerosis is the most common etiology for retinal artery occlusion but is unusual in patients under 40. A cardiogenic embolism should be suspected in younger patients presenting with this condition. <br><br>CRAO fundoscopic findings include a pale, cloudy retina with narrow blood vessels and a characteristic <strong>\"cherry-red spot\"</strong> overlying the fovea. This later finding occurs due to the presence of a pale ischemic retina, while the well-vascularized macula remains intact (the macula receives its blood supply from the choroid plexus, not the central retinal artery), at the same time, &#160;the <strong>surrounding retina is pale and ischemic</strong> due to retinal artery occlusion. Treatment includes <strong>hyperbaric oxygen therapy</strong> to enhance oxygen delivery to ischemic retinal tissue. In addition, <strong>ocular massage</strong> is thought to enhance the breakdown of the thrombus. &#160; <br><br>Diagnosis of CRAO in elderly patients suggests a high burden of carotid atherosclerosis, which carries a high risk developing an <strong>ischemic stroke</strong>. The stroke rate following a CRAO is as high as 13% in the first year and ten times higher than in the general population.

The most common etiology of this condition is retinal breaks, which often occur secondary to <strong>head trauma </strong>or <strong>vitreous degeneration</strong>. &#160;Significant vitreous degeneration increases traction on the retina and potentially a retinal tear. Liquefied vitreous seeps through the tear and under the retina, promoting detachment. &#160; <br><br>Patients (especially on examination questions) typically present with the sensation of<strong> light flashes or floaters</strong> described as fine dots, veils, cobwebs, clouds, or strings, followed by sudden visual field loss in the affected eye. As the retina detaches, it may create a mechanical depolarization of the axons running through the nerve fiber layer of the retina, resulting in the sensation of flashing bright lights. Vision loss typically begins in the periphery and progresses toward the central visual axis over hours to weeks like a &#8220;<strong>curtain drawn down</strong>.&#8221; Diagnosis is based on a fundoscopic examination, which may visualize <strong>crinkling of retinal tissue </strong>or <strong>changes in blood vessel direction</strong>.

This finding occurs secondary to retinal ischemia and subsequent upregulation of pro-angiogenic cytokines, namely, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Neovascularization is not a contraindication to the performance of a lumbar puncture. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Crinkling of retinal tissue &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Retinal detachment typically presents as flashes or floaters followed by sudden, painless visual field loss in the affected eye. Vision loss typically begins in the periphery and progresses toward loss of the central visual axis over hours to weeks. A fundoscopic examination may demonstrate wrinkling/crinkling of retinal tissue or changes in blood vessel direction. These fundoscopic findings do not suggest papilledema and hence do not contraindicate the performance of a lumbar puncture. &#160;&#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "This young child presents with strabismus, leukocoria, and fundoscopy findings consistent with <strong>retinoblastoma</strong>. This retinal tumor of childhood is caused by a mutation in both alleles of the retinoblastoma or<strong>&#160;<em>RB1&#160;</em>gene</strong> on chromosome 13. Retinoblastomas can be hereditary, in which case the individual inherits a mutation in one of the alleles of the RB1 gene; however, random mutations in this gene may also lead to the development of retinoblastoma. Hereditary retinoblastomas are typically bilateral and are associated with an increased risk of developing additional malignancies, including osteosarcoma, sarcomas, and melanoma. Sporadic retinoblastomas tend to be unilateral. &#160; <br><br>Clinical features of retinoblastoma include <strong>leukocoria</strong> or &#8220;white pupil&#8221; with <strong>red reflex testing</strong>. Typically, reflected light from the fundus appears red; however, a tumor that grows over the fundus blocks reflected light such that the pupil appears white. Other common symptoms include <strong>strabismus</strong> (misalignment of the eyes), nystagmus, or ocular inflammation. Metastases to the brain are common, presenting with findings of vomiting, headaches, or neurologic deficits. Diagnosis of retinoblastoma begins with a red reflex testing, followed by a fundoscopic examination. Characteristic findings on fundoscopy include the presence of a chalky, off-white retinal mass with a soft, friable consistency. A biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Definitive treatment depends on the extent of disease progression, but in early stages typically consists of enucleation or complete removal of the eye. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Impaired inhibition of E2F transcription factor &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypermethylation of DNA repair gene promoter regions &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) &#160;inherited germline mutations in DNA-repair genes, resulting in hypermethylation of these crucial repair proteins. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased B-catenin synthesis &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The <em>APC</em> gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein that promotes the degradation of B-catenin.

These genes encode a tumor suppressor protein involved in cell signaling and apoptosis. Loss of kinase activity of STK11 is associated with deranged growth suppression function. Patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome characteristically have a hyperpigmented perioral area, along with an increased risk for gastrointestinal cancers. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Impaired production of p53 protein &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> A mutation in the TP53 gene reduces the production of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare cancer-predisposition syndrome caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the <em>TP53</em> gene. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is also known as sarcoma, breast, leukemia, and adrenal gland (SBLA) cancer syndrome. &#160;&#160;</span></div>",
