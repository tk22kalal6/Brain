Metabolism refers to the build-up and breakdown of substances by enzymatic conversion of one chemical entity to another. In contrast, excretion eliminates drug or drug metabolites from the body.

ACE, which plays a role in the degradation of bradykinin, can be inhibited by ACE inhibitors and would increase the serum levels of bradykinin. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Angiotensin II:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Examination.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Endothelin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Endothelin-receptor antagonists (e.g., bosentan and ambrisentan) can help improve symptoms in patients with pulmonary hypertension. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Substance P:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Aprepitant is an oral antagonist at NK1 (substance P) receptors and is approved for use in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
