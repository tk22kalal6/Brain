      "solution": "Genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins. The DNA sequence contains introns, exons, and 2 <strong>promoter regions</strong> (the CAAT box and TATA box). Gene transcription begins with the <strong>unpacking of DNA</strong> from chromatin and de-helicization (double helix unwinds). The promoter region, which is a repetitive non-coding sequence of nucleotides, signals the initiation site of transcription.<br><br>Subsequently, various proteins and enzymes coalesce to form the pre-initiation complex around the promoter, also featuring an enzyme called <strong>RNA polymerase</strong>. A process called elongation then occurs, where RNA polymerase unzips the two strands of DNA via the shearing of hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleotides. The RNA polymerase then follows the template strand and uses it to assemble an mRNA molecule, that is the mirrored image of the template strand. Although promoters are not directly translated into proteins, promoter mutations can cause abnormal gene expression.<br><br>The mRNA is different from DNA in that <strong>thymine (T) is replaced by uracil (U)</strong> and it runs in the opposite direction compared to the template strand, that is, from <strong>5&#8217; end to 3&#8217; end</strong>. <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/HPmFrLHKQWiaPA4AsYTeM85UTZGOj7_n/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 3&#8217;-UACGUACAGU-5&#8217; &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: mRNA runs in the direction opposite to that of the template strand, that is, 5&#8217;&#8594;3&#8217;. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ 5&#8217;-UACGUACAGU-3&#8217; &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 3'-ATGCATGTCA-5':</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: mRNA runs in the direction opposite to that of the template strand, that is, 5&#8217;&#8594;3&#8217;.

      "solution": "The <strong>lac operon</strong> represents a model for the regulation of gene transcription in E. Coli and functions based on the concentration on the availability of both glucose and lactose to the cells. &#160;The lac operon consists of the <strong>promoter, operator, and three structural genes, lacZ, lacY, and lacA</strong>. These genes produce proteins that allow E.Coli to utilize lactose for energy production. The lacZ gene leads to the production of B-galactosidase, an enzyme that breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose. The lac Y gene produces B-galactosidase permease, allowing lactose to enter the cell. &#160;Upstream of these genes lies the promoter region (where the RNA polymerase binds and initiates transcription), followed by the operator region.<br><br>The <strong>lac repressor protein</strong> and <strong>catabolite activator protein (CAP) are two leading players that regulate these genes</strong>. The repressor protein binds to the operator region and, when bound, prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes of the lac operon. This protein remains attached to the operator region unless lactose is present in abundance. If lactose is present, it binds to the repressor protein detaching it from the operator region, allowing the RNA polymerase to proceed and initiate transcription of the lac operon genes.<br><br>The <strong>catabolite activator protein</strong> (CAP) binds to DNA at a slightly higher location than the lac operon promoter region. It positively regulates the lac operon, increasing the gene expression of the lac operon structural genes. The CAP protein only binds to the DNA when the high cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration. Glucose inhibits cAMP production and thus, by surrogate effect, diminishes transcription of the lac operon. On the other hand, if glucose concentration is low, then cAMP production increases, allowing the CAP to bind to its region in the DNA and increasing the gene expression of the lac operon structural genes. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/7MkVqW0pRDiWUpeyPJVFgiQdSSSjLAah/_.png\"></div><br>Several scenarios exist for understanding the transcription pattern of these genes:<br><br>1. &#160; &#160; &#160;<strong>Glucose high, lactose high</strong>: The repressor protein will not bind to the operator region because lactose is present, allowing the RNA polymerase to initiate gene transcription. However, because glucose is present, cAMP is low, and the CAP cannot bind to the DNA and positively increase gene transcription. Therefore, the structural genes are expressed at a low rate, producing the proteins in small amounts.<br><br>2. &#160; &#160; &#160;<strong>Glucose high, lactose low</strong>: In this case, minimal to no gene expression and protein production will occur because the repressor is bound to the operator region (since lactose is low), and therefore, RNA polymerase cannot initiate gene transcription.<br><br>3. &#160; &#160; &#160;<strong>Glucose low, lactose low</strong>: This case will amount to minimal gene expression since the lactose is low, and the repressor protein is bound to the operator preventing the RNA Polymerase from gene transcription. <br><br>4. &#160; &#160; &#160;<strong>Glucose low, lactose high</strong>: here, the function of the lac operon is at its highest. Because of the presence of lactose, the repressor protein will be detached from the operator region, allowing RNA polymerase to function in gene transcription. Also, because of low glucose, cAMP levels in the cell increase, allowing CAP to bind and positively impact the gene transcription in the lac operon, increasing gene expression. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: B-galactosidase production in this setting will be minimal since lactose will prevent RNA polymerase from expressing the lacZ gene--the gene responsible for producing B-galactosidase. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: B-galactosidase production in this setting will be minimal because, without lactose, the repressor protein will prevent the RNA polymerase from expressing the lacZ gene. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: High glucose concentration decreases the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

      "solution": "<strong>Translation&#160;</strong>refers to the process of protein synthesis and occurs in the cytoplasm of all cells. Following transcription, <strong>mRNA or messenger RNA</strong>&#160; is produced. The four nucleotides found in mRNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), uracil (U), and cytosine (C). Each three-nucleotide sequence in mRNA comprises a codon, and each codon encodes for a specific amino acid, which serves as the building block for proteins.<br><br>Protein synthesis requires mRNA to serve as the coding sequence for amino acids in accordance with its codon sequence; <strong>tRNA or transfer RNA</strong> acts as a carrier of amino acids and brings them to the ribosomes for translation.<br><br>Ribosomes serve as the site of protein synthesis in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, the ribosomes are designated as 70S, while in eukaryotes it is larger and designated as 80S. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the ribosomes have two distinct subunits. In prokaryotes, the smaller subunit is designated as 30S and the larger subunit is designated as 50S. While in eukaryotes, the smaller subunit is designated as 40S and the larger subunit is designated as 60S. <br><br>The process of translation begins once mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches to a ribosome. The first step is called <strong>initiation</strong>, where ribosomes attach to mRNA. In order to determine where to start translation, a specific sequence in the <strong>5' untranslated region (5&#8217; UTR)</strong> is identified downstream from the start codon. The start codon specifically implies where the translation will start and is made of <strong>AUG</strong>, which encodes for <strong>methionine</strong>. <br><br>The process of initiation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes requires ribosomes, initiation factors (IF), mRNA, and methionyl tRNA. First, IF binds to the small ribosomal subunit. Then this complex allows for the binding of mRNA with the aid of the 5&#8217; UTR (e.g. 5&#8217; cap in eukaryotes) and the initiator tRNA. After this step, the larger ribosomal subunit joins the complex and forms a complete ribosome that is ready for translation with mRNA and initiator tRNA attached to it. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/9jo89teSQhSAcQvxXcb2Pn7BQpeNzrGZ/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Translation begins at a specific codon sequence that encodes for methionine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ribosomes are the same in prokaryotes and eukaryotes:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although the ribosomes are similar in structure in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, there are a few differences.
