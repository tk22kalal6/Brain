Defects in this enzyme lead to the accumulation of<strong>&#160;porphyrins</strong>, which can react with ultraviolet light and cause tissue damage.<br><br>PCT can be either familial or sporadic. The sporadic form is more common and usually due to <strong>hepatitis C infection</strong>. Symptoms can be triggered by factors such as sunlight exposure, smoking, and alcohol consumption. PCT is characterized by <strong>blistering skin lesions</strong> that appear most commonly on the backs of the hands. Furthermore, some patients may develop <strong>hypertrichosis</strong> and <strong>hyperpigmentation</strong>.

      "solution": "This patient has <strong>type I familial hyperlipidemia</strong>, which is most often due to a defect in<strong>&#160;lipoprotein lipase</strong>. Lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme that <strong>b</strong><strong>reaks down triglycerides&#160;</strong>into fatty acids and glycerol. The condition presents with <strong>pancreatitis&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;eruptive xanthomas.</strong>&#160; <br><br>After a meal, fats are taken up by intestinal cells, packaged into <strong>chylomicrons</strong>, and released into the bloodstream. Capillary lipoprotein lipase breaks down chylomicrons in order to free the triglycerides, which are absorbed by nearby tissues. &#160;<br><br>Chylomicron remnants, which contain cholesterol and small amounts of triglyceride, then travel to the liver to deposit the leftover lipids. The liver will combine these remnants with more, newly synthesized fatty acids and cholesterol, and it will package them together into<strong>&#160;very low-density lipoproteins&#160;</strong>(VLDLs). <strong>&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>VLDLs are released into the blood where lipoprotein lipase breaks them down again to release triglycerides for nearby tissues to use. As triglycerides leave the VLDL, it becomes an <strong>intermediate density lipoprotein</strong> (IDL) and eventually a<strong>&#160;low density lipoprotein</strong> (LDL). LDLs are ultimately endocytosed by liver and peripheral tissue cells expressing LDL receptors. &#160;<br><br>Without a functional lipoprotein lipase, the breakdown of chylomicrons and their triglyceride content is prevented, resulting in massive triglyceride accumulation within the blood with subsequent clinical consequences (e.g., recurrent pancreatitis, eruptive xanthomas). &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/hivVkYvpQ3OhY4Yi4kXAbbYLRiyyHrCJ/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/j9KqCNA2RIGdZg8_8Fk5Y-y2Rd6qnrU9/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Breakdown of triglycerides into fatty acids:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Uptake of lipoprotein remnants &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is involved in the uptake of lipoprotein remnants. An ApoE defect presents with premature atherosclerosis, xanthomas, and increased risk of developing acute coronary syndrome. Although this patient has xanthomas, it would be atypical for an ApoE defect to cause recurrent pancreatitis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Binding of low density lipoprotein to its receptors:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Apolipoprotein B-100 mediates the binding of low density lipoproteins (LDLs) to their receptors.

Defects in apolipoprotein A-I can lead to Tangier disease, which presents with cholesterol deposits in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymphatics.

      "solution": "This male infant presents with hypotonia and poor growth. Enzymatic testing reveals decreased activity of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). In combination, these findings are diagnostic of <strong>Lesch-Nyhan syndrome</strong>, which can be treated with medications such as allopurinol and febuxostat. &#160; <br><br>Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an <strong>X-linked recessive disorder</strong> caused by mutations in the HGPRT enzyme. Without HGPRT, patients are unable to recycle purines. Therefore, the purines undergo metabolism into uric acid, resulting in <strong>hyperuricemia</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Laboratory testing will demonstrate elevated <strong>serum and urinary uric acid levels</strong>. Some patients may have <strong>megaloblastic anemia</strong> despite normal serum B12 and folate level. A definitive diagnosis can be made via <strong>enzymatic testing&#160;</strong>of HGPRT or <strong>genetic testing</strong> for mutations in the <em>HPRT1&#160;</em>gene. &#160; <br><br>Treatment involves reducing uric acid levels with medications such as <strong>allopurinol&#160;</strong>or <strong>febuxostat</strong>. Both medications are <strong>xanthine oxidase inhibitors</strong> and decrease conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. &#160; &#160;<br><br>However, xanthine oxidase inhibitors do not prevent or treat neurodevelopmental and behavioral symptoms associated with the condition. Other interventions are needed to treat these symptoms. These include <strong>benzodiazepines&#160;</strong>and <strong>baclofen&#160;</strong>for pyramidal symptoms (e.g., spasticity), behavioral interventions (e.g., positive reinforcement), and aversive techniques (e.g., teeth guard) to prevent self-injuries. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Uridine monophosphate synthase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Hereditary orotic aciduria is an autosomal recessive condition caused by a deficiency in uridine monophosphate (UMP) synthase. The enzyme mediates the conversion of orotic acid to UMP, which is subsequently converted into the pyrimidine bases needed for DNA and RNA synthesis. Patients with hereditary orotic aciduria present with megaloblastic anemia as well as elevated serum and urinary orotic acid levels.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ornithine transcarbamylase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of proteins in the urea cycle. Although OTC deficiency results in elevated urinary orotic acid levels, these patients also have increased ammonia levels. Furthermore, patients with OTC deficiency do not typically have megaloblastic anemia.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ribonucleotide reductase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> In order for nucleobases to be used in DNA synthesis, the ribose sugars need to be of the deoxy form. This step of the biochemical process is carried out by ribonucleotide reductase. While ribonucleotide reductase deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia, it does not lead to increased urinary orotic acid levels.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Thymidylate synthase.:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Thymidylate synthase is responsible for converting deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). A deficiency in folate or vitamin B12 can lead to decreased thymidylate synthase activity and megaloblastic anemia. However, patients would not typically have elevated urinary orotic acid levels.</span></div>",
