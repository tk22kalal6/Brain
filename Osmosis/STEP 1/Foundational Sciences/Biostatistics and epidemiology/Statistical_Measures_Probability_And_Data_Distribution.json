      "solution": "<strong>Numerical data </strong>(also termed quantitative data) refers to data expressed as numbers. Numerical data can be categorized into either interval or ratio data. &#160; <br><br><strong>Interval data </strong>describes data wherein there is a meaningful quantitative difference between two values, and all the values can be placed in a clear, logical order. Common examples of interval data include the Centigrade scale, Fahrenheit scale, and height. &#160; <br><br>However, ratios cannot be calculated using interval data. For instance, stating that 90&#176;F is three times as hot as 30&#176;F (90 = 3*30) is inaccurate. This limitation exists since data must be measured on a scale that includes an absolute value for 0 in order to make relational statements involving multiplication or division. Temperature data, measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit, do not have a meaningful value for 0 since 0&#176;F or 0&#176;C does not imply that there is no temperature. &#160; <br><br><strong>Ratio data</strong>, on the other hand, is similar to interval data but the zero point is now meaningful. As a result, numerical relationships between numbers are also meaningful. Examples of ratio data include the Kelvin temperature scale, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Ratio data &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ordinal data &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Ordinal data describes categorical data that has an order, but the difference between values is not consistent or quantifiable.
