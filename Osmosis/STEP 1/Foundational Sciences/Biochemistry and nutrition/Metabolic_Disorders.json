This presentation is suggestive of a diagnosis of <strong>organic acidemia</strong>, specifically due to a <strong>deficiency of propionyl CoA carboxylase</strong>.<br><br>The breakdown of odd-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids (including valine, isoleucine and leucine) results in the formation of propionyl CoA. Propionyl CoA carboxylase converts propionyl CoA to methylmalonyl CoA using the <strong>cofactor biotin</strong>. Isomerization of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA is catalyzed by the cobalamin-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl mutase. The end product of this catabolic process results in the formation of succinyl CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle. Propionic acidemia is caused by the absence of the enzyme propionyl CoA carboxylase.

      "solution": "This patient is presenting with infantile cataracts and urine testing positive for reducing substances. These findings suggest a deficiency of the enzyme <strong>galactokinase</strong>, which helps convert<strong>&#160;galactose to galactose-1-phosphate. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br><strong>Galactokinase deficiency&#160;</strong>is inherited in an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> pattern. A deficiency in this enzyme causes galactose to instead be converted into galactitol by aldose reductase. Galactitol mainly accumulates in the lens of the eye and attracts water, which ultimately causes the lens fibers to swell and rupture. This process leads to the formation of <strong>infantile cataracts</strong>. Cataracts can present as a failure to <strong>track objects</strong> or develop a <strong>social smile</strong>, which is when one smiles after seeing another person&#8217;s smile. &#160;<br><br>Another similar but more severe condition is<strong>&#160;classic galactosemia,</strong> which is due to a deficiency of <strong>galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase.</strong> Classic galactosemia is also inherited in an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> pattern. Classic galactosemia typically presents in the first few days of life after initiation of galactose-containing human breast milk or cow's milk-based feedings. It leads to accumulation of not only galactitol, which causes cataracts, but also galactose-1-phosphate, which accumulates in the brain and liver. As a result, patients have additional signs of <strong>hypoglycemia&#160;</strong>(e.g., lethargy, hypotonia), <strong>hepatomegaly</strong>, jaundice, and <strong>intellectual disability.</strong> Patients with classic galactosemia are at increased risk of <strong>sepsis</strong>, particularly by Escheria coli infection. Furthermore, patients may have systemic symptoms such as lethargy and failure to thrive. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/4QEgTuv7QBybgpMZjCJOUNQiSpiEk-Hd/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Conversion of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Fructokinase converts fructose to fructose-1-phosphate.

This presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of <strong>organic acidemia</strong> caused by a <strong>propionyl CoA carboxylase deficiency</strong>.<br><br>The breakdown of odd-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids (including valine, isoleucine and leucine) results in the formation of propionyl CoA. Propionyl CoA carboxylase converts propionyl CoA to methylmalonyl CoA using the cofactor biotin. Isomerisation of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA is catalyzed by the cobalamin-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl mutase. The end product of this catabolic process results in the formation of succinyl CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle. Propionic acidemia is caused by the absence of the enzyme propionyl CoA carboxylase. As a result, propionic acid accumulates in the central nervous tissue, and excess propionic acid is excreted in urine.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/N7deer2DS72PumNGQHWSzy_mRkqULTCS/_.png\"></div><br><br>Symptoms are caused by accumulation of organic acids proximal to the metabolic block.

In the intestine, the disaccharide is broken down into galactose + glucose. After entering the cells, galactose is phosphorylated to <strong>galactose-1-phosphate</strong> by <strong>galactokinase</strong>. Galactose-1-phosphate is then converted to <strong>glucose-1-phosphate</strong> by the enzyme <strong>GALT</strong>. Glucose 1-phosphate can be converted to glucose 6-phosphate in order to enter the glycolysis or gluconeogenesis pathways. Alternatively, glucose 1-phosphate can be converted to UDP-glucose to undergo glycogenesis. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/v65d4gXxT42hh5zheVAnc5ZKSUihiyiy/_.png\"></div><br><br><strong>Classic galactosemia&#160;</strong>leads to the toxic accumulation of <strong>galactose 1-phosphate</strong> in the cells, leading to damage, for example, in the <strong>liver</strong>. It also results in the depletion of phosphate in the liver, which reduces its ability to perform <strong>gluconeogenesis&#160;</strong>and <strong>glycogenolysis</strong>. An additional problem derives from the excess galactose in the serum, which is converted to <strong>galactitol&#160;</strong>by the enzyme <strong>aldose reductase</strong>. The highly osmotic galactitol accumulates in the lens of the eyes, causing <strong>infantile cataracts</strong> (similar to sorbitol damage in diabetes).

Screening is mandatory in most parts of the United States, which allows early diagnosis and treatment; however, affected infants may become symptomatic before the screening results become available (approximately 10 to 14 days after sample collection), and thus, clinicians must consider the diagnosis in infants with characteristic signs and symptoms.

Manifestations include jaundice, cirrhosis, and vomiting similar to classic galactosemia.

This process is called the urea cycle and involves the condensation of bicarbonate and ammonia to form carbamoyl phosphate with the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. &#160;<strong>Ornithine carbamoylase</strong> (OTC) catalyses the addition of carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline to form ornithine.<br><br>OTC deficiency, an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder, is the <strong>most common urea cycle disorder&#160;</strong>and results in clinical manifestations of hyperammonemia including poor feeding, irritability, vomiting, somnolence, convulsions and cerebral edema. Most patients present typically as neonates in the <strong>first 24-48 hours of birth</strong> following their first feeds, as breast milk contains a high protein load. Laboratory investigations will reveal<strong>&#160;hyperammonemia</strong> and <strong>orotic aciduria</strong>, as a deficiency of OTC results in an accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate that stimulates pyrimidine synthesis and in turn <strong>orotic aciduria</strong>. Additional genetic sequencing may be required to confirm the enzyme defect.<br><br>&#160;Treatment in mild hyperammonemia involves initiation of a diet that <strong>restricts protein intake</strong> to lower serum ammonia levels and volume repletion.
