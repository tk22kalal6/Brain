      "solution": "Gastric juice contains a protein synthesized by <strong>parietal cells</strong> called <strong>intrinsic factor</strong>. This binds to vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, and is required for the eventual absorption of this vitamin more distally in the intestine in the terminal ileum. Intrinsic factor is specialized for its role by being <strong>relatively resistant to degradation by acid and proteolytic enzymes. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Following ingestion of vitamin B12, the stomach acid releases B12 from its food carrier proteins. The free vitamin B12 binds to haptocorrin (R proteins) secreted by salivary glands, which protects B12 from acid degradation. Eventually, the pancreatic proteases degrade R proteins in the duodenum, where <strong>B12 binds to the intrinsic factor</strong> (secreted by gastric parietal cells) to protect it from pancreatic enzymes. The intrinsic factor-B12 complex is resistant to degradation from pancreatic enzymes. Finally, this complex binds to a specific receptor located in the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining the <strong>terminal ileum</strong>, where <strong>vitamin B12 is absorbed. &#160;</strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Intrinsic factor &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pepsin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach and helps in protein digestion. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Bicarbonate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Bicarbonate is released by the mucosal cells (stomach, duodenum, salivary glands, pancreas) and Brunner glands (duodenum).

      "solution": "<strong>Vitamin B12</strong> (cobalamin) is absorbed in the <strong>terminal ileum</strong> along with bile salts, which requires an intrinsic factor. Iron is absorbed as ferrous Fe<sup>2+</sup> in the <strong>duodenum </strong>and <strong>folate </strong>is also absorbed in the <strong>small bowel</strong>, primarily in the duodenum and jejunum. It is important to note that parietal cells located in the stomach secrete the <strong>intrinsic factor</strong>, which is a protein that binds to vitamin B12. B12 must be attached to the intrinsic factor for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal ileum of the small bowel only recognize the B12-IF complex. Furthermore, the intrinsic factor protects vitamin B12 from catabolism by intestinal bacteria. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Stomach:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The stomach participates in virtually the digestive activities with the exception of ingestion and defecation.
