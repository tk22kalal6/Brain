      "solution": "Protein digestion and absorption is a complex process that takes place in the gastrointestinal tract to obtain the necessary amino acids needed by the body. The process of protein digestion starts in the <strong>stomach</strong>. In the stomach, <strong>hydrochloric acid</strong> weakens the peptide bonds. An enzyme called <strong>pepsinogen </strong>is produced by the <strong>chief cells</strong> in the stomach and is converted into the active form <strong>pepsin </strong>by the acidity of the stomach, which is then able to cleave peptide bonds yielding smaller peptides and amino acids. &#160; <br><br>After that, proteins reach the small intestine, where the majority of protein digestion and absorption occurs. In the small intestine, pancreatic proteolytic enzymes are secreted as <strong>zymogens</strong>, which are inactive to protect the pancreas. Once these zymogens reach the small intestine, brush border <strong>enterokinase </strong>cleaves <strong>trypsinogen into trypsin</strong>. Then trypsin cleaves other zymogens to their active form including <strong>chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, and elastase</strong>. Also, trypsin cleaves additional trypsinogen into trypsin. All these proteolytic enzymes cleave proteins into<strong> free amino acids, dipeptides</strong>, and <strong>tripeptides</strong>; in these forms, they are able to be absorbed by enterocytes. Once in the enterocytes, di- and tripeptides are cleaved by proteolytic enzymes inside the enterocytes into free amino acids, which are then transported to the blood. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The majority of the protein digestion takes place in the stomach &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although protein digestion begins in the stomach, it accounts only for small amounts of protein digestion.

In the mitochondria, ammonia is converted to <strong>carbamoyl phosphate</strong>, which in turn, reacts with ornithine to generate citrulline. Citrulline, in turn, reacts in the cytosol with aspartate, produced by the deamination of glutarate, to yield sequentially arginine succinate then arginine itself. The enzyme arginase then dehydrates arginine to yield urea and ornithine, which returns to the mitochondria and can re-enter the cycle to generate additional urea. The net reaction is the combination of two molecules of ammonia with one of carbon dioxide, yielding urea and water. &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Exj7oxrpQgSXeAk13WUqnjVeSP2iH_Ta/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ NH3 + carbon dioxide &#8594; carbamoyl phosphate &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Alpha-ketoglutarate + NH3 &#8594; glutamate &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This reaction is not a part of the urea cycle. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Citrulline + aspartate &#8594; argininosuccinate &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This reaction occurs in the cytoplasm. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Argininosuccinate &#8594; arginine + fumarate &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This reaction occurs in the cytoplasm. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Arginine &#8594; urea + ornithine &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This reaction occurs in the cytoplasm. &#160;</span></div>",
