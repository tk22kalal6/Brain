Among the answer choices, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is the most likely cause of this patient&#8217;s symptoms, especially since it is the most common organism causing community-acquired pneumonia. &#160; <br><br>The bacterial <strong>capsule</strong> is a polysaccharide layer that lies outside of the cell. Examples of encapsulated bacteria include <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae </em>type b<em>, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, </em>and <em>Klebsiella</em>. The capsule acts as a shield that <strong>protects against phagocytosis</strong> and helps bacteria <strong>adhere to surfaces</strong>. The capsule is considered an important <strong>virulence factor</strong> since bacterial strains lacking the capsule are generally less virulent. &#160; <br><br>Antibodies and complements can bind to the capsules of invading bacteria and target them for destruction by the <strong>spleen</strong>. Hence, individuals with asplenia are at higher risk of infections by encapsulated bacteria. &#160; <br><br>The capsule can also be isolated, conjugated to a protein, and serve as a potent antigen used in vaccinations. Examples of vaccinations using conjugated capsules include the <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b and pneumococcal (e.g. PCV13) vaccines. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Escherichia coli &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> This patient likely has pneumonia.
