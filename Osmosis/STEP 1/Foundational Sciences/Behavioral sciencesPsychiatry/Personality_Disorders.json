Importantly, this avoidance is not because social interaction causes them anxiety or because they think there are possible threats; rather, it is a pure lack of interest. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder may also find physical contact in all forms to be less pleasurable, from sexual activity to holding hands, leading these individuals to be far less motivated to seek out physical relationships with others. In addition, they might also have a <strong>flat affect</strong> and <strong>emotional blunting</strong>, with apparent indifference to praise or criticism. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/RsQxpGERRI6_8ksqFO0FAh1lTpiYRPdt/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Schizoid personality disorder:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Avoidant personality disorder:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>In contrast to schizoid personality disorder, individuals with avoidant personality disorder desire relationships with others but tend to avoid them due to feelings of inadequacy and hypersensitivity to rejection and criticism.

The patient states that she knew her partner was having sexual thoughts about the woman from the grocery store, prompting her decision to cut her own wrist in an attempt to end her life. Past medical history is significant for a similar emergency department visit a few months ago when she was struggling with online dating. She does not drink alcohol or use illicit substances. During the interview, she is teary-eyed and apologizes for &#8220;making a scene.&#8221; She expresses gratitude to the physician for her care, and she expresses regret for her actions. The patient states that she always struggles with her romantic relationships though she deeply desires them. After a complete physical examination and appropriate wound care for the laceration, the physician tells the patient that she will have to stay in the psychiatric emergency department for the night, which makes her furious, resulting in verbal assault of the physician and the nurses by the patient. Which of the following answer choices best characterizes the pattern of behavior exhibited by this patient? &#160;",
