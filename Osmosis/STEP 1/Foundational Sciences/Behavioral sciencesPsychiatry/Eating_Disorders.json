      "solution": "This patient is having ice cravings and is repeatedly eating ice, suggesting a diagnosis of <strong>pica</strong>. Pica is defined as eating non-nutritive, non-food substances, which can include mud, ice, paper, or charcoal. For the diagnosis of pica to be made, this behavior must persist for <strong>at least 1 month</strong> and should not be socially or culturally acceptable behavior. Additionally, pica is not diagnosed in children less than the age of 2 years, as eating non-nutritive substances is part of normal pediatric development &#8211; it is common and not considered pathological. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/7B52ELMES7uDU63-z5LkHVAeT2eB8nVU/_.png\"></div><br><br>The etiology of pica is not completely understood, however, certain patients are at increased risk of developing the condition. For instance, it is seen more in children and <strong>pregnant women</strong>. Additionally, <strong>iron deficiency</strong> has also been implicated in patients with pica, especially for ice. Other nutritional deficiencies like zinc deficiency can also cause pica. Finally, other risk factors include stress and underlying mental illness. &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/P0pix5WiRPmaUVnGCcQbNvBpT5eRrQlu/_.png\"></div><br><br>The evaluation and treatment of pica can be different. First of all, <strong>iron studies</strong> must be done to check for iron deficiency anemia, and if found, supplementation with iron supplements is usually enough for the treatment. Other nutritional deficiencies must be tested (e.g. zinc) and treated accordingly. In patients with no nutritional deficiencies, <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/7-Qp-dThSbm_m1XDgdJ61hdkQhmF-kwo/_.png\"></div>&#160;is a strategy that can be used for treatment, where patients are taught to redirect the undesired behavior into other activities, such as substituting a healthier food alternative to satisfy cravings. <br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Iron deficiency anemia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Air fluid levels on abdominal radiography:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Certain patients with pica may develop an obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract due to swallowing abnormal things (e.g. hair).

This clinical presentation is most likely due to <strong>refeeding syndrome. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Refeeding syndrome is a potentially fatal condition that results from the rapid shift of fluids and electrolytes after the introduction of feeding in severely malnourished people (e.g. anorexia nervosa). During starvation, several intracellular electrolytes become depleted, but the serum levels of these electrolytes usually remain at normal levels because these are mainly intracellular electrolytes; these electrolytes include potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and thiamine. After the reintroduction of food containing carbohydrates,<strong>&#160;insulin secretion is stimulated;</strong> this <strong>increase in serum insulin is the major driver of refeeding syndrome</strong>. Insulin stimulates the intracellular uptake of phosphorus to be used in the synthesis of ATP and, in addition, stimulates the uptake of potassium and magnesium. This rapid shift for the use of these electrolytes results in massive depletion of them in the intracellular and extracellular compartments, leading to <strong>hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.</strong> These electrolyte imbalances are very dangerous and can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In addition, the rapid use of already-depleted thiamine can result in severe thiamine deficiency, causing Wernicke encephalopathy characterized by the triad of encephalopathy, ataxia, and nystagmus. &#160; <br><br>Lastly, consumption of carbohydrates can lead to increased sodium and water retention, which is usually combined with fluid replacement to maintain urine output.

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by low body weight, a distorted body image, and an intense fear of gaining weight accompanied by aggressive weight-loss behaviors (e.g., calorie restriction, excessive exercising). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Anorexia nervosa is associated with multiple complications in almost every organ in the body due to malnutrition and weight loss. Because of the calorie restriction and starvation, protein and fat catabolism results in atrophy in the brain, heart, intestines, muscles, and kidneys. In addition,<strong>&#160;hormonal disturbances</strong> are common in patients with anorexia. Due to severe malnutrition, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is often disturbed in both males and females. Patients with anorexia have <strong>decreased GnRH release</strong>, leading to <strong>decreased LH and FSH,</strong> which subsequently decreases <strong>estrogen and testosterone.</strong> This hormonal disturbance leads to infertility, decreased sexual function, and <strong>amenorrhea</strong> in females. Amenorrhea in females with anorexia nervosa is one of the most common manifestations of the condition. &#160; <br><br>In addition, patients tend to have high cortisol and an elevated growth hormone (GH), while insulin-like growth factor-1 is low, indicating GH resistance.

      "solution": "This patient most likely has <strong>bulimia nervosa.</strong> Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by <strong>binge-eating episodes followed by compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain.</strong> During binge-eating episodes, patients lose control of overeating and consume a larger than average amount of food. These episodes are then followed by feelings of guilt and compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain; these behaviors include <strong>purging (inducing vomiting),</strong> use of <strong>laxatives, diuretics, extreme exercises,&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;prolonged fasting. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>Clinical features of bulimia nervosa include dental complications, especially in those who induce vomiting. The chronic exposure of teeth to gastric acids can result in <strong>enamel erosion&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;dental caries.</strong> Additionally, &#160;a nearly pathognomonic dermatologic complication is <strong>calluses on the dorsum of the hand&#160;</strong>(Russell sign), due to pressure of the teeth against the skin while stimulating the gag reflex to induce vomiting. For a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa, these episodes must occur <strong>at least once per week,&#160;</strong>for<strong>&#160;at least 3 months. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>The difference between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa binge-eating/purging subtype is body weight; patients with <strong>anorexia have low body weight (BMI &lt;18.5)</strong>, while patients with <strong>bulimia nervosa have a normal weight and are sometimes overweight. &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>It is important to consider an eating disorder such as bulimia nervosa in any patient presenting with a characteristic history and physical exam, such as this patient &#8211; <strong>regardless of gender.&#160;</strong>While eating disorders are more common in women, girls, and transgender individuals, men and boys are still subsceptible to these potentially fatal conditions and are often underdiagnosed. It is therefore important to avoid stereotyping when formulating a differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with disordered eating behaviors. &#160; <br><br>The treatment of bulimia nervosa is aimed towards decreasing binge-eating and purging behaviors. Fluoxetine is a<strong>&#160;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</strong> (SSRI) that has been shown to have great efficacy in patients with bulimia; it is considered a first-line treatment as it is associated with decreased binge-eating and purging episodes.

It is characterized by <strong>episodes of binge eating where the patient cannot control themself</strong> and often consumes larger than needed amounts of food. These episodes are then followed by feelings of regret and shame; however, unlike bulimia nervosa, patients with binge eating disorder <strong>do not engage in compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain&#160;</strong>(e.g., purging, laxative use). Frequently, because these patients feel ashamed of their eating behaviors, they may avoid eating with others and prefer eating alone. These episodes must occur at least <strong>once per week for 3 months</strong> for the diagnosis to be made. &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/tXRQAGOLSY_DcWWt26ZQqtKfTPeGrqeJ/_.png\"></div><br>Patients with binge eating disorder are usually overweight, but they can be a normal weight.

AN is characterized by the extreme overvaluation of body shape and weight, with intense fear to gain weight. Patients with anorexia nervosa have <strong>low body weight</strong> which is defined by a body mass index (BMI) below 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (or in younger children, body weight below the 5th percentile for age). This patient&#8217;s calculated BMI is 18.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Despite their low BMI, these patients have a distorted self-image and are consistently trying to lose more weight or maintain a low body weight. To that end, patients with the <strong>restricting subtype</strong> may engage in a restrictive pattern of eating wherein they avoid calorie-rich food and engage in intense calorie counting or portion eating. In the<strong>&#160;purging subtype</strong>, patients compensate for eating by purging (i.e. inducing vomiting) or using laxatives or diuretics. In addition, patients with anorexia may exercise aggressively to lose additional calories. &#160; <br><br>The diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa involves &#160;<ul><li>&#160;Distorted self-image &#160;</li><li>&#160;Low body weight (i.e &lt;18.5 BMI or less than 5th percentile of weight for age) &#160;</li><li>&#160;Excessive attempts to lose weight (restriction of calories, purging)&#160;</li></ul>&#160; Without treatment, anorexia nervosa can have an all-cause mortality rate of up to 14 times that of the general population, with 60 percent of deaths in patients with AN attributable to medical complications from the disorder (e.g. cardiovascular). It is therefore critically important to recognize and treat AN as early as possible. The core of the treatment of anorexia nervosa is <strong>nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy</strong>. Some patients who are suicidal or have medical complications (e.g. severe electrolyte disturbances) may need hospitalization. Although medical treatment for weight gain is not indicated initially, patients who are acutely ill and do not respond to first-line treatment may be given olanzapine to stimulate weight gain. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/1B-tYzQjQr2Rs2mnJZ8B_zW2SkeMLUvB/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Anorexia nervosa&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Bulimia nervosa:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although patients with bulimia nervosa might show signs of purging (e.g., dental caries, calluses on the hands) as seen in this patient, patients with bulimia nervosa have a normal body mass index, unlike this patient, who has a calculated BMI of 18.1 kg/m<span>2</span>. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Normal adolescent behavior:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient has low body weight and a distorted body image, and she shows signs of purging behavior (e.g., dental caries, calluses on the hands).

Given her normal body weight and history of binging and purging behaviors, she most likely has <strong>bulimia nervosa.&#160;</strong>Therefore, the most likely cause of her hematemesis is <strong>Mallory-Weiss syndrome</strong>, which is a complication of repeated induced vomiting in patients with bulimia nervosa. &#160; <br><br>Patients with bulimia nervosa can develop multiple complications. Because of repeated vomiting, patients can develop <strong>sialadenosis</strong> which manifests as bilateral swelling of the parotid glands. Due to chronic exposure of the teeth to gastric acids, patients may also develop <strong>enamel erosions, dental caries, and halitosis.&#160;</strong>In the case of manual induction of emesis, <strong>calluses</strong> may appear on the knuckles of the hands due to repeated friction with the teeth. Finally, repeated forceful emesis can sometimes lead to <strong>tears in the lower esophagus,</strong> causing hematemesis and chest pain; this complication is known as <strong>Mallory-Weiss syndrome. &#160;</strong><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/PgFeeP5sQWWDMR1moqxLM8MGQd_qswMv/_.png\"></div><br><br>Furthermore, patients with bulimia nervosa can have multiple electrolytes abnormalities. Dehydration is often seen and can lead to <strong>metabolic alkalosis</strong>, which is worsened by repeated vomiting. Also, repeated vomiting causes loss of potassium and chloride, leading to <strong>hypokalemia</strong>&#160;<strong>and hypochloremia.</strong> Hypokalemia in particular is worrisome because it can lead to multiple complications including muscle weakness and fatal arrhythmias (e.g. ventricular tachycardia). &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/CroSBKguR_qvxy5i_7pSgSH1QnuGmBBH/_.png\"></div><br>Other complications of bulimia nervosa include hormonal irregularities, which develop secondary to suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release due to calorie restrictions and extreme exercising.
