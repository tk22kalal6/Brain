The patient&#8217;s partner states that the previous night the patient was acting &#8220;normal.&#8221; However, the patient&#8217;s partner says that this morning they found the patient sitting on the toilet and that the patient couldn&#8217;t remember their own name or where they were, so the partner called emergency services. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia for which they take amlodipine and tamsulosin. The patient drinks one to two glasses of wine at night. Temperature is 37.7&#176;C (99.9&#176;F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 22/min, blood pressure is 131/70 mmHg, and O<sub>2</sub> saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is currently oriented to self but not to place or year. The patient is asked to spell the word &#8220;world&#8221; backwards, but they are unable to do so. The patient is able to follow simple one-step commands, moves all extremities appropriately, and ambulates without difficulty. The patient&#8217;s abdomen is soft and mildly distended. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. Further diagnostic testing is most likely to demonstrate which of the following findings?&#160;",

Some individuals may benefit from treatment with stimulants like <strong>dextroamphetamine</strong> or <strong>modafinil&#160;</strong>to prevent daytime sleepiness. <strong>Sodium oxybate</strong>, also known as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), can be used at nighttime to improve sleep quality. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Lateral hypothalamus &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Suprachiasmatic nucleus &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The suprachiasmatic nucleus is involved in regulating the circadian rhythm.
