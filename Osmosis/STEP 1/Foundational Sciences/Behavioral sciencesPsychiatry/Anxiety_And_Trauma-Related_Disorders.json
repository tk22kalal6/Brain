The patient tells the physician that whenever she sees a trash can, she thinks that she has lost money in it, and she has to go check through it for her money. She adds that although she knows these thoughts are not logical, she cannot stop thinking about it and always has to go thoroughly check the trash cans, sometimes multiple times over. Over the past year, she has had a few distressing moments in which she was caught looking through the trash cans while visiting her friends&#8217; homes, and she has twice been asked to leave.

These thoughts can control the patient and are bothersome and disabling for them, provoking anxiety and leading to marked distress. Although patients recognize that they are illogical, they cannot stop these thoughts; for this reason, OCD is characterized as <strong>ego-dystonic</strong>. Common examples of intrusive thoughts include constant fear of germs and infection, fear of forgetting to do something, or fear of hurting someone or themselves.<br><br><strong>Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the patients tend to do over and over in order to either eliminate or reduce the anxiety from the frightening thoughts</strong>. These compulsions are often illogical or excessive. Common behaviors include repeated washing of hands, repeated checking or counting, excessive cleaning, or meticulously arranging things in order.<br><br>The DSM-V criteria for the diagnosis of OCD are:<br>&#160; &#160;<ol><li>&#160;Recurrent obsessions, compulsions, or both&#160;</li><li>&#160;The obsessions are time consuming or cause significant distress or impairment of functioning.&#160;</li><li>&#160;The symptoms are not due to another medical condition or substance use.&#160;</li><li>&#160;The symptoms are not better explained by another psychiatric condition.&#160;</li></ol>Patients with OCD also often have other coexisting psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety disorders. Also, patients with a previous history of trauma or physical, sexual or emotional abuse, particularly in childhood, are more likely to develop OCD.<br><br>Management of OCD includes cognitive behavioral therapy, medical treatment, or both. Patients with mild to moderate disease can be given either option; however, it is better to use a combination of the two in patients with severe disease. <strong>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</strong> (SSRIs) are considered first-line treatment for OCD because of their great efficacy and minimal side effects. Cognitive-behavioral therapy in the form of <strong>exposure and response</strong> therapy is also first-line in the management of OCD.<br><br>P.S.

In addition, the diagnosis cannot be made if the criteria for another mental disorder are met.

The most likely diagnosis is <strong>agoraphobia</strong>.<br><br>Agoraphobia is defined as the fear of public or crowded places from which the patient may find it difficult to escape. Patients who have had panic attacks related to this fear might also worry about having subsequent panic attacks or panic-like symptoms in these areas. This worry leads to an avoidance of public places or, in severe cases, an avoidance of leaving the house entirely.<br><br>The DSM-5 criteria for agoraphobia include intense fear of at least 2 of the following 5 situations:<br>&#160;<ol><li>&#160;Using public transportation&#160;</li><li>&#160;Being in open spaces&#160;</li><li>&#160;Being in enclosed spaces&#160;</li><li>&#160;Standing in line or being in a crowd&#160;</li><li>&#160;Being outside the home alone&#160;</li></ol>These fears must persist for at least <strong>6 months</strong> and must lead to significant distress to the patient. The symptoms also must cause some level of impairment in the patient&#8217;s life, which usually manifests in the methods that a patient may employ to avoid these places or situations.<br><br>Panic disorder is very similar to agoraphobia and the differentiation between these two diagnoses may be challenging. Patients with both disorders experience panic attacks, and they may avoid activities due to fear of subsequent panic attacks. However, to make the diagnosis of panic disorder, the panic attacks must not have a specific, identifiable trigger, whereas with agoraphobia, the panic is consistently related to the triggering public situations.<br><br>Treatment of agoraphobia is similar to panic disorder, namely a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Medication options include <strong>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</strong> (SSRIs) or selective <strong>norepinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitors</strong> (SNRIs). Benzodiazepines can be used to acutely manage panic attacks in agoraphobia, but they are not the preferred long-term option due to the risk of dependence. <strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</strong> is also recommended in patients with agoraphobia and has been shown to be of great efficacy.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/OnZeq5eGQxW52WYQD7Z5eqi6SdCedp4n/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Agoraphobia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Social anxiety disorder &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Social anxiety disorder presents with fear and anxiety related to social events where the patient feels they may be humiliated or negatively judged.

The most likely diagnosis is <strong>social anxiety disorder</strong>.<br><br><strong>Social anxiety disorder</strong> is characterized by excessive worry and anxiety about being embarrassed or judged when engaging in social activities. It is one of the most common anxiety disorders, and it is more commonly diagnosed in <strong>females</strong> than males. The fear and anxiety in social anxiety disorder is only seen in relation to social events, where the patient feels that they could be exposed to negative judgment by others. This anxiety often leads to some degree of impairment in the patient&#8217;s life (e.g., avoidance of social events, turning down opportunities).<br><br>The DSM-V diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder is as follows:<br><br><ol><li>&#160;Excessive fear or worry about one or more social situations where the patient could be exposed to scrutiny or <strong>negative judgment</strong> by others. &#160;</li><li>&#160;The social events <strong>provoke excessive worry and anxiety</strong>. &#160;</li><li>&#160;The anxiety is <strong>out of proportion</strong> to the real threat posed by the social situation. &#160;</li><li>&#160;The social situations are either endured with intense fear and worry, or they are avoided completely. &#160;</li><li>&#160;Duration for <strong>&#8805; 6 months</strong> &#160;</li><li>&#160;The presentation is not better explained by substance use or another mental or physical disorder.&#160;</li></ol>The treatment for social anxiety disorder includes both medication and psychotherapy. &#160;The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sertraline and paroxetine and the selective norepinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine are all very effective and can be used as first-line treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also effective. Although medical treatment can demonstrate faster effects, CBT has been shown to be more effective in managing social anxiety in the long term.<br><br>The performance subtype of social anxiety is specific to situations where the patient has to present or perform in front of others. The patient&#8217;s fear of being embarrassed or judged is limited to these instances of performance, while other social situations are tolerated as normal. The performance subtype can be managed with as-needed beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) or benzodiazepines.

OCD is very similar to another related condition known as <strong>obsessive-compulsive personality disorder</strong> (OCPD). Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a <u>personality</u> disorder characterized by an obsession with orderliness, perfectionism, rigidity, and control, often at the expense of interpersonal relationships. The two disorders are closely related, and co-occurrence is common.<br><br>There are several key features which distinguish OCD from its related personality disorder. First, OCD is characterized by the classic pattern of intrusive, obsessive thoughts plus recurrent compulsions, while OCPD tends to be a more general focus on perfectionism. However, the major difference between a diagnosis of OCD and a diagnosis of OCPD is the way in which the patient views their obsessions and compulsions. In OCD, the symptoms are <strong>ego-dystonic</strong>, meaning the patients are aware of the illogical nature of the intrusive thoughts and behaviors, and they wish they would stop, which leads to significant anxiety and distress.

A panic attack is defined as an abrupt <strong>intense fear</strong> or <strong>discomfort</strong> that develops suddenly and peaks within minutes. It is associated with a set of physical symptoms. The medical management of an acute panic attack involves the use of <strong>benzodiazepines</strong>. Since these drugs are very rapid in relieving anxiety in patients with a panic attack, they are useful in the acute setting to help alleviate the intense physical and psychological symptoms.<br><br>The symptoms of a panic attack are divided into physical symptoms, thoughts, and ideas. The physical symptoms of a panic attack are: &#160;<ul><li>&#160;Palpitations or increased heart rate&#160;</li><li>&#160;Chest pain or discomfort&#160;</li><li>&#160;Shortness of breath&#160;</li><li>&#160;Nausea&#160;</li><li>&#160;Sweating&#160;</li><li>&#160;Trembling or shaking&#160;</li><li>&#160;Lightheadedness or fainting&#160;</li><li>&#160;Numbness or paresthesias&#160;</li><li>&#160;Chills&#160;</li></ul>While the thoughts or ideas include:&#160;<ul><li>&#160;Intense fear of dying&#160;</li><li>&#160;Intense fear of losing control&#160;</li><li>&#160;Depersonalization or derealization&#160;</li><li>&#160;Feeling of choking&#160;</li></ul>In order to diagnose a patient with a panic attack, <strong>four</strong> out of these thirteen symptoms must be present, along with <strong>intense fear</strong>. Although panic attacks can happen suddenly and without any precipitating factors, like in panic disorder, panic attacks can also be triggered by substance use (e.g., cocaine, marijuana) or medical (e.g. hyperthyroidism) or psychological (e.g. social anxiety disorder) disorders.<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/_ccIHY_uQviJ2hj8TLs3GrIdQHOES5Hj/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Rapid onset of action:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Maintenance therapy for generalized anxiety:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be used to treat panic disorder.

BDD is characterized by a <strong>preoccupation with an imagined defect or appearance that is usually minimal or not even apparent to others</strong>. This preoccupation leads to significant distress and impairment of functioning. In addition, for the patient to meet the criteria for the diagnosis, they must engage in repetitive activities regarding the perceived defect such as <strong>repetitive mirror checking or covering up the perceived defect&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;be involved in mental acts such as frequently comparing their appearance to others</strong>. These activities are usually time-consuming, difficult to control, and cause significant distress. Some patients with BDD may acknowledge that their preoccupation is not rational but is out of their control, while others may have minimal or no insight about it. On average, these patients have more than one perceived defect.<br><br>BDD most frequently starts in early adolescence and is more common in <strong>females</strong>. Additionally, it is more commonly seen in patients with a history of neglect or abuse in childhood.

GAD is the most common psychological diagnosis and is characterized by <strong>excessive, persistent, and unrealistic anxiety</strong>. This anxiety is present during most of the day and affects the patient&#8217;s daily activities. It is worth noting that this anxiety persists even though most patients with GAD do recognize that their anxiety is excessive and unnecessary at times, and patients report feeling that it is <strong>out of control</strong>.<br><br>In addition to the anxiety, patients with GAD also experience the physical symptoms of anxiety. These include <strong>decreased sleep</strong>, which may lead to <strong>fatigue</strong>. In addition, <strong>headache</strong> is one of the common manifestations, often due to associated <strong>muscle tension</strong>. Finally, patients may also experience <strong>irritability</strong>, <strong>inability to concentrate</strong>, and sometimes feel that they are constantly &#8220;on edge.&#8221;<br><br>The diagnosis of GAD requires anxiety to be present for <strong>most of the day for more than 6 months</strong>. In addition, the anxiety and associated problems must not be explained by another mental (e.g. social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder) or physical (e.g. hypothyroidism) disorder. Finally, patients must also have physical manifestations of stress; in adults, three of these manifestations are required to make the diagnosis, while in children, only one physical symptom is sufficient to reach the diagnosis of GAD.<br><br>Treatment of GAD typically involves a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medical management. Anxiety has been associated with <strong>decreased serotonin activity and increased noradrenergic activity</strong>.

Given the timeline of events, this patient currently meets diagnostic criteria for <strong>acute stress disorder. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Acute stress disorder, like PTD, develops following exposure to a traumatic experience or life-threatening event. Such events include sexual assault, near-death experiences, or violent conflicts. Acute stress disorder follows along the spectrum of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with the difference being the <strong>timeline of symptoms since the event</strong>. In acute stress disorder, symptoms occur between <strong>three days and up to one month after the traumatic event</strong>, while with PTSD, symptoms must be present for <strong>greater than one month</strong> after the event. <strong>Trauma-focused psychotherapy</strong> is the treatment of choice for patients with acute stress disorder. &#160; <br><br><strong>The DSM-V diagnostic criteria for acute stress disorder are:&#160;</strong><br><br>A. &#160;Exposure to a significant traumatic event. &#160;<br>B. Presence of at least 8 of the following symptoms (clustered into five categories): &#160;<ol><li>&#160;Intrusive symptoms: recurrent thoughts, dreams about the event, flashbacks, psychological or physical distress when reminded of the event.&#160;</li><li>&#160;Negative mood&#160;</li><li>&#160;Dissociative symptoms&#160;</li><li>&#160;Avoidance symptoms: avoidance of thoughts about the events or avoidance of reminders of the event.&#160;</li><li>&#160;Arousal symptoms: sleep problems, irritability, distractibility, hypervigilance, abnormal startle responses, and heightened reflexes to the environment. &#160; &#160;</li></ol>P.S.
