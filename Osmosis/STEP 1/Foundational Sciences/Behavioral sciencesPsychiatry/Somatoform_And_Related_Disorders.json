In addition, the physical examination is suspicious for <strong>recent hospitalizations</strong> and intravenous catheter placement. The willingness of this mother to have her daughter undergo a non-indicated and invasive medical procedure is highly questionable for <strong>factitious disorder imposed on another</strong>, also known as <strong>Munchausen syndrome by proxy</strong>. When this diagnosis is suspected, the first step involves immediate <strong>contact with child protective services</strong> for safety concerns. <br><br>Factitious disorder imposed on another refers to a psychiatric condition defined as a <strong>caregiver or parent intentionally faking or inducing symptoms in the patient</strong> for internal gain (e.g., sympathy, attention). This condition is more commonly found in females, healthcare workers, and patients with a history of physical or emotional trauma. Common presenting features include a patient that consistently presents with their caregiver with associated recurrent hospitalizations for a similar complaint, persistent symptoms after gaining attention, as well as an overeagerness for the patient to undergo invasive medical procedures. Often, the caregiver may cause real medical harm, such as via poisoning, administration of non-indicated medications, or intentional trauma.<br><br>In contrast to malingering, factitious disorder reflects self-induced or fake symptoms for internal gain and is produced unconsciously. Malingering, on the other hand, results from feigning or exaggeration of physical or psychological symptoms to achieve external gain, reflecting a conscious motivation for secondary gain. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Factitious disorder imposed on another &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Vulnerable child syndrome &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Vulnerable child syndrome refers to a caregiver or parent's extreme manifestation of persistent and unfounded expectations of medical vulnerability following a serious disease or life-threatening event for the child. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Somatic symptom disorder &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Somatic symptom disorder refers to a psychiatric condition that involves at least one unexplained physical symptom for greater than six months without a clear underlying pathophysiologic diagnosis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Conversion disorder &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Conversion disorder, also known as functional neurological symptom disorder, results when one or more neurological symptoms arise due to an underlying stressful event or an experience of emotional or physical trauma. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Malingering &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Malingering refers to a feigning or exaggeration of physical or psychological symptoms with the intent to achieve the desired outcome, reflecting a conscious motivation for secondary gain. &#160;</span></div>",

Common physical symptoms include vague neurologic complaints, back pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, or pelvic pain.

It is essential to acknowledge the validity of the patient&#8217;s symptom(s) while reinforcing that medical disease has been ruled out.
