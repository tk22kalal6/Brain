Her clinical presentation is most consistent with <strong>pyelonephritis</strong>, which will demonstrate a high white blood cell count and <strong>hyaline casts on urinalysis</strong>. Hyaline casts or white blood cell casts, while not always seen in the setting of pyelonephritis, are highly specific for pyelonephritis when compared to other forms of urinary tract infections. In addition, other forms of urinary tract infections, such as urethritis and cystitis, do not present with systemic symptoms like fever, nausea, or vomiting. &#160;<br><br>Pyelonephritis refers to an acute kidney infection, where neutrophils infiltrate the renal interstitium, causing inflammation in the cortex while relatively sparing the glomeruli and vasculature. The most common cause of pyelonephritis is an ascending <strong>bacterial infection,</strong> usually due to <strong><em>E. coli</em></strong>, but other common organisms include Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, or Enterococcus species. Hematogenous spread due to bacteremia is also causative but less common overall. Laboratory markers will typically demonstrate an <strong>elevated white blood cell</strong><strong>count</strong>, and urinalysis will typically demonstrate <strong>positive leukocyte esterase, positive nitrites</strong>, as well as possible <strong>white blood cell</strong> or <strong>hyaline casts.</strong> CT scans will often demonstrate striated parenchymal enhancement in the affected kidney. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ High white blood cell count and hyaline casts:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 4+ Proteinuria:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Significant proteinuria is more likely to occur in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, which presents in gestational women with hypertension, headache, and blurred vision.

      "solution": "&#160;This young male patient, who is presenting with <strong>penile discharge</strong> and <strong>dysuria&#160;</strong>in the setting of recent unprotected sexual intercourse, likely has <strong>urethritis</strong>. Of the laboratory abnormalities listed, urinalysis with positive leukocyte esterase and no bacteria is most likely consistent with<strong>&#160;sterile pyuria. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Urethritis refers to inflammation of the urethra. Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish from cystitis (bladder inflammation), since it presents with many similar symptoms including dysuria or discharge at the urethral meatus. However, urethritis can be differentiated clinically from pyelonephritis, based on absence of systemic features including fever, tachycardia, costovertebral angle tenderness, nausea, and vomiting. &#160;<br><br>Urethritis can be further differentiated from other urinary tract infections based on the causative organisms and laboratory findings. In general, the majority of urethral infections are caused by sexuallay transmitted organisms, such as <strong>Chlamydia trachomatis </strong>and <strong>Neisseria gonorrhoeae.</strong> A urinalysis will reveal sterile pyuria, which refers to positive leukocyte esterase without identifiable bacteria on microscopy. Confirmatory diagnosis relies on urethral swabs with subsequent <strong>nucleic acid amplification</strong> testing, in addition to possible Gram-staining for N. gonorrhoeae. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Positive leukocyte esterase with no bacteria:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Positive leukocyte esterase and positive nitrite:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Positive leukocyte esterase and positive nitrite are more consistent with cystitis or pyelonephritis, which are most often caused by Escherichia coli.
