      "solution": "This patient is presenting with the classic signs and symptoms of nephrolithiasis, including flank pain radiating to the groin, nausea and vomiting, hematuria, and inability to lay still. In the absence of underlying conditions or additional clues, it is reasonable to deduce that the patient&#8217;s symptoms are due to the <strong>most common</strong> type of renal stone, <strong>calcium oxalate stones</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Calcium oxalate stones account for 80% of all stones. <strong>Idiopathic hypercalciuria</strong> is the most common metabolic abnormality in patients with calcium kidney stones. Idiopathic hypercalciuria is characterized by normocalcemia and hypercalciuria that cannot be explained by another medical condition (e.g. hyperparathyroidism). Calcium oxalate stones are not pH-dependent, unlike other stone types. Additional risk factors for developing calcium oxalate stones are listed in the table below.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/m-n-TcdvQmibSt26omZ8N1crQnWnmGtl/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> These findings can be seen in patients with hereditary cystinuria, an autosomal recessive condition caused by a defect in the proximal convoluted tubule cystine-reabsorbing transporter. This defect also results in poor reabsorption of the amino acids ornithine, lysine, and arginine (COLA). Hexagonal-shaped cystine crystals can be found on urinalysis. Cystine stones account for approximately 1% of all stones. Patients often have a positive family history and present during childhood with recurrent kidney stones.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> These findings are consistent with ammonium magnesium phosphate (struvite) stones, which account for 15% of all stones. Struvite stones can be found in the setting of infection by urease-producing bacteria such as <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, and <em>Enterobacter</em>. Urease breaks urea into ammonia and alkalizes urine (high pH). This patient has no history of urinary tract infections.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>These findings are consistent with uric acid stones, which account for 5-10% of all stones. Dehydration, acidic urine, and increased uric acid levels, such as in the setting of myeloproliferative disorders, promote their formation. They can also form in the setting of chronic diarrhea, in which bicarbonate is lost via stool; the subsequent decrease in urine pH facilitates the formation of insoluble uric acid crystals. This patient has none of these conditions.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Calcium phosphate stones, which are associated with a high urinary pH (&gt;6.5), are the second most common type of kidney stone. In contrast, calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stone and the most likely diagnosis in this patient. These stones are associated with hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, and hypocitraturia.</span></div>",

He most likely has <strong>benign prostate hyperplasia.&#160;</strong>The patient is started on <strong>prazosin</strong>, which is an<strong>&#160;&#945;1-adrenergic receptor antagonist.&#160;</strong>This receptor is coupled with the Gq protein. &#160; <br><br>Alpha-adrenergic receptors, &#593;1, and &#593;2 receptors activate when stimulated by <strong>catecholamines&#160;</strong>(e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine). Together, they help to trigger the fight or flight response. &#593;1-receptors are mainly found in the body&#8217;s <strong>smooth muscles&#160;</strong>(in the blood vessels, bladder, and other hollow organs) and are stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system. This receptor is coupled with a Gq protein, bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) at rest. When an &#593;1-receptor binds a catecholamine, the receptor changes its shape and allows the Gq protein to release GDP and bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP) instead, thereby activating it.
