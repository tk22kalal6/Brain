It mainly occurs in <strong>children&#160;</strong>and presents with nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndrome or a combination of both. MPGN is divided into three types. Type II is a result of widespread <strong>activation of C3</strong>, which occurs due to the persistent activity of the enzyme C3 convertase. Its activity is upregulated by autoantibodies called <strong>C3 nephritic factors</strong>. Immunofluorescence shows <strong>granular deposits</strong> of C3 within (<strong>intramembranous</strong>) and <strong>along the GBM</strong>. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/_Aln4md8SneYjDeSi23HrxpmRb6hsKEr/_.png\"></div><br><strong>Type I</strong>, on the other hand, is mainly immune complex-mediated MPGN resulting from chronic antigenemia and is usually seen in chronic infections (hepatitis B or C infection) or autoimmune conditions.

In its inherited form, SAME is an autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by an inhibition or deficiency of <strong>11&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase&#160;</strong>in the collecting duct of the nephron. Normally, this enzyme converts cortisol to cortisone, a less potent hormone; therefore, a decrease in enzyme activity leads to increased levels of cortisol. Excess cortisol binds and over-activates mineralocorticoid receptors in the collecting duct of the kidneys, which mimics the effects of aldosterone. <br><br>Thus <strong>serum aldosterone levels are low</strong>, but the patient&#8217;s <strong>clinical presentation is consistent with hyperaldosteronism</strong>. This includes increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, leading to hypertension and hypokalemia. The kidneys will attempt to compensate for these changes by increasing the activity of the K+/H+ ATPase in the collecting duct. This will lead to increased hydrogen ion secretion and metabolic alkalosis. &#160;<br><br>One common cause of acquired SAME is chronic licorice consumption, because licorice contains glycyrrhetinic acid, which can inhibit 11&#946;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. &#160;Treatment for SAME includes normalizing potassium levels, identifying the underlying cause, discontinuing the offending agent, and regular monitoring of patient&#8217;s blood pressure. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/1H374cHmTgGp5hzzb5fktWkNSoyXplfb/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 17&#945;-hydroxylase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>17&#945;-hydroxylase deficiency is associated with a type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia with increased mineralocorticoids, decreased cortisol, and decreased sex hormones.

      "solution": "This 8-year-old boy presents with weight gain, pitting edema, and frothy urine in the setting of a recent infection. This presentation is most consistent with the <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong> due to <strong>minimal change disease</strong>. The condition leads to a decrease in intravascular plasma volume and in response, the body<strong>&#160;increases aldosterone and ADH secretion. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br><strong>Nephrotic syndrome</strong> is a spectrum of disease states characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema due to <strong>disruption of the glomerular filtration charge barrier</strong>. Disruption of the charge barrier formed by podocytes causes large proteins (e.g., albumin, antithrombin III) to be excreted via urine, resulting in decreased plasma oncotic pressure. As plasma oncotic pressure decreases, fluid moves from the intravascular space into the interstitial space, causing edema. Intravascular volume depletion activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to improve sodium and water retention. Moreover, due to decreased oncotic pressure, the liver attempts to compensate by increasing lipoprotein synthesis, resulting in <strong>hyperlipidemia.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/yzDYZAAhRSiRRc9-JKqYSsUNTUOywVrs/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Increased aldosterone and ADH secretion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased lipoprotein synthesis&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Increased lipoprotein synthesis, not decreased synthesis, is observed in patients with nephrotic syndrome. This phenomenon occurs as a compensatory mechanism due to the large losses of protein (primarily albumin) via urine.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased oncotic pressure&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient has frothy urine and pitting edema in the lower extremities, which raises concern for nephrotic syndrome. Oncotic pressure in nephrotic syndrome is decreased, not increased, due to excess proteinuria.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypercellular and inflamed glomeruli:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Nephritic syndromes are primarily driven by inflamed glomeruli. The inflammation can be due to disease states such as acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and Alport syndrome. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is on the differential for this patient. However, urine in patients with nephritic syndrome is typically tea-colored or cola-colored.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Poor cardiac ejection fraction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Poor cardiac ejection fraction may cause symptoms of edema, including pitting of the lower extremities and pleural effusions. However, this patient has no major risk factors or clinical stigmata for heart failure, myocarditis, or dilated cardiomyopathy.&#160;</span></div>",
