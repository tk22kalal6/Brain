      "solution": "This patient with growth retardation, polyuria, polydipsia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis most likely has <strong>Bartter syndrome</strong>. Bartter syndrome is an autosomal recessive renal tubular defect caused by a mutation in the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the <strong>thick ascending limb&#160;</strong><strong>of the loop of Henle</strong>. The loss of this cotransporter leads to excretion of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the urine, as well as excessive loss of extracellular water. The depletion of extracellular water then leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which prompts the excretion of hydrogen and more potassium, as well as the reabsorption of bicarbonate. Therefore, common laboratory findings in patients with Bartter syndrome include <strong>metabolic alkalosis</strong> and <strong>hypokalemia</strong>. Despite the loss of sodium through the urine, there is no hyponatremia, due to the concomitant loss of water. <br><br>The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is also responsible for calcium reabsorption via an electrochemical gradient created by the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride. As a result, patients with Bartter syndrome commonly present with <strong>hypercalciuria</strong>. Also, due to increased reabsorption of urate and general volume depletion, patients may also present with <strong>hyperuricemia&#160;</strong>with or without <strong>gout.&#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/C9emI08qQ7i6FvDJ9TPjN3hxTLyafdz7/_.png\"></div><br>It is also worth noting that loop diuretics act by blocking the same cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

Liddle syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a gain of function mutation that leads to increased activity of the<strong>&#160;epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the collecting duct</strong>, thereby increasing sodium reabsorption. Normally, ENaC activity is increased by aldosterone, so patients with Liddle syndrome have a clinically identical presentation to those with hyperaldosteronism (i.e. symptomatic hypertension and hypokalemia). However, in patients with Liddle syndrome, laboratory findings show characteristically low levels of aldosterone and renin. <br><br>As more sodium is reabsorbed and potassium is excreted, the patient will develop hypertension and hypokalemia. The kidneys will attempt to compensate for these changes by increasing the activity of the K+/H+ ATPase in the collecting duct, which increases hydrogen ion excretion and subsequently causes metabolic alkalosis. Treatment for Liddle syndrome includes a <strong>potassium-sparing diuretic</strong>, such as <strong>amiloride&#160;</strong>and <strong>triamterene</strong>, which will block ENaC. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/SBCerFk-Qjmlx_iZQk2W4lVSR3e1CYuA/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;&#160;Aldosterone&#160;&#160;Renin&#160;&#160;K+&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160;&#160;&#8595;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>These laboratory findings would be present in a patient with primary hyperaldosteronism, also known as Conn syndrome.

She most likely has<strong>&#160;diabetic glomerulonephropathy.</strong><br><br>Diabetic glomerulonephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. The condition presents with symptoms of nephrotic syndrome, including massive <strong>proteinuria&#160;</strong>(&gt;3.5 g/day), <strong>hypoalbuminemia</strong>, <strong>edema</strong>, and <strong>hyperlipidemia</strong>. Of note, the hyperlipidemic state is thought to be a method of compensating for the reduction in plasma oncotic pressure due to protein loss via urine. &#160; <br><br>The condition arises since hyperglycemia secondary to diabetes mellitus causes nonenzymatic glycation, which leads to mesangial expansion, basement membrane thickening, and podocyte damage. The increased permeability causes glomerular hyperfiltration, which eventually progresses to glomerular hypertrophy and scarring (glomerulosclerosis). &#160;<br><br>Biopsy will reveal <strong>eosinophilic nodular glomerulosclerosis</strong> (<strong>Kimmelstiel-Wilson</strong> lesions), which arise due to mesangial matrix expansion. These lesions are<strong>&#160;Periodic acid&#8211;Schiff (PAS)</strong> stain positive. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Light chain nephropathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Light chain nephropathy, which can be seen in patients with multiple myeloma, is a cause of nephrotic syndrome. It occurs when light chains precipitate with uromodulin (formerly termed Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein) and obstruct the renal tubular lumen. On light microscopy, these casts can be seen as amorphous material within the renal tubular lumen. However, light chain nephropathy would not manifest with the Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions seen on this patient&#8217;s biopsy.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in patients of Hispanic and African-American descent. It can be a primary condition or arise secondary to HIV, sickle cell disease, obesity, or interferon treatment. Biopsy results under light microscopy will show segmental sclerosis and hyalinosis. In other words, only part of the glomerulus is affected. However, the condition would not lead to the formation of Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions, which are seen on this patient&#8217;s biopsy.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis is a condition that often presents concurrently with both nephrotic and nephritic syndrome. It is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The condition can lead to nephrotic range proteinuria (i.e. &gt;3.5 g/day) and clinical features of nephritic syndrome (e.g., hematuria, RBC casts in the urine). A biopsy under light microscopy will show wire looping of capillaries. In contrast, this patient has neither hematuria nor wire looping.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Diabetic glomerulonephropathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Amyloidosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Amyloidosis is a cause of nephrotic syndrome. It is associated with systemic amyloidosis and chronic conditions that lead to amyloid deposition (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis). Kidney biopsy will reveal amyloid deposits, which present with an apple-green birefringence under polarized light following Congo red staining.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Membranous nephropathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Membranous nephropathy is a cause of nephrotic syndrome. Primary disease can be due to antibodies against phospholipase A2 receptors. Secondary disease can be due to drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, penicillamine), infections (e.g., HBV, HCV, syphilis), systemic lupus erythematosus, and solid tumors. Biopsy results under light microscopy will show diffuse capillary and glomerular basement membrane thickening. However, the condition would not manifest with the Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions seen on this patient&#8217;s biopsy.&#160;</span></div>",
