Abdominal radiography demonstrates calcification and ballooning of the abdominal aorta. These findings are concerning for a symptomatic <strong>abdominal aortic aneurysm</strong> with impending rupture. <br><br>The vast majority of aortic aneurysms are present in the <strong>infrarenal</strong> region and are clinically defined as dilating the aorta to greater than 50% of its normal diameter. Typically, this value is 3 cm, with large aneurysms defined as those greater than 5 cm. Known risk factors include male sex, older age, significant smoking history, uncontrolled hypertension, family history, and atherosclerotic disease. These aneurysms are due to chronic arterial wall inflammation, extracellular matrix degradation, and subsequent balloon dilation.<br><br>Clinically, most abdominal aortic aneurysms are <strong>silent</strong> and present with symptoms only at the time of rupture or impending rupture.

Peripheral artery disease, a type of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), is caused by insufficient tissue perfusion due to narrowing or occlusion of the aorta or one of the more distal branches supplying the limbs. Similar to coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, the development of an <strong>atherosclerotic plaque</strong> that narrows or completely occludes an artery is the number one cause of peripheral artery disease, and therefore these diseases often exist together. Risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and hyperlipidemia, raise the suspicion for peripheral artery disease. &#160;<br><br>The location of a patient&#8217;s pain can indicate where the occlusion is: &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ot6OYptVSsqc4yF13aBaLJlARyifnzgC/_.png\"></div><br><br>This patient&#8217;s thigh pain, without pain in the hips or buttocks, suggests there is an occlusion in the femoral artery.

These include decreased skin temperature (termed poikilothermia), decreased hair and nail growth, and loss of sensation.

Both of these features, in conjunction with a history of smoking and dull chest pain radiating to the back, are concerning features for a diagnosis of a <strong>thoracic aortic aneurysm&#160;</strong>(TAA). &#160;<br><br>TAAs are true aneurysms, meaning all three layers of the blood vessel - intima, media, and adventitia - are dilated <strong>&gt;50% greater of the normal diameter of the aorta</strong>. Other risk factors for thoracic aortic aneurysms include hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Significant genetic risk factors aside from Marfan syndrome include other inherited connective tissue disorders such as <strong>Loeys-Dietz</strong> and <strong>vascular type Ehlers-Danlos syndromes</strong>, large vessel inflammatory diseases such as <strong>giant cell arteritis&#160;</strong>and <strong>Takayasu's aortitis</strong>, as well as infections such as <strong>tertiary syphilis</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Most cases of TAAs are <strong>silent</strong>, meaning they do not produce symptoms until they are large enough to compress on adjacent structures.

The condition involves blood vessels of all sizes (small, medium, and large), including both the arterial and venous circulation. This condition has a high incidence among<strong>&#160;eastern Asia&#160;</strong>and <strong>Mediterranean</strong> countries.

Patients with aortic dissections classically present with sudden onset, sharp or<strong>&#160;tearing chest pain&#160;</strong>that <strong>radiates to the back</strong>, syncope, <strong>widened pulse pressure</strong>, and occasionally <strong>differing blood pressure</strong> in the upper extremities with associated<strong>&#160;neurologic deficits</strong>. &#160;<br><br>Aortic dissections are caused by prolonged hydrodynamic shear stress on the intima of the vessel, which eventually creates a tear in the intimal layer and a column of blood gains access into the aortic media. With repetitive hydrodynamic stress the column of blood longitudinally tears through the media either retrograde (towards the heart), anterograde (away from the heart), or both. Eventually, the hematoma compresses on adjacent structures depending on where the dissection travels. For example, it may compress the brachiocephalic trunk or carotid arteries causing a <strong>stroke</strong>, or if proximal it may compress the right coronary artery causing an <strong>inferior wall MI</strong>, as in this patient with changes consistent with an NSTEMI. The hematoma may progress into the pericardium, causing <strong>pericardial tamponade</strong>. &#160;<br><br>The most common risk factor aortic dissection is <strong>uncontrolled hypertension</strong>, likely precipitated by her chronic cocaine. Genetic risk factors include a history of connective tissue diseases likely <strong>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</strong> or <strong>Marfan syndrome</strong>, which predispose to an already weakened aorta from <strong>thoracic aortic aneurysms</strong>. Infectious or inflammatory risk factors include Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Beh&#231;et disease, and syphilis, which also weaken the aortic intima and predispose to intimal tearing. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/lB9uAJr9QtWbUsMVBfpQUjKRQ2SH8iKt/_.png\"></div><br><br>&#160;The diagnosis of aortic dissection is made by careful physical examination, history, in addition to imaging findings of a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray and a visible dissection flap on <strong>CT-angiography</strong> of the aorta.

      "solution": "<strong>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)&#160;</strong>should be considered in any older individual presenting with sudden onset abdominal, low back, or flank pain and a history of syncope with hypotension. &#160;Risk factors for AAA include significant age <strong>&gt;65 years, smoking, male gender, family history</strong> of AAA, and other risk factors for coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease including hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are <strong>true aneurysms</strong>, meaning all three layers of the blood vessel - the intima, media, and adventitia - are dilated. The pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysms is a complex, multifactorial process that involves alterations in the structure of the vascular wall due to inflammatory changes, abnormal collagen remodeling and cross-linking, as well as loss of elastin and smooth muscle cells. This ultimately results in progressive thinning and weakening of the aortic wall and enlargement of the aortic diameter to a dilation <strong>50% greater than the normal diameter</strong> of the aorta. &#160; <br><br>AAAs commonly occur at the <strong>infrarenal&#160;</strong>level, or below the level of the renal arteries. People with near rupture or rapid expansion of a AAA commonly present with sudden onset back, flank, or abdominal pain and associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, mimicking a myriad of other conditions. Other associated symptoms may include <strong>diminished peripheral pulses</strong> due to expansion of the aneurysm compressing the internal iliac arteries. Although a <strong>pulsatile abdominal mass</strong> is a classic presentation, it may not always be detectable, especially if the patient is obese, such as in this vignette. If left untreated, AAAs can rupture, leading to severe hypotension, hemodynamic instability, and death. In a case where rupture has not occurred, <strong>repair&#160;</strong>should be offered when the aneurysm is<strong>&#160;&gt;5 cm</strong>. <br><br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/nHMW_VVESfKJL3GyfeDFa6kESGu3DghW/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Renal colic:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Renal colic commonly causes flank pain radiating to the groin with associated nausea and vomiting; however, it rarely causes syncope.

      "solution": "This patient's presentation and ECG findings are consistent with <strong>acute myocardial infarction</strong>, which given the patient&#8217;s risk factors, is most likely due to <strong>atherosclerosis&#160;</strong>of the coronary arteries. &#160;<br><br>Atherosclerosis is a pathologic process that affects arteries throughout the body including the aorta, coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arteries. Atherosclerosis is the hardening of any artery (but usually <strong>medium-large</strong> arteries) which is caused by the buildup of plaques (termed &#8220;atheromas&#8221;). Atherosclerosis can begin as early as childhood with the development of fatty streaks and advances with aging. The current hypothesis of the pathogenesis is the <strong>response-to-injury model</strong>, which is as follows: &#160; <br><br><ul><li><strong>Endothelial cell injury</strong>, due to hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, homocysteine or diabetes, is the <strong>first step in pathogenesis</strong>. Injury to endothelial cells results in endothelial dysfunction, increased membrane permeability, leukocyte adhesion and thrombosis.&#160;</li><li>&#160;Lipoproteins, mainly oxidized LDL and cholesterol crystals, aggregate in the blood vessel wall.&#160;</li><li>&#160;Platelets (<strong>choice C</strong>) adhere to exposed collagen and are activated.&#160;</li><li>&#160;Monocytes (<strong>choice E</strong>) adhere to the endothelium, migrate into the intima, and differentiate into macrophages. Macrophages (<strong>choice A</strong>) engulf LDL, becoming foam cells (macrophages ingest LDL and become laden with lipids, which gives them a foamy appearance). The macrophages with engulfed lipids eventually undergo apoptosis (fatty streak) and release toxic oxidized LDL and inflammatory cytokines.&#160;</li><li>&#160;At the same time, growth factors and inflammatory cytokines released from the activated platelets, macrophages, and endothelial cells then recruit smooth muscle cells (<strong>choice B</strong>).&#160;</li><li>&#160;The growing smooth muscle secretes collagen, proteoglycans, and elastin fibrous cells, which all help form a wall around the fatty streak. The lipid core center surrounded by a fibrous cap is termed &#8220;fibrous plaque.&#8221;&#160;</li><li>&#160;When the formed fibrous plaques rupture due to shearing forces of blood flow, thrombogenic material (e.g., collagen) is exposed, which allows platelets to adhere to it.
