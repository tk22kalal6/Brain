She was watching TV when she started feeling right side numbness and had difficulty moving her right arm and leg. Medical history is unremarkable. Medications include oral contraceptives and ibuprofen for occasional migraines. She reports a 2-month history of dyspnea which she initially attributed to a viral illness she had prior. Her temperature is 38.0&#176;C (100.2&#176;F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mmHg. On physical examination, strength is 5/5 on the left side and 2/5 on the right side. Touch and temperature sensations are diminished on the right side. Cardiac auscultation reveals a low pitch early diastolic sound heard most prominently on the left sternal border. Echocardiography is obtained and shown below: &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/tc6Jt7NMTCWA4e6pmFY_zIDWRMi1Kohg/_.gif\"></div><br><br>Reproduced from: Wikimedia Commons &#160; <br><br>Histopathology examination of this patient&#8217;s finding will most likely show which of the following? &#160;<br><br>&#160;",

The majority of myxomas originate from the left atrium. Histologically, it is composed of<strong>&#160;gelatinous myxoma cells scattered within a mucopolysaccharide stroma</strong>. Macroscopically, they are often described as a pedunculated, &#8220;<strong>ball-valve</strong>&#8221; lesion. Patients frequently present with constitutional symptoms (e.g., weight loss, fever) that are thought to be related to the production of cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6) and growth factors by the tumor. Symptoms vary and often accompany a <strong>change of body position</strong> due to the pedunculated architecture, causing a \"ball-valve\" effect that obstructs blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The transient mitral valve obstruction can mimic mitral stenosis. Symptoms include dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, chest pain, embolization, and sudden death. Systemic embolization occurs when fragments from the tumor enter the systemic circulation. On physical examination, early diastolic, low pitch sounds are often heard when the tumor is lodged into the mitral valve surface (&#8220;tumor plop&#8221;). Diagnosis is made by echocardiography and treatment involves resection. &#160; &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hamartomatous growth; polygonal cells with glycogen-laden vacuoles:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>These characteristics are consistent with a cardiac rhabdomyoma, the most common primary pediatric tumor of the heart.

It can also be seen in advanced malignancy and inflammatory conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, and burns.

Common angiosarcoma locations include the liver, kidney, lung, and breast. In the liver, the tumor cells tend to grow along sinusoids and branches of the portal and hepatic veins. Immunostaining typically shows positivity for vascular markers, including ERG transcription factor, <strong>CD31</strong>, CD34, and factor VIII antigen. The most common cause of liver angiosarcoma is the prolonged exposure to <strong>vinyl chloride</strong> monomers (i.e., weatherstripping material, plastic pipes) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
