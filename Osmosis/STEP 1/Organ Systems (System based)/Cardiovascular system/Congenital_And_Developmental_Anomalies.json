Persistent truncus arteriosus occurs when the single trunk fails to divide into the aorta and pulmonary trunk due to a defect in the <strong>aorticopulmonary septum formation</strong>. This is often accompanied by a single truncal valve and ventricular septal defect. &#160;<br><br>Immediately after birth, the pulmonary vascular resistance is initially high, which causes relatively little left-to-right shunt through the single trunk. This allows a relatively normal amount of blood flow into the pulmonary circulation. However, as the pulmonary vascular resistance drops, the left-to-right shunting increases, leading to pulmonary overload, cyanosis, and heart failure. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Cardiovascular findings include single <strong>second heart sound, ejection click</strong> at the apex or left sternal border, <strong>bounding peripheral pulses</strong>, and in patients with truncal valve regurgitation, a diastolic murmur may be heard along the left sternal border.

On physical examination, a single second heart sound (S2) is also heard; however, bounding pulses are characteristics of persistent truncus arteriosus. Moreover, TOF chest radiographs typically reveal a &#8220;boot-shaped&#8221; heart and decreased pulmonary markings, as the right ventricular outflow obstruction leads to decreased pulmonary flow. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Persistent truncus arteriosus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) is another cause of early cyanosis in which the four pulmonary veins fail to make their normal connection to the left atrium and instead drain into the right atrium.

In this type, aortic narrowing occurs before the ductus arteriosus. Blood pressure is elevated in the aorta before the narrowing and reduced after the narrowing. As a result, deoxygenated blood is shunted from the pulmonary artery, through the ductus arteriosus, into the aorta distal to the narrowing. Deoxygenated blood can travel to the lower extremities and result in <strong>differential</strong> cyanosis, which is when the lower extremities are cyanotic, but the upper extremities are not. &#160; <br><br>The <strong>postductal typ</strong>e (also termed the adult type) is not associated with a PDA.

This patency leads to a left-to-right shunt, wherein high-pressure blood in the aorta is able to enter the low-pressure pulmonary artery. Other risk factors for developing a PDA include <strong>preterm birth&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;in utero alcohol exposure</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Clinically, it presents with a continuous <strong>machine-like murmur&#160;</strong>at the left infraclavicular area. In addition, patients can develop<strong>&#160;differential cyanosis,&#160;</strong>which is when the lower extremities are cyanotic but the upper extremities are acyanotic. This finding is because the ductus arteriosus originates in the aortic arch distal to where the subclavian arteries branch off. As a result, sufficiently oxygenated blood reaches the upper extremities, but inadequate blood reaches the lower extremities. Cardiac catheterization will reveal<strong>&#160;increased oxygen</strong> saturation in the <strong>pulmonary artery.&#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br><strong>Indomethacin</strong>, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, blocks synthesis of prostaglandin E and is used to treat PDA.

Along with the chest x-ray findings showing classic &#8220;<strong>egg on a string</strong>&#8221; appearance and<strong>&#160;increased pulmonary markings</strong>, the most likely diagnosis is<strong>&#160;D-transposition of the great vessels (D-TGA).</strong>&#160;<br><br>D-TGA is a congenital heart defect in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle, resulting in<span>&#160;</span><strong>2 parallel circulations</strong>. The condition is not well understood but is thought to occur due to<span>&#160;</span><strong>failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to spiral</strong>. Due to this parallel circuitry, blood from the right ventricle leaves through the aorta to the body, and then flows back to the right atrium and ventricle (blood never becomes oxygenated). Then, blood from the left ventricle leaves through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where it flows through to the pulmonary veins, left atrium and left ventricle (the oxygenated blood never gets delivered to the organs). &#160;<span>&#160;</span>&#160;<br><br>The postnatal clinical features are dependent on the degree of mixing between the two circulations and the presence of other cardiac anomalies.

The PDA typically closes in the first few days of life, resulting in cyanosis if the congenital heart defect is PDA-dependent, as seen here.

In addition, despite having marked hypoxemia, D-TGA pulmonary markings on chest x-ray are normal or increased, rather than decreased.

      "solution": "This patient has<strong>&#160;Eisenmenger syndrome,</strong> which is when an uncorrected left-to-right shunt reverses direction and becomes a<strong>&#160;right-to-left shunt</strong>. In this patient&#8217;s case, the condition most likely arose secondary to an <strong>uncorrected</strong> ventricular septal defect, given catheterization finding of decreased saturation in the left ventricle. &#160; <br><br>Eisenmenger syndrome occurs as a result of the constant shunting of blood to the right heart, which increases pulmonary blood flow. This high flow state triggers <strong>vascular remodeling</strong> in the lungs, which is characterized by increased proliferation of vascular smooth muscle and <strong>narrowing of pulmonary artery lumen.&#160;</strong>As a result, the right heart must pump against greater resistance, so it too undergoes remodeling in the form of <strong>right ventricular hypertrophy.</strong> This growth causes the pressure in the right heart to increase and exceed that of the left heart, ultimately switching the shunt&#8217;s direction. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Clinically, Eisenmenger syndrome presents with <strong>cyanosis</strong>, <strong>hypoxia</strong>, and <strong>clubbing</strong> of the fingers and toes.

ASDs are a type of left-to-right shunt. Cardiac catheterization will show increased oxygen saturation in the right atrium, ventricle, and pulmonary artery. Even with Eisenmenger syndrome, ASD would lead to decrease in saturation in the left atrium (not the ventricle).&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Impaired closure of the foramen ovale&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A patent foramen ovale (PFO) can cause transient right-to-left shunting of blood.
