Hemostasis is divided into two stages, <strong>primary&#160;</strong>and <strong>secondary</strong> hemostasis. Primary hemostasis occurs first and results in a <strong>platelet plug formation</strong> at the site of endothelial injury. &#160; <br><br>Primary hemostasis starts immediately after an endothelial injury and is divided into five main stages: <strong>endothelial injury, exposure, adhesion, activation,&#160;</strong>and <strong>aggregation. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Endothelial injury</strong>: Primary hemostasis starts when a blood vessel's endothelium is injured. The first thing that happens is <strong>vasoconstriction&#160;</strong>to prevent further blood loss, which is mediated by both neural reflex and endothelin released from damaged endothelial cells. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/3WNt55RSSOes8WOErgEaY_z_TvqT6sYl/_.png\"></div><br><br><strong>Exposure</strong>: The injured endothelial cells allow for the exposure of <strong>subendothelial collagen,</strong>&#160; which binds to the<strong>&#160;von Willebrand factor (vWF)</strong> released from damaged endothelial cells. &#160; <br><br><strong>Adhesion</strong>: Platelets then bind to the vWF (which is bound to the subendothelial collagen at the site of injury) via <strong>GpIB&#160;</strong>receptors on the platelets, which results in the activation of platelets. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-rbF8y2sRJm2duOGk6aAbW0dSa6hT3kz/_.png\"></div><br><br><strong>Activation</strong>: Once the platelets bind to VWF and get activated, they undergo a conformational change and release <strong>calcium, ADP, and thromboxane A2</strong>. Calcium is involved in the secondary hemostasis.

Thrombin (factor II) activates a number of coagulation factors including fibrinogen, factor V, factor VIII, and XIII.

      "solution": "This African-American patient with anemia, recent history of malaria prophylaxis, and family history of a maternal uncle with similar symptoms, has <strong>glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency</strong>. G6PD deficiency is an <strong>X-linked recessive</strong> disorder characterized by decreased levels of the enzyme G6PD. Males are almost exclusively affected by the disease, and females are carriers of the disease. It is most common in individuals of <strong>African</strong>, <strong>Mediterranean</strong>, and <strong>Asian&#160;</strong>descent. &#160; <br><br>G6PD deficiency leads to hemolysis by making erythrocytes more susceptible to damage caused by free radicals. <strong>Free radicals</strong>, which are products of metabolism, can destroy erythrocytes but are normally neutralized in the body by a molecule called <strong>glutathione</strong>. For this to occur, glutathione must be in the reduced state where it can donate protons and electrons to the free radicals and convert them to H2O2. However, this reaction causes glutathione to become oxidized, and for it to be reused, it must be converted back to the reduced state. This is done by an enzyme called glutathione reductase, which uses <strong>NADPH&#160;</strong>to reduce oxidized glutathione and converts NADPH into NADP+. To replenish the NADPH and allow for more glutathione to be reduced, <strong>G6PD&#160;</strong>reduces NADP+ back to NADPH. Therefore, low levels of G6PD, as in this patient, would lead to low levels of NADPH, decreased activity of glutathione reductase, decreased levels of reduced glutathione, and increased susceptibility to hemolytic episodes caused by free radicals. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/peyzmGxgQo__yPnaXZdGwvX0R6msMzxV/_.png\"></div><br><br>Some common triggers of G6PD include <strong>oxidant stressors</strong>, such as infections, metabolic acidosis, fava beans, soy products, red wine, <strong>antimalarials&#160;</strong>(primaquine and chloroquine), anti-inflammatories (aspirin and ibuprofen), quinidine, and sulfonamides (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ucBfVrbpTMCdebPJWTvi4ZqWTOSL_wSC/_.png\"></div><br><br>Peripheral blood smear of patients with G6PD deficiency shows <strong>degmacytes</strong>, also known as <strong>bite cells</strong>.

HbC disease is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder caused by mutated genes that encode for an abnormal adult hemoglobin called hemoglobin C (HbC). This mutation leads to a substitution of glutamic acid in the sixth position of the beta globin chain with <strong>lysine</strong>, and a mutation in both copies of the gene is needed to get the disease. If the person has just one copy of the mutation and one normal hemoglobin A gene (HbA), then he or she has <strong>HbC trait</strong> and is said to be a carrier of the disease. HbC carriers are also <strong>protected against malaria</strong>, because infected erythrocytes are removed by the spleen. &#160; <br><br>HbC is less soluble than normal HbA, so it aggregates into crystals, which build up inside erythrocytes and make them more rigid.

These cells are known as <strong>target cells&#160;</strong>or <strong>codocytes</strong>. Erythrocytes do not appear sickled like in sickle cell disease, because unlike valine, lysine is positively charged. Therefore, there is no hydrophobic effect seen in HbC disease.

Iron-deficiency anemia can also be caused by <strong>reduced intake</strong> (e.g. vegan diet), <strong>reduced absorption</strong> (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease), and <strong>increased demand</strong> (e.g. pregnancy) &#160;<br><br>Regardless of the cause, laboratory testing in patients with iron-deficiency anemia will demonstrate <strong>decreased hemoglobin levels, microcytosis</strong> (decreased mean corpuscular volume), <strong>hypochromia&#160;</strong>(decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin), and<strong>&#160;decreased reticulocyte count. &#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/9NFkVJssQOiVI20wzynM47ZcRaGGCbVq/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/7Suf7GxnQNacFuPJhR5KVi9HSbKhzklo/_.png\"></div><br>Image reproduced from Flickr<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Impaired heme synthesis due to decreased substrate availability:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Overproduction of cytokines:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Anemia of chronic disease typically occurs in chronic inflammatory states (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) or in cases of underlying malignancies (e.g., lymphoma, lung cancer). During these chronic states of inflammation, there is increased production of cytokines, in particular hepcidin. Hepcidin causes reduced iron uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as decreased release of iron from macrophages. Although this patient likely has an underlying malignancy, another cause of anemia is more probable.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Defective globin synthesis&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Thalassemias are characterized by defective globin chain production, which results in faulty hemoglobin, ultimately leading to anemia. Based on the globin chain that is affected, thalassemias can be classified as either alpha or beta. Although thalassemias can cause anemia, this patient&#8217;s positive stool guaiac test raises greater concern for iron deficiency secondary to an underlying malignancy.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Impaired heme synthesis due to enzyme inhibition&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Lead poisoning can cause anemia by inhibiting ferrochelatase and ALA dehydratase, two vital enzymes involved in heme synthesis. Lead poisoning typically presents with nervous system involvement, notably polyneuropathy and encephalopathy. This patient lacks any significant exposure to lead, lacks paresthesias or cognitive impairment, and has no pigmentation of the gums (termed lead line). As a result, lead poisoning is unlikely in this patient.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Destruction of myeloid stem cells&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Aplastic anemia is characterized by failure or destruction of myeloid stem cells. This loss typically results in pancytopenia, which is characterized by anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia since the stem cell precursor for all 3 lineages is destroyed. Thrombocytopenia can present as spontaneous purpura, petechiae, and mucosal bleeding. Leukopenia can present as recurrent infections. Although this patient has signs of anemia, he lacks signs of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia.</span></div>",

This condition is most commonly caused by a Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) gene mutation. &#160;<br><br>In healthy individuals, the kidneys release <strong>erythropoietin (EPO)</strong>, a hormone that binds to receptors on the hematopoietic stem cells, activating the JAK2 gene. This causes the hematopoietic stem cells to divide and produce more red blood cells (RBCs). However, when this mutation occurs, the JAK2 gene stays activated, and the hematopoietic stem cells are able to divide in the<strong>&#160;absence of EPO.&#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>The mutated cells rapidly proliferate and<strong>&#160;increase RBC mass.</strong> The body will notice the elevated RBC mass and <strong>reduce EPO production&#160;</strong>in an attempt to halt the process. The reason why polycythemia vera causes increased plasma volume is unclear. One hypothesis is that over time, a large number of RBCs pool in the spleen causing splenomegaly. In response there is a <strong>compensatory plasma volume increase</strong> in the rest of the circulation.

PNH is a genetic disorder caused by a somatic mutation of the <strong>PIG-A gene</strong> in <strong>myeloid stem cells</strong>. This gene encodes for a protein called phosphatidylinositol glycan A that is required to synthesize another protein called <strong>GPI anchor</strong>. GPI anchor is found on the membrane of all blood cells and serves to anchor proteins like <strong>decay accelerating factor (DAF)</strong>, also known as <strong>CD55</strong> and <strong>CD59</strong>, to the cell membrane.

This occurs as a result of the production of cold agglutinins, which are autoantibodies that target erythrocyte membranes and mark them for destruction in the spleen. &#160;<br><br>Hemolytic anemias can be classified based on the location of erythrocyte destruction (i.e., <strong>intravascular or extravascular</strong>), as well the etiology of the hemolysis (i.e., intrinsic vs. extrinsic). Extravascular hemolysis is defined by erythrocyte destruction outside of blood vessels, typically in the reticuloendothelial system (i.e. macrophages in the spleen), and intravascular hemolysis is defined by erythrocyte destruction within blood vessels. Extrinsic anemia is defined as hemolysis resulting from a problem outside of the erythrocyte and is typically acquired (e.g., autoimmune, infections, microangiopathic), whereas intrinsic anemia is defined as hemolysis resulting from a problem with the erythrocyte itself and is typically caused by enzyme deficiencies, commonly seen in congenital conditions (e.g., sickle cell disease, G6PD, hereditary spherocytosis). &#160;<br><br>The type of hemolysis present can be determined based on laboratory findings. In <strong>intravascular hemolysis,</strong> hemoglobin released inside blood vessels is bound by haptoglobin and both molecules are removed together. Therefore,<strong>&#160;haptoglobin levels decrease</strong> sharply.

Hemoglobinuria and hemosiderinuria can cause kidney damage, and patients may present with back pain. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In <strong>extravascular hemolysis</strong>, erythrocytes are destroyed outside of blood vessels, so <strong>haptoglobin levels are normal </strong>and there is no hemoglobin or hemosiderin in the urine.

B-thalassemia minor is caused by a mutation of only 1 of the 2 B-globin genes. Patients with the condition usually present with <strong>mild microcytic, hypochromic anemia</strong> and are asymptomatic. Most patients are unaware that they are carriers; oftentimes, the mild microcytic anemia is incorrectly attributed to iron deficiency, but iron supplements do not benefit these patients since they have sufficient levels of iron. &#160;<br><br>Normal adult hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1) consists of 2 alpha chains and 2 beta chains (&#945;&#945;&#946;&#946;) along with heme.

In patients with B-thalassemia minor, the mildly reduced synthesis of B-globin chains results in increased production of hemoglobin that does not involve incorporation of B-globin, such as hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) and fetal hemoglobin (HbF).

      "solution": "This patient has <strong>macrocytic anemia</strong> secondary to <strong>vitamin B9 (folate) deficiency</strong>. Common causes include <strong>poor diet, medication side-effects, and excessive alcohol consumption</strong>. Folate is obtained by consuming leafy greens and fortified foods. It is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF), which plays an important role in the synthesis of nitrogenous bases that are incorporated into DNA and RNA. As a result, folate deficiency <strong>impairs DNA synthesis</strong> and hinders the maturation of hematopoietic cell lines. &#160; <br><br>Folate deficiency causes <strong>macrocytic anemia</strong>. This is because RBC precursors are normally big (MCV &gt; 100 &#181;m3) and undergo cell divisions as they mature, resulting in normal, smaller RBCs. With folate deficiency, RBC maturation is impaired. This causes megaloblasts (structurally abnormal immature RBCs) to be released into the bloodstream. The net result is <strong>macrocytic megaloblastic anemia</strong>. Likewise, folate deficiency impairs white blood cell (WBC) maturation, resulting in <strong>immature hypersegmented neutrophils</strong> (greater than 5 lobes), as seen on this patient&#8217;s peripheral smear. &#160;<br><br>Folate deficiency causes <strong>fatigue, pallor, and glossitis</strong>. Diagnosis relies on a peripheral blood smear, which shows large red blood cells and hypersegmented neutrophils. A bone marrow study can also be done to look for the megaloblastic changes in RBC precursors. <strong>Homocysteine levels are also elevated</strong>.

Rh hemolytic disease of the newborn typically occurs in an Rh(+) fetus born to an Rh(-) mother previously exposed to Rh(+) blood through either a blood transfusion or fetomaternal hemorrhage from a previous pregnancy. During the pregnancy, preformed maternal anti-D IgG, which were produced as a result of the prior exposure, cross the placenta and opsonize fetal erythrocytes.

Extrinsic anemia is defined as hemolysis resulting from a problem outside of the erythrocyte and is typically acquired (e.g., autoimmune, infections, microangiopathic), whereas intrinsic anemia is defined as hemolysis resulting from a problem with the erythrocyte itself and is typically caused by enzyme deficiencies, commonly seen in congenital conditions (e.g., PNH, sickle cell disease, G6PD, hereditary spherocytosis). &#160; <br><br>The type of hemolysis can be determined based on symptoms and laboratory findings. In intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobin that is released inside vessels gets bound by haptoglobin, and both molecules are removed together. Therefore, haptoglobin levels decrease. Once the haptoglobin gets overwhelmed, the remainder of the hemoglobin travels via the blood to the kidneys. Here, it is excreted in the urine and causes hemoglobinuria. While passing through the renal tubules, some of the hemoglobin is reabsorbed by the cells lining the tubule. The iron component of the heme is stored in these cells as hemosiderin for a few days. Eventually, these cells slough into the urine and cause hemosiderinuria. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/uLsMbuvTQgG_1hp9MuZTb3qrQtGWUdEG/_.png\"></div><br>In extravascular hemolysis, erythrocytes are destroyed outside of the blood vessels, typically in the liver or spleen.
