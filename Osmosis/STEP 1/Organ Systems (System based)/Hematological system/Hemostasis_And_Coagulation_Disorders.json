If left untreated, recurrent hemarthrosis can cause chronic joint pain and deformity, and intracerebral hemorrhage can cause chronic neurologic disorders or death. &#160; <br><br>Diagnosis of hemophilia A is performed by obtaining coagulation parameters and performing a mixing study. In a mixing study, the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma, which will demonstrate a <strong>correction of PTT</strong> since factor VIII is now present.

Transmission occurs in an autosomal dominant fashion. Prothrombin, also known as <strong>factor II</strong>, is the precursor of thrombin, the end product of the coagulation cascade. Thrombin&#8217;s main role is to proteolytically cleave fibrinogen to fibrin, which in turn crosslinks to form a fibrin clot. Thrombin also interacts with other hemostatic components. &#160; <br><br>Prothrombin deficiency occurs due to a point mutation in which adenine (A) is substituted for guanine (G) at position 20210. Hence the condition is named prothrombin gene mutation G20210A. The base change occurs in the <strong>terminal nucleotide of the 3&#8217; untranslated gene region, which corresponds to the messenger RNA sequence used for polyadenylation</strong>. The end result is a <strong>gain-of-function mutation</strong>, increased prothrombin production, and hypercoagulability. &#160;<br><br>Patients may be heterozygous or homozygous. Patients are at increased risk for venous or arterial thromboembolism, MI, stroke, and obstetric complications. Laboratory testing will show normal or elevated PTT. <strong>Prothrombin levels are often elevated</strong> but are not used for diagnosis since there is too much overlap between the upper limit of normal and the levels in individuals carrying the mutation.

Its primary function is to inhibit thrombin (factor IIa), factor Xa, and other factors in the coagulation cascade. <strong>&#160;</strong>Inherited deficiencies are caused by <strong>AT gene mutations</strong> (autosomal dominant). <strong>Acquired deficiencies</strong> are associated with impaired production of AT (e.g., liver disease, warfarin therapy), protein loss (e.g. nephrotic syndrome), or accelerated consumption (e.g. disseminated intravascular coagulation). &#160; <br><br>Patients with AT deficiency are at increased <strong>thrombotic risk&#160;</strong>and are therefore at risk of developing venous or arterial thrombosis, obstetric complications, and stroke. Another feature of the conditions is <strong>insensitivity to heparin</strong>. Normally, heparin enhances the activity of antithrombin, which in turn inhibits thrombin and factor Xa. In patients with AT deficiency <strong>aPTT cannot be adequately prolonged with heparin administration</strong>. Diagnosis is made via AT-heparin cofactor assay, which assesses plasma antithrombin activity. Genetic testing is used in laboratories but not used routinely for diagnosis. Treatment includes direct thrombin inhibitors (Argatroban), direct factor X inhibitors (Rivaroxaban), warfarin, recombinant AT, or plasma transfusions. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/OQOc-UJmR0KItbjL6h3V7nyuSUS-9RyA/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Vitamin K deficiency:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Vitamin K is crucial for the coagulation cascade to function properly, as it serves as a cofactor for several key proteins with carboxyglutamic acid residues (factors 2, 7, 9, 10, C and S).

Patients may be homozygous or heterozygous. &#160;<br><br>Factor V is a procoagulant clotting factor that is synthesized as an inactive form and activated by thrombin at the wound site. Activated factor V then functions as a cofactor in the production of more thrombin from prothrombin. However, thrombin also halts its own production via a negative feedback loop. It does so by <strong>activating protein C&#160;</strong>(aPC), a protease that deactivates factor Va and factor VIIIa, thereby reducing thrombin production. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Factor V Leiden deficiency is caused by a single point mutation in the factor V gene in which guanine is switched to adenine.

The G20210A point mutation in the prothrombin gene results in a gain-of-function of prothrombin that leads to hypercoagulability.

Antithrombin is a natural anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin (factor IIa), factor Xa, and other factors in the coagulation cascade. A variety of mutations have been recognized. AT has no direct effect on the PT, PTT, or thrombin time. Instead, it diminishes the increase in PTT following heparin administration. This phenomenon exists since heparin, an indirect inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa, requires functional AT to be effective. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Factor V Leiden deficiency:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div>",

He later develops bleeding from his urinary catheter, and the laboratory findings demonstrate prolonged PT/PTT, low fibrinogen, and low factor VIII levels. Together these findings are consistent with<strong>&#160;disseminated intravascular coagulation</strong> (DIC). &#160;<br><br>DIC refers to a widespread consumptive coagulopathy resulting in hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, and end-organ ischemia. It has multiple triggers including <strong>trauma, sepsis</strong> (due to lipopolysaccharides found in bacteria),<strong>&#160;pregnancy related complications, malignancies&#160;</strong>(acute promyelocytic leukemia, mucinous tumors), and<strong>&#160;transfusion reactions. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Regardless of the trigger, DIC causes unchecked activation of the coagulation cascade and deposition of platelet-rich or fibrin-rich thrombi in the microvasculature. Over time, this process consumes <strong>all&#160;</strong>coagulation factors, causing <strong>an elevated PT/PTT&#160;</strong>and <strong>decreased fibrinogen levels</strong>. DIC also causes fibrinolysis resulting in <strong>elevated d-dimer levels</strong>, depleted platelets resulting in <strong>thrombocytopenia</strong>, and <strong>schistocytes&#160;</strong>on peripheral blood smear. &#160;<br><br>Clinically, patients will often develop <strong>bleeding from catheters, venipuncture sites,</strong> or other means of invasive access. Patients often develop petechiae and easy bruising from thrombocytopenia. Signs of end-organ ischemia may also ensue (e.g., renal insufficiency, pulmonary hemorrhage). When suspected, coagulation studies including PT/PTT, d-dimer, and fibrinogen levels should be obtained. Additionally,<strong>&#160;factor VIII</strong> levels can help determine if the coagulopathy is due to DIC (reduced levels) or hepatic dysfunction (normal levels, since factor VIII is made outside the liver). &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/y4qXKhuVT4SO_R1MOPCMDqUnTqu53_lA/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Lipopolysaccharide induced consumptive coagulopathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cancer procoagulant activation of factor X&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Studies have shown that certain malignancies can drive the process of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) via a proteolytic enzyme termed &#8220;cancer procoagulant.&#8221; However, this protein is primarily found in mucinous tumors and would be unlikely to trigger DIC without additional instigating factors.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Trauma to vascular endothelium resulting in exposure of tissue factor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This answer choice describes the pathophysiologic process of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as a consequence of severe trauma.

This can decrease the efficacy of warfarin and subtherapeutic INR.&#160;</li></ul>&#160;<ul><li><strong>&#160;Medications/Supplements:&#160;</strong>Warfarin is metabolized by the <strong>cytochrome P450 system,</strong> and medications that inhibit this enzyme system (e.g., fluoroquinolones, erythromycin, metronidazoles, and amiodarone) can cause a supratherapeutic INR. In contrast, medications or supplements that induce this system (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and <strong>St. John&#8217;s Wort</strong>) can lead to a subtherapeutic INR.&#160;</li></ul>&#160;<ul><li>&#160;Liver disease can increase the INR due to decreased production of clotting factors. Similarly, acetaminophen use (&gt;2-3 g/day) can prolong the INR in those on warfarin therapy due to its interruption of vitamin K recycling in the liver. &#160;</li></ul><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/AgMynxS4SROmxI41Me5z_evMTNWNPOVq/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Daily exercise:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Exercise has not been shown to alter warfarin's physiologic function or metabolism. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ St. John&#8217;s Wort:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Azithromycin&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Macrolides, including erythromycin and clarithromycin, are CYP 450 inhibitors that can potentiate warfarin and increase INR.

Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that interferes with the normal synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X), and is used for both the treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolic events. However, warfarin also inhibits <strong>proteins C and S,&#160;</strong>which are factors that function as anticoagulants (these proteins are thought of like the brakes on the coagulation cascade). &#160; <br><br>Specifically, <strong>inhibition of protein C leads to a hypercoagulable state since it has the shortest half-life of all factors inhibited by warfarin.&#160;</strong>At therapeutic doses, the anticoagulant effects of warfarin outweigh the hypercoagulable ones, but protein C is depleted before the other factors during the initiation of the medication. This creates a temporarily hypercoagulable state during which the patient is more prone to clotting. This factor imbalance manifests in paradoxical pro-coagulation, resulting in microthrombules of blood vessels in the skin and subsequent purpura and necrosis. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis can be avoided by administering a heparin bridge when initiating warfarin therapy.&#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Factor II:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This woman&#8217;s skin lesions are likely due to the paradoxical pro-coagulant effects following a decrease in protein C.
