In most cases, it results from an <strong>activating point mutation in BRAF (serine/threonine)</strong>, leading to self-sustained activation of RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which causes the accelerated proliferation of lymphocytes in the bone marrow. It eventually causes <strong>bone marrow fibrosis</strong>, resulting in a<strong>&#160;dry tap on aspiration</strong> and leading to <strong>pancytopenia&#160;</strong>(fever, fatigue, weakness and recurrent infections). The neoplastic cells also infiltrate the red pulp of the spleen, leading to <strong>splenomegaly</strong>, which can present as a <strong>dragging sensation in the abdomen</strong> (as in this patient), as well as early satiety due to compression of the stomach. &#160;<br><br>Peripheral blood smear shows <strong>lymphocytes with cytoplasmic projections</strong> (irregular cytoplasm outline).

Bleomycin acts on the <strong>G2 phase</strong> of the cell cycle and prevents cells from proceeding to the M stage (mitosis).<br><br>The cell cycle is normally divided into 4 stages: G1, S, G2, and M (mitosis). In order to progress from one stage to another, proliferating cells must pass through <strong>surveillance checkpoints</strong>. These checkpoints are found mainly in-between the G1-S phase and G2-M phase. If the cell is found to have mutated DNA, regulatory proteins at the checkpoints (e.g., p53) are activated and prevent the cell from progressing to the next stage until the DNA is repaired.
