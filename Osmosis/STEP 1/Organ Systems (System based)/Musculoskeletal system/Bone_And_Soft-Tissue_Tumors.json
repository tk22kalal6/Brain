      "solution": "<strong>Osteoporosis</strong> is usually diagnosed with a <strong>dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan</strong>, which tests for bone density. The test compares the individual's total lumbar spine, hip, and femoral neck bone density to that of the average bone density found in a healthy young individual. This comparison yields a T-score. A T-score of &#8804; -2.5 standard deviations is diagnostic of osteoporosis. A T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 means the individual has <strong>osteopenia</strong>, a condition also characterized by decreased bone strength but less severe than osteoporosis. &#160;<br><br>In addition, a diagnosis of osteoporosis can also be established with a <strong>fragility fracture&#160;</strong>at the hip or vertebra in the absence of other metabolic bone disorders. According to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), one time screening by DEXA scan is recommended in all females <strong>65-years-old and above</strong>. In addition, younger females with risk factors (e.g., smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, low body weight) may also require a DEXA scan. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ T-score one standard deviation below the population average:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The T-score compares the patient&#8217;s bone mineral density with that of the average bone density found in a healthy young individual.

The patient in this vignette has two risk factors: <strong>advanced age&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;reduced estrogen&#160;</strong><strong>levels&#160;</strong>secondary to menopause. Estrogen normally decreases osteoclast resorption of bone; therefore, decreased estrogen levels leave the patient vulnerable to breakdown of bone. In addition, the rate of bone deposition by osteoblasts decreases with age. A combination of the two factors accounts for the pathophysiology behind this patient&#8217;s reduced bone mineral density, which is quantified using the T-score.

Of note, breast milk contains low vitamin D levels, and exclusively breast-fed children are at risk of developing vitamin D deficiency. When these elements are missing, osteoblasts do not have enough calcium and phosphate to deposit into the organic matrix.<br><br>In children, since the growth plates have not closed, this leads to cartilaginous growth plates, impaired growth of bones, and bone malformations. In adults, where the epiphyseal plates have already closed, it only causes defective mineralization of osteoid, resulting in weak bones that are fracture-prone. <br><br>Both conditions can cause diffuse bone and joint pain, proximal muscle weakness, and increased risk of fragility fractures.

The first step in management is to initiate<strong>&#160;lifestyle changes&#160;</strong>such as engaging in physical activity as well as ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. <br><br><strong>Bisphosphonates,&#160;</strong>such as alendronate and risedronate, are the first-line drugs to manage osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogs that bind to hydroxyapatite in the bone and inhibit osteoclast activity. Side effects include <strong>jaw osteonecrosis, atypical stress fractures,</strong> and, if taken orally, they can cause <strong>pill-induced esophagitis.</strong> To prevent this last side-effect, patients are advised to take the medication with water and remain upright for 30 minutes afterwards. Bisphosphonates should also be used with precaution in individuals with renal failure, since they are eliminated via the kidneys. &#160; <br><br>For advanced cases of osteoporosis, <strong>teriparatide</strong>, a recombinant parathyroid hormone, can be used. Although parathyroid hormone stimulates bone resorption, it has been found that pulsatile injections with teriparatide activate osteoblasts more than osteoclasts.
