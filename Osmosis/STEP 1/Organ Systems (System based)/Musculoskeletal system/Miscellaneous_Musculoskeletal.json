These effects prevent the activation and maturation of osteoclasts, which ultimately limits bone breakdown. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In addition to treating <strong>postmenopausal osteoporosis</strong>, denosumab can be administered to <strong>prevent skeletal-related events</strong> (e.g., bone pain, fractures) in patients with bone metastases. &#160; <br><br>Common side effects include <strong>hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia,&#160;</strong>and <strong>infections</strong>.

When osteoclasts break down bones, they also take in the bisphosphonates. The medication interferes with osteoclast function and promotes osteoclast apoptosis, thereby suppressing bone turnover.

Given the medical history of <strong>&#8220;white eye,&#8221;</strong> the most likely mutated gene is the <strong>retinoblastoma&#160;</strong>(RB) <strong>gene. &#160;</strong><br><br>Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor. The tumor produces an osteoid matrix or mineralized bone. Osteosarcoma has a bimodal age distribution, with a first peak seen in persons younger than 20 years of age and a smaller peak in older adults. In adolescents, it often arises in the metaphyseal regions of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Radiographs usually show a destructive, mixed lytic and sclerotic mass with reactive subperiosteal bone formation. This bone formation leads to elevation of the periosteum and the characteristic imaging finding known as Codman&#8217;s triangle (not pathognomonic). Risk factors for developing osteosarcoma include <strong>RB gene mutation, TP53 mutations</strong> (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), <strong>prior irradiation or chemotherapy, Paget disease, fibrous dysplasia</strong>, and other benign bone lesions. &#160;<br><br>The RB gene, also known as the<strong>&#160;governor of the cell cycle</strong>, is a <strong>tumor suppressor gene&#160;</strong>and a key negative regulator of the cell cycle. The product of the RB gene is the RB protein, which regulates the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle before DNA replication commences. When RB protein is <strong>hypophosphorylated</strong>, it binds the E2F transcription factor to inhibit gene transcription. When RB is <strong>phosphorylated&#160;</strong>it releases E2F, which binds DNA and activates transcription of S-phase genes. Mutations in the RB gene result in abnormal progression through the cell cycle, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and division. RB gene germline (inherited) or somatic (acquired) mutations are associated with retinoblastoma eye cancer, osteosarcoma bone cancer, and other soft tissue tumors. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase receptor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This answer describes the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The condition arises when a part of the ABL gene is translocated from its normal location on chromosome 9 to chromosome 22.

The product of this gene, the p53 protein, is a transcription factor that prevents neoplastic transformation via temporary cell cycle arrest (quiescence), permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence), or apoptosis.

Mutation in the HER2 gene causes overexpression of this receptor, which leads to highly proliferative tumors and poor prognosis. The HER2 gene mutation is associated with breast cancer, but HER2-positive breast cancer is not inherited and is considered a somatic genetic mutation.
