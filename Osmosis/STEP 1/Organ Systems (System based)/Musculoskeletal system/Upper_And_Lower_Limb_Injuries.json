      "solution": "<strong>Torticollis</strong> results from a <strong>contraction or shortening of the neck muscles</strong>, such as the sternocleidomastoid or trapezius muscle. This condition typically presents with the head tilted towards the affected side and the chin rotated away from the affected side, limiting the neck&#8217;s range of motion. This posturing is because the condition mimics the action of the sternocleidomastoid, which functions to flex the head toward the side of contraction (in this case, the right) and laterally rotate the head or chin away from the side of the contraction (in this case, the left). &#160;<br><br>Torticollis can be congenital or acquired, as described below:&#160;<ul><li>&#160;<strong>Congenital torticollis</strong> is the most common type of torticollis. This postural deformity of the neck develops prenatally and is most often caused by the development of a fibrous tissue tumor in the sternocleidomastoid muscle and less often by neurological or bony abnormalities. &#160;</li><li>&#160;There is also <strong>congenital muscular torticollis</strong>, a postural deformity that is typically evident 2-4 weeks after delivery and often occurs during delivery when there is tearing of the muscle fibers of the baby's neck, resulting in subsequent fibrosis and shortening of the neck muscles. &#160;&#160;</li><li>&#160;<strong>Acquired torticollis</strong> typically appears after delivery and can be caused by various conditions that cause injury or inflammation to the muscles of the neck. These can range from trauma to infection or neurological disorders. Acquired torticollis typically occurs in children but can occur in adults as well. &#160;</li></ul>Adults usually acquire a type of torticollis referred to as <strong>spasmodic torticollis</strong>, or <strong>cervical dystonia</strong>, resulting from strenuous movement or awkward positioning for too long. Spasmodic torticollis is a chronic and painful condition characterized by involuntary contraction of the neck muscles, leading to involuntary tilting, turning, flexing, or extending the neck. In most cases, the cause of spasmodic torticollis is unknown, but more serious causes include cervical spine injuries, such as fractures and subluxations. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Sk5K34pySjGbKRIK5cePEiXgQLie5ctF/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Clavicle fracture:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Clinical findings of a clavicle fracture include asymmetric contour, crepitus, edema, decreased or absent movement of the arm on the affected side, and crying with passive movement of the arm on the affected side.

Spondylolisthesis refers to anterior displacement of the vertebral body with respect to the adjacent vertebral bodies. Spondylolisthesis can be caused by degenerative changes in the spine in adult patients. It can also be congenital and seen in children. In both adolescents and children, pars defects can be caused by overuse of the low back, mainly from sports that involve repetitive back bend-like motion. This can lead to fracture of the pars interarticularis (spondylolysis) which may progress to anterior subluxation of one vertebral body with respect to an adjacent vertebral body (spondylolisthesis). &#160; <br><br>Lumbar spondylolisthesis can present with intermittent localized low back pain.

      "solution": "This adolescent girl presents with poorly localized anterior knee pain and clinical features suggestive of <strong>patellofemoral pain syndrome</strong> (PFPS). The pathogenesis of this condition is poorly understood but is likely due to anatomical variants that increase chronic contact pressure between the patella and the femur, resulting in knee pain. In addition, muscular imbalance(s) between the quadriceps and hamstrings decrease the stability of the patellofemoral joint with normal weight-bearing activities. This condition is primarily related to overuse but can also occur acutely following trauma. <br><br>Clinical features of PFPS include <strong>anterior knee pain</strong> directly under or around the patella. The pain is often worsened with activity or with <strong>walking up and down stairs</strong>. It is relieved with rest, although pain may be noted after prolonged periods of knee flexion (e.g. sitting in a chair). Diagnosis of PFPS is primarily based on patient history and examination findings. The pain is often provoked by maneuvers that involve contraction of the quadriceps with the knee in flexion (e.g. squatting). PFPS is most common in adolescent females.<br><br>Nonoperative medical management and <strong>physical therapy</strong> is the most common initial treatment course. Therapy focuses on stretching and strengthening of the quadriceps muscle. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Chronic avulsion of the secondary ossification center of the tibial tuberosity &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) refers to a traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle due to repetitive strain and chronic avulsion of the secondary ossification center at the tibial tuberosity.

Inversion injuries typically result in distraction (stretching) of the lateral ankle structures with compression of the medial structures. In contrast, eversion injuries result in medial distraction with lateral compression. The structures that are distracted during the injury tend to fracture or tear before the compressed structures. &#160; &#160;<br><br>A Pott&#8217;s fracture is a bimalleolar fracture (injury to both the medial and the lateral malleolus) that results from a<strong>&#160;combined abduction external rotation from an eversion force.</strong> A Pott's fracture often occurs in combination with a dislocation of the ankle or other fractures of the foot, ankle, or lower leg. &#160; <br><br>Another type of fracture, called a <strong>trimalleolar fracture</strong>, occurs when a bimalleolar fracture occurs in conjunction with a fracture of the posterior malleolus.

      "solution": "This patient presents with an effusion, pain, and joint instability after a <strong>rapid deceleration</strong> mechanism of injury. Together, these findings are concerning for an anterior cruciate ligament tear, best confirmed on physical examination with the <strong>Lachman test</strong>.<br><br>The knee's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most anterior ligamentous component of the knee joint. It prevents the tibia from sliding out in front of the femur and provides rotational stability. The ACL is the most commonly injured ligament in the knee and typically occurs in sports during moments of <strong>rapid deceleration, direction changes, or pivoting on a lower extremity with the foot planted</strong>. Symptoms include the sensation of a &#8220;pop&#8221; or &#8220;tear&#8221; during the injury as well as significant effusion, pain, and sensation of joint instability immediately after the incident.<br><br>Two physical examination techniques with high sensitivity for detecting ACL tears are the <strong>Lachman test</strong> and the <strong>anterior drawer test</strong>. The <strong>Lachman test</strong> involves flexing the knee at 20&#176;with the patient supine. At the same time, the examiner places one hand behind the tibia and the other hand grasps the patient's thigh and pulls the tibia forward. A positive test is indicated by anterior translational of the tibia or a &#8220;soft&#8221; end feel. The anterior drawer test involves the examiner grasping the proximal lower leg below the tibial plateau with the knee in 90&#176;of flexion and attempting to translate the lower leg anteriorly with the patient's foot planted on the examination table. Definitive diagnosis of ACL tear is achieved with MRI. Signs of ACL tear on MRI include swelling, increased signal intensity, fiber discontinuity and abnormal ACL orientation. An empty notch sign which is a fluid signal at the site of femoral attachment at the intercondylar notch may be seen and it denotes avulsion at the femoral attachment. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Lachman test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ober test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The Ober test is used to evaluate tension in the iliotibial band.

Posterior cruciate ligament injury commonly occurs with a direct blow to the front of the knee such as when a bent knee hits the dashboard in a motor vehicle collision. Based on this patient&#8217;s mechanism of injury, an anterior cruciate ligament injury is more likely. &#160;</span></div>",
