      "text": "A 60-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of nausea, headaches, and forgetfulness. The symptoms developed several months ago and have worsened in severity. Past medical history is notable for small cell carcinoma of the lung, diagnosed a year ago and associated syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), blood pressure is 128/75 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. There is no significant soft tissue swelling. The patient is oriented to person, place, and time. Strength and sensation are intact in the upper and lower extremities. Laboratory testing reveals a serum sodium of 124 mmol/L. In addition to fluid restriction, the physician decides to give the patient a medication that directly antagonizes the antidiuretic hormone V2 receptors. Which of the following adverse effects is most commonly associated with this medication? &#160;",

      "solution": "This patient&#8217;s symptoms of nausea, headache, and forgetfulness are likely due to <strong>syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion</strong> (SIADH), a common paraneoplastic disorder associated with small cell lung cancer. The cancerous cells produce antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which leads to excessive free water retention and hyponatremia.<br><br><strong>Vaptans </strong>(e.g., conivaptan, tolvaptan) are <strong>direct ADH receptor antagonists</strong> that are used in the treatment of SIADH due to their efficacy in correcting hyponatremia. These drugs block V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, resulting in excessive loss of free water with minimal loss of electrolytes. These changes help normalize serum sodium levels.<br><br>Vaptans should be used cautiously to avoid rapid correction of serum sodium, which can result in a form of devastating central nervous system injury known as <strong>osmotic demyelination syndrome</strong>. Vaptans are otherwise relatively safe drugs, with side effects including <strong>excessive thirst, dry mouth, </strong>and <strong>increased urinary frequency</strong>.<br><br><strong>Demeclocycline </strong>is a tetracycline derivative that can also be used in SIADH treatment due its ability to induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The mechanism of action is not well understood, but the medication appears to inhibit the binding of ADH to its receptor. However, it is not frequently used in the treatment of SIADH due to its severe nephrotoxic side effects. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Excessive thirst:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Neurotoxicity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Antidiuretic hormone V2 antagonists (e.g., conivaptan, tolvaptan) are not known to cause neurotoxicity. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypothyroidism:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hypothyroidism is a common side effect of lithium therapy.

      "solution": "This patient has physical examination, imaging, and laboratory findings consistent with <strong>acromegaly</strong>. Most cases of acromegaly are due to growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas. The first-line treatment option is <strong>transsphenoidal resection</strong> of the adenoma, which has excellent outcomes in controlling the disease and normalizing growth hormone (GH) levels. However, medical treatment is available for patients who are poor fit for surgery, refuse surgery, or have an unresectable adenoma. The options of medical treatment for acromegaly include: &#160;<br><br><ul><li><strong>Somatostatin analogs</strong> (e.g., octreotide, lanreotide): Somatostatin analogs are effective in the treatment of acromegaly. These agents <strong>inhibit growth hormone secretion</strong>, thus controlling the symptoms and complications of excessive growth hormone. Furthermore, somatostatin analogs have been shown to induce shrinkage of pituitary adenomas. Side effects of this drug class include <strong>bloating, loose stools, fat malabsorption</strong>. In addition, there is increased risk of <strong>gallstones</strong> due to gallbladder hypomotility. &#160;</li></ul><br><ul><li><strong>GH-receptor antagonist</strong> (e.g. pegvisomant): Pegvisomant is a newly developed medication that has been shown to be efficacious in treating acromegaly. It binds to GH receptors and prevents their activation. Also, as it blocks GH receptors in hepatocytes, it <strong>prevents the production of IGF-1</strong>. Since pegvisomant does not suppress GH hormone production, a minority of patients may experience an increase in the size of the adenoma due to increased GH production. It can rarely cause <strong>increased liver enzymes</strong>, which usually normalizes after stopping the medication.&#160;</li></ul><br><ul><li><strong>Dopamine agonists</strong> (e.g. cabergoline): Dopamine agonists have been shown to <strong>decrease growth hormone secretion</strong> from pituitary adenomas. It can be used alone or in combination with somatostatin analogs. Side effects include <strong>nausea, lightheadedness, depression&#160;</strong>and <strong>constipation</strong>. &#160;</li></ul><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Decreased insulin like growth factor-1 levels. &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased growth hormone levels &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Pegvisomant is a growth hormone receptor antagonist that leads to decreased insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels.

In contrast, this patient is started on pegvisomant, which is a growth hormone receptor antagonist that leads to decreased insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) production.
