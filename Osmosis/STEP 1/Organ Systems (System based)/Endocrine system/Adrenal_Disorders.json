These findings are concerning for <strong>11&#946;-hydroxylase deficiency</strong>. &#160; <br><br><strong>11&#946;-hydroxylase deficiency</strong> is a subtype of <strong>congenital adrenal hyperplasia</strong>, which are a series of <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> enzymatic deficiency disorders that affect mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid, and sex hormone synthesis. 11&#946;-hydroxylase deficiency results in elevated levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone, which acts as a mild mineralocorticoid, inducing hypertension, hypokalemia, and suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. In addition, steroid precursors are shunted towards androgen production, resulting in <strong>virilization in females</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Clinically, this diagnosis is difficult to distinguish from 21-hydroxylase deficiency. A useful memory tool to recall the difference between these two disorders is if the deficient enzyme starts with 1, it causes hypertension; if the deficient enzyme ends with 1, it causes virilization in females. &#160; <br><br>The diagnosis of 11&#946;-hydroxylase deficiency is confirmed by elevations of <strong>11-deoxycortisol</strong> and <strong>11-deoxycorticosterone</strong>, which are the substrates for 11&#946;-hydroxylase.

In contrast to primary adrenal insufficiency, secondary adrenal insufficiency will have normal levels of aldosterone, since the adrenal glands&#8217; synthetic function remains unaffected. &#160; <br><br><strong>Tertiary adrenal insufficiency</strong> is reflective of hypothalamic dysfunction and decreased CRH production. The most common etiology is the sudden withdrawal of chronic glucocorticoid use, since exogenous steroid use suppresses CRH release.

Physical examination is notable for hyperpigmented palmar creases, reflective of increased melanin in the setting of augmented ACTH production. Together, his clinical presentation is consistent with <strong>primary adrenal insufficiency</strong>, of which the most common etiology in the developed world is <strong>autoimmune adrenalitis</strong>. &#160; <br><br>A careful history and physical examination can disclose the etiology and subtype of <strong>chronic adrenal insufficiency</strong>. In general, chronic adrenal insufficiency presents with non-specific or constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, muscle or joint pain, and psychiatric symptoms (e.g., impaired memory, depression). &#160; <br><br>Differentiating features of <strong>chronic primary adrenal insufficiency</strong> include hyperpigmentation, salt craving, orthostatic hypotension, as well as hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis. Hyperpigmentation stems from increased levels of ACTH, which stimulate melanin stimulating hormone (MSH) production and subsequent melanin synthesis. Loss of aldosterone leaves the kidneys with an inability to adequately retain sodium, excrete potassium, and maintain intravascular volume--leading to salt craving, orthostatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis. Additional clues to this diagnosis include a family history of autoimmune disorders (e.g., Hashimoto thyroiditis, type I &#160;diabetes mellitus). &#160; <br><br>In contrast, <strong>chronic secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency</strong> is more commonly due to hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction -- and thus does not affect levels of aldosterone. This means that patients with chronic secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency will not develop metabolic derangements. Hyperpigmentation will also be absent since ACTH production is reduced. Important clinical features for secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency include headaches, focal neurologic deficits, and abrupt withdrawal of exogenous glucocorticoids. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/szf5_4FdTVGlKXgbIYcUZpCtQ8iGMET1/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Autoimmune adrenalitis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Chronic mycobacterial infection:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> infection is the most common etiology of primary adrenal insufficiency in the developing world.
