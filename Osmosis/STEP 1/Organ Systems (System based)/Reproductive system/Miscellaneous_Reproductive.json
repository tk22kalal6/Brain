      "text": "A 61-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 2, comes to the clinic due to pelvic discomfort and fatigue over the past 6 months. The patient was previously healthy, other than a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Menarche occurred at age 12, and menopause occurred 2 years ago. Both of the patient&#8217;s children were delivered via Cesarean sections due to personal preference. Family history is significant for breast cancer in her cousin at age 56 and colon cancer in her father at age 55. Vitals are within normal limits. BMI is 35 kg/m2. On physical examination, the abdomen is bloated, and shifting dullness is present. Pelvic examination reveals a left-sided adnexal mass. The patient undergoes a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. A pathohistological analysis is consistent with serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary. Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for this patient&#8217;s condition?",

      "solution": "<strong>Ovarian cancer</strong> is the 2nd most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries and 3rd in developing countries (cervical cancer is most common). In the United States, ovarian cancer is the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death. Surface epithelial tumors (EOC) account for the majority of ovarian tumors, of which, the serous subtype is the most common. Epithelial carcinomas of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum are considered a single clinical entity. &#160; <br><br>Risk factors for developing EOC are detailed in the table below. In general, <strong>increased number of lifetime ovulations is associated with increased risk of developing ovarian cancer</strong>, due to the repeated damage to the surface epithelium with the subsequent repair and regeneration that predisposes to mutations. <strong>Nulliparity</strong>, <strong>early menarche</strong>, and <strong>late menopause</strong> result in increased lifetime ovulations and therefore are associated with increased risk of EOC. It follows that <strong>protective factors are typically associated with decreased lifetime ovulation</strong>, such as oral contraceptive pills, multiparity, and breastfeeding. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/LsyMG5o8RgO5tFzWgJRF9R-wSKegP5wQ/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The patient&#8217;s family history:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> There is an increased risk of ovarian cancer for women with no personal history of cancer but with either: &#160;<br><ul><li>1st or 2nd degree relative with any of the following: breast cancer &#8804;45 years, ovarian cancer, male breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, or metastatic prostate cancer. &#160;</li><li><strong>Or&#160;</strong>&#8805;2 primary breast cancer in a single individual Or occurring on the same side of the family with at least one diagnosed &#8804;50 years. &#160;</li></ul>A cousin is a 3rd-degree relative, and colon cancer is not associated with increased risk for ovarian cancer. &#160;<br></span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The patient&#8217;s medical history:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Findings regarding whether polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) increases the risk for ovarian cancer are currently inconclusive.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The patient&#8217;s BMI:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Findings regarding whether obesity increases the risk for ovarian cancer are currently inconclusive.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Age of menarche:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Early menarche (before age 12) has been associated with a mildly increased risk of ovarian cancer, due to an increased number of total ovulations.
