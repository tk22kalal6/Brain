It can be further divided according to the etiology, including lactational, physiologic (e.g., medication, neurological stimuli, etc.), and pathologic. Any discharge other than milk should raise suspicion for pathologic processes. These include serous (clear or yellow), sanguineous (bloody), or serosanguineous (blood-tinged). The most common cause of pathologic nipple discharge is <strong>intraductal papilloma</strong>, as seen in this patient. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/D2L82AG0SLGbIjTs0X9IjhqNQ3WlDMjl/_.png\"></div><br>Reproduced from: Wikimedia Commons&#160;<br>&#160;<br>Intraductal papilloma is a <strong>benign growth of papillary cells</strong> that grow into the lumen of the lactiferous ducts. It frequently presents as <strong>isolated, painless serous/bloody nipple discharge</strong>. Occasionally, it may present as a mass and/or tenderness. Mammography is mostly unrevealing or may show duct ectasia, calcifications, or a mass. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than mammography and show duct ectasia, nodules, or a cyst. <strong>MRI </strong>is the best modality to detect intraductal papilloma. On gross examination, it appears as a lobulated, soft, tan mass within a cystic cavity. Microscopically, it consists of <strong>a central, branching fibrovascular core with an overlying layer of epithelium.</strong> Although it is considered a benign lesion, it can harbor areas of atypia or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and thus it is associated with a slightly increased risk for breast cancer. A biopsy is required for diagnosis. When biopsy demonstrates intraductal papilloma with atypical cells, surgical excision is warranted. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Branching fibrovascular core with overlying epithelial cells:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Necrotic fat, bleeding, and giant cells&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>These findings are consistent with fat necrosis, a benign breast lesion that occurs in the setting of trauma or surgery.

Unlike ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), it is rarely associated with calcifications on mammography. Approximately 1/3 of women diagnosed with LCIS eventually develop invasive carcinoma. It is important to note that invasive carcinomas following a diagnosis of LCIS may arise in <strong>either breast</strong> (unlike DCIS, which predisposes to invasive carcinoma in the same breast). On histology, the tumor has a homogeneous appearance. The cells are monomorphic with round nuclei and are found in clusters within the lobules.

It is important to note that the term IDC is used for all carcinomas that are not subclassified into specialized types (e.g., mucinous, tubular). The tumor usually arises from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and crosses the basement membrane. Ductal carcinoma typically produces an <strong>extensive desmoplastic response</strong>, which is the growth of fibrous or connective tissue that surrounds the tumor and replaces the normal breast tissue. This reaction leads to an identifiable mammographic and sonographic density, and a hard, palpable irregular mass upon examination. On histology, its appearance ranges from tumors with well-developed tubules to sheets of anaplastic cells.

Invasive carcinomas can be classified according to the <strong>biologic type</strong> as follows: ER-positive/HER2-negative, HER2-positive, and ER/PR/HER2-negative (triple-negative). The biologic classification is important, since each type differs in patient characteristics, grade, mutation profile, metastatic pattern, response to therapy, time to recurrence, and prognosis. For the majority of patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, an adjuvant endocrine therapy is recommended. Patients with triple negative tumors tend to have a poorer short-term prognosis (first five to seven years) and higher relapse rates during this period of time compared with ER-positive types. Since triple-negative tumors lack hormone receptors, no targeted therapy is available, making treatment more difficult. &#160; <br><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/vYxXOQoIS1afKmWj2nkBhvshTGK0fB4Q/_.png\"></div><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/dYRtnCzET_GGBvzo_mMyKLoSRt2NyxFe/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;&#160;Estrogen receptor &#160;expression &#160;&#160;Progesterone receptor &#160;expression &#160;&#160;&#160;HER2 receptor overexpression&#160;&#160;+&#160;&#160;-&#160;&#160;-&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Estrogen receptor (ER) expression is generally associated with a better outcome and prognosis.

Gynecomastia is defined as benign proliferation of the glandular breast tissue in males. It differs from the female breast development by the lack of terminal alveolar development in response to progesterone. Patients typically present with a mass or ridge of glandular tissue that is symmetrically distributed around the nipple. It may be tender or asymmetric. Gynecomastia can be physiologic or pathologic, primary (e.g. Klinefelter syndrome) or secondary (e.g. drugs). The vast majority of gynecomastia cases in children and adolescents are physiologic. &#160;<br><br><strong>Neonatal breast hypertrophy &#12540;&#160;</strong>This occurs in both boys and girls during the neonatal period and is thought to be related to placental transformation of androgens to estrogens, which stimulate glandular proliferation in the fetus.

Gynecomastia peaks during mid-puberty, coinciding with peak height velocity at age 12 to 14 years, and Tanner stage 3 to 4. The pathogenesis is thought to be related to an imbalance in the androgen-to-estrogen ratio, in which a relative increase in extratesticular production of estrogen may play a role in the development of gynecomastia.

Granulosa cell tumors include 2 subtypes, adult and juvenile. Histology shows granulosa cells arranged around collections of eosinophilic fluid, known as Call-Exner bodies, which resemble primordial follicles.

Those of ovarian origin arise from the extraembryonic differentiation of malignant germ cells, which differentiate into trophoblastic structures. Essentially, all choriocarcinomas produce b-hCG, which may lead to precocity in girls and/or irregular vaginal bleeding.

These neoplasms (especially the larger variants) are prone to cause <strong>ovarian torsion</strong>, since they increase the likelihood for the ovary to rotate on the axis of the infundibulopelvic and utero-ovarian ligaments and become fixed in a torsed position.

The main concern in postmenopausal women who present with an adnexal mass is to exclude malignancy. &#160; <br><br>Following a thorough history and physical exam, there are 4 steps that can assist in determining the management. First, an ultrasound should be obtained to determine if the mass is likely benign (simple cyst) or malignant (complex cyst). The differences in sonographic features are summarized in the table below. Complex cysts typically have<strong>&#160;internal vascularity</strong>, which can be seen on Doppler ultrasonography. As neoplastic cells proliferate and grow, their metabolic needs increase, resulting in increased blood vessel formation and growth. &#160; <br><br>The next step is to determine if there is a physiological process that can account for the mass (e.g. hemorrhagic physiologic cyst). The third step is to determine if there are characteristics of a specific entity (e.g. endometrioma usually demonstrates echoes in a cystic mass). The last step is to determine if there is a need for a follow-up ultrasound or additional testing. A repeat of pelvic ultrasound is useful when physiologic processes are still in the differential diagnosis. An MRI should be considered if the results on ultrasound are equivocal. &#160; <br><br>If the mass appears to be malignant, testing for <strong>serum CA-125</strong> has a higher specificity for ovarian malignancy when combined with imaging.
