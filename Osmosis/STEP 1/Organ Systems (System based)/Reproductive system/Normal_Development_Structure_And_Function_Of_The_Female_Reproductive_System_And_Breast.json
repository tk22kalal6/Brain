There is no history of recent infection, sick contacts or change in the color of his stool. The patient was born at term through normal vaginal birth and delivery. At birth, the patient was diagnosed with a right eye condition, but his parents can&#8217;t remember the name.

In contrast, complex cysts usually require follow-up imaging, biopsy, or surgical excision in order to exclude malignancy. &#160;<br><br>The first step in evaluation is ultrasound, which helps to differentiate a <strong>cyst&#160;</strong>from malignancy or abscess as following: &#160;<br><br><ul><li><strong>&#160;</strong><strong>Round&#160;</strong>mass, sharply <strong>demarcated&#160;</strong>with smooth walls.&#160;</li><li>&#160;No echoes (<strong>anechoic</strong>) within the mass.&#160;</li><li>&#160;<strong>Strong posterior wall echo</strong>, indicating good transmission through the cyst.&#160;</li></ul>If all three components of the criteria are satisfied, further evaluation is not necessary, since the likelihood of malignancy is low. If the results of the ultrasonogram are equivocal, if calcifications or septae are seen, or if multiple cysts could mask an underlying carcinoma, a CT scan should follow. &#160;<br><br>A <strong>simple renal cyst</strong> is considered to be present if the following features are observed on CT scan: &#160; &#160;<br><br><ul><li><strong>&#160;</strong>A sharply demarcated lesion with a smooth, thin wall.&#160;</li><li>&#160;Homogeneous fluid within the cyst is, with a density of &lt;20 Hounsfield units (similar to water). &#160;</li><li>&#160;No enhancement of the mass following the administration of contrast, indicating an avascular lesion.

His urinalysis shows the classic appearance of <em><strong>Schistosoma haematobium.&#160;</strong>&#160;</em><br><br>These parasites live in certain types of <strong>freshwater snails</strong>. Cercariae, the infectious form of the parasite, emerge from the snail and contaminate the water. Infection occurs through penetration of the skin. After entering the body, the cercariae shed their tails, and become schistosomula, which migrate through the circulation to the liver, where they mature into adults. The adult worms migrate against portal blood flow to the mesenteric venules of the intestine, the mesenteric venules of the colon, or the vesical venous plexus. The males form a groove in which the females reside and deposit the eggs. The eggs travel to the lumen of the intestine (S. <em>mansoni&#160;</em>and S. <em>japonicum</em>) or <strong>bladder&#160;</strong>and ureters (S. <em>haematobium</em>) and are excreted in feces or urine. &#160;<br><br>The entrapped eggs secrete proteins and carbohydrates that induce a host TH2 immune response, which results in an eosinophilic granulomatous reaction and subsequent tissue inflammation and fibrosis.

      "solution": "This patient presents with a recent history of significant weight loss presents with intermittent gross hematuria and lumbar pain. The abdominal CT scan demonstrates left renal vein compression at its distal segment between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery with mild proximal dilatation. In combination, this presentation is consistent with nutcracker syndrome (NCS). &#160; <br><br>NCS occurs when the <strong>left renal vein,</strong> which drains blood from the left kidney, becomes <strong>squeezed between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)&#160;</strong>and <strong>abdominal aorta</strong>. Normally, the aortomesenteric angle (between SMA and aorta) is around 45 degrees, with the renal vein cushioned by a bit of fat in the mesentery. If there is significant weight loss which shrinks the mesenteric fat, this angle is reduced, and the arteries begin to pinch the left renal vein, causing renal hypertension. Over time, the high pressures cause small breaks in the renal blood vessels. Patients typically present with<strong>&#160;gross hematuria</strong> and <strong>left flank pain</strong> that may improve or worsen depending on positioning. &#160; <br><br>Since the left gonadal vein drains via the left renal vein, nutcracker syndrome can also result in<strong>&#160;left testicular pain</strong> in males or <strong>left lower quadrant pain</strong> in females, especially during intercourse and during menstruation. An unusual manifestation of NCS includes <strong>varicocele&#160;</strong>formation and varicose veins in the lower limbs. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ypqvyLGnT0illKYap83BBonhRe2dICHu/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ureteric stone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Ureteric stones lie within the ureter at any point from the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) to the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ).
