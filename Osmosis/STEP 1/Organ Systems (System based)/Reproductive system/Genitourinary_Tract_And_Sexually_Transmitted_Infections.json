It is usually secondary to absent or dysfunctional follicles that have stopped developing and secreting estrogen in response to gonadotropin stimulation.

The exact pathophysiology is unknown, but it is thought to develop from invagination of endometrial basalis into the myometrium.

Abscesses, however, are usually painful and may present with fever. &#160; <br><br>Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, and physical exam may reveal the presence of a mass in the lower medial labia minora or vulvar vestibule. Management of a Bartholin gland mass depends on its size and whether it is a cyst or abscess. In general, larger cysts or abscesses (&#8805;3 cm) are an indication for incision and drainage, while smaller lesions may be treated with conservative therapy such as warm compresses or sitz baths. Antibiotics may be added for abscess treatment. <br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/RszmT9jfRpS1KQeRWQmANPK1RfK539Oc/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hair follicle:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hair follicle infections are common sites of infection and abscess formation. The mons pubis and labia majora are covered with hair but not the labia minora.

The exact pathogenesis is not well understood, but it is hypothesized that chronic stimulation of the cutaneous nerve results in nerve dysfunction, which accentuates the &#8220;itch-scratch&#8221; cycle.

These medications can be given in either a pulsatile or continuous fashion. When administered in a <strong>pulsatile pattern</strong>, they mimic the physiological secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus.

Epididymitis rarely causes systemic symptoms (e.g., fevers, chills, myalgias), and most patients are afebrile. The diagnosis of acute epididymitis is based on history and physical examination after ruling out other etiologies such as testicular torsion. In all suspected cases, a urinalysis, urine culture, and a urine nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and<em>&#160;C. trachomatis</em> should be performed. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Retrograde ascent of E. coli:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Retrograde ascent of N. gonorrhoeae:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>In males less than 35 years old, sexually transmitted organisms such as <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and, less commonly, <em>Neisseria</em><em>gonorrhoeae</em> are the predominant culprits of epididymitis.

Two months ago, she was diagnosed clinically with a herpes simplex genital infection and treated with antiviral therapy. She is sexually active and began a relationship with a new partner six months ago. Menstrual periods are regular and occur every 28 days for three to five days. Temperature is 38.5&#176;C (101.3&#176;F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg. Physical examination is notable for a diffuse macular rash over the patient&#8217;s palms, soles, and trunk, and enlarged axillary, inguinal, and popliteal lymph nodes are palpable. The abdomen is soft and nontender. External genital examination reveals multiple wart-like lesions on the labia majora and minora. Cervical motion tenderness is absent on bimanual examination. Which of the following best describes this patient&#8217;s vulvar lesions? &#160;",

      "solution": "This patient presents with wart-like genital lesions, diffuse lymphadenopathy, fever, and a diffuse macular rash encompassing the palms and the soles. Together, these findings suggest a diagnosis of <strong>secondary syphilis infection</strong>. The wart-like genital lesions of secondary syphilis are termed <strong>condyloma lata</strong>.<br><br>Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete <strong><em>Treponema pallidum</em></strong>; it is a progressive disease with varying features dependent on the disease stage.<br><br>The clinical manifestations of <strong>primary syphilis</strong> include a <strong>single painless ulcer</strong> with raised margins and indurated borders that manifests 1-3 weeks after initial infection.<br><br><strong>Secondary syphilis</strong> is characterized by fever, a <strong>diffuse, symmetric macular rash on the trunk and extremities involving the palms and soles</strong>, and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Additionally, condyloma lata is a characteristic clinical manifestation of secondary syphilis which appears as multiple, flat-topped, wart-like, painless mucosal growths in the genital region. These lesions hold a high concentration of spirochetes and are considered highly infectious.<br><br><strong>Latent syphilis</strong> refers to asymptomatic individuals infected with <em>T. pallidum</em> identified solely based on serologic testing. Patients with early latent syphilis (an infection that occurred within the previous 12 months) can transmit the infection to their recent sexual contacts, and they therefore require treatment with penicillin.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Condylomata lata:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Gumma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Gummatous syphilitic lesions are characteristic of tertiary syphilis infection and present as granulomatous or nodular lesions that appear on skin and bones.
