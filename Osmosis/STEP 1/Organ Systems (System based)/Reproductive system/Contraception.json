      "text": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the clinic for her postpartum visit. &#160;She complains of significant pain around the vagina that worsens during sexual intercourse and when sitting down. Medical history during pregnancy is significant for gestational diabetes mellitus treated with NPH insulin. Six weeks ago, she delivered a 4.5 kg male baby after a prolonged, forceps-assisted vaginal delivery that resulted in a second-degree perineal tear. Past medical history includes depression treated with venlafaxine and escitalopram. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 105/75 mmHg. &#160;The perineal laceration is intact. &#160;Perianal wink reflex is absent. &#160;Pain is not reproducible on speculum examination, and vulvar examination is non-tender. The vagina has a scant clear discharge. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient&#8217;s condition? &#160; ",

She most likely has a pudendal nerve injury due to compression of the nerve fibers during delivery. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The pudendal nerve arises from the sacral plexus's<strong>&#160;S2, S3, S4</strong> ventral rami. It originates in the pelvis, courses through the greater foramen to enter the gluteal region, then enters the perineum through the lesser sciatic foramen. It is related to the<strong>&#160;ischial spine,</strong> which serves as the bony landmark for transvaginal pudendal nerve block for episiotomies during the second stage of labor. The perineum courses through the pudendal canal and terminates into its branches in the ischioanal fossa. The pudendal nerve carries sensory, motor, and autonomic fibers and supplies the <strong>skin of the perineum</strong> (including the anal canal below the pectinate line) and the clitoris with muscular branches to the anterior external anal sphincter and the urogenital muscles. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In the second stage of labor, the descent of the fetal head causes significant compression and stretching of the pudendal nerve, resulting in <strong>pudendal neuralgia.</strong> This is especially prevalent in cases of difficult or prolonged labor. It is more likely to be encountered following an operative delivery or an extensive perineal tear. Symptoms of pudendal neuralgia include pain, numbness, and paresthesias in the distribution of the pudendal nerve in addition to urinary and anal sphincter dysfunction resulting in urinary and fecal incontinence and dyspareunia. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Pudendal nerve injury&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypoestrogenism due to prolactinemia&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Patients who breastfeed have elevated prolactin levels that suppress GnRH release from the hypothalamus. &#160;This results in low levels of estrogen, FSH, LH, and vulvovaginal atrophy. &#160; Atrophic vulvovaginal changes can cause dyspareunia.
