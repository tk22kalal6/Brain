In males <strong>less than 35 years old</strong>, this infection is most commonly associated with sexually transmitted organisms including <strong><em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em></strong> and, less commonly, <strong><em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em></strong>. In males older than 35 years, and those without sexual partners, the most common organisms are gram-negative bacteria, predominantly<strong><em>&#160;Escherichia coli</em></strong>. In some patients, the infection can spread to the testicle, resulting in orchitis. Isolated cases of orchitis are rare and are more often seen with viral etiologies (e.g. mumps).<br><br>It is important to differentiate epididymitis from testicular torsion, which is another cause of testicular and scrotal pain. <strong>The Prehn sign</strong> is a helpful differentiating physical examination maneuver that is typically positive in patients with epididymitis. The exam is considered positive when <strong>elevation of the affected testis results in relief of pain</strong>, whereas in testicular torsion, any testicular manipulation exacerbates the pain. Additionally, patients with epididymitis have an <strong>intact cremaster reflex</strong>, whereas patients with testicular torsion have an absent reflex. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Relief of pain with manual elevation of the right testis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ High-riding right testis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>A high-riding testis occurs when the testis moves to a more superior scrotal position.

A second-degree perineal tear involves injury to the perineal body. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Perineal tears are a common obstetric injury following difficult vaginal childbirth. They are distinct from an episiotomy, an intentional enlargement of the vaginal introitus to facilitate delivery. &#160; <br><br>An episiotomy is a surgical incision that involves the perineum and the posterior vaginal wall during the second stage of labor. Episiotomies are done to minimize perineal injuries caused by overstretching the perineum by the fetal head; however, they are not routinely <strong>indicated</strong>. &#160;Possible indications for an episiotomy include conditions when the physician anticipates a perineal tear, elderly primigravida, macrosomia, face to pubis delivery, forceps/ventouse delivery, breech delivery, or shoulder dystocia. &#160; &#160;<br><br>There are two common <strong>approaches&#160;</strong>to an episiotomy; a mediolateral approach and a median approach. &#160;In a <strong>mediolateral episiotomy,</strong> the incision is made at an angle and proceeds from the vaginal opening diagonally downwards to the left or the right in a straight line that runs an inch away from the anus. &#160;During a mediolateral episiotomy, structures incised include the posterior vaginal wall, superficial and deep transverse perineal muscles, bulbospongiosus, part of the levator ani, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. &#160; <br><br>In the <strong>median episiotomy</strong>, the incision proceeds from the vaginal opening downwards. Median episiotomies bifurcate the perineal body, which supports the female pelvic organs, particularly the posterior vaginal wall. Incision of the perineal body poses a risk of pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence. Midline episiotomies can also extend into the anal sphincter and cause sphincter dysfunction and fecal incontinence. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/uWVZ64HDSceOf5SmIYZBFWjUSv_ARI3k/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/lsAuTeclQO_r3HxUMKV01-nGTomXgFF3/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Perineal body&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Anal mucosa:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Fourth-degree perineal tears involve the anal sphincter complex and the anal mucosa.

It arises from the ischial tuberosity and inserts into the crura of the clitoris. It is unlikely to be involved in second-degree perineal tears. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Internal anal sphincter&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The anal sphincter complex (internal anal sphincter and the external anal sphincter) are damaged in fourth-degree perineal lacerations. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ External anal sphincter&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Severe perineal lacerations of the third and fourth degrees tend to involve the external anal sphincter and result in fecal incontinence. &#160;&#160;</span></div>",
