She most likely has a ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Ectopic pregnancy</strong> is an extrauterine pregnancy and commonly occurs in the uterine tubes. It should be suspected in women of reproductive age with risk factors for a tubal pregnancy, including the previous history of tubal pregnancy, IUD use, sterilization, and history of tubal disease. Laboratory investigations would reveal a rising beta hCG level, and imaging could reveal an extra ovarian adnexal mass/ extrauterine gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The fallopian tubes are situated in the upper margin of the broad ligament of the uterus and are divided anatomically into 4 divisions; the infundibulum, the ampulla, the isthmus, and the intramural or interstitial part of the tube. The isthmus forms the medial one-third of the tube. The ampulla forms the lateral two-thirds and is the site of fertilization. The infundibulum forms the lateral end of the uterine tube and is attached to the tubal pole of the ovary. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Due to its close proximity to the ovary, ovarian torsion or rupture are often considered in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen in a woman of reproductive age. However, these differentials are unlikely to cause abnormal vaginal bleeding or amenorrhea. A transvaginal ultrasound can further aid in distinguishing ovarian pathologies from a tubal pregnancy. Ovarian torsion on a pelvic ultrasound would reveal an adnexal mass with the absent flow on a doppler USG. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/mWG2qVr8Tu24-pepta_1kv2jQTuhTJPm/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Simple ciliated columnar epithelium:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Simple cuboidal epithelium&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Simple cuboidal epithelium covers the epithelial surface of the ovary.

The disorder is caused by <strong>placental and maternal vascular dysfunction</strong> and typically resolves after delivery. The pathogenesis involves abnormal development of the uteroplacental circulation that results in <strong>placental hypoperfusion</strong> and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, second trimester fetal death, abruptio placentae, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm labor. On examination, preeclampsia is associated with a variety of manifestations such as <strong>generalized hyperreflexia</strong> or clonus, amaurosis fugax, epigastric pain, oliguria, peripheral or pulmonary edema, and even stroke.

The ultrasound results show a classic <strong>\"Swiss cheese pattern,\"</strong> favoring the diagnosis of <strong>molar pregnancy</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Hydatidiform mole (also known as a molar pregnancy or mole), is a premalignant disease that is caused by aberrant fertilization. A molar pregnancy can be categorized as a complete mole or partial mole, which differ by pathogenesis, gross morphology, histopathology, karyotype, and risk of malignancy. Complete moles are formed by the <strong>duplication of the haploid genes of a single sperm</strong> following fertilization of an empty ovum and therefore are <strong>diploid 46,XX</strong>. Less commonly, 46,XY karyotype may occur due to dispermic fertilization of an empty ovum. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Partial moles occur due to fertilization of a normal ovum by two sperm and therefore are triploid (69,XXX, 69,XXY, or 69,XYY). Compared to complete mole, hCG levels are typically far lower in partial moles, and uterine size is often normal. Additionally, hyperemesis gravidarum, hyperthyroidism, and theca lutein cysts are less common since these features are caused by severely elevated b-hCG levels. On ultrasound, both conditions are characterized by ultrasound appearance of cystic spaces (\"Swiss cheese pattern\"), but fetal parts may be seen in a partial mole. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Although benign, molar pregnancy increases the risk for invasive disease (e.g., choriocarcinoma, invasive mole). The risk is higher with a complete mole. Treatment is evacuation, which is both therapeutic and diagnostic. Monitoring hCG following treatment is required to detect signs of invasive disease. At the same time, contraceptives are used for several months during the monitoring phase to prevent confusion with normal pregnancies. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/eTnF1p3MQBue31-kKsSZIiIpQUKQ9-oX/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ 46, XX:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 46, XO:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This karyotype is consistent with Turner syndrome, a genetic condition characterized by partly or completely missing an X chromosome in a female.

The classic presentation is painless late-pregnancy vaginal bleeding. Normally, the placenta implants in the upper uterus, and although it is unclear why it implants in the lower uterus in placenta previa, one hypothesis suggests that areas of suboptimal vascularity in the upper uterine cavity from previous damage (e.g. surgery) promotes implantation in the lower part. Significant risk factors include <strong>previous cesarean deliveries</strong>, <strong>previous uterine surgery</strong>, <strong>multiple gestations</strong>, and <strong>previous placenta previa</strong>. It is important to note that the presence of pain and tender uterus makes the diagnosis of placenta previa unlikely. &#160; <br><br>The vast majority of placenta previas are identified on <strong>ultrasound&#160;</strong>examination before 20 weeks gestation and typically resolve spontaneously before delivery. In asymptomatic patients &lt; 37 weeks of gestation, management includes follow up with transvaginal ultrasound. If the previa resolves, routine prenatal care can resume.

A molar pregnancy can be categorized as a complete mole or partial mole, which differ by pathogenesis, gross morphology, histopathology, karyotype, and risk of malignancy. Patients often present with vaginal bleeding and hyperemesis gravidarum. Although benign, molar pregnancy increases the risk for invasive disease (e.g., choriocarcinoma, invasive mole).

Patients often present with painless vaginal bleeding upon rupture of membranes, accompanied by fetal heart rate abnormalities such as bradycardia or sinusoidal pattern. <strong>Fetal exsanguination</strong> can occur within minutes. The exact pathogenesis of vasa previa is unknown. Risk factors for developing vasa previa include velamentous cord insertion, umbilical cord insertion in the lower uterus, placenta previa or low-lying placenta, succenturiate placental lobe or bilobed placenta, in vitro fertilization, and multiple gestations. Diagnosis of vasa previa is made by demonstrating the fetal vessels passing across the internal cervical os by transvaginal ultrasound examination with color Doppler. Delivery is usually made via planned cesarean delivery at 34 to 35 weeks of gestation or by emergency cesarean delivery if a rupture occurred. Vasa previa is often associated with velamentous umbilical cord insertion, in which the umbilical inserts to the chorioamniotic membranes instead of the placenta and therefore is not protected by Wharton's jelly. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/hZ6xpjwtTp2Te5o6n_n1kArSTWuqTN3N/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Placenta accreta:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Placenta accreta refers to a placenta that attaches to the myometrium without penetrating it.

It stimulates uterine contraction by binding to Gq protein-coupled receptors. Once activated, these receptors activate another molecule called phospholipase C. Phospholipase C cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate.

Progestins with androgenic activity can also cause acne, hirsutism, seborrhea, voice deepening, changes in liver protein production, and <strong>weight gain</strong>. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/NgPTGh8yTASLCj9kcvbVFcQUQCmlbR1X/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Menstrual irregularities:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Type 2 diabetes mellitus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although estrogen oral contraceptive pills have shown to increase the risk of glucose intolerance, progestins have not been linked to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Breast cancer:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The data for progestin-only contraceptives are inadequate to make a definitive conclusion regarding the risk of breast cancer. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Endometrial hyperplasia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Progestins reverse endometrial hyperplasia via activation of progesterone receptors, which results in stromal decidualization and subsequent thinning of the endometrium.

      "solution": "This patient is presenting with a palpable, nontender breast mass, nontender lymph nodes, a negative mammogram, and an ultrasound revealing a mass, all of which raises suspicion for a breast malignancy. The biopsy results show a classic picture of cells that invaded the stroma aligned in a &#8220;<strong>single-file</strong>,&#8221; which is characteristic of<strong>&#160;invasive lobular carcinoma</strong>. While most tumors appear as a palpable mass or mammographic density, a subgroup of invasive lobular carcinomas do not, as seen here. This allows lobular carcinomas to be clinically occult and difficult to detect by imaging, which often results in a worse prognosis. &#160;<br><br>Invasive lobular carcinoma arises from the terminal duct lobular unit, spreads into the lobules, and crosses the basement membrane into the stroma. It is the 2nd most common cause of invasive breast carcinomas and accounts for up to 15% of the cases. Morphologically, it consists of infiltrating cells similar to the tumor cells seen in lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Approximately one-third of women with LCIS eventually develop invasive carcinoma. Importantly, invasive carcinoma may arise secondary to LCIS in the same breast or in the contralateral breast, and therefore, <strong>bilateral imaging is indicated. &#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>In contrast to other types of breast cancer, which often metastasizes to the bone, brain and liver, invasive lobular carcinoma has a unique metastatic pattern, as it spreads to the <strong>cerebrospinal fluid, serosal surfaces, gastrointestinal tract, ovary, uterus, and bone marrow.</strong> The majority of lobular carcinomas express hormone (estrogen, progesterone) receptors, whereas HER2 overexpression is rare. Treatment usually conosist of clinical and radiologic follow-up, chemoprevention with tamoxifen or, less commonly, bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/u7zz9ZxeQMSDfTL6HZUUkON5RVCvbmfN/_.png\"></div><br>&#160;Reproduced from: Wikimedia Commons &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/FtzDXGqoRAO__9Ks6_Kd7sncSk6xdBpT/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ductal carcinoma in situ:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive breast cancer which arises from the terminal duct lobular unit, spreads into the lactiferous duct and does not cross the basement membrane.
