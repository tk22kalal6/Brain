      "solution": "This patient has a history of recurrent miscarriages. Laboratory testing is unremarkable and imagining reveals a <strong>bicornuate uterus.&#160;</strong>This condition arises due to <strong>incomplete fusion of the M&#252;llerian ducts. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Uterine anomalies</strong> describe anatomical malformations of the uterus that are present at birth. &#160; &#160;<br><br>A <strong>septate uterus</strong> occurs when the M&#252;llerian ducts fuse, but the <strong>septum between the ducts persists</strong>. The condition can lead to decreased fertility and increased risk of early miscarriage or pregnancy loss. Diagnosis can be made with <strong>imaging techniques</strong> (e.g., ultrasound, hysterosalpingogram, MRI) revealing the presence of a midline septum. &#160; <br><br>A<strong>&#160;bicornuate uterus</strong> occurs due to <strong>incomplete fusion of the M&#252;llerian ducts.</strong> As a result, the uterus develops two upper horns above the uterine body, giving it a heart shape. The finding can be observed on imaging. The condition can lead to an increased risk of complicated pregnancy, fetal malpresentation, early miscarriage, and preterm birth. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Finally, <strong>uterus didelphys</strong> occurs due to <strong>complete failure of M&#252;llerian duct fusion</strong>. As a result, patients will have a double uterus, double cervix, and double vagina. While pregnancy remains possible, patients are at increased risk of early miscarriage and preterm birth. Imaging will reveal two uncommunicated uteruses, each one with its own fallopian tube. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/64OFp8LTTm2EIcTP9tZO1l34QpGvHoZ2/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Complete failure of M&#252;llerian duct fusion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Uterus didelphys occurs when there is complete failure in fusion of the M&#252;llerian ducts. As a result, individuals will have two uteruses, two cervixes, and two vaginas. In contrast, this patient&#8217;s imaging demonstrates a single vagina and cervix but two uteruses, which is more suggestive of a bicornuate uterus. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Proliferation of benign uterine smooth muscle tumors:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Uterine fibroids are caused by benign proliferation of smooth muscle.

The condition will lead to an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). In contrast, this patient&#8217;s PTT is within normal limits, making antiphospholipid syndrome unlikely.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Incomplete fusion of the M&#252;llerian ducts:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reduced hypothalamic hormone release:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Excessive exercise can lead to reduced hypothalamic secretion of GnRH, which subsequently impairs pituitary release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The condition can manifest with amenorrhea and infertility. While this patient has a history of training for marathons, her BMI is within normal limits, and she has been having monthly menstrual periods. Furthermore, imaging findings are more suggestive of a uterine abnormality as the underlying cause of her prior miscarriages.&#160;</span></div>",

Initially, inheritance of the Y chromosome and expression of its genetic content drives development of the gonad towards testicle formation. In the second phase of sexual differentiation, the secretion of growth factors and intercellular paracrine signalling (driven by the genes listed in the above table) drives external genital development and maturation.

These findings are indicative of a hormonal deficiency during development, specifically of <strong>androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)</strong>. <br><br>AIS is a disorder that arises secondary to <strong>defective androgen receptors</strong>. Androgens are created in the testes and adrenal gland and subsequently enter systemic circulation.

A mutation of the androgen receptor silences this process, arresting phenotypic masculinization, resulting in de-facto development of female phenotypic characteristics.

In combination, these findings are concerning for <strong>Klinefelter syndrome&#160;</strong>(XXY)<strong>.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br><strong>Advanced maternal age</strong> is a major risk factor for the development of chromosomal abnormalities. Studies have demonstrated that as women become older, <strong>age-dependent changes&#160;</strong><strong>in the sister chromatid cohesion complex&#160;</strong>that form during <strong>meiosis&#160;</strong><strong>I</strong> are responsible for aberrancies in chromosomal translocation. Specifically, proteins responsible for pairing the chromatids, such as SMC1 Beta, have decreased function with advanced maternal age. &#160; <br><br>&#160;There are five main chromosomal disorders associated with advanced maternal age, and they include the trisomies (21, 18, and 13), Triple X syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome. <strong>Down syndrome (trisomy 21)</strong> is the most common autosomal chromosome abnormality associated with increased maternal age. &#160; <br><br>&#160;There are four main chromosomal abnormalities associated with the sex chromosomes. These include Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, Triple X syndrome (XXX), and Jacobs syndrome (XYY). Among these four disorders, Klinefelter Syndrome is the most prevalent. &#160; <br><br>Of note, Turner syndrome and Jacobs syndrome are typically caused by meiotic nondisjunction of the paternal gametes.

During development, the testes are formed retroperitoneally and descend into the scrotum via the inguinal canal. Normally, the proximal portion of the processus vaginalis obliterates while the distal portion persists as the tunica vaginalis. Therefore, the tunica vaginalis becomes a potential space for fluid collection. In the case of a patent processus vaginalis, peritoneal fluid is allowed to move into the scrotum, forming a hydrocele.<br><br>A characteristic feature of hydroceles is their ability to <strong>transilluminate</strong>. An ultrasound, although not necessary for diagnosis, typically reveals an anechoic or echolucent area surrounding the testis. Most primary causes of hydrocele require no surgery.
