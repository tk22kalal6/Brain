Five weeks ago, the patient developed a rash, headache, and fever. The rash started from the wrist and spread to the ankles, trunk, palms, and soles. Her primary care physician suspected Rocky Mountain spotted fever and prescribed an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by blocking peptidyltransferase at the 50S ribosomal subunit. The patient was not aware that she was pregnant at that time. The last menstrual period was approximately 15 weeks ago. She is concerned about the potential side effects on her baby. Which is the most common finding in a child exposed to this antibiotic in utero? &#160;",

It is a <strong>bacteriostatic&#160;</strong>antibiotic. It is well absorbed perorally and parenterally and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, so clients could use it to treat bacterial meningitis. Chloramphenicol is effective against some<strong><em>&#160;Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides species, and Rickettsia species</em></strong>. However, due to its severe toxicity, it is no longer used systemically in most countries with access to safer alternatives. The drug is sometimes used as a<strong>&#160;topical antimicrobial agent&#160;</strong>for bacterial conjunctivitis. &#160; <br><br><strong>Resistance&#160;</strong>to chloramphenicol occurs via plasmid-encoded <strong>acetyltransferase</strong>, which inactivates the drug.

      "solution": "<strong>Priapism</strong> refers to a pathological penile erection in the absence of sexual arousal; it is a <strong>urological emergency</strong>. &#160;Identifying priapism and prompt treatment is paramount, as delayed urologic care may result in permanent erectile dysfunction. There are two main types of priapism: ischemic and nonischemic:<br><br><ul><li><strong>&#160;Ischemic (low-flow) priapism</strong> presents with a painful, rigid erection secondary to impaired relaxation and<strong>&#160;paralysis of cavernosal smooth muscle</strong>. This process results in a <strong>compartment syndrome of the penis</strong>, with resultant hypoxemia and acidemia in cavernosal tissue.&#160;</li><li><strong>Nonischemic (high-flow) priapism</strong> usually presents <strong>following genital trauma</strong>, without a painful or rigid erection. It occurs less commonly than ischemic priapism and results from a fistula between the cavernosal artery and corpus cavernosum.</li></ul>Ischemic priapism is far more common, and it occurs secondary to hypercoagulable states (e.g., <strong>sickle cell disease</strong>, thalassemia), neurologic diseases (e.g. spinal cord stenosis), metastatic disease (e.g., prostate cancer, bladder cancer) and medications that relax smooth muscles (e.g., trazodone, prostaglandins, hydralazine). The precise pathophysiology of priapism secondary to sickle cell disease is not fully understood; however, is thought to be due to a combination vaso-occlusion and a regulatory defect in the nitric oxide pathway.<br><br>Enhancement of venous outflow is the goal in management of ischemic priapism, and intracavernosal injection of<strong>&#160;phenylephrine</strong> is commonly performed. The alpha-agonist effects of phenylephrine contract the cavernosal smooth muscle, allowing for reentry of oxygenated blood through the penis. In addition, aspiration of static cavernosal blood is performed to further promote venous outflow and detumescence.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Paralysis of cavernosal smooth muscle and impaired venous outflow:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Fistula formation between the cavernosal artery and corpus cavernosum:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Nonischemic priapism (also known as high-flow) occurs less commonly than ischemic priapism and is usually the result of a fistula between the cavernosal artery and corpus cavernosum.

These findings are suggestive of ovarian torsion, which necessitates urgent intervention. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Ovarian torsion is a common gynecological emergency among women of reproductive age, although it can occur in any age group.<strong>&#160;Clinical symptoms</strong> include sudden onset abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting with or without an adnexal mass. The most important <strong>risk factor</strong> for adnexal torsion is the presence of ovarian cysts or tumors, particularly those greater than 5 cm in size. Ovarian tumors are more common amongst women of reproductive age as most benign tumors (functional cyst, corpus luteum cysts) are associated with hormonal changes and ovulation induction therapy. <strong>Pathogenesis&#160;</strong>of ovarian torsion involves rotation of the ovary around the axis of its ligamentous attachment, the infundibulopelvic ligament. The presence of a large ovarian mass increases the likelihood of torsion. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The <strong>infundibulopelvic ligament/suspensory ligament of the ovary&#160;</strong>attaches the superior pole of the ovary to the pelvic sidewall and contains the ovarian vessels. Rotation around its axis can impair the blood supply to the ovaries, which are detected as decreased blood flow on a doppler USG. Compression of the blood vessels impairs lymphatic and venous drainage and impedes arterial supply.

She most likely has a genitourinary fistula. &#160; &#160;<br><br>A fistula is a pathological communication formed between two epithelialized surfaces. Genitourinary fistulas form between the urinary and genital tracts. The transmission can occur between the bladder (vesicovaginal) or urethra (urethrovaginal) and the genital tract. Fistulas in the genital tract can result from obstetric trauma to the vaginal wall (instrumental vaginal delivery), ischemia to the vaginal wall from prolonged and obstructed labor, malignancies of the genital tract, operative injuries (eg, abdominal hysterectomies), or radiation therapy. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In developing countries, the most common cause of fistulas is obstetric trauma. Prolonged compression of the bladder wall between the fetal head and symphysis pubis can cause ischemia, necrosis, and sloughing to form a fistula. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Vesicovaginal fistulas</strong> are aberrant communications between the bladder and the vagina. Clinical symptoms include the continuous passage of urine from the vaginal opening. A visible vaginal defect and pooling of clear fluid in the vagina are noted on clinical examination. <strong>Rectovaginal fistulas</strong> are pathologic communications formed between the lower gastrointestinal tract and the vagina and most commonly result from obstetric trauma, including inadequately healed perineal lacerations. They can also occur as a complication from Crohn&#8217;s disease. Clinical symptoms include malodorous, brown vaginal discharge and a posterior vaginal defect noted on physical examination. &#160; Treatment involves surgical repair. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Aberrant connection between the bladder and vagina&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Neurogenic bladder dysfunction&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Diabetic neuropathy can cause neurogenic bladder dysfunction and result in incomplete bladder emptying and overflow incontinence.

Most of the organisms are part of the endogenous cervicovaginal flora that travel upwards during labor and delivery. <strong>Route of delivery&#160;</strong>is the most important risk factor in the development of postpartum endometritis. Up to 30% of cases occur after <strong>cesarean deliveries</strong> (especially those performed after the onset of labor or rupture of membranes) as compared to &lt;3% after vaginal birth. Other proposed risk factors include prolonged rupture of membranes, retained products of conception following delivery, uncontrolled maternal diabetes and heavy vaginal colonization by E. coli. However, none is as significant as the route of delivery. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Endometritis can be either acute or chronic. Acute endometritis typically presents with symptoms like fever, vaginal discharge and/or bleeding, lower abdominal pain, dysuria and cervical motion and uterine tenderness, whereas chronic endometritis is usually asymptomatic with normal physical examination. <strong>Presence of neutrophils</strong> on microscopic examination is the hallmark of <strong>acute&#160;</strong>endometritis, whereas as plasma cells are seen in chronic endometritis.
