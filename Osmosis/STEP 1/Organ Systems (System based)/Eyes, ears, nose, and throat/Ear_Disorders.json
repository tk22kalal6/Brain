      "solution": "Topical pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist that can be used to treat <strong>open-angle glaucoma</strong> (OAG).<br><br><strong>Cholinergic agonists</strong> (e.g., pilocarpine, carbachol) lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) by causing <strong>muscarinic-induced contraction of the ciliary muscle</strong>, which facilitates <strong>aqueous outflow</strong> via the trabecular meshwork. They do not affect aqueous production. Pilocarpine is very effective at opening meshwork into the canal of Schlemm and can be used in acute angle-closure glaucoma.<br><br><strong>Ciliary body spasm</strong> is a muscarinic cholinergic effect that can induce myopia and refraction due to iris and ciliary body contraction. The drug effect waxes and wanes between doses. <strong>Headaches </strong>can also occur from the iris and ciliary body contraction. The ocular side effects have decreased the utilization of these drugs, and they are not typically first-line medications used in OAG. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased secretion of aqueous humor from the ciliary epithelium:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Beta-blockers (e.g., timolol. betaxolol, and carvedilol) are an effective treatment option for glaucoma.
