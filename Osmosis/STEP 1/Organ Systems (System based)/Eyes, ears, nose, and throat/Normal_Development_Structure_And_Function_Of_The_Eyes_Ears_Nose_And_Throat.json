It can cause an <strong>elevation in hematocrit</strong> as a side effect.<br><br>Testosterone derivatives are a group of <strong>androgenic hormones</strong> that have the structure of testosterone. Testosterone cypionate is one of these derivatives used intramuscularly, while fluoxymesterone and methyltestosterone are oral ones. Testosterone derivatives are usually used in androgen replacement therapy in patients with primary or secondary hypogonadism. It can also stimulate anabolism in patients with severe catabolic states (e.g. burn patients).<br><br>Side effects of testosterone derivatives are common. First, these drugs stimulate erythropoiesis, leading to increased erythrocyte production and <strong>hematocrit</strong>. Furthermore, they can increase the growth of the prostate gland as testosterone will be converted to dihydrotestosterone, which directly stimulates the <strong>growth of the prostate gland</strong>. Because of this effect, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can increase in patients taking testosterone derivatives, and sometimes there is a slightly increased risk of prostate cancer.

This organ is mechanically coupled to the external environment by the tympanic membrane and the middle ear ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes).
