      "solution": "When light enters the eye, it hits the retina, where phototransduction (the process by which light waves are converted into electrical signals) occurs. From the retina, electrical signals are sent to the brain for visual processing. &#160; <br><br>When light enters the eye, the temporal field of vision is projected to the opposite side, onto the medial nasal retina, and the nasal field of vision gets projected to the opposite side, onto the lateral temporal retina. The visual fields are further divided into the superior and inferior visual fields, so the visual fields are actually divided into quadrants. The superior visual field projects to the inferior retina, and the inferior visual field projects to the superior retina. The visual information that appears in the right upper quadrant projects to the left lower retina. &#160; <br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Tze3m81DQcGWz1hPpdoi1PBOTqeZClXr/_.png\"></div><br>When light hits the retina, it first triggers visual receptor cells, called <strong>rods and cones</strong> (rods primarily contribute to night-time vision, whereas cones primarily contribute to day-time vision), which synapse with<strong> bipolar cells</strong>, which in turn synapse with <strong>ganglion cells</strong>. The axons of the ganglion cells pass caudally through the optic nerve and optic tract to end in the lateral geniculate body in the thalamus. There is an area in the retina where the optic nerve exit doesn't have any receptor cells; this area is called the <strong>blind spot.</strong> In the geniculate body, the fibers from the nasal half of one retina and the temporal half of the other synapse on the cells whose axons form the geniculocalcarine tract. This tract passes to the occipital lobe of the cerebral cortex. &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/JRBB_bE9SOmUYPcpwYvEdo_NQXOeJWlv/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Bipolar cells &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This answer choice is incorrect.
