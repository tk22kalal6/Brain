      "solution": "This patient&#8217;s presentation with signs and symptoms of <strong>space occupying lesions</strong> (e.g., focal neurological deficits, seizure) and CT imaging evidence of <strong>multiple round lesions</strong> is highly suggestive of metastatic disease. In this case, it is most likely due to melanoma, a dermatologic malignancy that usually responds well to <strong>vemurafenib</strong>.<br><br>Melanoma is the <strong>most aggressive</strong> form of skin malignancy with high rates of metastasis. The most common genetic mutation seen in the neoplastic tissues involves <strong><em>BRAF</em></strong> (up to 60% of the cases), which is a <strong>protein kinase</strong> involved in activating signaling pathways for melanocyte proliferation. Its point mutation results in a <strong>valine to glutamic acid substitution</strong> at position 600 of the protein. The end result is continuous activation of BRAF, which causes <strong>uncontrolled proliferation </strong>of atypical melanocytes. <strong>Vemurafenib</strong> is a monoclonal antibody directed against BRAF kinase, thereby blocking cellular proliferation in the cancerous cells. It is a preferred agent in patients with metastatic melanoma who test positive for the BRAF V600E mutation. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pyrimidine antimetabolite interfering with DNA synthesis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>5-fluorouracil is a pyrimidine antimetabolite that interferes with DNA synthesis, thereby preventing proliferation of rapidly growing cells.

      "solution": "This patient has metastatic melanoma. Treatment for melanoma is based on staging and localization of the disease. Localized melanoma that has not spread to lymph nodes is treated surgically. For thicker, but still localized lesions, surgical resection and adjuvant therapy is recommended (e.g. alpha interferon). For metastatic disease, treatment with hydroxyurea, vemurafenib, and radiation therapy may be used. <br><br><strong>Hydroxyurea </strong>is an antineoplastic drug that inhibits <strong>ribonucleotide reductase</strong>, which is an enzyme that converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides used in DNA synthesis. Thus, inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase impairs DNA synthesis and cellular division.<br><br>Hydroxyurea is used mainly to treat <strong>chronic myelogenous leukemia</strong> and other <strong>chronic myeloproliferative disorders</strong> (e.g. polycythemia vera). In addition, it is used to treat <strong>head and neck cancers</strong> and <strong>malignant melanoma</strong>.<br><br>Aside from its use as an anticancer agent, hydroxyurea is also used in patients with <strong>sickle cell anemia</strong> to reduce the frequency of acute pain crises and need for blood transfusion. These effects are achieved by stimulating the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and increasing water content in erythrocytes.<br><br><strong>Macrocytosis </strong>is usually seen in patients taking hydroxyurea. While not related to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, the administration of folate alongside hydroxyurea can help mitigate this side effect. Other adverse effects include severe <strong>myelosuppression </strong>and <strong>gastrointestinal toxicity</strong> (e.g., nausea, mucositis). &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Peripheral neuropathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Peripheral neuropathy is commonly associated with the use of vincristine, which inhibits microtubules assembly.
