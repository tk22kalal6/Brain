The patient visited several months ago to evaluate mild trembling of his hands and a slow, shuffling gait. The physician started the patient on an anti-Parkinsonian medication at the time. The patient states that his tremors have improved, but he noticed a rash on his lower legs several weeks after starting the medication. The rash is not itchy or painful. Vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a widespread, patchy rash on the lower legs as shown in the image below.

The reticular, lacy nature suggests<strong>&#160;livedo reticularis,</strong> likely caused by recent <strong>amantadine&#160;</strong>use. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Amantadine is an antiviral medication that was found to have antiparkinsonian activity. Studies have demonstrated that amantadine acts on dopaminergic neurons as a weak, non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor, where it <strong>increases dopamine release</strong> and <strong>prevents dopamine reuptake.&#160;</strong>The primary clinical use of amantadine includes treatment of early PD, although it can be used as adjunctive treatment with levodopa. &#160; <br><br>Central side effects associated with amantadine include <strong>confusion</strong>, hallucinations, insomnia, and nightmares. These are more common in older patients but can occur in patients of any age. Peripheral side effects include<strong>&#160;livedo reticularis</strong> and ankle edema; however, these side effects are typically benign and not treatment-limiting. The mechanism of amantadine-induced livedo reticularis is thought to occur secondary to altered catecholamine metabolism, which induces vasoconstriction in the dermal arterioles and limits flow to the capillary skin surface. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Amantadine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Selegiline:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Selegiline, an MAO-B inhibitor, is often used in patients &lt;65 years of age with mild Parkinson symptoms. A major side effect of MAO-B inhibitors includes drug interactions.

The exact pathophysiology underlying the sign of Leser-Trelat is uncertain, but there is strong suspicion that the release of <strong>cytokines</strong> and <strong>growth factors</strong> from the underlying neoplasm stimulates the eruptive growth of the seborrheic keratoses, such as overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). &#160; <br><br>On physical examination, seborrheic keratoses are well-demarcated, round or oval lesions that can appear in various colors and have a dull, verrucous and slightly elevated surface.

They usually have hair growing out of them. On the other hand, <strong>acquired melanocytic nevi</strong> appear later in life. Patients with familial predisposition, sun exposure, and lightly pigmented skin are at increased risk of developing acquired nevi. &#160; <br><br>Acquired nevi can further be classified as common or atypical. <strong>Common nevi</strong> are benign tumors of melanocytes. They are symmetrical, evenly pigmented, have well-demarcated borders, and small (diameter &lt; 5 mm). Common nevi can then be divided into junctional and intradermal nevi. <strong>Junctional nevi,</strong> which are characterized by the proliferation of melanocytes at the <strong>dermal-epidermal junction,</strong> typically manifest as flat macules. <strong>Intradermal nevi,</strong> which are characterized by the proliferation of melanocytes within the dermis, typically manifest as elevated papules. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Lastly, there are <strong>atypical nevi,</strong> which are asymmetrical, inconsistently pigmented, and large (diameter &gt; 5 mm) with irregular borders.

This symptom occurs since the fungus degrades lipids in the skin, which produces acids that damage melanocytes and cause inflammation. Patients can develop either hypo- or hyperpigmentation.

      "solution": "The examination findings of a <strong>hyperkeratotic</strong> nodule in the setting of <strong>prolonged sunlight exposure</strong> (construction worker), together with biopsy findings of <strong>atypical keratinocytes with keratin pearls and deep dermal invasion</strong>, are characteristic of <strong>invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)</strong>.<br><br>cSCC is the second most common skin cancer, and it frequently affects fair-skinned individuals with a history of<strong>&#160;prolonged sun exposure</strong>, immunosuppression, chronic non-healing wounds, and/or chronic arsenic exposure. It commonly involves sun-exposed areas including face, lower lips, ears and<strong>&#160;hands</strong>. The lesion appears as<strong>&#160;0.5-1.5 cm</strong> indurated or <strong>firm plaque</strong> or <strong>papule</strong> with <strong>scaling</strong>, <strong>crusting&#160;</strong>or <strong>ulceration</strong>. Less commonly, it appears as an enlarging <strong>pink nodule</strong> with <strong>surface keratinization</strong> (as in this patient) or ulceration. It is a locally invasive tumor, which may result in early<strong>&#160;perineural invasion</strong> presenting as <strong>regional numbness</strong> and paraesthesias, pain, and muscle weakness. Trigeminal and facial nerves are most commonly affected by local nerve invasion. It can also metastasize to head and neck lymph nodes, which usually presents as enlarged submental and submaxillary nodes. Diagnosis is established on punch, shave, or <strong>excisional biopsy</strong> of the lesion.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/uibCMzDUTuW_1H2AWAU1kvriQw2tvkMn/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Elevated serum IgE levels:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Elevated serum IgE levels are found in association with atopic dermatitis. It usually presents in adults as pruritic lichenified plaques on flexural surfaces with a background history of other atopic conditions (e.g., asthma, allergic rhinitis). A slowly enlarging keratinized nodule is atypical.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ History of tick bite:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>A tick bite history is significant in Lyme disease, which usually presents with erythema migrans (an erythematous blanching rash with a &#8220;Bull&#8217;s eye&#8221; appearance). A slowly enlarging keratinized nodule is unlikely.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pinpoint bleeding on scraping off the lesion (Auspitz sign):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Pinpoint bleeding on scraping off the scaly lesion (Auspitz sign) is characteristic of psoriasis, which clinically presents as scaly plaques or papules. A keratinized nodule with atypical keratinocytes on histology is unlikely.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Insulin resistance:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Insulin resistance is commonly associated with acanthosis nigricans, which is an epidermal hyperplasia that presents with a hyperpigmented skin thickening on the neck or axilla. A nodule with keratinization is atypical.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Regional numbness:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div>",
