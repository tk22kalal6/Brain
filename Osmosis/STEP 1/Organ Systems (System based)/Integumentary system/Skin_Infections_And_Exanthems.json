      "solution": "This patient has sustained 2nd-degree burns on different parts of his body (anterior chest and abdomen, left leg) after being trapped in a house fire. His vitals are unstable (increased body temperature, tachycardia, hypotension) due to fluid loss through the damaged skin and widespread cytokine activation. He needs urgent medical attention to avoid possible complications (e.g., infection, lactic acidosis) and death. <br><br>Management of burn patients (e.g., fluid resuscitation, antibiotics) depends on the severity of the burns and the total body surface area (TBSA) involved. Different methods are employed to assess the TBSA of a patient with burns (e.g., Lund-Browder charting, Palm method, etc.). One such method is known as the &#8220;<strong>Rule of Nines</strong>.&#8221; It is one of the most expeditious methods to estimate TBSA in adults. It attributes 9% of the TBSA to each of the following areas: head, anterior chest, posterior chest, anterior abdomen, posterior abdomen, right arm, left arm, and anterior and posterior parts of the right and left legs each. The perineum is assigned 1% of the TBSA. Therefore in the above patient, his <strong>anterior chest</strong>&#160;<strong>(9%)</strong> and <strong>abdomen (9%)</strong>, together with <strong>anterior (9%)</strong> and <strong>posterior (9%)</strong> parts of the <strong>left leg</strong>, constitute <strong>36%</strong> (9+9+9+9) involvement of the TBSA. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Jh-HD9niQK_XpQiFcceILIUiTf2Eitns/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 27% &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Following the rule of 9's, this patient&#8217;s anterior chest (9% of TBSA) and abdomen (9% of TBSA), together with anterior (9% of TBSA) and posterior (9% of TBSA) parts of the left leg, constitute 36% involvement of the TBSA (9+9+9+9=36%) &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ 36% &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 45% &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Following the rule of 9's, this patient&#8217;s anterior chest (9% of TBSA) and abdomen (9% of TBSA), together with anterior (9% of TBSA) and posterior (9% of TBSA) parts of the left leg, constitute 36% involvement of the TBSA (9+9+9+9= 36%) &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 54% &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Following the rule of 9's, this patient&#8217;s anterior chest (9% of TBSA) and abdomen (9% of TBSA), together with anterior (9% of TBSA) and posterior (9% of TBSA) parts of the left leg, constitute 36% involvement of the TBSA (9+9+9+9= 36%) &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 63% &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Following the rule of 9's, this patient&#8217;s anterior chest (9% of TBSA) and abdomen (9% of TBSA), together with anterior (9% of TBSA) and posterior (9% of TBSA) parts of the left leg, constitute 36% involvement of the TBSA (9+9+9+9= 36%) &#160;</span></div>",

It <strong>binds to the 30S bacterial ribosomal subunit</strong> to inhibit protein synthesis.<br><br>Its side effects are similar to tetracycline antibiotics and include <strong>nausea and vomiting</strong>, <strong>headache</strong>, <strong>photosensitivity</strong>, and <strong>tooth discoloration</strong>. Moreover, there has been an increased risk of death associated with tigecycline use. As a result, it should only be used when there are no alternative treatments. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Nausea and vomiting:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Peripheral motor neuropathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This adverse effect can be seen with dapsone therapy.

The drug inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids and is used to treat tuberculosis. Isoniazid should be administered with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) to prevent peripheral neuropathy and sideroblastic anemia. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Disulfiram-like reaction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This side effect is most commonly seen with drugs such as metronidazole, griseofulvin, sulfonylureas, procarbazine, and certain cephalosporins are taken with alcohol. A disulfiram-like reaction can present with severe flushing, tachycardia, and hypotension. &#160;</span></div>",

      "text": "A 56-year-old man presents to the clinic for increasing redness and pain at a surgery site on the left arm. He had a skin excision performed about one week ago to treat squamous cell carcinoma. The redness developed two days later and, since then, has been spreading. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and dyspepsia. Current medications include calcium carbonate, metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and aspirin. Temperature is 37.9&#176;C (100.2&#176;F), blood pressure is 109/74 mmHg, pulse is 81/min, and respiratory rate is 15/min. There is bright red erythema surrounding the excision site with purulent drainage and tenderness to light palpation on physical examination. A bacterial culture of the excision site grows methicillin-sensitive <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. The patient is started on a 7-day course of doxycycline. Which of the following medications should not be taken concurrently with doxycycline? &#160;",

      "solution": "This patient should avoid concurrently consuming doxycycline and calcium carbonate. This precaution should be taken since the divalent calcium ions can inhibit the absorption of tetracyclines in the gut and decrease the drug&#8217;s efficacy. Tetracyclines <strong>should not be taken with milk, antacids, or iron-containing preparations</strong>. <br><br>Moreover, tetracyclines can accumulate in the teeth and bones, causing discoloration of the teeth and inhibition of bone growth.
