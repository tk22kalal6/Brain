It typically consists of a 3-drug regimen, consisting of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and an integrase inhibitor, to prevent resistance. There are newer classes of HIV medication that have been developed to address treatment-resistant strains of HIV. &#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Entry inhibitors,&#160;</strong>also known as fusion inhibitors, are examples of such drugs. These medications are given to patients who show replication of HIV despite ongoing ART. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In particular, enfuvirtide acts as a <strong>viral entry inhibitor</strong> through the <strong>binding of the viral gp41 protein,</strong> which is involved in viral fusion with T-cells. It is given as a subcutaneous injection. Unlike other HIV medications which are active against HIV-1 and HIV-2, enfuvirtide is only active against HIV-1. Its main side effects are <strong>injection site reaction</strong> and an <strong>increased risk of bacterial infections, </strong>such as pneumonia. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased creatine kinase (CK) levels:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The integrase inhibitors are associated with myopathy and increased CK levels. Examples include bictegravir, dolutegravir, elvitegravir, and raltegravir.

NNRTIs inhibit viral reverse transcriptase. Additional NNRTIs include delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine. Medications in this class are all associated with rash and hepatotoxicity. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Bone marrow suppression:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Bone marrow suppression is associated with the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). NRTIs competitively inhibit nucleotides from binding to reverse transcriptase, thereby terminating DNA chain elongation. Examples of NRTIs include abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine. These medications can also cause peripheral neuropathy, lactic acidosis, and pancreatitis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hyperglycemia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Hyperglycemia is most commonly seen with protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir. These medications block viral protease, thereby preventing the cleaving of HIV mRNA and viral maturation. Protease inhibitors are also associated with gastrointestinal intolerance and lipodystrophy. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Injection site reaction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div>",

Diagnosis is clinical, and <strong>management</strong> is <strong>supportive care</strong> with adequate fluid hydration. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Herpes simplex virus infection &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Viral infection caused by herpes simplex virus can lead to erythema multiforme, usually presenting with asymptomatic targetoid lesions. Herpetic vesicles instead of influenza-like symptoms (fever, malaise, joint pain) usually precede the onset of these lesions. This patient has no such rash. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Medication side-effect &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sun exposure:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Excessive sun exposure can cause sunburn, which presents with tender, blanching erythema, blister formation, and peeling skin. Mucosal erosions, however, are not usually seen. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tick bite &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Ixodes tick bite can lead to the development of erythema migrans (EM), the earliest manifestation of Lyme disease. EM typically presents with a painless &#8220;bull&#8217;s eye&#8221; rash 1-2 weeks after the bite. Although this patient has a history of travel to a Lyme endemic area, her painful and tender mucocutaneous lesions and hemodynamic instability suggest an alternative diagnosis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pregnancy &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Although pregnancy can precipitate inflammatory dermatoses, this usually occurs in the third trimester. The lesions are usually papular or eczematous and start from stretch marks in the periumbilical region. Tenderness and mucosal erosions are not commonly seen. &#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "This adolescent girl with multiple open comedones on her forehead, in the setting of a recent stressor (upcoming debate competition), is most likely suffering from <strong>acne vulgaris</strong>, a common inflammatory skin disorder affecting hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The underlying etiology is multifactorial and involves the following changes: &#160;<ul><li>&#160;Hyperkeratosis of lower follicular infundibulum&#160;</li><li>&#160;Increased sebum production from sebaceous glands, stimulated by androgens&#160;</li><li>&#160;Subsequent proliferation of <em>Cutibacterium</em> acnes (part of normal flora) causing inflammation and development of papules and pustules&#160;</li></ul>Common predisposing factors include genetic predisposition, hormonal imbalance, infection, medications, psychological stress, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Treatment options depend on the severity and include <strong>retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, and isotretinoin</strong>. Acne vulgaris can be categorized into the following 4 types based on severity, as shown in the table below.<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/lHg-rDjGT0SkZEaQa-PINsL6QJ6ymeK3/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Rosacea:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Rosacea is an inflammatory cutaneous disorder that usually presents with persistent facial flushing, telangiectasia, papules, pustules, and ocular hyperemia. It can be exacerbated by exposure to sunlight, alcohol intake, or eating spicy foods. Rosacea is differentiated from acne vulgaris by the absence of comedones and the presence of telangiectasia in the former. <br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/17s6FCpkRje-2Lv2Vqsg63TaQjGSm_Jf/_.jpg\"></div><br>Reproduced from Wikimedia Commons</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sebaceous hyperplasia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Sebaceous glands enlargement is termed sebaceous hyperplasia. It presents small pale papules with umbilication mainly on the forehead and cheeks. The presence of open comedones favors the diagnosis of acne vulgaris.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/EPQS1whkQ3qjnhY7bLOspi3VRyW93XHV/_.png\"></div><br>Image reproduced from Wikimedia Commons</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Acne vulgaris:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hidradenitis suppurativa:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hidradenitis suppurativa is an inflammatory occlusion of the pilosebaceous subunit that results in the formation of solitary, painful nodules, not papules. Moreover, it usually affects intertriginous areas (e.g., axilla, inguinal, and perineal areas) <br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/3624vA5vRcSNsBVxGCEwSVx4Q1axSmXX/_.png\"></div><br>Image reproduced from Wikimedia Commons</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Drug-induced acne:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Drug-induced acne appears as monomorphic papular lesions, unlike the polymorphous lesions seen in this patient. Moreover, combined oral contraceptives do not promote acne but can improve it by inhibiting androgen synthesis. Common examples that can cause drug-induced acne include glucocorticoids, phenytoin, lithium, and isoniazid.&#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "This patient has <strong>vitiligo</strong>, an acquired condition characterized by the development of <strong>irregular patches of depigmented skin.</strong> In addition, patients can develop depigmentation of the hair and iris. Vitiligo can be subdivided into non-segmental and segmental vitiligo.<br><br><strong>Non-segmental vitiligo</strong> tends to affect the extremities (e.g., hands, feet), neck, and head. The lesions are usually symmetrical. <strong>Segmental vitiligo</strong> tends to affect areas of skin near the spinal cord dorsal roots. The lesions are usually asymmetrical. Both types are caused by the <strong>autoimmune destruction of melanocytes.</strong><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/J5i6p1TGQtyptjwVR7Zi7VC9Rz6swFMq/_.png\"></div><br>Vitiligo is associated with other <strong>autoimmune disorders,</strong> such as type I diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, Graves disease, and Hashimoto thyroiditis.<br><br>There are two main treatment approaches. When the affected area is <strong>small</strong>, cosmetic cover up and topical immune-suppressants can be applied directly to skin. When the affected area is <strong>large</strong>, systemic immune-suppressants, UV phototherapy, skin-bleaching, and in severe cases, skin grafts, can be tried. Whatever the course of therapy, sunscreen is recommended to prevent darkening of skin areas immediately surrounding the vitiligo lesions and contrasting the depigmentation areas. Moreover, sunscreen can reduce the risk of skin cancer. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Impaired melanocyte tyrosinase activity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Impaired melanocyte tyrosinase activity would hinder melanin production and result in albinism. The condition manifests with diffusely white skin and hair. In contrast, this patient has only patches of hypopigmentation, which is more consistent with vitiligo. Moreover, the symptoms of albinism would be present at birth. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;Autoimmune destruction of melanocytes&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Infection of skin by Malassezia furfur&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This answer choice describes tinea versicolor, which arises secondary to an infection of the skin by the <em>Malassezia</em> fungus. The fungus can degrade lipids, which produces acids that damage melanocytes, ultimately causing hypo- or hyperpigmented lesions. However, skin lesions affected by <em>Malassezia</em> are generally pruritic.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Deposition of disorganized collagen at injury site:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This answer choice describes a keloid, which occurs when there is over-deposition of scar tissue at an injury site.
