      "solution": "This patient is provided with a peripheral nerve block with a<strong>&#160;local anesthetic</strong> for repair of a forearm laceration. Prior to repair of lacerations it is commonplace to check for adequate regional analgesia--usually by gently tapping the wound edges with a pin, or the sharp end of scissors. The order of sensation loss following administration of a local anesthetic is <strong>Pain&gt;Temperature&gt;Touch&gt;Pressure. &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Local anesthetics&#160;</strong>include medications such as procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, chloroprocaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine and all carry a similar mechanism of action. These medications all work by binding to specific receptors on the inner portion of the <strong>sodium channel,</strong> physically preventing the flow of sodium ions, and subsequently blocking the initiation and propagation of action potentials. Local anesthetics are most effective at blocking fast firing nerves--e.g. smaller fibers and myelinated fibers are blocked more easily than unmyelinated fibers. In the setting of two fibers with equal degrees of myelination, the smaller fiber will be more sensitive to local anesthesia. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In accordance with this pattern, the degree of sensation loss after administration of local anesthetics includes <strong>pain first, followed by temperature, touch, and finally pressure</strong>. In addition, pain firing fibers tend to be located more superficially in tissues, such that fibers located in the periphery of a thick nerve bundle are blocked faster than those in the core because they are exposed to higher concentrations of anesthetic. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Pain&gt;Temperature&gt;Touch&gt;Pressure&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Temperature&gt;Touch&gt;Pressure&gt;Pain:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Pain is the first sensation to be lost after administration of local anesthetics, not the last. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pressure&gt;Touch&gt;Pain&gt;Temperature:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Pressure and touch are lost after pain and temperature, not before. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pain&gt;Pressure&gt;Touch&gt;Temperature:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Pain is the first sensation to be lost after administration of local anesthetics; however, pressure and touch are the last to be lost, not temperature. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Temperature&gt; Pain &gt;Touch&gt;Pressure:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Pain is lost before temperature, not temperature before pain.<strong>&#160;&#160;</strong>&#160;</span></div>",

This clinical presentation is suspicious for <strong>cauda equina syndrome</strong>, and <strong>urinary retention</strong> is a particularly specific finding for this condition. &#160; &#160;<br><strong>Cauda equina syndrome</strong> refers to a spinal cord injury caudal to the conus that injures two or more nerve roots, often via direct compression of the cauda equina within the lumbar spinal canal. The disease has multiple etiologies, including ankylosing spondylitis, chemotherapy, disc herniation, osteomyelitis, spinal epidural abscess, neoplasm, hematoma, arteriovenous malformations, inferior vena cava thrombosis, or trauma. &#160; <br><br>The most common presenting complaint is acute-on-chronic low back pain; however, the associated features vary. In general, most patients have a combination of <strong>back pain, bowel&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;bladder dysfunction,&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;symptoms of radiculopathy</strong>. Additional findings include lower extremity weakness and diminished sensation in the distribution of multiple nerve roots (L3-S1), peri-anal numbness, and loss of anal sphincter tone. This disorder, while rare, carries significant morbidity, often resulting in permanent neurologic dysfunction if left untreated. When suspected, management includes emergent MRI of the lumbar spine and neurosurgical consultation.<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/6Xj3daVbT8CmyU_siN5CqcKmQbGuM9Z2/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Urinary retention&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased deep tendon reflexes:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The absence of deep tendon reflexes is often found in patients with cauda equina syndrome; however, it is not a specific feature of this condition as it may be found in simple, unilateral radiculopathy as well. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hyperreflexia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hyporeflexia, not hyperreflexia, is more commonly found in patients with cauda equina syndrome. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Preserved perineal sensation&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Cauda equina syndrome usually exhibits sensory loss in the perineal area (saddle anesthesia). &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased anal sphincter tone&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Decreased, not increased, anal sphincter tone is observed in patients with cauda equina syndrome. &#160;</span></div>",

When a clinical presentation is highly suggestive of <strong>subarachnoid hemorrhage</strong>, and the initial CT-brain is negative, the next best step is to obtain a <strong>lumbar puncture</strong>, which may demonstrate blood or <strong>xanthochromia</strong>. <br><br>A lumbar puncture is performed by inserting a spinal needle between the 4th-5th lumbar intervertebral space to evaluate for frank blood or metabolized blood products in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once blood products become metabolized, CSF appears a straw-yellow color, termed <strong>xanthochromia</strong>. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid analysis is performed to examine for the persistence of red blood cells in tubes one through four. An increasing, or persistently high, titer of red blood cells suggests underlying SAH. Importantly, this procedure should not be performed if a patient has an underlying coagulopathy, severe thrombocytopenia, or overlying infectious process near the puncture site. In addition, patients should not have this procedure performed if they have established evidence of elevated intracranial pressure, as lumbar puncture may precipitate cerebral herniation.
