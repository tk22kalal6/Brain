This herniation can cause <strong>compression of the anterior cerebral artery&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;infarction of the frontal and parietal lobes</strong>, resulting in <strong>contralateral leg paralysis</strong>. Hydrocephalus may also occur due to obstruction of the foramen of Monro. Clinical features of cingulate herniation are not well defined but may include unilateral/bilateral weakness, loss of bladder control, and coma. Subfalcine herniation may also be a precursor of other types of herniation (e.g. uncal herniation). &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/x_U6wW-zSJyKUuZyQPzQgIFsRQmMGezq/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inferior shift of the parahippocampal gyrus &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>These findings are consistent with uncal transtentorial herniation. The uncus is the anterior terminus of the parahippocampal gyrus, located at the innermost part of the temporal lobe. In uncal herniation, the uncus becomes compressed against the tentorium.

Additionally, the physical examination demonstrates dysfunction of the <strong>spinocerebellar, lateral corticospinal, and dorsal column pathways</strong>, consistent with <strong>subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. &#160;&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Several spinal cord pathologies can be identified via a careful neurological examination to reveal the affected spinal cord tract(s). For example, <strong>subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord</strong> results when vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is absent or deficient. It may become deficient due to malabsorptive disease (e.g., Crohn disease, pernicious anemia), dietary restriction (e.g. veganism), or medications that interfere with cobalamin absorption (e.g., metformin, proton pump inhibitors). When physiologic stores of vitamin B12 are low, levels of methylmalonic acid increase, which causes degeneration of the myelin sheath of the <strong>spinocerebellar, lateral corticospinal,&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;dorsal column pathways,</strong> resulting in subacute combined degeneration (SCD). SCD manifests with symptoms of gait ataxia, paresthesias, and impaired position/vibration sense. Furthermore, SCD can cause psychiatric symptoms, including <strong>worsening depression</strong> or signs of <strong>dementia</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Additional noteworthy patterns of spinal cord pathologies include Brown-Sequard syndrome, syringomyelia, and tabes dorsalis. <strong>Brown-Sequard syndrome</strong> is a rare asymmetrical spinal cord injury pattern that occurs following a stab wound, penetrating injury, or, less commonly, fracture or blunt trauma. It results in <strong>ipsilateral loss</strong> of motor function, vibration, and proprioception due to the <strong>dorsal columns and corticospinal tract damage.</strong> In addition, contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation occurs at one or two levels below the lesion due to injury of the <strong>spinothalamic tracts</strong> (which decussate at the anterior commissure). Brown-Sequard syndrome may also be associated with <strong>Horner syndrome</strong> (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) if the lesion occurs <strong>above the T1 level</strong> and causes damage to the <strong>oculosympathetic pathway</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Syringomyelia</strong> describes a <strong>cystic cavity</strong> within the spinal cord, usually within the <strong>central canal,</strong> that can expand over time and compress the <strong>anterior white commissure,</strong> a structure directly anterior to the cervical canal. The anterior white commissure is the decussation site for the spinothalamic tracts, relaying pain and temperature sensation. As a result, syringomyelia causes a \"<strong>c</strong><strong>ape-like,\" bilateral, symmetrical loss of pain and temperature sensation</strong> in the <strong>upper extremities</strong>. Syringomyelia is associated with Chiari I malformation, a congenital condition characterized by abnormally shaped cerebellar tonsils that herniate below the level of the foramen magnum. &#160; <br><br>Lastly, <strong>tabes dorsalis</strong> arises due to infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by <em>Treponema</em> <em>pallidum</em>, the spirochete that causes syphilis. Tertiary infection of the spinal cord leads to demyelination and degeneration of the <strong>dorsal column and roots,</strong> resulting in findings of gait ataxia and incoordination. The condition takes nearly 20 years to develop after the initial infection. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Spinocerebellar tracts, lateral corticospinal tracts, and dorsal columns &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Anterior white commissure &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Chiari I malformation is characterized by cerebellar tonsillar ectopia and is most commonly associated with a syrinx within the spinal cord.

In contrast, the tremor that occurred during college was most likely physiologic tremor, exacerbated by sleep deprivation and excessive caffeine intake. &#160;<br><br>Tremor is defined as a rhythmic, involuntary, oscillatory movement of a body part caused by either alternating or synchronous antagonist muscle contractions. ET is the most common cause of action tremor in adults. Classically, ET involves the hands and becomes apparent by arm movement during an activity (intention tremor) or sustained antigravity postures. The tremor can be quite disabling, affecting daily activities such as writing, drinking from a glass, and using utensils. The tremor is typically slowly progressive, bilateral, slightly asymmetric, and with moderate to high frequency (6 to 12 Hz). ET may also affect the head, voice, and less commonly the face or trunk. A helpful clue often seen on USMLE exams is that ET is often <strong>relieved by small amounts of alcohol&#160;</strong>intake, and therefore, patients often self-medicate with alcoholic beverages. The neuropathologic basis of ET remains poorly understood, but involvement of the cerebellum and brainstem (locus coeruleus) has been suggested. ET has a strong genetic component, often referred to as \"familial tremor.\" The diagnosis of ET is based purely upon the clinical features, according to the following criteria: &#160; <br><br><ul><li>&#160;Isolated, bilateral upper limb action tremor, without other motor abnormalities&#160;</li><li>&#160;At least three years in duration&#160;</li><li>&#160;With/without a tremor in other locations (e.g., head, voice, or lower limbs)&#160;</li><li>&#160;Absence of other neurologic signs (e.g., parkinsonism, ataxia)&#160;</li></ul>First-line treatment consists of <strong>beta-blockers</strong> (e.g. propranolol) or certain <strong>barbiturates&#160;</strong>(e.g. primidone). &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/7U2-GSiNScmGxezQaNC4oluqTayijvc2/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Essential tremor&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Physiologic tremor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Physiologic tremor is a very low-amplitude, high-frequency (8 to 12 Hz) action tremor that can be seen in healthy individuals.

The underlying pathophysiology is an increased number of CAG repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene on chromosome 4. Mutant huntingtin contains an expanded tract of glutamine residues which results in an abnormal protein toxic to neurons. The condition is characterized by <strong>anticipation</strong>, which refers to increased severity and earlier onset in succeeding generations due to expansion of CAG repeats.

CJD is a neurodegenerative condition caused by <strong>prions&#160;</strong>(misfolded proteins that transmit their misfolded shape onto normal variants of the protein) demonstrating an increase in <strong>&#42933;-sheet structures</strong>. These &#42933;-sheets are resistant to proteolysis and form insoluble plaques that deposit in the brain. These plaques have a toxic effect on surrounding neurons, leading to<strong>&#160;neural cell death</strong> and development of multiple &#8220;holes&#8221; in the brain. As a result, CJD produces a characteristic spongy appearance of the brain termed <strong>spongiform encephalopathy</strong>. There are four types of CJD: familial (due to PRNP gene mutation), variant (due to consumption of contaminated animal meat), iatrogenic (due to medical procedures such as corneal transplants), and sporadic (appears without clear cause). &#160;<br><br>Patients with CJD have long incubation periods but once symptoms manifest, individuals develop <strong>rapidly progressive dementia</strong> within weeks to months. It is classically associated with <strong>ataxia&#160;</strong>(lack of coordination of voluntary movements) and <strong>myoclonus&#160;</strong>(jerking movement of a muscle group). In CJD, the myoclonus is usually generalized and can be triggered when the person is startled by a loud noise -- the response is therefore termed <strong>&#8220;startle myoclonus.&#8221;</strong> There is no effective treatment for CJD, and it is uniformly fatal. <strong>Death&#160;</strong>commonly occurs within one year of symptom onset. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ELMEhyK6Tny_uz_QzFEPwQroTUSb-dhJ/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Sudden involuntary contraction of muscles after a loud sound&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Unilateral, violent, flailing motion of the arm:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Hemiballismus is characterized by sudden, wild flailing of an extremity.

Symptoms typically present between ages 20 and 50 and include chorea, athetosis, aggression, depression, and dementia. Chorea is defined as a rapid, involuntary, arrhythmic, <strong>disorganized movement</strong> with variable speed, timing, and direction. Most commonly, it involves the distal extremities, but it also affects the trunk and face. Athetosis is a slow, continuous, involuntary writhing movement of the fingers, hands, toes, and less commonly, the arms, legs, neck, and tongue. The term \"choreoathetosis\" is used when chorea and athetosis coexist. &#160;<br><br>The structures that have been associated with chorea include the putamen, caudate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, and their interconnecting pathways. The basal ganglia system is important in regulating movement. Damage or malfunction of these structures disrupts the balance between the indirect and direct pathways in the basal ganglia circuitry, leading to excessive dopaminergic activity. Disruption to the indirect pathway results in loss of inhibition to the globus pallidus which in turn allows hyperkinetic movements to occur.

The condition is characterized by the accumulation of Lewy bodies, which are composed of alpha-synuclein. <strong>Alpha-synuclein</strong> is a protein found at presynaptic terminals and is involved in neurotransmitter release. In times of increased oxidative stress and under pathologic conditions, alpha-synuclein undergoes a structural change, forming oligomers and beta sheet structures which ultimately deposit as <strong>Lewy bodies</strong>.

Ballism is often unilateral (hemiballism), present at rest, and worsened by activity. Traditionally, hemiballism was pathognomonic of a lesion of the <strong>contralateral subthalamic nucleus</strong> (STN). However, recent evidence suggests that other locations are often involved, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, and globus pallidus. Most stroke lesions causing hemichorea/hemiballism seem to involve a common functional network connected to the posterolateral putamen. &#160; &#160;<br>The basal ganglia system is important in regulating movement. Damage or malfunction of these structures disrupts the balance between the indirect and direct pathways in the basal ganglia circuitry, leading to excessive dopaminergic activity. Disruption to the indirect pathway results in loss of inhibition to the globus pallidus, which in turn allows hyperkinetic movements to occur. Chorea, athetosis, and ballism often coexist in the same patient and are considered to be a part of the choreiform spectrum. &#160; &#160;<br><br><em><strong>High-yield note:&#160;</strong>For the purposes of USMLE examinations, keep in mind the association between the subthalamic nucleus and contralateral hemiballismus.&#160;</em><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Dystonia&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle contractions that result in repetitive movements or an abnormal fixed posture.

It is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Currently, the most firmly established genetic risk factor for late-onset disease is having increased copies of the apolipoprotein E &#949;4 allele (<strong>ApoE4-&#949;4</strong>). Apolipoprotein E is found in the brain and is involved in the removal of amyloid-beta (A&#946;). The ApoE4-&#949;4 isoform, however, is not as efficient at transferring A&#946; to the bloodstream, and therefore it causes<strong>&#160;increased A&#946; deposition</strong>. Environmental risk factors for late-onset AD include obesity, reduced physical activity, smoking, and history of traumatic brain injury.<br><br>In contrast, <strong>early-onset</strong> AD typically occurs between the ages of 30-65 and makes up 5-10% of cases.
