The most common causes of aseptic meningitis are the <strong>enteroviruses</strong>, which include poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and <strong>echovirus</strong>. Less common viruses are varicella zoster virus, herpes, and mumps. The diagnosis of viral meningitis is based upon negative bacterial cultures and virus identification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, antigen detection, or serology. CSF analysis typically shows normal/slightly low glucose (since glucose utilization is far less with viruses than with bacteria), WBC count between 10 to 500 cells/&#181;L and protein &lt; 150 mg/dL.

In light of the <strong>recent tooth pain</strong> and MRI showing a <strong>ring-enhancing lesion</strong> in the frontal lobe, the most likely diagnosis is brain abscess due to the <strong>direct spread of a tooth infection into the brain</strong>. Further evaluation with biopsy and drainage is required for definitive diagnosis of the pathogen, but <strong>Viridans streptococci&#160;</strong>are one of the most common causes of brain abscess, especially in the setting of tooth infections. &#160;<br><br>A brain abscess is a focal collection of pus within the brain tissue that occurs as a complication infection, trauma or surgery. Bacteria gain access to the brain either by direct spread from a contiguous location or through hematogenous seeding. A direct spread of infection from a contiguous site usually causes a single abscess, while the spread through bacteremia usually causes multiple lesions. Primary infections that can directly spread to the brain include: &#160;<br><ul><li>&#160;otitis media and mastoiditis, resulting in abscess formation in the temporal lobe and/or cerebellum&#160;</li><li>&#160;sinusitis in the frontal or ethmoid sinuses, resulting in abscess formation in the frontal lobes&#160;</li><li>&#160;dental infections, resulting in abscess formation in the frontal lobes&#160;</li></ul>The pathogens involved differ depending upon the primary infection location, patient age, and the immune status of the host. However, <strong>Viridans streptococci&#160;</strong>and <strong><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></strong> are the most common pathogens. Head imaging may show ring-enhancing lesions. Lumbar puncture is often contraindicated secondary to signs of elevated intracranial pressure, due to the risk of herniation. Stereotactic CT-guided aspiration is required to direct treatment. Treatment of a brain abscess usually requires a combination of antibiotics and surgical drainage. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/AbI-RQaPTXSBQKq2_7Wy1Pn_TquvC1dH/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pseudomonas aeruginosa:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Pseudomonas brain abscesses are associated with ear infections and urinary tract infections.

There are currently two types of polio vaccines, the <strong>Sabin vaccine</strong> (OPV) and <strong>Salk vaccine</strong> (IPV). &#160; &#160;<br><br>The Sabin vaccine contains a <strong>live-attenuated version</strong> of polio and is given orally. This medication is primarily used in developing nations due low cost, ease of administration, and ability to induce mucosal immunity. The major downside to this vaccine is the risk of <strong>vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis</strong>, which is when the virus within the vaccine regains virulence, and the patient develops polio symptoms. However, this is an extremely rare event and should not limit vaccination efforts. &#160; <br><br>The Salk vaccine contains<strong>&#160;inactivated virus</strong> and is commonly combined with other infant vaccines including diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTPa), hepatitis B, and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type B vaccines.

Approximately 200 cases occur yearly, and 95% of infections occur in children under the age of five. &#160; <br><br>Polio spreads by <strong>fecal oral transmission.&#160;</strong>After being ingested, the virus replicates in the oropharynx and intestinal mucosal cells. During this time, most patients are asymptomatic, although some may have non-specific symptoms including fever, vomiting, and headache. As viral load increases, the virus enters the blood-stream where it is thought to invade neurons and the central nervous system via retrograde axonal transport to the spinal cord. The virus then replicates in<strong>&#160;motor neurons&#160;</strong>of the<strong>&#160;anterior horn,&#160;</strong>resulting in neuronal death and muscle paralysis. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The disease causes <strong>asymmetric paralysis,</strong> more commonly affecting the lower extremities, and signs of <strong>lower motor neuron disease</strong> (e.g., fasciculations, hypotonia, absent reflexes).

The physical examination shows nuchal rigidity, while the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results show low glucose with numerous <strong>neutrophils&#160;</strong>and <strong>RBCs</strong>. In light of the <strong>recent swimming activity</strong>, the rapidly progressive course of the disease, and the presence of RBCs in the CSF, the most likely diagnosis is <strong>amebic meningoencephalitis</strong> (PAM) caused by<strong>&#160;<em>Naegleria fowleri. &#160;</em></strong><em>&#160;</em><br><br>Naegleria fowleri is a<strong> protozoan parasite</strong> that can be found in fresh and<strong> warm water </strong>sources (thermophilic <strong>amoebae</strong>) worldwide. The most common risk factor for infection is recreational water activities. Trophozoites from the water penetrate the olfactory mucosa, cross the cribriform plates, and eventually reach the olfactory bulb and brain. PAM is an acute <strong>hemorrhagic </strong>meningoencephalitis with an extremely high mortality rate. Patients often present with high fevers, severe headache, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, behavioral changes, seizures, and altered mental status. <strong>Smell and taste </strong>abnormalities may occur early and imply the migration of the parasite through the olfactory mucosa. Eventually, severe intracranial hypertension develops, leading to herniation and death within days. CSF analysis typically shows high WBC count with marked polymorphonuclear predominance, low glucose, elevated protein, numerous RBCs (due to hemorrhage) but negative routine bacterial cultures and gram stain. Diagnosis is based upon the clinical suspicion and is established by observation of motile trophozoites on CSF with <strong>wet mount </strong>or by polymerase chain reaction.

Germ-cell tumors can secrete hCG, which, in boys, leads to activation of LH receptors on the Leydig cells. This results in <strong>increased testosterone</strong> production and precocious puberty. In girls, hCG-secreting tumors do not cause precocious puberty, because activation of both FSH and LH receptors is required for estrogen production. In girls, however, a urine pregnancy test will be falsely positive. &#160;<br><br>Symptoms of pinealomas may include headaches, lethargy, signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g. papilledema), hydrocephalus and <strong>pretectal syndrome (Parinaud syndrome)</strong>, in which compression of the pretectal area results in a classic constellation of neuro-ocular symptoms including <strong>upward gaze</strong><strong>&#160;limitation, bilateral eyelid retraction</strong> (Collier sign), and <strong>light-near dissociation</strong> (&#8220;Argyll Robinson pupil&#8221;). &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Raphe nucleus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The raphe nucleus is found in the medulla and is responsible for serotonin secretion. Deficiency of serotonin is associated with anxiety, depression and Parkinson's disease. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Nucleus basalis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The nucleus basalis (basal nucleus of Meynert) is found at the base of the forebrain and secretes acetylcholine. Decreased levels of acetylcholine are associated with Alzheimer and Huntington&#8217;s disease. Increased levels are seen in Parkinson's disease. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pituitary gland:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Pituitary gonadotropin-secreting tumors theoretically can cause precocious puberty, however, they are extremely rare. In addition, pituitary tumors are more likely to present with bilateral hemianopsia due to compression of the optic chiasm rather than upward gaze palsy. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ventral tegmentum:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The ventral tegmentum is a group of neurons located in the midbrain which is responsible for dopamine secretion. Deficiency is associated with depression and Parkinson's disease while elevated levels with schizophrenia and Huntington's disease. &#160; &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Pineal gland:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Locus coeruleus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Locus coeruleus is a nucleus found in the pons which is responsible for secreting norepinephrine. High levels of norepinephrine are associated with anxiety and low levels with depression. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sella turcica:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Craniopharyngiomas arise from remnants of Rathke's pouch within the sella turcica. During embryological development, Rathke's pouch gives rise to the anterior pituitary gland. Craniopharyngiomas often present with growth delay and bitemporal hemianopsia, not precocious puberty. &#160;</span></div>",
