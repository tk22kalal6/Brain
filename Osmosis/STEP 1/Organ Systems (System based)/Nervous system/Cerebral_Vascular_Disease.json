It typically<strong>&#160;lasts longer than 2 minutes&#160;</strong>and presents with inconsistent findings (e.g., variable motor activity, pelvic thrusting, and forced closure of eyes). According to DSM-V criteria, the diagnosis does not require a provider to judge whether the episode was intentionally produced, as this aspect of the presentation may not be reliably discerned, and such a judgement would not change management, which consists of psychological evaluation. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/fuianDenQBG0tfsQo62Rq6lFTF6ijC83/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizure (PNES) is commonly misdiagnosed as GTCS because of generalized motor symptoms.

      "solution": "<strong>Absence seizure&#160;</strong>(also called petit mal) is a type of generalized seizure (i.e. affecting both the cerebral hemispheres at onset), and it is one of the most common forms of pediatric epilepsy. The seizure manifests in school-aged children and adolescents as a <strong>brief staring spell</strong> causing transient loss of consciousness without loss of body tone. It usually<strong>&#160;lasts about 10 seconds&#160;</strong>and <strong>cannot be interrupted</strong> by verbal/tactile stimuli (as opposed to staring spells that occur out of boredom or lack of focus). There is no postictal confusion or sedation, but the patient is unable to recall the event. <strong>Automatisms&#160;</strong>(lip smacking, rapid blinking) are observed sometimes, especially when the episode lasts for more than 10 seconds. &#160;<br><br>Absence seizures can easily be<strong>&#160;provoked by hyperventilation</strong>, and electroencephalogram (EEG) exhibits <strong>classical 3 Hz spike-and-wave discharges</strong>. The first line agent for the treatment of absence seizures is <strong>ethosuximide</strong>, which inhibits T-type calcium channels in thalamic neurons. Valproic acid can be used if ethosuximide is ineffective or not tolerated. Absence seizures are typically benign and resolve before puberty. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/gp2QMQ_zRg_N71jo2TRtYVZuRWe6vHo4/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Selective mutism:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Selective mutism is an uncommon disorder in which the child fails to communicate in a specific social place (like school) but speaks normally in other settings (like home).

This description is most consistent with the mechanism of action of <strong>benzodiazepines</strong>. Of the medications listed, only lorazepam falls into this medication class. &#160; <br><br>Both benzodiazepines and barbiturates act on the GABA<span>A</span> receptor and affect <strong>chloride-selective ion channels.&#160;</strong>These effects lead to neuronal hyperpolarization and decreased excitability. Therefore, these medications are excellent for acute seizure control. &#160; &#160;<br><br>However, benzodiazepines and barbiturates differ in their specific mechanisms of action. Benzodiazepines facilitate GABA<span>A</span> activity by<strong>&#160;increasing the frequency</strong> of chloride channel opening, whereas barbiturates work by <strong>increasing the duration</strong> of chloride channel opening. &#160; <br><br>Ultimately, this mechanistic difference accounts for a <strong>&#8220;gating effect&#8221; </strong>with benzodiazepines, such that only a certain amount of GABA can be released upon medication binding. In contrast, with barbiturate use, the chloride channel is in an open state while the medication exerts its effects.

Orthostatic vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination demonstrates decreased radial and brachial pulses of the right upper extremity when compared to the left upper extremity. Skin over the right upper extremity feels cooler than the left. The remainder of the cardiopulmonary and neurologic exam are within normal limits. CT angiogram is performed and reveals a condition that results in reversal of blood flow through a vascular structure. Reverse blood flow through which of the following vessels is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's symptoms? &#160;",

In this condition, the affected arm is often supplied by blood flowing in a retrograde direction down the ipsilateral vertebral artery at the expense of the <strong>vertebrobasilar circulation</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Given this patient's vascular risk factors (i.e., hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension), an atherosclerotic occlusive plaque in the right subclavian artery is the most likely culprit of his symptoms. Reduced blood flow through the subclavian artery results in symptoms of recurrent heaviness with exertion, paresthesias, as well as decreased pulses and cooler skin. &#160; <br><br>Over time, stenosis of the subclavian artery increases in blood flow through the contralateral vertebral artery to the basilar artery, followed by retrograde flow through the ipsilateral vertebral artery, away from the brainstem. Ultimately, this may result in presyncopal symptoms with exertion of the affected arm including lightheadedness, nausea, and blurred vision. Other etiologies of SSS include Takayasu arteritis, Giant cell arteritis, and thoracic aortic dissection. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Right subclavian artery:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Given this patient's vascular risk factors (i.e., hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension), he most likely has an atherosclerotic occlusive plaque of the right subclavian artery.

Temperature is 37.7&#176;C (99.8&#176;F), pulse is 99/min, respirations are 20/min and blood pressure is 166/90 mmHg. The patient falls to the left when asked to sit without support.

Further neurologic examination demonstrates partial ptosis and miosis of the left eye, nystagmus, reduced pain and temperature sensation on the left side of the face and right side of the body, and sensorineural hearing loss on the left.
