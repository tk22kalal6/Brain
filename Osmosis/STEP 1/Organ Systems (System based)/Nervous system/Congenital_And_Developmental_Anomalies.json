Of the clinical findings listed, <strong>fasciculations</strong>, or muscle twitches that result from incomplete firing of the damaged lower motor neuron, are most consistent with this disease. &#160; <br><br>In general, upper motor neuron diseases refer to lesions of the neural pathway above the anterior horn of the spinal cord or motor nuclei of the cranial nerves. Classic examples include stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and cerebral palsy.

Upper motor neuron lesions result in disinhibition of lower motor neurons, resulting in excitatory symptoms including <strong>increased muscle tone, spastic paralysis, hyperactive reflexes,</strong> and<strong>&#160;postive Babinski sign.</strong> In contrast, lower motor neuron lesions result in inhibition of muscle contraction and cause<strong>&#160;flaccid paralysis, muscle atrophy, decreased deep tendon reflexes,</strong> and <strong>fasciculations</strong>.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/e7otinZuRCypGOat85lCM6MUQQqjAqZm/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Fasciculations:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Spastic paresis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Spastic paresis is a complex condtion characterized by paralysis and muscle spasms.

These medications work by binding to specific receptors on the inner portion of the <strong>sodium channel,</strong> physically preventing the flow of sodium ions, and subsequently blocking the initiation and propagation of action potentials. These medications are most effective in rapidly firing, <strong>small diameter, highly myelinated neurons,</strong> which <strong>comprise the majority of pain associated fibers.&#160;</strong>Thus local anesthetics are exceptionally effective agents for nerve blocks, minor skin procedures, or prior to placement of indwelling catheters.&#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Non-specific blockade of voltage gated Na+ channels:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ NMDA receptor antagonism:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>NMDA receptor antagonism describes the mechanism of action of ketamine, a dissociative analgesic.
