These findings are consistent with the presentation of <strong>Huntington disease</strong> (HD). &#160;<br><br>HD is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The condition arises due to an increased number of <strong>CAG trinucleotide repeats</strong> in the <em>huntingtin&#160;</em>gene, which leads to the production of a dysfunction protein that impairs subcortical motor circuits. &#160;<br><br>The diagnosis of HD is based upon the presence of associated clinical features (e.g., chorea, dementia, depression), a family history of the disease, and genetic confirmation of the trinucleotide gene expansion. Gene expansion can be tested using <strong>polymerase chain reaction&#160;</strong>(PCR). Head imaging, although not commonly done for diagnostic purposes, would demonstrate characteristic<strong>&#160;atrophy of the striatum</strong>, which is a term collectively referring to the caudate and putamen. Atrophy is most pronounced in the <strong>caudate nucleus</strong> (red outline) and leads to concomitant enlargement of the lateral ventricles (yellow outline). &#160;<br><br>PS: If you or someone you know needs this, here's the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to the Crisis Text Line at 741741. &#160; <br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/i37WIGyYRomZQF7sXcqP7IzXSIOS9CLq/_.png\"></div><br>Image reproduced from Radiopedia <br>&#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/FTvpHvHRSSCNClExvAiGyniYSBGdJKVi/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Loss of neuronal volume in the striatum:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lesion in the left subthalamic nucleus&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Lesions in the subthalamic nuclei, such as after a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, can result in the movement disorder known as hemiballismus.

      "solution": "This patient is presenting with acute onset of neck muscle contraction. Given the presented medical history and pharmacologic treatment, the most likely diagnosis is <strong>acute dystonia</strong>, (specifically <strong>torticollis</strong>) secondary to antipsychotic use. Antipsychotics (especially first-generation antipsychotics) antagonize dopamine receptors and lead to an imbalance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the basal ganglia. Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary, sustained or intermittent muscle contractions that result in repetitive movements or an abnormal fixed posture. Since acute dystonia results in an elevated level of acetylcholine in the basal ganglia, first-line treatment for acute dystonia secondary to antipsychotics includes benztropine, an anticholinergic drug that blocks M1 receptor, and diphenhydramine, a first-generation antihistamine that blocks H1 receptor and M1 receptors. &#160;<br><br>Antipsychotic medications are first-line medication treatment for schizophrenia and are used in a variety of other psychiatric illnesses. While they effectively reduce behaviors and symptoms associated with the conditions, the trade-off is their significant side effect profile. All antipsychotic medications are capable of causing <strong>extrapyramidal symptoms</strong> (EPS), but these are more common with 1st generation antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine). Among the 2nd generation antipsychotics, risperidone and paliperidone carry the highest risk for EPS. Extrapyramidal symptoms include dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, and parkinsonism, as described in the chart below. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/uvw8PoB-RZaKcex2y92smmd6Qwmkyr3L/_.png\"></div><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/AMRjyZmwQTyPqD-xeQ_LZqQeTpeFvbLB/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reducing cAMP level and calcium influx current:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This answer depicts the mechanism of beta-blockers, which halt the effect of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and their downstream cascade, which results in reduced cAMP and intracellular calcium levels.

      "solution": "This patient presents with hyperkyphosis, postural instability, hypokinesia (small steps), resting tremor, and personality changes (anxiety or depression). Together, these findings are consistent with <strong>Parkinson disease</strong> (PD). PD is caused by degeneration of the substantia nigra, and disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway, thus decreasing striatal dopamine levels. Treatment of PD involves several medications that increase dopamine levels within the brain. &#160; <br><br>Initial treatment often involves a combination of <strong>carbidopa/levodopa.</strong> Unlike dopamine, levodopa can cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), which gets converted to dopamine in the CNS via decarboxylases. Dopamine decarboxylase inhibitors, like <strong>carbidopa</strong>, prevent the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery, allowing for more levodopa to cross the BBB. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Over time, dopamine becomes more efficiently metabolized by different enzymes in the brain, leading to a <strong>&#8220;wearing-off&#8221; phenomenon</strong>&#8211;where the patient&#8217;s symptoms improve when they take the medication, with effects rapidly ending after one or two hours. People also experience the <strong>&#8220;on/off&#8221; phenomenon</strong>, where patients experience sudden oscillations of symptomatic improvement followed by a rapid return to rigidity and hypokinesia. Chronic use of levodopa can also cause dyskinesias, which are uncontrolled, involuntary movements. These motor complications occur as the disease progresses, as<strong>&#160;nigrostriatal neurons lose their capacity to store and recycle dopamine.</strong> This phenomenon requires higher doses of levodopa and subsequent over-excitation of striatal neurons. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Reemergence of parkinsonism symptoms between doses:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Worsening of impulse control disorder:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Worsening of impulse control disorders (e.g., gambling, compulsive buying) can be seen in patients taking dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole and ropinirole.

      "solution": "<strong>Parkinson disease&#160;</strong>(PD) is caused by degeneration of the substantia nigra, disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway and thus, decreases in striatal dopamine levels. Treatment of PD involves several medications that increase dopamine levels within the brain. &#160; <br><br>Levodopa is peripherally metabolized by dopamine decarboxylase and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Levodopa (L-DOPA) is commonly given in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa) to prevent its peripheral metabolism to dopamine, as peripherally active dopamine leads to various adverse effects (e.g.nausea, vomiting). &#160; &#160;<br><br>When levodopa is co-administered with a decarboxylase inhibitor, the medication is converted by peripheral <strong>COMT </strong>to the inert metabolite 3-O- methyldopa (3-OMD). Only 10% of a given dose of levodopa reaches the brain for subsequent conversion to dopamine. Two medications that<strong> inhibit COMT</strong> are <strong>tolcapone </strong>and <strong>entacapone</strong>, which can be used as adjunctive therapies to treat PD. Both COMT inhibitors exert their therapeutic effects by inhibiting the peripheral metabolism of levodopa and increasing its bioavailability for the central nervous system. In addition, they reduce the formation of 3-OMD, which competes with L-DOPA for transport into the brain. Tolcapone inhibits both peripheral and, to a lesser extent, central COMT, whereas entacapone acts only in the periphery. &#160; <br><br>COMT inhibitors are often combined with levodopa when patients develop motor complications. In addition, they improve the therapeutic response to levodopa and reduce the &#8220;wearing-off&#8221; phenomenon.
