During his last check-up one year ago, the patient was otherwise healthy. Since then, the patient has not achieved new milestones in speech, gross motor, or fine motor development. Temperature is 37.3&#176;C (99.1&#176;F), pulse is 79/min, respirations are 28/min and blood pressure is 105/55 mm Hg. The patient does not maintain eye contact. The anterior fontanelle is closed. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examination is unremarkable. The skin is pink and well perfused. Growth charting demonstrates a rapidly enlarging head circumference. A CT scan of the brain reveals a mass lesion, enlarged lateral and third ventricles, and a normally sized fourth ventricle.

Normally, CSF is produced by the choroid plexus, flows from the lateral, through the third and fourth ventricles, and ultimately to the subarachnoid space for reabsorption. The <strong>narrowest portion of the ventricular system is the cerebral aqueduct</strong>, also called the <strong>aqueduct of Sylvius</strong>, where it drains CSF from the third to the fourth ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct is the <strong>most common site of obstruction</strong> that may result in <strong>hydrocephalus</strong>.<br><br>The cerebral aqueduct can be blocked by <strong>cellular debris</strong> formed from intraventricular hemorrhage, bacterial or fungal infections, as well as <strong>tumors of the midbrain or pinealomas</strong>.

In addition, there is evidence of<span>&#160;</span><strong>urinary incontinence, seizures, and bilateral lower extremity weakness,&#160;</strong>which can be due to compression of the<strong>&#160;medial aspect of the precentral gyrus (paracentral lobule). &#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>The paracentral lobule is an area of the brain located on the medial surface of the cerebral hemispheres that lies in close proximity to the falx cerebri and surrounds the indentation produced by the central sulcus. Functionally, it is involved in cerebral control of both urination and defecation. It also houses motor and sensory innervation of the contralateral lower extremities. Thus a space-occupying lesion of this area (e.g. parasagittal meningioma) can cause urinary incontinence, seizures, and bilateral lower extremity weakness. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The paracentral lobule is supplied by the branches of the<strong>&#160;anterior cerebral artery,&#160;</strong>so occlusion of the ACA results in<span>&#160;</span><strong>hemiparesis&#160;</strong>and<span>&#160;</span><strong>hemisensory loss</strong><span>&#160;</span>in the contralateral lower extremity and<span>&#160;</span><strong>urinary incontinence</strong>.

The pathogenesis involves a mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3 which encodes for a protein responsible for the degradation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). In the absence of normally functioning protein, there is a high level of HIF that facilitates the expression VEGF and other growth factors, resulting in a stimulus for tumor growth. &#160;<br><br>Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease may present with <strong>hemangioblastomas&#160;</strong>throughout the central nervous system, clear cell renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, serous cystadenomas and neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas, and papillary cystadenomas of the epididymis or broad ligament. &#160;<br><br>Hemangioblastomas are benign, <strong>highly vascular</strong> tumors of the central nervous system.
