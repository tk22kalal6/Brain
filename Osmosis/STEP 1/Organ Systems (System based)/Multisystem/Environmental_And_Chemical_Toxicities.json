      "solution": "This patient has <strong>albinism</strong>, which is characterized by a drastic reduction or complete <strong>lack of pigmentation</strong> in the hair, skin, and eyes. The condition arises due to congenital defects in <strong>tyrosinase</strong>, the enzyme that produces melanin, or <strong>impaired transport&#160;</strong>of tyrosine and melanosomes. &#160; <br><br>Patients can have <strong>milky-white</strong> hair and skin. In addition, patients can have <strong>very light blue or translucent</strong> irises, which appear red because of the retinal tissue lining the back of the eye. The absence of melanin in the eyes causes a variety of vision problems, including impaired depth perception, <strong>reduced visual acuity</strong>, nystagmus, and amblyopia. Moreover, albinism can cause freckles, moles, and lentigines to form on the skin; the lack of melanin and exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation increases the risk of developing <strong>skin cancer</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Albinism is also seen in <strong>Chediak-Higashi syndrome</strong>, which can cause pancytopenia, recurrent infections, and peripheral neuropathy. Of note, this patient does not have Chediak-Higashi syndrome, since his blood cell counts are normal. &#160; <br><br>Treatment involves preventing additional ailments arising from the lack of protection normally conferred by melanin. Prevention includes wearing <strong>tinted glasses</strong> for eye protection and <strong>sunscreen</strong> to reduce the risk of skin cancer. <strong>Nitisinone</strong>, a medication that increases tyrosine levels, can be used to treat certain forms of albinism. <br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/hrUs3D5cSU_lpQ3_Cw4-ZH5ORu278GWf/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recurrent Staphylococcal infections:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This complication would likely develop in patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, which is due to a defect in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene.

Bacitracin is an antibiotic agent active against gram-positive cocci, including <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>, and <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>. It inhibits bactoprenol phosphate, a transmembrane transporter embedded within the bacterial cell membrane. Bactoprenol phosphate promotes the transport of N-acetyl-muramic acid and N-acetyl mucopeptides that form components of the bacterial cell wall. Bacitracin inhibits the transport of these mucopeptides and inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.<br><br>Bacitracin is commonly used for topical application in partial thickness burns, particularly those that involve the face and the perineum, and for photokeratitis.

He works at a glass factory and has been experiencing a painful burning sensation in his distal extremities and weakness while gripping tools for the past two weeks. The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable. Past medical history is noncontributory. He has been taking homemade herbal medications for the last 5-years. Vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation over the neck. There is a thickening of the skin on the palms and soles. Neurologic examination shows decreased sensation in the hands and feet. Upper and lower extremity deep tendon reflexes are 2/5. Laboratory results are shown below. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient&#8217;s clinical presentation? <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/59XUbCjJQxieW-pqG1VXeiHvT1e4qraa/_.png\"></div>&#160;",

      "solution": "This patient has peripheral neuropathy, variable skin pigmentation, and hyperkeratosis. Laboratory testing is notable for pancytopenia and mild transaminitis. In combination with his history of consuming homemade herbal medications and working at a glass factory, these findings suggest chronic <strong>arsenic poisoning</strong>. The patient should be started on dimercaprol therapy.<br><br>Arsenic is a metal found in herbicides, pesticides, and water. <strong>Acute arsenic poisoning</strong> can occur if someone ingests large quantities of the substance. <strong>Chronic arsenic poisoning</strong> can occur due to occupational exposures (e.g., metal smelting, agriculture, mining, glass manufacturing) or consumption of contaminated water and foods (e.g., herbs, rice). Arsenic is taken up by erythrocytes, where it <strong>binds to sulfhydryl groups</strong> and impairs various enzymatic reactions, leading to <strong>impaired cellular respiration</strong>. <br><br>Acute toxicity can present with diarrhea, vomiting, <strong>garlic breath</strong>, and <strong>QT-interval prolongation</strong>. Chronic exposure can cause <strong>sensorimotor neuropathy</strong>, skin <strong>hypopigmentation</strong> or <strong>hyperpigmentation</strong>, and <strong>hyperkeratosis </strong>of the palms and soles. <strong>Mees lines</strong>, which are horizontal striations on the fingernails, may also be present. <br><br>Diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and measurement of <strong>urine arsenic excretion</strong>. Other laboratory abnormalities include <strong>pancytopenia </strong>and <strong>elevated liver enzymes</strong>. Chelation agents such as <strong>dimercaprol </strong>or <strong>succimer </strong>can treat arsenic toxicity. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acetaminophen intoxication:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Patients with acetaminophen overdose can present nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and malaise. Although severe intoxication can cause liver damage and elevated liver enzymes, it would not typically cause peripheral neuropathy, dyspigmentation, hyperkeratosis, or pancytopenia. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Organophosphate poisoning:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Organophosphate poisoning can present with symptoms of cholinergic hyperactivity such as bradycardia, miosis, bronchorrhea, salivation, and lacrimation. This patient&#8217;s symptoms are inconsistent with those of organophosphate poisoning. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lorazepam overdose:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Affected patients can present with nervous system depression and occasionally respiratory depression. Benzodiazepine overdose would not typically cause peripheral neuropathy or cutaneous changes. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Arsenic poisoning:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ethylene glycol poisoning &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Patients with ethylene glycol poisoning can present with abdominal pain, vomiting, and altered mental status. In contrast, the peripheral neuropathy, skin dyspigmentation, and hyperkeratosis seen in this patient is instead consistent with a different exposure. &#160;</span></div>",
