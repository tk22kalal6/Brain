Underlying etiologies of this condition include <strong>pathological contraction of the pterygoid muscles</strong> secondary to repeated jaw clenching or grinding, misalignment, or trauma. Patients often develop <strong>hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve (CV V<sub>3</sub>)</strong> and subsequent otalgia, given the nerve&#8217;s proximity to the TMJ. Classic symptoms include dull, waxing and waning jaw/facial pain, clicking and popping with jaw movement, ear pain, fullness, and tinnitus. <br><br><strong>The mandibular nerve</strong>, the largest branch of the trigeminal nerve, supplies sensation to the TMJ in addition to the floor of the mouth, anterior tongue, and the lower face. In addition, this nerve contributes to sensory innervation to the <strong>external auditory canal</strong>. Therefore, TMJ disorder can also present with <strong>referred ear pain</strong>. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Trigeminal nerve &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypoglossal nerve &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) carries general motor innervation to the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue.

The <strong>facial nerve CN VII (parotid plexus)</strong> can be injured during <strong>parotidectomy</strong> or from compression by a <strong>parotid gland tumor</strong>. Damage to the CN VII or its branches will cause <strong>paralysis of the facial muscles</strong>, causing them to lose tone. The inferior eyelid can be particularly affected, resulting in an inability to close the eye entirely. <br><br>Similarly at risk during parotid pathologies, the <strong>auriculotemporal nerve</strong>, a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3), is closely related to the parotid gland and <strong>passes superior</strong> to it along with the superficial temporal vessels. The auriculotemporal nerve <strong>innervates the parotid sheath</strong> as well as the overlying skin.

The condition is often seen in preterm infants and Asian newborns. &#160;<br><br>Physiologic jaundice of the newborn is caused by three factors. First, fetal erythrocytes have<strong>&#160;shorter lifespans</strong>. As a result, more unconjugated bilirubin gets produced. Second, newborn livers have<strong>&#160;immature UDP-glucuronyl transferase&#160;</strong>that is inefficient in conjugating bilirubin. Third, there is<strong>&#160;increased enterohepatic circulation</strong> of bilirubin. This phenomenon is because there is a lower concentration of bacteria in neonatal digestive tracts, and therefore there is less intestinal bacterial conversion of conjugated bilirubin to urobilin, which is excreted via urine. As a result, more conjugated bilirubin is broken down into unconjugated bilirubin by beta-glucuronidase (an intestinal enzyme) and reabsorbed. &#160;<br><br>Physiologic jaundice of the newborn is usually a<strong> benign condition</strong> that resolves in 1-2 weeks. Most cases do not require treatment. In severe cases, treatment with <strong>non-UV phototherapy </strong>is used to isomerize unconjugated bilirubin into a water-soluble form that can be excreted via urine.

The transporter that mediates this uptake is the <strong>apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT)</strong>. The reabsorbed bile acids enter the portal bloodstream and are taken up rapidly by hepatocytes, reconjugated, and resecreted into bile (enterohepatic circulation). Typically, the bile acid pool circulates ~5&#8211;10 times daily. Intestinal reabsorption of the pool is about 95% efficient; therefore, fecal loss of bile acids is in the range of 0.2&#8211;0.4 g/d.

      "solution": "<strong>Bilirubin</strong> is the pigment that gives bile its color and is a byproduct of <strong>hemoglobin metabolism</strong>. The red blood cells are destroyed near the end of their lifespan by immune cells. Macrophages break down hemoglobin into heme and iron. Next, an enzyme called <strong>heme oxidase</strong> converts heme to biliverdin, which is green in color. Then, the enzyme biliverdin reductase converts biliverdin into bilirubin, which is yellow, and the bilirubin enters the blood. The bilirubin in the blood is not water-soluble and is referred to as <strong>unconjugated bilirubin</strong>. Albumin in the blood binds to the unconjugated bilirubin and transports it to the hepatocytes. Within the hepatocytes, the enzyme <strong>uridine glucuronyl transferase</strong> attaches the unconjugated bilirubin to <strong>glucuronic acid</strong>, turning it into <strong>conjugated bilirubin.</strong> The conjugation of bilirubin allows the bilirubin to become more water-soluble. As a result, conjugated bilirubin can be secreted into bile, whereas unconjugated bilirubin is typically not found in bile. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The bilirubin released in the blood from macrophages is water-soluble.:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The bilirubin in the blood is not water-soluble and is referred to as unconjugated bilirubin.
