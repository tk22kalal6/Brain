Some colorectal cancers can develop a V600E mutation of BRAF, driving high ERK signaling output independently. Similar mutations in BRAF are common in melanomas and some thyroid cancers and are associated with more aggressive phenotypes. &#160;Therefore, inhibition of BRAF signaling is a key aspect of treatment in these cancers, as it significantly stifles cell proliferation in aberrant cells. BRAF inhibition is seldom used&#160;alone and&#160;is often combined with inhibition of complement pathways of tumorigenesis, including EGFR, MEK, PI3K, and&#160;Wnt&#160;pathways. BRAF inhibitors include&#160;encorafenib, dabrafenib, and vemurafenib.

The purpose of the greater omentum is threefold: 1) Fatty thermal insulation and a physical promotility agent for the intestines, 2) physical barrier to protect against infections and wounds, and 3) centralized hub for immune activity. &#160; &#160; <br><br>Pathologies involving the omentum are rare. The greater omentum can undergo <strong>torsion</strong>, whereby the omentum pivots on its long axis and cuts off its blood supply. The greater omentum can whorl around a nidus of adhesion or tumor, as is seen in the CT above. Since the omentum is vascularized, this whorling is an acute surgical emergency as it can cause acute ischemia and subsequent necrosis of the omentum. Torsion of the greater omentum can present as an acute abdomen. The twisted segment is often localized to the right-side segment and presentation with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain can mimic acute appendicitis.

This phenomenon occurs because the right hemidiaphragm is <strong>protected by the large size of the liver. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Hiatal hernias</strong> also occur when gastrointestinal contents protrude into the chest cavity through an opening in the diaphragm. They protrude through the opening in the diaphragm called the hiatus. Hiatal hernias occur when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity. There are two types of hiatal hernias: sliding hernias and paraesophageal hernias. <strong>Sliding hernias</strong> occur when the fundus of the stomach bulges directly into the thoracic cavity. In contrast, <strong>paraesophageal hernias</strong> occur when the gastric fundus bulges into the thoracic cavity adjacent to the esophagus.

Whereas, a <strong>ruptured spleen</strong> may result in <strong>massive intra-abdominal bleeding</strong> and should therefore be treated as a medical emergency. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Duodenal hematoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Rapid compression of the abdomen against the vertebral column can crush the duodenum, potentially causing duodenal hematoma. It does not cause free intraperitoneal fluid as the bleeding remains confined to the duodenal wall. Moreover, this patient suffered trauma from the left side of his vehicle. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Abdominal aortic rupture:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Abdominal aortic rupture is frequently fatal due to the profuse bleeding that results from the rupture, and many patients die of examination before reaching the hospital. The minority of the patients who survive is most likely due to the containment of the blood in the retroperitoneal space. Moreover, a blunt trauma from the left side is less likely to cause aortic rupture. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Liver laceration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Blunt force mechanisms such as motor vehicle accidents are a common cause of liver laceration, and FAST may show free intraperitoneal fluid. Tenderness, however, is located over the right upper quadrant (rather than LUQ as seen in this patient). &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diaphragmatic injury:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Diaphragmatic injury can occur after blunt trauma due to a sudden increase in intra abdominal pressure. Chest auscultation may reveal bowel sounds. Free intraperitoneal fluid on FAST in this patient is suggestive of splenic laceration.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Splenic laceration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div>",

      "text": "A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being tackled during a football match. The patient was knocked to the ground by another player. He experienced sudden-onset sharp pain in the abdomen and left shoulder. He subsequently lost consciousness. Before the incident, the patient had been experiencing fatigue and sore throat for two weeks. He has no significant past medical history and was screened with an ECG prior to playing football. At arrival, temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), blood pressure is 90/60, and pulse is 110/min. Physical examination reveals diffuse abdominal guarding and rigidity. Elevation of the legs leads to the patient grimacing in pain and grabbing his left shoulder. Palpation of the left upper abdominal quadrant also causes the patient to grimace in pain. The bilateral tonsils are swollen and erythematous, and there is bilateral posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Which of the following best explains this patient&#8217;s shoulder pain? &#160;",

      "solution": "This patient presents with acute-onset abdominal pain and hypotension after being tackled during a football match. In addition, he likely has concurrent infectious mononucleosis given his symptoms of fatigue, sore throat, and findings of swollen, erythematous tonsils bilaterally with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. In combination, these findings are concerning for a <strong>splenic rupture</strong> and associated <strong>internal bleeding. &#160; &#160; <br></strong><br>The patient experienced <strong>left shoulder pain&#160;</strong>after the tackle and grimaces from left shoulder pain when the legs are elevated. This finding of left shoulder pain from irritation of the left diaphragm is known as the <strong>Kehr Sign</strong>. It is a classic example of<strong>&#160;referred pain.&#160;</strong>The pathophysiology of Kehr Sign is the same as that of other types of referred pain: visceral pain in one location of the body is interpreted as somatic pain in another due to effects of temporal and spatial summation of nerves arising from the same spinal level. &#160; &#160; <br>In this case, splenic rupture and filling of the abdominal cavity with blood irritates the<strong>&#160;inferior surface of the left diaphragm</strong>. Irritation of the underside of the diaphragm is signaled by the <strong>phrenic nerve</strong> which carries pain signals up to spinal nerve levels C3 and C4. The <strong>supraclavicular nerve</strong>, which innervates the skin over the shoulder, also inserts at cervical levels C3 and C4. As a result, there is referred pain to the left shoulder from splenic rupture. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Shoulder dislocation due to excessive force:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Shoulder dislocation does not explain this patient&#8217;s abdominal symptoms, head and neck findings, and hypotension. Splenic rupture associated with trauma in a patient with mononucleosis infection is more likely the cause of this constellation of findings. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Undiagnosed tumor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>An undiagnosed intra-abdominal malignancy would &#160;likely present with insidious and chronic pain. This patient has acute onset abdominal pain and hypotension after a traumatic tackle and signs of mononucleosis which would indicate splenic rupture. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Impingement of the supraclavicular nerve:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Impingement of this nerve would cause pain in the shoulder area.

Myocardial infarction would be unlikely in this young man with no prior medical history who had a screening ECG prior to playing sports. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Irritation of the diaphragm:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div>",
