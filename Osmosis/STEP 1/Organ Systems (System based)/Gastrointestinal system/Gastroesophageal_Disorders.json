      "solution": "This newborn infant boy has a midline non-reducible mass covered in a whitish membrane, which is consistent with <strong>omphalocele</strong>. Omphalocele is often associated with <strong>other anomalies</strong>, including chromosomal (e.g. trisomies 13 and 18), syndromic (e.g. Beckwith-Wiedemann) and other structural anomalies (e.g., cardiac, genitourinary, neural tube). This patient has low set ears, micrognathia and clenched fingers, and therefore most likely has <strong>Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18)</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Both gastroschisis and omphalocele are ventral abdominal wall defects, and they can often be confused with each other. However, these are distinct clinical entities, with different presentations, embryologic causes, and outcomes. During embryological development, the four body folds (rostral, caudal, and two lateral folds) fuse to form a normal abdominal wall. <strong>Omphalocele</strong> occurs when<strong>&#160;lateral folds</strong> fail to migrate and fuse at the umbilical ring. This failure causes the abdominal contents to remain <strong>persistently</strong>&#160;<strong>herniated</strong> into the umbilicus instead of returning to the abdominal cavity during the 10th week of embryological development. The abdominal contents are <strong>midline</strong> as they protrude through the umbilicus, and are <strong>covered with peritoneum.</strong>&#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Gastroschisis</strong> occurs when the abdominal wall fails to close normally, and it is believed to be due to disrupted blood flow to the developing abdominal wall. The intestines are <strong>not covered with peritoneum&#160;</strong>and protrude typically to the <strong>right of the umbilicus.&#160;</strong>This condition is usually an<strong>&#160;isolated defect,&#160;</strong>with approximately 10% having an associated anomaly.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/9RCNIx5bQIq030fpMj6DEOVWSOeFL_oq/_.png\"></div><br><br>Both defects can be detected early in pregnancy via ultrasound, and an elevated <strong>maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein&#160;</strong>(MSAFP) can also be seen (higher in gastroschisis than omphalocele). Both can be treated with surgical repair after birth. The overall survival with gastroschisis is over 90%, while survival in omphalocele is lower mainly due to associated anomalies. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Persistence of the vitelline duct&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Persistence of the vitelline duct (omphalomesenteric) is the cause of Meckel diverticulum. The vitelline duct joins the yolk sac to the midgut lumen of the developing fetus. It may contain ectopic acid-secreting gastric mucosa and/or pancreatic tissue and can present with pain, hematochezia (bloody feces), intussusception, and/or volvulus. It does not present with a sack protruding through the abdominal wall.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Failure of urachus involution&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The urachus is a duct that connects the fetal bladder and the umbilicus. Failure of urachus to involute can cause a patent urachus, urachal cyst, or vesicoureteral diverticulum. In the case of a patent urachus, the patient would have urine coming out of the umbilicus. A urachal cyst would present with a painful mass below the umbilicus.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Failure of lateral body fold fusion&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Failure of umbilical ring closure&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Improper closure of the umbilical ring after reduction of the intestines during embryological development results in an umbilical hernia. The hernia is usually reducible, asymptomatic, and resolves in the first few years of life. In contrast to omphalocele, in which the body folds fail to fuse, in umbilical hernias, the body folds develop properly. The physiologic midgut herniation persists and results in a simple hernia that is covered by the skin.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Failure of gut rotation &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Failure of the gut to rotate is the cause of intestinal malrotation. During 4<span>th</span>-8<span>th</span> week of embryonic development, there is physiologic extrusion and reduction of the gut through the umbilical ring. The gut performs 270&#176;-degree rotation around the axis of the superior mesenteric artery. The abnormal position of the gut is termed malrotation. It does not cause a protrusion through the abdominal wall.&#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "This patient has <strong>duodenal atresia,</strong> a condition associated with <strong>trisomy 21</strong>. During embryological development, the primitive gut tube undergoes a solid stage where proliferating cells fill it up. Normally, the gut subsequently undergoes recanalization, and the lumen re-forms. If recanalization fails in the region giving rise to the duodenum, the result is duodenal atresia. &#160; <br><br>A similar condition is <strong>jejunal/ileal atresia,</strong> which occurs when ischemia causes necrosis and reabsorption of portions of the gut tube. The condition is associated with <strong>cystic fibrosis</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Both conditions result in a blind pouch and intestinal obstruction. In utero, these conditions cause <strong>polyhydramnios</strong>. After birth, these conditions cause <strong>difficulty feeding</strong> and <strong>vomiting</strong>. The vomitus can be non-bilious or bilious depending on whether the obstruction is proximal/distal to the major duodenal papilla, respectively. Additionally, patients with duodenal atresia can develop biliary atresia and annular pancreas because the region of the embryonic gut giving rise to the duodenum also gives rise to the pancreas and hepatobiliary tree. &#160; &#160;<br>Both conditions are diagnosed by <strong>radiography</strong>. Duodenal atresia causes the &#8220;<strong>double-bubble sign</strong>&#8221;, where both the duodenum and nearby stomach are filled with air.

In contrast, this patient&#8217;s physical exam findings of upslanted palpebral fissures, prominent epicanthal folds, and single transverse palmar creases are consistent with trisomy 21. Patients with trisomy 21 are at increased risk of developing duodenal atresia.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Failure of the duodenum to recanalize&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This answer describes hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Patients with trisomy 21 are at increased risk of developing the condition, and Hirschsprung disease can cause bilious vomiting. However, it would also cause a distended abdomen, since stool cannot be eliminated, as opposed to a scaphoid abdomen. Additionally, neonates with Hirschsprung disease typically have a positive squirt sign (expulsion of stool on digital rectal examination), as well as increased rectal tone, neither of which are seen in this patient.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Abnormal rotation of the small intestines&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Malrotation of the intestines can lead to a midgut volvulus. It can cause intestinal obstruction, vomiting, and a distended abdomen. However, many of this patient&#8217;s physical examination findings (e.g., prominent epicanthal folds, single transverse palmar crease) are consistent with trisomy 21, which predisposes patients to developing duodenal atresia.&#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "&#160;This patient has <strong>dysphagia, regurgitation and recurrent episodes of pneumonia.</strong> Along with the barium swallow test results, the most likely diagnosis is a <strong>Zenker diverticulum. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Zenker diverticulum is an <strong>outpouching&#160;</strong>of the mucosa and submucosa through the <strong>Killian triangle</strong> (also called the Killian dehiscence), an area in the posterior wall of the <strong>pharynx between the cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus</strong> (the 2 parts of the inferior constrictors). The pathogenesis of Zenker diverticulum is not entirely clear, but it is thought to be associated with altered function of the upper esophageal sphincter, esophageal dysmotility, or esophageal shortening. This dysfunction leads to impaired bolus passage and increased intraluminal pressure. As a result, the mucosa and submucosa emerge through a natural area of weakness, the Killian's triangle. In contrast to a Meckel diverticulum, a Zenker diverticulum is a false diverticula which contains only mucosa and submucosa. Patients typically present with complaints of dysphagia, regurgitation, halitosis (bad breath), and occasionally an observed neck mass. Possible complications include aspiration pneumonia, ulceration and bleeding (due to retained oral medications), fistula formation, and vocal cord paralysis (pressure buildup from retained food).

A common complication of this condition is <strong>recurrent aspiration pneumonia.</strong> If small, a Zenker diverticulum is treated conservatively; larger diverticula are traditionally treated with surgery to incise the cricopharyngeus muscle and resect the diverticulum. &#160; <br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Junction between the cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Junction between the middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictors muscles:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The area between the middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictors muscles is not involved in a Zenker diverticulum's pathogenesis.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Junction between the upper part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictors &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The thyropharyngeus muscle refers to the upper part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictors muscle, which is not the site of formation of a Zenker diverticulum.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Junction between the superior and middle pharyngeal constrictors:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The junction between the superior and middle pharyngeal constrictors is not involved in the pathogenesis of a Zenker diverticulum.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Junction between the circular and longitudinal fibers of the esophagus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The junction between the circular and longitudinal fibers of the esophagus is not involved in Zenker diverticulum formation.</span></div>",

They are most often caused by<strong>&#160;portal hypertension</strong>, which may be secondary to liver cirrhosis brought about by hepatitis or chronic alcohol use. Portal hypertension leads to increased pressure within the small vessels that connect the portal circulation to the systemic circulation. Over time, these small systemic vessels dilate, and blood is shunted through these anastomoses, which have lower resistance than the liver circulation. In particular, dilation of the <strong>left gastric and azygos veins</strong> contributes to the development of esophageal varices. &#160; <br><br>Patients with esophageal varices can have life-threatening <strong>hematemesis&#160;</strong>if the varices rupture. This complication may occur when eating hard food or during vomiting.

Patients typically present with intermittent dysphagia to solids, although some may be asymptomatic depending on the size of the ring. Diagnosis is made with an endoscopy or barium swallow test (more sensitive), showing a concentric band of mucosa, protruding into the lumen. On biopsy, rings are composed of mucosa and submucosa, hyperkeratosis and occasional eosinophils. Biopsy is always performed on endoscopy because Schatzki rings are often associated with <strong>eosinophilic esophagitis</strong>.

The barium swallow test results show characteristic dilated esophagus with distal stenosis (<strong>&#8220;bird&#8217;s beak&#8221;</strong>). &#160; <br><br>Deglutition (swallowing) is a complex process that involves a series of synchronized voluntary and involuntary muscle contractions. It is divided into the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases. In short, the food is chewed into bolus and propagated by the tongue towards the pharynx. The bolus is then transited to the pharynx and pushed into the esophagus by sequential contraction of pharyngeal constrictor muscles. The bolus enters the esophagus and by waves of peristalsis moves downwards.

The cholinergic neurons that contribute to lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone by smooth muscle contraction are relatively spared.

A distinguishing diagnostic feature of H. pylori gastritis when compared to chronic autoimmune gastritis is the location of the metaplasia and atrophy seen on histologic specimens. Most patients with chronic gastritis due to H. pylori will demonstrate these pathologic changes in the <strong>antrum&#160;</strong>of the stomach, whereas patients with chronic autoimmune gastritis will have these changes primarily in the body/fundus. &#160; <br><br>Clinically, chronic H. pylori gastritis presents with symptoms of dyspepsia over weeks to months but may go unrecognized entirely. H. pylori preferentially invades the <strong>antrum&#160;</strong>to avoid the acidic secretions by parietal cells in the fundus and body. In the antrum, colonization by the bacteria drives proliferation and increased secretion of gastrin by G-cells. Gastrin stimulates parietal cells to secrete additional hydrochloric acid, eroding the gastric mucosa and causing atrophy and loss of glandular cells with replacement by metaplastic epithelium. Colonization in the antrum also damages delta cells, involved in the secretion of somatostatin. With decreased somatostatin levels, gastrin becomes uninhibited, leading to increased secretion of acid by parietal cells. &#160;With continued inflammation, <strong>MALT lymphoma</strong>, a tumor of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue, can arise. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Fundus of the stomach:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The fundus is the most common area of the stomach affected by chronic autoimmune gastritis, which typically presents in patients with additional autoimmune disorders and pernicious anemia. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Gastroesophageal junction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The gastroesophageal junction is implicated in Barrett esophagus.

Appropriate treatment for GERD includes lifestyle modification and medications that reduce acid suppression, such as <strong>proton pump inhibitors</strong> (PPIs). GERD is caused by transient <strong>lower esophageal sphincter relaxation</strong>, which results in the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus. &#160;<br><br>Clinically, GERD presents with burning in the throat or chest, regurgitation, or an acidic taste in the mouth while lying flat or lying flat immediately after eating. GERD can also present with atypical features including<strong>&#160;chronic cough, globus sensation</strong> (the feeling that something is stuck in the throat), <strong>wheezing, or nausea</strong>. Risk factors for GERD include <strong>obesity</strong>, hiatal hernias, and pregnancy, since these conditions tend to increase intrathoracic pressure and regurgitation of stomach contents. <strong>Smoking&#160;</strong>is also a notable risk factor, due to its ability to relax the lower esophageal sphincter. &#160;<br><br>If left untreated, GERD can progress to <strong>esophageal stricture, Barrett esophagus&#160;</strong>and ultimately <strong>esophageal cancer</strong>.

She most likely has <strong>gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</strong> and is started on <strong>omeprazole</strong>, a <strong>proton pump inhibitor (PPI)&#160;</strong>that is considered a <strong>first-line&#160;</strong>agent for treating GERD. &#160; <br><br>Physiologically, when food enters the stomach, it causes the stomach walls to distend. These changes lead to the activation of branches of the vagus nerve and the release of <strong>acetylcholine</strong>, thereby activating <strong>M3 receptors</strong> on<strong>&#160;parietal cells</strong> of the stomach. Next, the<strong>&#160;G-cells</strong> in the gastric antrum release <strong>gastrin</strong>, activating <strong>CCK2 receptors</strong> on parietal cells. Gastrin and acetylcholine activate the <strong>enterochromaffin-like</strong> (ECL) <strong>cells</strong>, which release <strong>histamine&#160;</strong>and cause activation of <strong>H2 receptors</strong> on gastric parietal cells. Activation of M3, CCK2, and H2 receptors increases the conversion of water and CO2 to H+ and HCO3- by<strong>&#160;carbonic anhydrase.</strong> The <strong>H+</strong> is then <strong>pumped out</strong> of the parietal cells and the stomach via the <strong>H+/K+ ATPase pump.</strong> These H+ ions combine with Cl- ions to form hydrochloric acid and help <strong>decrease the stomach pH. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>PPIs work by<strong>&#160;irreversibly inhibiting&#160;</strong>the<strong>&#160;H+/K+ ATPase pump,</strong> thereby inhibiting the release of hydrogen ions into the stomach.
