Afterward, he <strong>started&#160;</strong>having <strong>severe watery diarrhea.</strong> Magnesium <strong>hydroxide&#160;</strong>is the most likely cause of this patient&#8217;s symptoms of the answer choices listed. &#160; <br><br>Magnesium hydroxide is an <strong>antacid</strong>, a class of medication that neutralizes gastric acid and reduces acid delivery to the duodenum. Several antacids are available, including magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, and calcium carbonate. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Magnesium hydroxide is sold as chewable tablets, capsules, and liquid formulations with various added flavors. It is primarily used to alleviate constipation by acting as an <strong>osmotic laxative</strong> but can also relieve indigestion and heartburn. When taken orally, the osmotic force of the magnesia suspension draws fluids from the intracellular compartment and retains those already within the intestinal lumen. These changes distend the bowel, thus stimulating nerves within the colon wall, inducing peristalsis and <strong>diarrhea</strong>. Moreover, the medication can occasionally cause <strong>hypermagnesemia </strong>in patients with renal insufficiency. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Aluminum hydroxide antacid:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Aluminum hydroxide is used as an antacid. It neutralizes the acidity of stomach content, which may relieve the symptoms of ulcers, heartburn, or dyspepsia. It can, however, cause constipation and is therefore often used with magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate, which have counterbalancing laxative effects. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Histamine 2 receptor antagonists:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) block the action of histamine at the H2 receptors of gastric parietal cells, thereby decreasing gastric acid production. Side effects are uncommon and include vitamin B12 deficiency, mental status changes, cardiotoxicity, and idiosyncratic myelosuppression. Gastrointestinal upset is rare.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Magnesium hydroxide antacid:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Prokinetic:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A prokinetic agent (e.g. metoclopramide) is a drug that enhances gastrointestinal motility by increasing the strength and frequency of intestinal contractions without disrupting their rhythm. Prokinetic agents can cause increased stool frequency but are not available over the counter and are not indicated for the management of reflux symptoms. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sucralfate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Sucralfate is a sulfated polysaccharide complexed with aluminum hydroxide. It prevents acute, chemically-induced mucosal damage and heals chronic ulcers. Side effects are uncommon and include aluminum-induced neurotoxicity, anemia, and hypophosphatemia. Gastrointestinal upset is atypical. &#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "This patient has localized abdominal pain after undergoing an aortic aneurysm repair that was complicated by hypotension and blood loss. The most likely cause of his symptom is colonic <strong>ischemia</strong>, which occurs when blood flow to the large intestines is reduced to a level that is inadequate for delivery of the oxygen and nutrients required for cellular metabolism.<br><br>The condition typically affects the <strong>elderly</strong>. Watershed regions of the colon, such as the <strong>splenic flexure</strong> and <strong>distal sigmoid</strong> colon, are most often affected. These areas are watershed regions, which are defined as the vascular territories covered only by the distal reaches of major arteries; their blood supply is therefore limited, making them more susceptible to ischemia. Causes of colonic ischemia include periods of hypotension (e.g. blood loss during surgery), atherosclerosis, diabetes, and embolism. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Acute colonic ischemia&#160;</strong>causes moderate, crampy, <strong>left-sided abdominal pain</strong>, <strong>hematochezia</strong>, and <strong>diarrhea</strong>. In contrast, chronic colonic ischemia causes recurrent postprandial abdominal pain that is usually accompanied by bloody diarrhea and unintentional weight loss. <br><br>Abdominal radiographs or CT are often the first tests ordered in patients with suspected colonic ischemia.

The formation of these lesions is not completely understood, but they are thought to be the result of decreased epithelial cell turnover and delayed shedding of surface epithelial cells, which leads to a &#8220;pileup&#8221; of goblet cells. This excess of goblet cells ultimately causes the <strong>hyperproliferation</strong> seen in the basal portion of the crypts, while the luminal surface has a superficial <strong>serrated architecture</strong>.

The biopsy results show a <strong>villous adenomatous polyp,</strong> which is a <strong>premalignant</strong> lesion. Clinically, adenomatous polyps are usually asymptomatic, but some may cause occult bleeding, secretory diarrhea, or partial intestinal obstruction. &#160; <br><br>Adenomatous polyps can be classified into three categories: villous, tubulovillous, and tubular. Amongst them, villous polyps have the highest malignant potential. The transformation from normal epithelium to adenomatous polyp, and later carcinoma, is termed the <strong>adenoma-carcinoma sequence.</strong> It is characterized by a series of mutations: &#160; <br><br><strong>1) Normal mucosa to colon-at-risk:</strong> A change from normal mucosa to an at-risk colon occurs by acquiring a mutation in the <strong>adenomatous polyposis coli (</strong><em>APC</em>) <strong>gene</strong>, which is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 5. Loss of the <em>APC</em> gene leads to accumulation of the &#946;-catenin protein (transcription factor), which leads to constitutive transcription and unregulated cell proliferation. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>2) Colon-at-risk to adenomatous polyps</strong>: The <strong><em>KRAS</em></strong> proto-oncogene normally encodes for proteins that regulate cell-signal transduction. Mutations in <em>KRAS</em> lead to the formation of stabilized forms of these proteins, which makes them resistant to degradation. The presence of these stabilized proteins leads to constant transmission of extracellular growth signals. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>3) Adenomatous polyps to colorectal cancer:</strong> This final step is believed to be caused by a loss of tumor suppressor genes, such as <strong><em>TP53</em></strong> and <strong><em>DCC</em></strong>, which are normally responsible for negatively regulating the cell cycle. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ TP53:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: <em>TP53</em> is a tumor suppressor gene and often referred to as \"guardian of the genome\".

Diverticulosis and diverticulitis are diseases primarily seen in Western nations, and they are thought to be due to <strong>diets low in fiber</strong>. The exact pathogenic mechanism for diverticula formation is unknown, but one theory suggests that diverticula form in response to increased intracolonic pressures generated when the colon is processing smaller, non&#8211;fiber-containing stools. This increased pressure eventually pushes out part of the colon, forming sac-like appendages at the weakest segments, at the point where the colon is fed by blood vessels called the <strong>vasa recta</strong>. &#160;<br><br>When a diverticulum becomes obstructed with a small amount of stool, this leads to stasis, inflammation, and infection. Most cases of diverticulitis classically present with focal left lower quadrant abdominal pain and the generalized symptoms of malaise, low grade fevers, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. Uncomplicated diverticulitis involving microperforations can be diagnosed clinically and responds well to outpatient oral antibiotic therapy. Patients with concern for complicated diverticulitis involving macro-perforations, failure of outpatient therapy, or diagnostic uncertainty should undergo <strong>CT of the abdomen and pelvis with both IV and oral contrast</strong>, and they should then be admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics. Risk factors for the development of complicated diverticulitis include <strong>older age, failure of outpatient therapy, and immunocompromised patients</strong>.

They are caused by a mutation in <strong>adenomatous polyposis coli&#160;</strong>(APC), a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 5 that is responsible for regulating cell growth and adhesion. The two predictors of a polyp&#8217;s likelihood of undergoing malignant transformation are: <strong>1)&#160;</strong>size and<strong>&#160;2)</strong> histological appearance. &#160; <br><br><strong>Increasing polyp size</strong> is the most important characteristic that correlates with malignancy risk. Adenomatous polyps less than 1-cm are less likely to acquire subsequent mutations and undergo malignant transformation. In contrast, adenomatous polyps greater than 4-cm are much more likely to progress to adenocarcinoma. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Furthermore, based on histological appearance, there are three types of adenomatous polyps: villous, tubular, and tubulovillous. <strong>Villous polyps,</strong> which have a cauliflower-like appearance, have the highest malignant potential. <strong>Tubular polyps,</strong> which are pedunculated polyps that protrude out into the intestinal lumen, have the lowest malignant potential. <strong>Tubulovillous polyps,&#160;</strong>which have characteristics of both tubular and villous polyps, have an intermediate malignant potential. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Clinically, adenomatous polyps are mostly asymptomatic.

Blind intestinal loops are vulnerable to stasis and bacterial proliferation. In SIBO, intestinal bacteria<strong>&#160;deconjugate primary bile acids</strong>, resulting in impaired dietary fat absorption and subsequent steatorrhea. <br><br>The <strong>D-xylose test</strong> measures the absorptive capacity of the small intestine and is used to determine whether defects in the intestinal mucosa are responsible for malabsorption. In cases of SIBO, increased bacterial proliferation results in impaired D-xylose absorption.

In patients with SIBO, D-xylose absorption will often increase following a course of antibiotics. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/mpoXOTuuTzScVn9H6sUe2An1RkCWO3t9/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/mqYVGnOVTy6-b27gX8vMd8L8Q__0Wb9E/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Microbial overgrowth in the small intestine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reduced secretion of pancreatic lipase and colipase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Chronic pancreatitis is the most common cause of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in adults.

      "solution": "The dark spots throughout this patient&#8217;s colon are referred to as &#8220;melanosis coli.&#8221; Melanosis coli is caused by stimulant laxatives such as senna and bisacodyl. As the metabolic breakdown products of these laxatives pass through the colon, they become active and cause cell death and apoptosis in the lining of the colon, causing lipofuscin deposition (not melanin as the name might imply) and eventually dark pigmentation of the colon. Melanosis coli is not associated with an increased risk of colon cancer and resolves with the discontinuation of laxatives.<br><br>Stimulant laxatives act by causing direct inflammation of the colon, which in turn causes the colon to reflexively undergo peristalsis. Stimulant laxatives are meant to be used as short-term therapies for constipation, and should not usually be used on a chronic basis. Dietary alterations, patient education, and regular exercise are key first steps for the treatment of constipation, followed by bulking agents such as psyllium, if indicated. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Metastatic adenocarcinoma to the colon:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Metastatic adenocarcinoma to the colon would likely present with multiple masses visible on imaging and/or on colonoscopy. The findings on this patient&#8217;s colonoscopy of dark pigmented spots are not suggestive of any underlying masses. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer may describe weight loss, fatigue, pencil-thin stools, hematochezia, or others. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Previous polypectomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: &#160;When found on colonoscopy, polyps are typically resected and harvested using an endoscopic snare for pathologic analysis in order to assess risk for possible malignancy. Minor bleeding may occur during cold or hot snaring. The finding in this patient&#8217;s colonoscopy of dark pigmented mucosa would not likely be from previous polyp resection sites from 10 years ago. More importantly, the patient&#8217;s previous colonoscopy is reported as normal. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Mucosal artifact from repeated colonoscopy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A well-executed colonoscopy has virtually no chance of chronically irritating the bowel mucosa. Submucosal dissection and perforation are the most common adverse events associated with colonoscopy and carry approximately a 7% and 1% risk, respectively. These would not cause dark pigmented spots in the colon. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Medication effect:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ulcerative colitis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Ulcerative colitis often has profound and easily recognizable findings on colonoscopy including edema, erythema, backwash ileitis, erosions, ulcerations, and loss of the typical vascular pattern. The dark mucosal pigmentation described in this patient&#8217;s colonoscopy is not indicative of ulcerative colitis. &#160;</span></div>",
