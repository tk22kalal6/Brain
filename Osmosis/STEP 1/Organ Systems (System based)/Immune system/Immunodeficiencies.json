Acute graft rejection can be reversed with the use of potent immunosuppressants; this includes steroids or mycophenolate mofetil. &#160;<br><br>Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressant that can be used to protect against (or reverse) organ transplant rejection. It inhibits purine synthesis by inhibiting inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo purine synthesis. It preferentially targets this enzyme in B- and T-lymphocytes, the main cells responsible for acute and chronic graft rejection. In addition, it can be used against a wide range of autoimmune disorders such as lupus nephritis, and autoimmune hepatitis. &#160;&#160;<br><br>One of the advantages of mycophenolate mofetil is that it is less likely to cause nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitors. However, it is associated with significant GI symptoms, and less commonly hypertension, hyperglycemia, and even pancytopenia. &#160;<br><br>IMPDH is also the target of ribavirin, an antiviral agent used in the treatment of hepatitis C virus and respiratory syncytial virus.

      "solution": "This patient has developed an elevation in serum creatinine after kidney transplantation. Absence of significant findings on urinalysis and the elevated BUN/creatinine ratio suggests a prerenal cause. This is most likely due to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction caused by cyclosporine. &#160; <br><br>Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that is used frequently to prevent transplant rejection and can also be used in treatment of certain autoimmune disorders. Normally, after T-cells are exposed to an antigen, calcineurin gets activated and dephosphorylates a transcription factor known as the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT). NFAT then translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription of immune mediator cytokines; most importantly interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 provides the signal needed for T-cell activation and proliferation. Cyclosporine inhibits the transcription of IL-2 by inhibiting calcineurin, thereby halting T cell proliferation and protecting the transplanted organ from T cell-mediated injury. &#160; &#160;<br><br>One of the major limitations of cyclosporine use is its severe nephrotoxic effects. Acute nephrotoxicity is related to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, which decreases the glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and creatinine clearance. As there is no intrinsic kidney injury, the urinalysis is usually bland. This is usually reversible with cyclosporine dose reduction. Long-term use can cause chronic nephrotoxicity marked by tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which is usually irreversible. Cyclosporine can also cause hypertension, gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-JoTbcv5SKOTjUF-N9G1ZHf6TOex1HJX/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cyclosporine side effect:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sirolimus side effect:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant that is frequently used in combination with cyclosporine as a prophylaxis for transplant rejection.

During the acute phase, seroconversion (detection of antibodies against the HIV antigen) lags, and most antibody assays will test negative in otherwise positive patients. Next, <strong>the window period</strong> occurs between the acquisition of HIV infection and seroconversion--P24 antigen tests have to be found to be positive during this period.<br><br>Gradually, CD4 T lymphocytes decline coupled with a steady-state plasma viremia. During this <strong>latency period</strong>, most patients are asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms, including weight loss, fatigue, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy,, or a maculopapular rash.<br><br>If left undetected and treated, HIV infection can progress to <strong>AIDS or acute immunodeficiency syndrome</strong> in approximately 8-10 years. AIDS is a clinical outcome of HIV infection and is defined clinically as a CD4 count &lt;200 cells/microL or the presence of an AIDS-defining illness. AIDS-defining illnesses include opportunistic infections and malignancies such as <strong>esophageal candidiasis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infections, toxoplasmosis, disseminated mycobacterium avium infections, Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma, and Burkitt&#8217;s lymphoma</strong>, among others. <br><br>Notably, the clinical course in neonates (who acquire the infection perinatally) includes nonspecific symptoms such as lymphadenopathy, failure to thrive, and oral thrush. The most common AIDS-defining illnesses in the pediatric population include <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> infection, recurrent bacterial infections, wasting syndrome, candida esophagitis, HIV encephalopathy, and cytomegalovirus. NAT, nucleic acid amplification tests (identification of HIV RNA) are the diagnostic tests of choice in neonates instead of antibody/ antigen-antibody testing performed in adults. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Undetectable CD4 count:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hepatitis B core antibodies:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hepatitis B core antibodies suggest infection with acute hepatitis B.

The viral genome of HIV consists of two single strands of positive-sense RNA enclosed within a viral capsid envelope that consists of glycoproteins coded by the <strong><em>env</em> gene</strong>. The <em>env</em> gene codes for the <strong>glycoprotein gp160</strong>, which is subsequently cleaved into <strong>gp120 and gp41</strong>--allowing for viral entry into cells. Gp120 binds to chemokine receptors on dendritic cells, macrophages (CCR5), and T lymphocytes ( specifically CXCR4). Upon binding to host cell receptors, gp120 undergoes a conformational change that exposes gp41, allowing for the fusion of the viral cell membrane and T cell membrane. <br><br>The <strong><em>pol</em> gene</strong> codes for <strong>reverse transcriptase protein, integrase, and protease</strong>. Following viral entry, reverse transcriptase converts the viral genome to ds DNA and is incorporated into the host cell via integrase. The modified genome then gets transcribed into polyproteins cleaved into active proteins by the enzyme protease.

In HIV-infected patients, clinical manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis mimic symptoms of tuberculosis and include insidious onset of fever, weight loss, nonproductive cough, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy.

Severe deficits are almost exclusively seen in untreated HIV patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/microL and a high viral load. Clinical symptoms include subacute and progressive neurocognitive decline with deficits in memory, concentration, attention, impaired psychomotor speed, and depressive symptoms.

Immunosuppressed patients including HIV-AIDS patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/microL are particularly susceptible to PML. Clinical manifestations include subacute focal neurological deficits such as hemianopia, diplopia, hemiparesis, gait ataxia, or altered mental status.
