As a result, the B-cell will likely undergo class switching and produce non-IgM antibodies. &#160; <br><br>B-cells are produced and mature in the bone marrow, where they undergo VDJ recombination to produce different types of B-cell receptors (BCRs). Afterward, B-cells leave and travel to <strong>secondary lymphoid organs</strong> (e.g., spleen, lymph nodes). &#160; <br><br>B-cells are exposed to antigens in these lymphoid organs and can be activated in one of two ways. First, the B-cell can be activated if an antigen binds and causes <strong>crosslinking BCRs</strong>. Alternatively, if the complement C3d has attached to the antigen, it can activate a B-cell by binding to the <strong>BCR</strong> and <strong>CD21</strong> protein (which binds with C3d). &#160; <br><br>An activated B-cell then differentiates into a plasma cell that secretes <strong>only IgM</strong>. If an activated CD4+ T-cell is present, it can help the B-cell undergo class switching. Since B-cells are a type of antigen-presenting cell, they will present the antigen on an <strong>MHC class II</strong> molecule to the nearby CD4+ T-cell. Once the T-cell is activated, it will express <strong>CD40L</strong>, which binds to <strong>CD40</strong> on the B-cell.

Pathogenesis begins when environmental triggers cause cell damage and apoptosis, exposing nuclear material to the immune system. Genetic susceptibility can lead to poor clearance of these <strong>nuclear antigens</strong> and to the recognition of their moieties as foreign. Dendritic cells present these antigens to B-cells which then produce <strong>autoimmune&#160;</strong>antibodies, known as <strong>antinuclear antibodies (ANA)</strong>. These antibodies spread through the bloodstream, forming <strong>immune complexes</strong> with antigens encountered in the blood, and deposit within various organs. There, these immune complexes cause <strong>complement cascade</strong> activation, leading to enzyme-mediated cell damage, referred to as a<strong>&#160;type III hypersensitivity reaction</strong>. End-organ damage (e.g., rash, nephritis, synovitis) occurs as a result. &#160;<br><br>In addition, non-complexed auto-antibodies can directly bind to antigens recognized on the cell membranes of circulating hematologic cells, activating the complement pathway on the cell surface and causing cellular destruction. This <strong>type II hypersensitivity reaction</strong> causes the hematologic manifestation of SLE, including <strong>anemia&#160;</strong>(usually chronic, less often hemolytic), <strong>leukopenia&#160;</strong>(specifically lymphopenia), and <strong>thrombocytopenia&#160;</strong>(rarely less than 50,000/mm3). Processing of these antibody-covered cells may lead to lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
