      "solution": "Hypersensitivity reactions occur when the immune system responds abnormally to a stimulus, resulting in potential harm to the body. <strong>Type I hypersensitivity reactions</strong> are mediated by <strong>IgE and mast cells</strong> and can be associated with hives, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis. &#160; <br><br>Pathophysiology of type I hypersensitivity reactions involves binding IgE to the surface of mast cells and basophils via high-affinity receptors. This eventually results in <strong>cross-linking of IgE</strong> by antigens, leading to cellular activation and release of preformed and newly synthesized mediators, including <strong>histamine, tryptase, and leukotrienes</strong>. These mediators cause <strong>vasodilation, increased vasopermeability, and smooth-muscle contraction</strong>. The effects of these molecules are termed <strong>&#8220;early phase reactions''</strong>, as they happen within minutes of the second exposure. &#160; <br><br>There are also <strong>&#8220;late-phase reactions,&#8221;</strong> which happen<strong> 8-12 hours after exposure</strong>, where TH<sub>2</sub> cells, eosinophils, and basophils are recruited to the site of allergen exposure. These include interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-10, and leukotrienes. These mediators perform various cellular activities, including smooth muscle contraction, further release of histamine, and chemotaxis of neutrophils, mast cells, and additional eosinophils. &#160; <br><br><strong>Examples</strong> of type I hypersensitivity reactions include ingested allergens like foods, dander, bee stings, mold, drugs/medications, and pollen.

      "solution": "This patient has fever, graft site tenderness, and abnormal kidney function test one month after kidney transplantation. This presentation is concerning for <strong>acute graft rejection</strong>. Although the incidence of acute renal graft rejection has decreased immensely after the introduction of immunosuppressant drugs, it is still one of the leading causes of rejection. &#160;<br>Acute rejection develops due to recognition of the graft antigens by the immune system, and it results from two immunological immune responses that act in combination or alone: the cellular and the humoral immune responses. The cellular response is mediated by <strong>T-cells</strong>, which directly recognize MHC antigens on the graft and cause damage to the graft (T-cell dependent process), while the humoral response develops when <strong>B cells</strong> are recruited (by T-helper cells) and generate antibodies that cause acute humoral rejection (B-cell dependent process). Therefore, acute rejection is considered a <strong>type II</strong> (antibody-mediated) and <strong>type IV</strong> (cellular-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction. &#160; <br><br>Acute rejection develops from one week to three months after transplantation, and patients usually complain of <strong>fever</strong> and <strong>graft site tenderness</strong>. Additionally, there is typically decreased function of the transplanted organ; for example, patients with acute renal graft rejection develop <strong>anuria, metabolic abnormalities</strong> (e.g. hyperkalemia), and<strong>&#160;elevated serum creatinine</strong>, as seen in this patient. &#160;<br><br>A biopsy is needed to diagnose acute graft rejection and differentiate it from other diagnoses (e.g. tacrolimus toxicity).

TRALI is one of the causes of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, in which <strong>left ventricular function is normal</strong>. Although the pathophysiology of TRALI is not yet completely understood, it is believed that the condition develops <strong>secondary to the presence of anti-leukocyte antibodies</strong> (e.g. anti-HLA antibodies) in the donor&#8217;s plasma. These antibodies bind to recipient neutrophils and lead to their activation in the pulmonary capillaries. This activation then initiates an inflammatory response in the pulmonary capillaries, causing endothelial cell damage, massive cytokine release, and pulmonary edema. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients with TRALI develop severe <strong>shortness of breath&#160;</strong>within six hours of transfusion, commonly along with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension or hypertension. <strong>Hypoxemia&#160;</strong>develops and is characterized by oxygen saturation &lt;90% and a ratio of PaO2/FiO2 &lt;300. Chest radiography shows <strong>bilateral pulmonary infiltrates</strong> and pulmonary edema.

Like TRALI, TACO usually presents with acute dyspnea associated with bilateral pulmonary edema. However, TACO is associated with <strong>decreased left ventricular ejection fraction,&#160;</strong>which is normal in TRALI.

Hyperacute transplant rejection is a<strong>&#160;type II (antibody-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction</strong> and is a rare form of transplant rejection. &#160; <br><br>Hyperacute transplant rejection occurs due to <strong>preformed anti-donor antibodies&#160;</strong>(e.g. anti-donor HLA antibodies) that are present before transplantation, which most commonly formed from <strong>previous failed grafts</strong> (such as in this patient), <strong>previous transfusions,</strong> or <strong>previous pregnancies.</strong> Once the transplanted organ is perfused, these antibodies attack it, leading to activation of the complement system and coagulation system. This activation ultimately results in <strong>vessel thrombosis, organ ischemia and necrosis,</strong> and <strong>graft loss</strong>.

The most common mechanism is that<strong>&#160;leukocytes in the donor&#8217;s blood produce cytokines when stored,</strong> and once transfused, these cytokines stimulate the <strong>hypothalamus</strong>, causing elevation of body temperature. <br>2. Another mechanism is that the recipient produces <strong>antibodies against the HLA antigen</strong> on the donor&#8217;s leukocytes, and these antibodies attack the donor&#8217;s leukocytes and lyse them, causing fevers.<br><br>Although these patients usually have isolated <strong>fevers</strong>, some patients may develop anxiety, <strong>chills</strong>, and <strong>headaches</strong>.
