There are three main mechanisms by which CO<sub>2</sub> is transported through the blood:<br><br><strong>1. Dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood</strong>: Dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood is one mechanism by which CO<sub>2</sub> is carried to the lungs. However, this mechanism only accounts for around 3-5% of the total CO<sub>2</sub> carried by the blood.<br><br><strong>2. Bound to hemoglobin</strong>: In the peripheral tissues, abundant CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses into red blood cells (RBCs) and gets attached to the hemoglobin at N-terminus (a different binding site than oxygen). When the CO<sub>2</sub> binds to hemoglobin, it decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, thus causing oxygen to be released into the tissues. This phenomenon is termed the Bohr effect and is responsible for increased oxygen release into tissues with high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This transport mechanism also accounts for a small fraction (3-5%) of the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> carried in the blood.<br><br><strong>3. In the form of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></strong>: When CO<sub>2</sub> is abundant, it diffuses into RBCs. Within RBCs, CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O due to the enzyme <strong>carbonic anhydrase</strong>, which catalyzes this reaction and produces hydrogen bicarbonate (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is an unstable molecule that converts to H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.
