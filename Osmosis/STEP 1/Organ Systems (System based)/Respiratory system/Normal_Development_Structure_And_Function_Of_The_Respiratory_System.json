He states that he had not noticed it before. Vitals are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient&#8217;s left testicle is non-tender, but a firm and fixed mass is palpated. Transillumination is negative. An ultrasound of the left testicle demonstrates a homogenous mass with low echogenicity compared to the normal testicular tissue. Blood work reveals increased placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) with normal serum levels of AFP and beta-hCG. The primary care physician is concerned about metastasis. Which of the following would most likely be the first area of metastasis?",

The <strong>transillumination test</strong>, which is performed by shining a light behind the scrotum, confirms the mass being solid, as light is blocked by the mass. If a firm mass is identified, a scrotal ultrasound should be performed, as <strong>ultrasound</strong> is the first-line imaging in patients that present with a testicular abnormality. While a painless mass is the most common manifestation of a testicular tumor, approximately 1/3 of patients complain of a dull ache or heavy sensation in the lower abdomen, perianal area, or scrotum, and acute pain is the presenting symptom in 10% of patients.<br><br>On ultrasound, seminomas usually appear as a <strong>homogenous intratesticular mass&#160;</strong>of low echogenicity compared to the normal testicular tissue. Typically, when suspecting a testicular tumor, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be measured. These serum markers allow for further categorization of the testicular tumor to a particular type, and they are shown in the table below.<br><br>Based on the serum markers in this patient,<strong>&#160;increased PLAP</strong> with normal AFP and beta-hCG typically correlates with a <strong>seminoma</strong>. Testicular tumors most commonly metastasize via <strong>lymphatic drainage</strong>.

It is important to note that medications that share a <strong>common metabolism pathway</strong> may cause drug-drug interactions.<br><br>Typically, if a drug acts as a <strong>CYP inducer</strong>, then it causes concurrently administered drugs metabolized by the same CYP isozyme to be metabolized faster and excreted. As a result, plasma levels of a specific drug may not reach therapeutic levels if it is cleared too quickly by the body, leading to treatment failure. In contrast, if a drug acts as a <strong>CYP inhibitor</strong>, then it causes other drugs to accumulate to toxic levels, potentially leading to overdose and side effects.<br><br>In the case of this patient, she was on an oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and then started on an antiepileptic medication (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin), which are CYP-450 inducers. There will be <strong>increased metabolism</strong> of OCPs, <strong>decreased serum concentration</strong> to subtherapeutic levels, and increased chance of pregnancy. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Reduced serum estradiol levels &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ False-positive pregnancy result caused by anti-epileptic medication &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are not frequently known to cause false-positive pregnancy test results. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Elevated serum prolactin levels &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hyperprolactinemia can cause anovulation and abnormal uterine bleeding.
