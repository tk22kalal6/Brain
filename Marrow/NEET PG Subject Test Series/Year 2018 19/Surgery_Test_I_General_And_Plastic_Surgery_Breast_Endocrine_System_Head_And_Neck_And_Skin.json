      "solution": "<p><strong>Phlegmasia cerulea dolens</strong>(PCD) is <strong>extensive DVT of the leg veins associated with cyanosis</strong>. In this condition, the collateral veins are also thrombosed.</p>\n<p><strong>Phlegmasia</strong> is a term that has been used to describe<strong> </strong>extreme cases of lower extremity DVT, which may progress to <strong>critical limb</strong> <strong>ischemia </strong>and potentially limb loss. The underlying pathologic condition of phlegmasia dolens is <strong>acute extensive VTE</strong> occluding the venous outflow of an extremity. The <strong>iliofemoral segment</strong> is almost always involved and occluded in the lower extremities. In 20%-40% of cases, phlegmasia has been associated with malignancy. However, other risk factors for VTE include hypercoagulable disorders, venous insufficiency, surgery,  pregnancy, the use of oral contraceptives, and prolonged immobilization.</p>\n<p>In PCD, there is <strong>near-total occlusion of the major deep venous system</strong> and most of the <strong>microvascular collateral veins</strong> of the extremity, causing severe venous congestion. It is characterized by pain and pitting edema. The most pathognomonic feature is the presence of <strong>cyanosis</strong>. As cyanosis and worsening venous congestion progress, patients develop necrosis and <strong>venous gangrene</strong>.</p>\n<p>Supportive measures should be performed immediately and are considered first-line. The <strong>extremity should be elevated</strong> to an angle greater than 60 degrees above the level of the heart to prevent venous stasis and to increase venous return through remaining patent channels. Definitive management involves <strong>anticoagulation</strong>, <strong>catheter-directed thrombolysis</strong>, and <strong>thrombectomy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>In <strong>phlegmasia alba dolens</strong>, the thrombosis involves major deep venous channels of the extremity and <strong>spares the collateral</strong> veins. The venous drainage is decreased but still present; the lack of cyanosis differentiates this entity from phlegmesia cerulea dolens. <strong>Phlegmasia alba </strong>dolens also called as<strong> milk leg.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e03eb1f3813d4c3c8fde1767593adf9ax250x187.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
