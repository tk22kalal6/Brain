Thus, there is no increase in cell number but cell size increases. <strong>Maximum cell size</strong> is obtained towards the end of this phase.</li>\n<li><strong>Log </strong>or <strong>exponential </strong>phase<strong> </strong>(B) - The bacteria<strong> </strong>start <strong>dividing</strong> and their <strong>numbers increase</strong> exponentially with time. Cells are smaller and stain uniformly. The growth rate is constant. </li>\n<li><strong>Stationary </strong>phase<strong> </strong>(C) - There is depletion of nutrients and accumulation of toxic products. Thus, cell division reduces and a state of <strong>equilibrium </strong>is attained, where the number of new cells formed equals the number that die.
