Clinical features include <strong>arthralgia</strong> and arthritis, abdominal pain, <strong>diarrhea,</strong> and weight loss. <strong>Arthralgias</strong> and arthritis are present for many years <strong>before</strong> the appearance of <strong>GI symptoms</strong>. CNS involvement is common and presents as <strong>psychiatric</strong> <strong>manifestations</strong>, memory problems, or <strong>ophthalmoplegia</strong>. Dementia may occur in later stages. Cardiac involvement may be in the form of <strong>endocarditis</strong>, <strong>myocarditis,</strong> and <strong>pericarditis</strong>. <strong>Hyperpigmentation</strong> in sun-exposed areas may also be seen. Intermittent <strong>low-grade fever</strong> is present in most of the patients.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis of Whipple's disease is primarily established by <strong>endoscopic biopsy</strong> and histological evaluation. Infiltration of <strong>lamina propria</strong> with <strong>PAS-positive macrophages containing the bacilli</strong> is diagnostic. The remainder of the cases are diagnosed by <strong>PCR,</strong> which can be done on duodenal biopsies or fluids (such as <strong>CSF</strong> and synovial fluid) or tissues.</p>\n<p>The treatment regimen for Whipple's disease is <strong>ceftriaxone or meropenem</strong> for <strong>2 weeks</strong>, followed by <strong>trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 12 months</strong>.

Occupational exposures associated with silicosis include <strong>mining</strong>, <strong>stone cutting</strong>, <strong>sandblasting</strong>, <strong>glass</strong> and <strong>cement</strong> <strong>manufacturing</strong>, and quarrying of <strong>granite</strong>. The <strong>pathogenic form</strong> of silica is<strong> crystalline quartz</strong>.&nbsp;Inhaled silica crystals are phagocytosed by macrophages and cause the release of IL-1 and IL-18. This causes the <strong>recruitment</strong> <strong>of</strong> more inflammatory cells and <strong>fibroblasts</strong> to the site, leading to <strong>collagen deposition</strong>.</p>\n<p>Silicosis can present in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acute</strong> <strong>silicosis</strong> occurs due to <strong>exposure to high concentrations</strong> of silica in closed spaces<strong>.</strong> Patients have clinical manifestations <strong>within a few months to years</strong> of exposure.</li>\n<li><strong>Chronic</strong> <strong>silicosis</strong> occurs<strong>&nbsp;</strong>due to <strong>long-term exposure to silica</strong>, often 10 to 30 years</li>\n<li><strong>Progressive massive fibrosis</strong> can occur following both acute and chronic silicosis. The patients present with <strong>more severe cough</strong> and <strong>dyspnea</strong> than simple silicosis, and might develop <strong>respiratory failure </strong>and cor pulmonale.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since <strong>silicosis</strong> leads to macrophage dysfunction, it <strong>increases</strong> the <strong>risk of tuberculosis</strong> in patients. Silica also has immunoadjuvant properties, and might lead to <strong>autoimmune diseases</strong> such as rheumatoid arthritis. Silica exposure is also considered to be a <strong>risk factor for lung cancer</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Calcification of hilar lymph nodes</strong> producing a characteristic <strong>eggshell pattern</strong> is seen in many cases of silicosis. The <strong>fibrotic areas</strong> present in the lung parenchyma can be <strong>identified on </strong>the <strong>HRCT</strong> of the lung. <strong>Acute silicosis</strong> may show <strong>diffuse ground-glass opacities</strong> with thickening of the interlobular septae, which is termed as <strong>crazy pavement appearance</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Some common

When patients' chances of PE are high, the patient should be assessed for D-dimer levels. Normal levels of D-dimer rule out the possibility of PE. <strong>If </strong>the <strong>D-dimer</strong> levels are <strong>elevated,</strong> then the <strong>chances of pulmonary embolism </strong>are very <strong>high </strong>and the <strong>patient should undergo imaging</strong> to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>CT of the chest</strong> with <strong>intravenous contrast</strong> is the <strong>principal imaging test</strong> for the diagnosis of PE. It can provide exquisite detail, with &le;1 mm of resolution during a short breath-hold. It also helps to visualize the chambers of the heart. In patients who do not have a pulmonary embolism, it can also help in identifying alternative diagnoses like emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary mass, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Because of the invasive nature of pulmonary angiography (option B) and availability of chest CT scans, it is not commonly used in the diagnosis of PE. It is reserved for patients with technically unsatisfactory chest CTs and for those for whom an interventional procedure such as catheter-directed thrombolysis is planned.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lung scanning</strong> has become a <strong>second-line</strong> diagnostic test for PE, in patients who cannot tolerate intravenous contrast. Small particulate aggregates of albumin labeled with a gamma-emitting radionuclide are injected intravenously and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed. The perfusion scan defect indicates absent or decreased blood flow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>MR pulmonary angiography</strong> is a reliable test to identify deep vein thrombosis. It may detect large proximal PE, but is not reliable for smaller segmental and subsegmental PE.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most patients with PE have a normal echocardiogram (option D). Therefore, it is not a reliable test to detect PE.

Patients will have <strong>elevated 24-hour urinary cortisol levels</strong>; they have elevated levels of plasma cortisol, which are <strong>not suppressed by dexamethasone</strong>. If these are elevated, it confirms that the patient has elevated levels of cortisol.</p>\n<p>The next step is to evaluate if the elevated cortisol levels are due to <strong>elevated ACTH</strong> or are <strong>independent of ACTH levels</strong>. In this patient, the ACTH levels are elevated, which means that increased ACTH has caused increased production of cortisol. Increased ACTH can be due to a pituitary tumor that produces ACTH or ectopic ACTH production that is seen in tumors like bronchial or pancreatic carcinoids, medullary thyroid carcinoma, etc.</p>\n<p>The source of ACTH production can be identified using an MRI of the pituitary, a corticotropin-releasing hormone test, and a high-dose dexamethasone test. If the ACTH production is due to an adenoma in the pituitary, it responds to the administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and is <strong>suppressed by the administration of dexamethasone.</strong> In this patient, both of these <strong>tests are negative</strong>, which means that ACTH production is not from the pituitary but is due to <strong>ectopic production of ACTH. </strong>The patient has to be evaluated for underlying tumours. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7b1a8d7d4f454ac69827eaedef7700a5x1200x2435.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/67f4448b6b654c48b078f570f7512206x1280x2864.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Pituitary adenoma has elevated levels of cortisol and is normal to high ACTH levels.

The <strong>pain</strong> may occur spontaneously or <strong>after</strong> <strong>movements</strong> like <strong>chewing</strong>,<strong> </strong>speaking,<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>smiling.<strong> </strong>Certain <strong>trigger zones</strong> are <strong>present on the face</strong> which provoke these attacks.<strong> Tactile stimuli </strong>such as<strong> washing the face</strong> and brushing teeth may <strong>trigger</strong> the <strong>pain</strong>. The pain usually lasts for a <strong>few</strong> <strong>seconds</strong> <strong>to 1-2 minutes</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>large myelinated fibers</strong> of the trigeminal nerve carry<strong> tactile stimuli</strong> from the face but do not carry the pain sensation.
