Usual locations include the bone itself, adjacent soft tissue, and subperiosteal spaces.</p>\n<p><strong>X-rays</strong> are<strong> not useful</strong> in early acute osteomyelitis because of minimal findings. Exposure to ionizing radiation and limited soft-tissue contrast is the main disadvantage of<strong> CT</strong> that makes it <strong>less useful</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Osteomyelitis</strong> is an acute or chronic inflammatory process involving the bone and its structures secondary to infection with pyogenic organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria. The bone becomes susceptible to disease due to large inoculation of microorganisms, from trauma, ischemia, or the presence of foreign bodies because bone sites to which microorganisms can bind are exposed.</p>\n<p>The bone can get infected by a <strong>hematogenous route</strong> through bacteremia seeding of a bone infection from a distant source of infection,&nbsp;contiguous spread from surrounding tissue and joints, or direct inoculation of bone from trauma or surgery. The <strong>most&nbsp;common</strong> pathogen of acute and chronic hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults and children is <em><strong>Staphylococcus aureus</strong>.&nbsp;</em>Other common pathogens are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coagulase-negative <em>staphylococcus</em></li>\n<li>Beta-hemolytic <em>streptococcus </em></li>\n<li><em>Enterococci </em></li>\n<li>Aerobic gram-negative bacilli (including<em> pseudomonas</em> species,&nbsp;<em>Enterobacter</em> species, <em>Escherichia</em> coli)</li>\n<li>Anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (such as <em>peptostreptococcus</em>, <em>Clostridium</em> species, <em>Bacteroides</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Osteomyelitis can be <strong>classified</strong> as <strong>acute or chronic</strong> based on histopathological findings rather than the duration of illness. Infection occurring before the development of sequestra is referred to as acute osteomyelitis. It usually takes place within two weeks of disease onset. The infection is considered chronic following the development of necrotic bone and the formation of sequestra. Acute infections generally present with pain, swelling, and redness of the affected area associated with systemic illness while&nbsp;discharging sinuses may be present&nbsp;in chronic infections.</p>\n<p><strong>Surgical debridement</strong> of all diseased bone is required as antibiotics penetrate poorly into infected fluid collections such as abscesses and injured or necrotic bone. Thus, the removal of necrotic tissue and bone is usually indicated where feasible. The cornerstone of treatment for osteomyelitis is <strong>prolonged antibiotic therapy</strong>.</p>",

In newborns marked cyanosis, massive cardiomegaly and holosystolic murmurs are seen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the chest radiograph, Ebstein&rsquo;s anomaly leads to a grossly enlarged cardiac contour and a prominent curved right atrial border, appearing as a<strong>&nbsp;box-shaped enlargement</strong> of the heart. In newborns with severe disease, the pulmonary fields may be totally obscured.&nbsp;Echocardiography is diagnostic. It provides the degree of tricuspid valve displacement, dilatation of the right atrium, and any right ventricular obstruction if present.</p>\n<p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPV) presents with severe cyanosis and respiratory distress. The radiograph shows a <strong>snowman appearance</strong>&nbsp;or<strong>&nbsp;figure of 8</strong>&nbsp;configurations of heart.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Transposition of great arteries</strong> (TGA) can present from birth to infancy with cyanosis, decreased exercise tolerance, and poor physical development. Radiography shows the <strong>egg-on-string</strong> appearance of the heart.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Tricuspid atresia</strong> also presents also with cyanosis at birth and holosystolic murmur along the left border of the sternum. Cyanosis with left axis deviation on ECG is suggestive of tricuspid atresia. 2D Echo shows a fibromuscular membrane in place of the tricuspid valve, small right ventricle, an enlarged left ventricle, and a VSD.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Important radiological signs in cardiology</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Sign</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Condition</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Flask</strong> shaped/ Pear shaped/ <strong>Leather bottle </strong>shaped/ <strong>Money-bag</strong> shaped heart</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Pericardial effusion</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Boot shaped heart/ <strong>Coeur-en-sabot</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Fallot’s tetralogy</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Gooseneck sign</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Endocardial cushion defects</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Box-shaped heart</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Ebstein's anomaly</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Jug handle appearance</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Primary pulmonary artery hypertension</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>“3” like appearance of the aorta</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Coarctation of aorta</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Egg-on-string appearance</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Transposition of great vessels</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Egg in cup appearance, Pericardial calcification</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Constrictive pericarditis</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Snowman’s heart, Cottage loaf appearance, Figure of Eight appearance</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Scimitar</strong> sign</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Calcification in the heart wall</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Carcinoid syndrome</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Calcification of ascending aorta</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Atherosclerosis, Syphilis</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Hilar dance on fluoroscopy</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Atrial septal defect</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Batwing appearance</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Pulmonary edema</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Pruned tree appearance of the pulmonary vasculature</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Pulmonary artery hypertension</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Sitting duck sign of heart</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Persistent Truncus arteriosus</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<div> </div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Radiological findings in some congenital heart defects</h3><p><strong>Boot shaped heart - Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b8d455f894f24e8e9c147e7c3a178428x510x558.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Egg on string appearance - Transposition of Great Arteries (TGA)</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ad3fe6b6422548c8856299317c3e47c5x510x522.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Snowman's heart appearance or figure of 8 appearance</strong> -&nbsp;<strong>Supracardiac TAPVC</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c4d273d1af7445fdad02e659555c9e69x510x494.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Box Shaped Heart - Ebstein's Anomaly</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d07d5041004645849e8cce1dd37bd092x510x640.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification of congenital heart disease</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Acyanotic</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Cyanotic </strong>(5TE&sup2;VP)<strong><br /></strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Left to right shunts</strong>:</div>\n<p>Ventricular septal defect (VSD)</p>\n<p>Atrial septal defect (ASD)</p>\n<p>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)</p>\n<p><strong>Obstructive lesions</strong>:</p>\n<p>Coarctation of aorta</p>\n<p>Infundibular stenosis</p>\n<p>Pulmonary valve stenosis</p>\n<p>Congenital mitral &amp;
