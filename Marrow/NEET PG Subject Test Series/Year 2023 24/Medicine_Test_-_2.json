      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario of a <strong>known hypertensive patient</strong> developing <strong>weakness</strong> of the right side of the body with <strong>headache</strong> and <strong>vomiting</strong>, along with the given NCCT image showing a <strong>hyperdense collection</strong> is suggestive of<strong> hemorrhagic stroke</strong> <strong>(intracerebral hemorrhage)</strong>. Out of the given options, <strong>intravenous hypertonic saline</strong> is used in the management of such cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Hypertensive ICH</strong> is a result of <strong>spontaneous rupture of</strong> a penetrating <strong>artery</strong>. The <strong>most common sites</strong> involved are <strong>basal ganglia (specially putamen)</strong>, thalamus, cerebellum and pons. Patients present with <strong>abrupt onset</strong> of <strong>focal neurological deficit</strong>. However, the <strong>deficit worsens over</strong> next <strong>30-90 minutes</strong>. This <strong>progression</strong> is something that <strong>differentiates ICH from ischemic stroke</strong>, because ischemic stroke is maximal at the onset itself.</p>\n<p>Since the internal capsule lies adjacent to the basal ganglia, it is also damaged and <strong>contralateral hemiparesis</strong> is seen. Patients may also have <strong>signs of increased ICP</strong> such as <strong>headache</strong> and <strong>vomiting</strong>. The <strong>level of consciousness</strong> may <strong>progressively diminish</strong> and the patient may land up in a coma.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>mainstay</strong> <strong>of</strong> the <strong>management</strong> of ICH is to <strong>maintain the ICP</strong> and <strong>reduce blood pressure</strong>. The <strong>target</strong> <strong>systolic blood pressure is &lt;140 mmHg</strong>, and the <strong>preferred drug for blood pressure reduction</strong> if SBP is &gt;160 mmHg is <strong>IV nicardipine</strong>. If there are signs of ICP elevation, <strong>osmotic therapy</strong> with <strong>intravenous</strong> <strong>mannitol</strong> or <strong>hypertonic saline</strong> is done. If the ICH has led to obstructive hydrocephalus, CSF drainage using an external drain can be done. Surgical evacuation of the hematoma has been found to the beneficial only in cerebellar hemorrhage.</p>\n<p>There is <strong>no role of glucocorticoid administration</strong> (option B) in the management because they haven't been shown to improve outcome, and increase the risk of hyperglycemia and infections.</p>\n<p>Thrombolysis with alteplase (option D) and mechanical thrombectomy (option C) are treatment modalities for ischemic stroke.&nbsp;</p>",

Although there is a risk of potential thromboembolism<strong> </strong>if the patient has not been put on anticoagulation before, the need for<strong> </strong>rate control outweighs this risk. In these patients, control of the heart rate is achieved using <strong>IV β-blockers </strong>or <strong>calcium channel blockers</strong> (like verapamil or diltiazem).

Tissue <strong>biopsy</strong> reveals&nbsp;<strong>granulomas</strong>&nbsp;with geographic patterns of central necrosis and accompanying vasculitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Scleroderma or systemic sclerosis (diffuse cutaneous) </strong>is strongly associated with the&nbsp;<strong>anti-Scl 70</strong> antibodies. It is an autoimmune rheumatic disease with female predominance. Cutaneous features include <strong>Raynaud's phenomenon</strong>, ulcerations that heal with<strong>&nbsp;</strong>pitted scars,&nbsp;<strong>sclerodactyly</strong>, and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>loss of sweat glands. Facial features include&nbsp;<strong>mask-like facies&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>diffuse hyperpigmentation.&nbsp;</strong>Systemic features include&nbsp;<strong>dysphagia</strong>, <strong>pulmonary fibrosis</strong>, <strong>heart failure</strong>, uremia, and carpal tunnel syndrome.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Sjogren&rsquo;s syndrome</strong> is associated with <strong>anti-Ro/SSA</strong> and <strong>anti-La/SSB</strong> antibodies. It is an autoimmune disease with<strong> lymphocytic infiltration</strong> of <strong>exocrine glands</strong> and hyperactive B-lymphocytes. The disease commonly involves the<strong> lacrimal </strong>and<strong> salivary glands.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>This results in the characteristic presentation of&nbsp;<strong>sicca syndrome</strong> (decreased tears and saliva). Parotid gland enlargement is present in half of the patients.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Autoantibodies Seen in Autoimmune Diseases</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Autoantibody</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Associated disease</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Antinuclear (ANA)</td>\n<td>\n<p>SLE (non-specific)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anticardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant</td>\n<td>SLE, APLA syndrome</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anti-ds DNA, anti-Smith</td>\n<td>SLE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anti-histone</td>\n<td>Drug-induced Lupus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anti-U1 RNP</td>\n<td>Mixed connective tissue disease</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP</td>\n<td>Rheumatoid arthritis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anti-Ro/SSA, Anti-La/SSB</td>\n<td>Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anti-Scl-70 (anti-DNA topoisomerase)</td>\n<td>Diffuse scleroderma</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anticentromere</td>\n<td>CREST syndrome</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anti-SRP,&nbsp;Anti-Mi-2, Anti-Jo-1</td>\n<td>Polymyositis, Dermatomyositis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>p-ANCA/MPO</td>\n<td>Churg Strauss syndrome</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>c-ANCA</td>\n<td>Wegener (Granulomatosis with polyangiitis)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: ANCA Antibodies</h3><p>The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (<strong>ANCA</strong>) are the antibodies that are targeted against the specific proteins present in <strong>neutrophils</strong> and <strong>monocytes.</strong> They can be further classified as:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cytoplasmic ANCA (cANCA)</p>\n</td>\n<td>Perinuclear ANCA (pANCA)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Directed against</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Proteinase 3 (PR3)</p>\n</td>\n<td>Myeloperoxidase (MPO)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Predominantly positive in</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Microscopic polyangiitis</p>\n<p>Churg&ndash;Strauss syndrome&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Crescentic glomerulonephritis</p>\n<p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Staining pattern</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Granular cytoplasmic staining</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Perinuclear or nuclear staining</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Important Vasculitis with Features</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Vasculitis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Predominant vessel involved</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Inflammatory cells</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Other features</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Temporal arteritis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(Large vessel vasculitis)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Temporal, vertebral and ophthalmic arteries, aorta</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lymphocytes, and macrophages</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&gt;40 years old, polymyalgia rheumatica, granulomas, giant cells</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Takayasu Arteritis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(Large vessel vasculitis)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>(Medium-sized and large arteries) Aortic arch, great vessels, pulmonary artery, coronary and renal arteries</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, granulomas, giant cells</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Pulseless disease</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Polyarteritis Nodosa</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Small or medium-sized muscular arteries, typically involving renal and visceral vessels</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells,</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Spares pulmonary vessels, 30% of patients with&nbsp; chronic hepatitis B</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Microscopic polyangiitis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Capillaries, small arterioles, venules</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells,</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Necrotizing glomerulonephritism (90% of patients) and pulmonary capillaritis leukocytoclastic vasculitis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Churg-Strauss&nbsp;</strong><strong>Syndrome</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Medium and small arteries</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Eosinophils (required), lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, lung infiltrates, peripheral hypereosinophilia, and extravascular necrotizing granulomata.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
