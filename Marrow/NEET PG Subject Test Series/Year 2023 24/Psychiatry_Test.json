      "solution": "<p class=\"p1\">The experiment shown in the image is that of <strong>classical conditioning </strong>by&nbsp;<strong>Ivan Pavlov</strong>. The <strong>whistle</strong> plays the role of a <strong>conditional stimulus.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Classical conditioning is the theory of learning where neutral stimuli are associated with psychologically significant events.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Events in the Pavlov experiment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\">Food - <strong>Unconditional stimulus (Option B)</strong> as it elicits salivation before the experiment commences</li>\n<li>Response to food - Salivation as a result of the unconditional stimulus is the <strong>unconditional response (Option A)</strong> as it is elicited before the commencement of the experiment.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">Bell/Whistle - <strong>Conditional stimulus</strong> as it elicits salivation conditional to the pairing of the bell and food</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">Response to the bell/whistle - This is known as the <strong>conditional response (Option C)&nbsp;</strong>as the dog has been conditioned to react to the conditional stimulus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">This model usually deals with<strong>&nbsp;involuntary responses</strong>.

The characteristics of children with ADHD, in order of frequency, are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hyperactivity</li>\n<li>Attention deficit (short attention span, distractibility)</li>\n<li>Impulsivity (action before thought, abrupt shifts in activity, lack of organization)</li>\n<li>Memory and thinking deficits</li>\n<li>Specific learning disabilities</li>\n<li>Speech and hearing deficits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under <strong>DSM-5</strong> criteria, for diagnosis of ADHD, it is necessary for symptoms to be present<strong> prior to age 12</strong>, persist for at least 6 months, have a negative impact on social, academic, or occupational activities, and be present in two or more settings.</p>\n<p>The course of ADHD is variable. The majority of the cases persist into adult life. The hyperactivity may disappear in some cases, but the decreased attention span and impulse-control problems usually persist.

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario of a 5-year-old boy with repetitive non-verbal gestures for communication, impaired peer relationships, and restricted interest in activities with a normal IQ and language skills points towards a diagnosis of <strong>Asperger syndrome.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Asperger syndrome </strong>is an <strong>autistic spectrum disorder</strong> characterised by a wide range of impairments in social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviours. The aetiology is complex, with genetic and potentially environmental and perinatal contributions. It predominantly affects<strong> boys</strong> after <strong>3 years</strong> of age. It is usually <strong>not</strong> associated with <strong>mental retardation,</strong> and a <strong>normal IQ</strong>, along with competencies in social skills, is considered a <strong>good prognostic</strong> factor.</p>\n<p>Asperger syndrome is characterised by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impairment</strong> in <strong>social interaction</strong> and development:\n<ul>\n<li>markedly <strong>abnormal nonverbal communicative gestures</strong></li>\n<li>failure to develop peer relationships at the expected level</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Restricted interests</strong> and patterns of behaviour</li>\n<li><strong>No significant delay</strong> in <strong>language</strong>, clinically significant <strong>cognitive</strong> delay, or adaptive impairment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment of Asperger's syndrome involves promoting social communication and peer relationships. Very often, these children are highly verbal and have excellent academic achievement. To help these individuals in social and work settings, <strong>self-sufficiency</strong> and <strong>problem-solving techniques</strong> can be utilised.</p>\n<p>As per the current updates (DSM-5), <strong>autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</strong> includes several conditions that are characterized by early onset of severe delay in the development of social and communicative skills and also unusual responses to the environment.</p>\n<p>The <strong>diagnostic criteria</strong> for autism spectrum disorder are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Persistent deficits</strong> in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts</li>\n<li><strong>Restricted, repetitive patterns</strong> of behaviour, interests, or activities</li>\n<li>Symptoms must be present in the <strong>early developmental period</strong></li>\n<li>Symptoms cause clinically <strong>significant impairment</strong> in social, occupational, or other important areas of social functioning</li>\n<li>These disturbances are <strong>not</strong> better explained by <strong>intellectual disability</strong> or <strong>global developmental delay.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Rett’s syndrome</strong> is seen <strong>exclusively</strong> in <strong>girls</strong>, where <strong>deterioration</strong> of developmental <strong>milestones</strong>, <strong>head circumference</strong>, and overall growth occurs after <strong>5 months</strong> of age. The absence of such a history of deterioration from previous normal development, along with the absence of other characteristic features of Rett's syndrome like- <strong>stereotypic motions</strong> (eg-hand wringing), poor coordination, <strong>ataxia</strong>, <strong>complete loss</strong> of <strong>verbal</strong> abilities, <strong>respiratory difficulties</strong>, and <strong>seizures </strong>makes a diagnosis of Rett syndrome unlikely.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Options C &amp; D:<strong> Heller syndrome/Childhood disintegrative disorder,</strong> occurring between the ages of <strong>3–5 years, </strong>is characterized by a significant developmental regression after a period of <strong>normal development </strong>for<strong> at least two years</strong>. This results in a <strong>deterioration</strong> of<strong> behavioural</strong> and<strong> adaptive functioning,</strong> including self-help skills, with <strong>loss of language </strong>and<strong> social skills, </strong>along with <strong>stereotyped movements</strong> and <strong>compulsive</strong> behaviour.

The symptoms are persistent for&nbsp;<strong>over 6 months.&nbsp;</strong>It equally affects men and women and is commonly seen in the&nbsp;<strong>third decade</strong>&nbsp;of life.

      "solution": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Sublimation</strong><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>is a <strong>mature </strong>defense mechanism, unlike introjection, regression, and somatization, which are immature defense mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Sublimation</strong> is a <strong>mature</strong> defense mechanism. It means to gratify an impulse by changing the end goal from a <strong>socially objectionable</strong> one to a <strong>socially valued one</strong>. Sublimation of <strong>aggressive impulses</strong> generally takes place through <strong>games </strong>or<strong> sports</strong>. Sublimation allows instincts to be channelled and not dammed up or diverted. Hence, in sublimation, feelings are acknowledged, modified, and directed toward a socially valued/acceptable goal so that modest instinctual satisfaction is achieved.</p>\n<p><strong>Mature defense mechanisms </strong>are healthy and adaptive throughout the life cycle. They are socially adaptive and useful in the integration of personal needs and motives, social demands, and interpersonal relations. They can underlie seemingly admirable and virtuous patterns of behaviour.</p>\n<p>Other mature defense mechanisms are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anticipation</li>\n<li>Humor</li>\n<li>Altruism</li>\n<li>Asceticism</li>\n<li>Suppression</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Immature</strong> <strong>defense mechanisms</strong> are usually triggered due to anxieties related to intimacy or its loss. These mechanisms are fairly common in <strong>preadolescent</strong> years and <strong>adult</strong> character disorders. Although they are regarded as <strong>socially awkward</strong> and <strong>undesirable</strong>, improvement in interpersonal relationships and personal maturity can alleviate it. Some of the immature defense mechanisms are:</p>\n<p>Option B. <strong>Introjection </strong>involves taking up features from the <strong>external world</strong> and <strong>making</strong> them a <strong>part of oneself</strong>. Introjection of a <strong>loved object</strong> involves internalizing the characteristics of the object to ensure closeness and constant presence of the object in order to reduce the anxiety associated with separation from or loss of the object. Similarly, the introjection of a <strong>feared object</strong> involves internalizing the aggressive characteristics of the object and using it defensively to have the aggression under their control. Introjection can also take place from a <strong>sense of guilt</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C. <strong>Regression</strong> involves a return to a previous stage of development or functioning to avoid the anxieties or hostilities involved in later stages. This reflects a basic tendency to achieve instinctual gratification or to escape instinctual tension by returning to earlier modes and levels of gratification when later and more differentiated modes fail or involve intolerable conflict.</p>\n<p>Option D. In <strong>somatization,</strong> psychic derivatives are converted into bodily symptoms and tend to react to somatic symptoms rather than psychic ones.</p>\n<p>Other immature defenses include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acting out</li>\n<li>Blocking</li>\n<li>Hypochondriasis</li>\n<li>Passive–aggressive behaviour</li>\n<li>Projection (non-psychotic)</li>\n<li>Schizoid

According to <strong>DSM-5</strong>, it is <strong>classified</strong> as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mild</strong> if ejaculation occurs <strong>within</strong> approximately <strong>30 sec&shy;onds </strong>to <strong>1 minute</strong> of vaginal penetration</li>\n<li><strong>Moderate</strong> if ejaculation occurs<strong> within</strong> approximately <strong>15 to 30 seconds</strong> of vaginal pen&shy;etration</li>\n<li><strong>Severe</strong> if ejaculation occurs <strong>at the start</strong> of sexual activity <strong>or within </strong>approximately <strong>15 seconds</strong> of vaginal penetra&shy;tion.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Sexual response</strong> is a true <strong>psycho-physiological experience</strong>. Normally, men and women experience a sequence of physiological responses to sexual stimulation. The <strong>phases</strong> of the normal sexual response cycle are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Desire phase</strong> -<strong>&nbsp;</strong>consists of sex fantasies and the desire to have sex</li>\n<li><strong>Excitement/Arousal phase </strong>-<strong>&nbsp;</strong>heightened excitement before orgasm&nbsp;<strong>(longest phase)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Orgasmic phase </strong>-&nbsp;a&nbsp;subjective perception of a peak physical reaction and release occurs, along with a feeling of well-being&nbsp;<strong>(shortest phase)</strong>. It is marked by ejaculation.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolution phase -&nbsp;</strong>return to the baseline.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"ng-scope\">\n<div class=\"ng-scope\">\n<p><strong>Following orgasm</strong>,<strong> men </strong>experience a <strong>refractory period</strong> during which they cannot be restimulated to further arousal. <strong>Women</strong> do <strong>not have</strong> a <strong>refractory period</strong> and can experience multiple, successive orgasms.</p>\n<p><strong>Disorders of</strong> the <strong>orgasm phase also include</strong> other conditions like <strong>female orgasmic disorder</strong> and <strong>delayed ejaculation</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Desire</strong> phase disorder includes <strong>male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.</strong> It is characterized by a deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and a desire for sexual activity. This should be present for <strong>at least 6 months.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Arousal</strong>&nbsp;disorders include <strong>female sexual arousal disorder</strong> and <strong>male erectile disorder</strong>. Women with sexual arousal disorder are unable to feel sexual interest or arousal. Male erectile disorder refers to difficulty obtaining and/or maintaining an erection during sexual activity. There may or may not be decreased erectile rigidity.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The<strong> resolution phase</strong>&nbsp;lasts for 10-15 minutes. If no orgasm is achieved, it can last for 1/2 -1 day. It is marked by full detumescence in 5-30 minutes. <strong>Detumescence</strong> is the release of vascular activity and muscle tone after orgasm.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Sexual disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Phase</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Characteristics</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Disorder</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Treatment</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Desire</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Focuses on the patient's drives, motivation, and desires</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Hypoactive sexual desire</strong>: Patients have a decrease or absence of sexual fantasies, desires, etc</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span><strong>Sexual aversion</strong>: A complete aversion to all sexual contact</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Address issues like feelings of guilt, poor self-esteem, homosexual impulses, etc</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span>Couples therapy may be indicated if due to marital conflict</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Arousal</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Consists of a sense of sexual pleasure with accompanying physiologic changes</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Female sexual arousal disorder:</strong> Persistent failure to achieve or maintain sufficient sexual interest or arousal&nbsp;during the sexual act</span></div>\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><span><strong>Impotence:</strong> Persistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain an adequate erection until completion of the sexual act</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Address issues like guilt, anxiety, and fear</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span>Check for use of medications that cause vaginal dryness, like antihistamines or anticholinergics</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span>Relaxation techniques.</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span>Determine if organic or psychological.</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><span>Consider plethysmography or postage stamp test</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Orgasm</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Physiologic state in which sexual tension is released and contractions are produced in various organs</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Female orgasmic disorder and delayed ejaculation:</strong> Recurrent or persistent inability to achieve orgasm either through masturbation or sexual intercourse</span></div>\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><span><strong>Premature ejaculation:</strong> Ejaculation before the man wishes to do so, before penetration or just after penetration</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Address issues of guilt, fear of impregnation, etc</span></p>\n<p><span>Use vibrators, education, and fantasy</span></p>\n<p><span>Behavioral techniques such as squeeze and stop-and-go</span></p>\n<p><span>Address issues of anxiety about the sexual act</span></p>\n<p><span>SSRIs to delay ejaculation</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Pain</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Subjective sense of pain associated with the sexual act.

      "solution": "<p>\"Deficits are more severe for information that was most recently learned\" -&nbsp;is known as <strong>Ribot's law.&nbsp;</strong>This applies best to<strong> retrograde amnesia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Ribot's Law states that \"Deficits are more severe for information that was most recently learned,\" i.e.,&nbsp; during incidents of retrograde amnesia, recent memories are more likely to be lost than remote memories. Ex:- If an incident causing retrograde amnesia occurs at 30 years of age, the memories acquired at 28 years of age may be more severely affected than those memories acquired at 20 years of age or earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>Dissociative amnesia</strong>&nbsp;is characterized by extensive and severe amnesia with an&nbsp;<strong>inability&nbsp;</strong>to<strong>&nbsp;recall</strong>&nbsp;important<strong>&nbsp;autobiographical information</strong>. The amnesia is&nbsp;<strong>predominantly retrograde</strong>&nbsp;with minimal anterograde amnesia. It usually follows severe emotional trauma, interpersonal conflicts, and other&nbsp;<strong>stressful events</strong>, such as sexual abuse, loss of a loved one, loss of livelihood, etcetera. Clinically, the presentation is quite dramatic with significant impairment in social, personal, and occupational functioning. In order for a diagnosis of dissociative amnesia to be made, it is imperative to rule out substance use, and other neurological and psychological conditions that may lead to a presentation similar to dissociative amnesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is further categorized into the following types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selective amnesia: Ability to remember some, but not all of the events occurring during a circumscribed period of time.</li>\n<li>Localized amnesia:&nbsp;Inability to recall all events in a circumscribed period of time.</li>\n<li>Generalized amnesia:&nbsp;Failure to recall one&rsquo;s entire life.</li>\n<li>Continuous amnesia:&nbsp;Failure to recall successive events as they occur.</li>\n<li>Systematized amnesia:&nbsp;Amnesia for certain categories of memory, such as all memories relating to one&rsquo;s family or to a particular person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dissociative fugue</strong>&nbsp;is characterized by a sudden, unintended, and&nbsp;<strong>unexpected travel</strong>&nbsp;to a place away from home, or workplace, or another place involved in one's daily repertoire. It is usually brief, lasting few hours to days, and is generally reversible. It is commonly associated with dissociative amnesia. In addition to amnesia, these patients may also experience confusion, trance-like behaviors, depersonalization, derealization, and conversion symptoms. It may recur in some patients.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that dissociative fugue was deleted as a major diagnostic category in DSM-5. It is instead declared as a subtype or specifier of disso&shy;ciative amnesia.</p>\n<p>Treatment of dissociative amnesia and dissociative fugue is mainly with psychotherapy.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 475\">&nbsp;</div>",
