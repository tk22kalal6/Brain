The pathogenesis of colon cancer can be explained by three distinct pathways of genomic instability:<br><br>* Chromosomal instability/APC-β-catenin pathway/Classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence<br><br>* Microsatellite instability pathway (MSI)<br><br>* CpG island methylator phenotype pathway.<br><br>Chromosomal instability/APC-β-catenin pathway/classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence is the most common pathway, accounting for 80% of sporadic cancers. The \"first-hit\" in this pathway is the inherited or acquired mutation of the cancer suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q21. <br><br> <br><br>Both copies of the APC gene must be inactivated. The \"second hit\" is due to methylation abnormalities and inactivation of the normal β-catenin. The loss of the second APC allele follows the \"second hit.\"<br><br> <br><br>Mutations of KRAS on chromosome 12p12, TP53 on chromosome 17p13, and LOH at chromosome 18q21 are also involved in further steps of the classic adenoma-carcinoma sequence.<br><br> <br><br>Microsatellite instability pathway (MSI) occurs in patients with DNA mismatch repair deficiency, leading to the accumulation of mutations in microsatellite repeats. The main pathogenic mechanisms are mutations of type II TGF-β receptor leading to uncontrolled cell growth, and loss of pro-apoptotic BAX, which may enhance the survival of genetically abnormal clones.<br><br> <br><br>CpG island hypermethylation phenotype (CIMP) - In these tumours, the MLH1 promoter region is typically hypermethylated, thus reducing MLH1 expression and repair function. Activating mutations in the oncogene BRAF are common in these cancers.<br><br> <br><br>KRAS and TP53 are not typically mutated.

It occurs in two distinct geometric forms, serpentine and amphibole. It is characterized by diffuse parenchymal interstitial fibrosis. It usually begins in the lower lobes of the lungs and may present with dyspnea and cough, usually after 20-30 years of exposure. <br><br>Pleural plaques of dense collagen that may be calcified are the most common manifestation of asbestos exposure.

In most cases, the only clinical sign is hepatomegaly.

These antibodies cause damage to the postsynaptic muscle membrane and increased endocytosis of the AChR. This autoimmune response against the AChR is mediated by the thymus.<br><br>The myoid (muscle-like) cells present in the thymus express AChRs on their surface and are postulated to provide the autoantigen that triggers this autoimmune reaction. There is some thymic abnormality in most patients with MG.<br><br>Thymic hyperplasia is seen in 65% of the patients, and thymomas are seen in 10% of the patients. Thymoma is seen as an enlargement of the thymus in the anterior mediastinum on CT chest.<br><br>MG usually occurs in females in their 20s and 30s.  Patients usually present with weakness and fatiguability of the muscles, which increase on repeated use or late in the day and improve on rest.<br><br>The cranial muscles, particularly the eyelids and extraocular muscles, are involved early in the course of MG.

Indications for thymectomy in a patient diagnosed with MG include: <br><br>* Presence of thymoma<br><br>* Generalized MG with anti-AChR antibodies, even if no thymoma is seen on CT chest<br><br>Following thymectomy, immunosuppressive drugs are started based on the clinical status of the patient. <br><br>Other options: <br><br>Lambert-Eaton Syndrome is a neuromuscular junction disorder associated with the reduced acetylcholine (Ach) release from the presynaptic nerve terminals, despite normal ACh vesicle numbers, ACh presynaptic concentration, and postsynaptic ACh receptors. It presents with an incremental response on repeated nerve stimulation test.

The commonly mutated genes include:<br><br>* ATP-binding cassette protein member 3 (ABCA3): It is the most common genetic mutation in surfactant dysfunction disorders.

It is associated with rapidly progressive respiratory failure followed by death.<br><br>* SFTPC gene: It is the second most commonly mutated, which normally encodes for surfactant protein C. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant mode.<br><br>* SFTPB gene: It is the third most commonly mutated gene, which normally encodes for surfactant protein B.  It is inherited in an autosomal recessive mode. The infant is full-term and develops progressive respiratory distress shortly after birth.
