However, the rate constants are not necessarily equal (Option B).<br><br>* Calculation of Keq: The numerical value of Keq can be determined either from the concentrations of substrates and products at equilibrium or from the ratio of the reaction rate constants.<br><br>* Dynamic state: Equilibrium is not static. While there's no net change in the concentrations of substrates or products, individual molecules are constantly interconverting. This dynamic nature can be demonstrated by adding a trace of a radioisotopic product to an equilibrium system, which will then show the appearance of radiolabelled substrate.<br><br>* If Keq is more than 1, the forward reaction is favoured. In such instances, the reaction is spontaneous and exothermic.<br><br>* The concentration of the enzyme does not affect the Keq (Option D). The concentration of the enzyme certainly increases the rate of reaction, but not the Keq or the ultimate state. Catalysts increase the rate of reaction but do not alter the equilibrium.",
