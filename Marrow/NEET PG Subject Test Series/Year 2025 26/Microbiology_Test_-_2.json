Legionnaire’s disease is associated with hyponatremia in patients. <br><br>Legionella pneumophila is a fastidious, aerobic, gram-negative coccobacillus (Option A). It can be grown on a buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar with L-cysteine and antibiotic supplements.<br><br>Infection is mostly spread by inhalation of the bacteria from aerosols produced by contaminated air conditioners, humidifiers, nebulizers, etc. Human-to-human transmission does not occur (Option C). It may present as a severe, rapidly progressive disease with high fever, chills, hypoxia, diarrhea, and delirium. On chest x-ray, patchy, often multilobar consolidation is seen. Pleural effusion may also occur. Hyponatremia is a feature typical of this infection, leading to confusion. It is usually severe in immunocompromised patients.<br><br>Diagnosis is by the identification of Legionella antigens in urine by latex agglutination or Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Direct fluorescent antibody test and culture on BCYE media can be used. Treatment is by newer macrolides, ciprofloxacin, or tetracycline. Aminoglycoside and beta-lactam antibiotics are ineffective (Option D). <br><br>The image below shows the growth of Legionella on BYCE medium.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f29546376a864982bd1984b2445a3b90x614x544.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM0001: Organisms and selective Culture Media<br><br>Appropriate culture media for various bacteria:<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Organism</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Medium for culture</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Staph aureus</td>\n<td>Mannitol salt agar<br/>ludlam’s medium<br/>salt milk agar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Strep.

The rapid progression of symptoms makes Prion disease, caused by the accumulation of misfolded protein, the likely cause of this condition. The source of the prion infection could have been the surgical equipment that was not adequately sterilized. <br><br>The proteins that make up the prions (PrP) are present even normally in the cells. This normal form, PrPc, is in a predominantly α-helical configuration and is sensitive to proteases. However, the prions (infectious form) are in an abnormal β-pleated configuration and are called PrPSc.<br><br>This pathological form is not degradable by proteases and converts the normal form- PrPc to the abnormal form- PrPSc. This abnormal protein gets deposited as plaques, and degeneration of surrounding neuronal and glial tissue occurs, characterized by intracellular vacuoles, leading to a characteristic spongiform encephalopathy. There is no associated inflammatory response to these agents. <br><br>Four types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have been described:<br><br>* Sporadic (sCJD): Most common;<br><br>* Variant (vCJD): Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), Kuru;<br><br>* Familial (fCJD): These individuals carry a PrPc mutation and include Gerstmann-Sträussler- Scheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia;<br><br>* Iatrogenic (iCJD): Maybe seen occurring after corneal transplantation, liver transplantation, use of contaminated neurosurgical instruments, use of cadaver-derived hormones, or stereotactic depth electrodes. <br><br>Clinically, CJD presents with predominantly CNS manifestations with rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus (startle myoclonus is common), ataxia, akinetic mutism, visual disturbances, and pyramidal/extrapyramidal dysfunction. Insomnia, apathy, and other behavioral abnormalities may be seen. <br><br>CSF is predominantly normal but may show a positive assay for 14-3-3 protein. EEG may show periodic triphasic or multiphasic sharp-wave complexes seen as spikes or spike-wave patterns. MRI on FLAIR sequencing and diffusion-weighted imaging will show increased intensity in the basal ganglia region and a characteristic 'cortical ribboning', in sporadic CJD. Diagnosis of CJD can be established on brain biopsy either by measuring PrPSc or by demonstrating the characteristic neuropathological features of spongiform encephalopathy.<br><br>Management is mainly supportive as the disease is usually fatal within a year of the onset of symptoms. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Chronic bacterial meningitis causes features of raised ICP and is associated with a decreased glucose count in the CSF. This patient's startle myoclonus with a history of a neurological procedure makes a diagnosis of Prion disease more likely.<br><br>Option C: Blockage of the shunt system presents with features of raised ICP as there is no outlet for drainage of CSF. This patient's only symptoms are progressive memory deficits with a history of VP shunt insertion. This makes a prion disease the likely etiology. <br><br>Option D: Surgical error during the procedure could have presented more acutely and not after 5 years.",

One of the strands (the plus strand) is incomplete resulting in partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded DNA. The steps in replication of HBV can be summarised as follows:<br><br>* The virus first attaches to the host and gets uncoated. <br><br>* The partially double-stranded DNA is converted to covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA in the nucleus. <br><br>* The cccDNA serves as the template for the production of HBV mRNAs and pre-genomic RNA. <br><br>* The pre-genomic RNA is encapsidated by newly synthesized HBcAg core particles. <br><br>* Within the encapsidated core, RNA serves as a template for the HBV reverse transcriptase which is a part of the polymerase gene to synthesise negative-strand DNA. Positive-strand DNA synthesis starts but does not proceed to completion within the core, resulting in a variable-length positive-strand DNA. <br><br>* Core particles containing these DNA replicative intermediates acquire HBsAg-containing envelopes to complete the process.<br><br>The images below show the structure and life cycle of the hepatitis B virus.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/469001a0bb614cd5a64f15e628bf26cdx711x452.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/64ad49b19fe04526b6d7f4ac8c13c52bx960x720.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

(Statement 1 )<br><br>Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), or stool transplant, involves transferring fecal bacteria from a healthy donor to a recipient. This procedure has been successfully employed to treat patients with C. difficile infection. FMT reintroduces beneficial microorganisms, specifically from the Bacteroides and Firmicutes phyla, to restore the balance of the colonic microbiota. (Statement 2)<br><br>Clostridium difficile, a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus (statement 4) is the most common infective cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is commonly seen in individuals who receive a prolonged antibiotic course, which causes a change in the composition of gastrointestinal microbial flora, leading to colonization of C. difficile.<br><br>Majority of the cases occur in the elderly with comorbidities within 1-6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. The symptoms include lower abdominal pain and watery diarrhoea. Rarely, it may progress to pseudomembranous colitis.<br><br>Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is diagnosed primarily through stool testing for C. difficile toxins A or B. Initial screening commonly uses glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) detection or PCR for C. difficile nucleic acid. A positive screening test is typically followed by confirmatory testing with toxin ELISA or a tissue-culture cytotoxicity assay to establish the presence of active toxin production.<br><br>For microbiological culture, cycloserine–cefoxitin–fructose agar (CCFA) serves as a selective and differential medium for isolating C. difficile from stool samples (Statement 3). In unclear or severe cases, sigmoidoscopy may reveal the characteristic pseudomembranous appearance with erythema, discrete white plaques, or adherent pseudomembranes.<br><br>Treatment begins with the immediate discontinuation of the inciting antibiotic whenever possible and placing the patient in isolation to limit transmission. First-line treatment for mild disease is a 10-day course of oral fidaxomicin, which is preferred because of its lower relapse rate; oral vancomycin is an acceptable alternative.<br><br>Severe or refractory cases may require adjunctive therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin or glucocorticoids.
