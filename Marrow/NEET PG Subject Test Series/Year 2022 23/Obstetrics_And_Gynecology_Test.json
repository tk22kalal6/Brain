The most common location of implantation in ectopic pregnancy is the <strong>tubal ampulla</strong>. </p>\n<p>Almost <strong>95% of ectopic pregnancies</strong> implant within the fallopian tube. Within the fallopian tube, the <strong>ampulla</strong> is the most commonly affected location in 70% of the cases. The remaining implant is in the <strong>isthmus</strong> (12%), <strong>fimbria</strong> (11%), and <strong>interstitial tub</strong>e (2%). </p>\n<p>The other sites of implantations are the <strong>ovary</strong> (Option A), peritoneal cavity, <strong>cervix</strong> (Option B), or prior cesarean <strong>scar</strong> (Option C). </p>\n<p>The classic <strong>triad</strong> of symptoms for an ectopic pregnancy is <strong>delayed menstrual cycle, abdominal pain, </strong>and<strong> vaginal bleeding. </strong></p>\n<p>The examination may reveal <strong>abdominal tenderness</strong>, pain in cervical motion,<strong> a bulging posterior vaginal fornix</strong>, boggy mass next to the uterus. <strong>Vaginal bleeding</strong> or spotting may be present. Ruptured ectopic will lead to intraabdominal haemorrhage, leading to reciprocal changes in vital signs. </p>\n<p>Investigations used to diagnose ectopic pregnancy include a <strong>positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin</strong> to diagnose a pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasound can be used to identify the gestational sac or determine if the case is a pregnancy of an unknown location. In an ectopic pregnancy, the endometrial stripe will appear as a <strong>trilaminar pattern</strong> and anechoic fluid collections may be present. </p>\n<p>Medical management of ectopic pregnancy involves the use of <strong>methotrexate</strong>, a folic acid antagonist. Surgical management depends on whether the patient is hemodynamically stable (laparoscopy versus laparotomy) and whether she desires future fertility (salpingectomy versus salpingostomy).</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Fallopian tube</h3><p><strong>Gross anatomy:</strong></p>\n<p>The fallopian tube is divided into the following parts:</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 31\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intramural/Interstitial portion:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<ul>\n<li>Intrauterine</li>\n<li>The narrowest and shortest part</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Isthmus:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The most common site for tubectomy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Ampulla:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The longest and widest part</li>\n<li>The most common site for - fertilization and ectopic pregnancy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Infundibulum</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6b727bd9f7374ff5820d26e5f0792421x1279x1178.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Histology:</strong></p>\n<p>The ampulla, isthmus and infundibulum are extrauterine.
