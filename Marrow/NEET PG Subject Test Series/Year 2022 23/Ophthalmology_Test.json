This results in the formation of<strong> cyst-like cavities around </strong>the<strong> foveola</strong>. It occurs due to a <strong>break</strong> in the <strong>inner and outer blood-retinal barrier</strong>. Common causes of CME include uveitis, previous cataract surgery (<strong>Irvine-Gass syndrome</strong>), retinal vein occlusions, <strong>diabetic retinopathy, </strong>and retinitis pigmentosa.</p>\n<p>Patients may complain of <strong>blurring, distortion</strong>, and <strong>micropsia</strong>.

It can be seen in conditions such as <strong>thyroid ophthalmopathy</strong>, <strong>entrapped inferior rectus</strong> muscle in <strong>blow-out fracture</strong> and orbital mass lesions. <strong>Forced duction test</strong> will be <strong>positive</strong>. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Primary exotropia</strong> is a form of <strong>divergent squint</strong> and may be intermittent or constant.

Hence, when light is transferred to the diseased eye, both the pupils will dilate. And on swinging the light back to the normal eye, both pupils will constrict again.  This 'escape dilatation' is known as a relative afferent pupillary defect/Marcus Gunn pupil. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of loss of vision</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Features </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cause </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sudden painless loss of vision</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Central retinal artery occlusion</li>\n<li>Massive vitreous hemorrhage</li>\n<li>Retinal detachment involving macula</li>\n<li>Ischemic central retinal vein occlusion</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sudden painless onset of diminution of vision</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Central serous retinopathy</li>\n<li>Optic neuritis</li>\n<li>Methyl alcohol amblyopia</li>\n<li>Non-ischemic central retinal vein occlusion</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sudden painful loss of vision</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Acute congestive glaucoma</li>\n<li>Acute iridocyclitis</li>\n<li>Injury to eyeball</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Gradual painless diminution of vision</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Corneal dystrophy</li>\n<li>Senile cataract</li>\n<li>Primary open angle glaucoma</li>\n<li>Optic atrophy</li>\n<li>ARMD</li>\n<li>Refractive error</li>\n<li>Diabetic retinopathy</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Gradual painful diminution of vision</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronic iridocyclitis</li>\n<li>Corneal ulceration</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Ophthalmoscopy is the method of assessing the interior of the eye by using an ophthalmoscope. There are 3 <strong>types of ophthalmoscopy,</strong> mainly <strong>indirect</strong> ophthalmoscopy,<strong> direct</strong> ophthalmoscopy, and <strong>distant direct</strong> ophthalmoscopy.</p>\n<p>An <strong>indirect ophthalmoscope</strong> produces a real, inverted, and magnified image. It is essential for <strong>assessing retinal detachment</strong> and other <strong>peripheral retinal lesions</strong>. </p>\n<p>Advantages of  an indirect ophthalmoscope over a direct ophthalmoscope are:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Feature</td>\n<td>Indirect Ophthalmoscopy</td>\n<td>Direct Ophthalmoscopy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Image</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Real, Inverted</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Virtual, Erect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Magnification</td>\n<td> X~2.5 </td>\n<td> X 15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Area of the field in focus</strong></td>\n<td> <strong>Much larger</strong> (8 disc diameter)</td>\n<td><strong>Small (2 disc diameter)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Examination through hazy media</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Possible</strong></td>\n<td>Not possible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Depth perception</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Possible</strong></td>\n<td>Not possible</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Slit-lamp biomicroscopy</strong> is used to scan the eye anteroposteriorly and horizontally. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Direct ophthalmoscope </strong>is most commonly used in routine fundus examination.
