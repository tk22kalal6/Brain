It occurs in the&nbsp;<strong>non-rapid eye movement</strong> (NREM)<strong> phase</strong> of sleep(Stage N3 sleep).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is more commonly seen in <strong>children</strong> between the ages of 4-8 years. It usually resolves after adolescence and is rarely seen in adults. It has a <strong>familial pattern&nbsp;</strong>and may occur <strong>secondary</strong> to<strong> other sleep disorders</strong> like sleep apnea.<strong>&nbsp;Sleep deprivation</strong>, interruption of slow-wave sleep, alcohol consumption, and <strong>stress</strong> can exacerbate the condition.</p>\n<p>During an episode of sleepwalking, the individual may sit up, attempt to walk or perform semi-purposeful actions. They have a <strong>blank expression</strong> and are<strong> unresponsive</strong> to communication. Waking them up is possible only with great difficulty. During the episode, patients can interact with the environment successfully (e.g., avoiding tripping over objects), but can also harm themselves (e.g., walking into the road). Legally, the person is <strong>not criminally responsible</strong> for his acts carried out during an episode.</p>\n<p>Forms of somnambulism include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sleep-related eating: The individual may ingest<strong> food</strong> during the episode.</li>\n<li>Sleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia): The individual may engage in sexual activities during the episode</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Management includes <strong>reassurance</strong>, maintenance of safety, and avoiding sleep deprivation. <strong>Antidepressants</strong>, relaxation techniques, and hypnosis may also be used.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Events occurring in NREM and REM sleep</h3><p>Events occurring during <strong>NREM&nbsp;stages 3 and 4</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Events</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Description</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Somnambulism</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Sleepwalking</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Sleep terror or Night terror</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Also called pavor nocturnus.</span></p>\n<p><span>Awakens with a scream or intense anxiety.

Though it points to an underlying medical condition, in reality, it arises due to <strong>psychological factors</strong>. The symptoms are <strong>not intentionally produced</strong> and the gain obtained is primarily psychological. </p>\n<p>It can be associated with <strong>depressive disorders</strong>, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and somatization disorders. Paralysis, <strong>blindness</strong>, and mutism are the most frequently seen conversion disorder symptoms. <strong>Anaesthesia</strong> and<strong> paresthesia </strong>of the extremities, abnormal movements, and gait disturbance are the other features commonly seen. </p>\n<p>Conversion disorder usually <strong>resolves spontaneously</strong>. Insight-oriented or <strong>behavioural therapy</strong> is also helpful.

However, this patient has normal visual acuity, normal pupillary reactions, and no detectable abnormalities on ophthalmic or neurological exams, making CRVO an unlikely diagnosis in this case.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Eales' disease</strong>, common in <strong>young Asian males</strong>, features <strong>recurrent vitreous haemorrhage</strong> and <strong>retinal neovascularization</strong> due to peripheral <strong>retinal vein inflammation</strong>. It presents with a <strong>reddish vitreous mass</strong> and can lead to <strong>vision loss</strong> and complications like <strong>retinal detachment</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>Defense mechanisms involved in this scenario are <strong>displacement, avoidance,</strong> and<strong> symbolization</strong> - 1,3,4 (Option A).</p>\n<p>The clinical scenario of extreme fear of heights points toward <strong>acrophobia</strong> and the defense mechanisms involved in phobias are <strong>displacement</strong>,<strong> symbolization</strong>, and<strong> avoidance. </strong></p>\n<p>A <strong>phobia</strong> can be described as a fear that is irrational and out of proportion to the stimulus. Defense mechanisms mediate an individual's reaction to emotional conflicts and stressors. In displacement, the conflict or emotions are <strong>displaced</strong> from the actual cause to a less threatening, irrel­evant <strong>object or situation</strong>. </p>\n<p>The primary source of the conflict may have a <strong>direct associative connec­tion</strong> with the phobic object or situation that <strong>symbolizes</strong> it. This object is something the <strong>person can avoid</strong> and this protects the person from the anxiety attached to the original object or idea, which is the defense mechanism of <strong>symbolization</strong>.</p>\n<p>The phobic situation or the object is usually something that the person can <strong>avoid</strong>. With the defense mechanism of avoidance, the person can escape the anxiety associated with it. </p>\n<p><strong>Behavioral therapy</strong> is the most effective treatment for phobias. Insight-oriented therapy, virtual therapy, and exposure therapy are also used for the treatment of phobic disorders and specific phobias. <strong>β-receptor blockers</strong> can be used for the treatment of specific phobias, particularly if it is associated with panic attacks. <strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> can also be used but the chronic nature of the disease limits its effect. <strong>Paroxetine</strong> and <strong>sertraline</strong> can be used to manage <strong>social anxiety</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Dissociation</strong> is the<strong> splitting</strong> of mental contents in clusters from conscious awareness. This allows the individual to support two contradictory truths while not being aware of them. An extreme manifestation of this mechanism is seen in dissociative identity disorder. </p>\n<p><strong>Reaction formation</strong> is an unconscious defense mechanism in which the person develops a wish or impulse that is a <strong>direct antithesis</strong> to the ones that are harbored consciously or unconsciously. It develops against impulses that are unacceptable to the ego.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Defense mechanisms that operate in various diseases</h3><ul>\n<li><strong>OCD</strong> - reaction formation,

      "solution": "<p>Attributable to physiological effects of a substance is <strong>not</strong> a diagnostic criterion for <strong>Tourette's disorder</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the <strong>diagnostic features</strong> of Tourette&rsquo;s disorder is that the disturbance is <strong>not</strong> a direct physiological effect of any&nbsp;<strong>stimulant</strong> or <strong>substance use</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tourette's disorder is the most severe tic disorder that more commonly affects boys. It is also associated with <strong>attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</strong> (ADHD) and <strong>obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong> (OCD).</p>\n<p>According to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), the following criteria are used for diagnosis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multiple motor tics</strong> and at least <strong>one vocal tic</strong> should be present during the illness. It need not be concurrent.</li>\n<li>The <strong>onset</strong> of illness is before the age of <strong>18</strong></li>\n<li>The tics can <strong>wax and wane</strong> in frequency but should persist for at least a <strong>year</strong> since the first tic onset</li>\n<li>The disturbance should <strong>not</strong> be<strong> attributable</strong> to the <strong>use</strong> of <strong>substances</strong> such as cocaine or medical conditions such as <strong>Huntington's disease</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The condition is thought to be a<strong> genetic</strong> disorder. Initially, the tics involve the face and neck which then progresses downwards. It usually <strong>disappears</strong> during <strong>sleep</strong> and is attenuated by relaxation or absorption in an activity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mild cases may not require treatment. In severe cases, <strong>behavioral interventions</strong> are the first line of treatment. <strong>Psychoeducation</strong> is recommended for <strong>families</strong> to understand the natural history of the disease. Antipsychotic agents such as <strong>risperidone</strong> are used for the treatment of tics. Noradrenergic drugs like clonidine can be used for children with comorbid ADHD.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Timeline in psychiatry</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Condition</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Duration</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Manic episode</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>At least 1 week</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Hypomania</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>At least 4 consecutive days</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Major depressive disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Lasts 6 to12 months with episodes for 2 or more weeks</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Cyclothymia</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>At least 2 years</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Dysthymia</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>At least 2 years</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Maternal blues</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Starts 2&ndash;3 days after delivery and usually resolves within 10 days</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Postpartum mood disturbances</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Onset within 4 weeks of delivery</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Brief psychotic disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &lt; 1 month, usually stress-related</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Schizophreniform disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts 1-6 months</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Schizophrenia</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 6 months</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Schizoaffective disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 2 weeks</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Delusional disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 1 month</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Panic disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>An episode followed by 1 month of concern of additional attacks&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Specific phobia</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 6 months</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 6 months&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Acute stress disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts between 3 days and 1 month&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>PTSD</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 1 month&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Adjustment disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Symptoms occur within 3 months of the stressor and last &lt; 6 months</span></p>\n<p><span>May last &gt; 6 months in presence of chronic stressor</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>At least 3 months</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Somatic symptom disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 6 months</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Separation anxiety disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Common onset at 7&ndash;9 years&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Tourette syndrome</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Onset &lt; age 18 years</span></p>\n<p><span>Tics that persist for &gt; 1 year&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>ADHD</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Symptoms for &gt; 6 months&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
