They are primarily on the cervix and labia in women.</li>\n<li id=\"yiv5783307750ymail_android_signature\"><strong>Secondary syphilis</strong> is the stage when generalized manifestations of syphilis appear on the <strong>skin </strong>and<strong> mucous membranes</strong>. A<strong>&nbsp;rash</strong>&nbsp;is commonly seen and this stage may be preceded by constitutional symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and malaise. The rash, known as <strong>syphilides</strong> is coppery-<strong>red, non-itchy, </strong>and<strong> symmetrical.&nbsp;</strong>It is initially macular, then progresses to papular syphilides.</li>\n<li>\n<div id=\"yiv5783307750ymail_android_signature\"><strong>Latent syphilis</strong> is the stage when there are <strong>no clinical features </strong>of the active disease but <strong>serological testing</strong> for the disease is <strong>positive.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</div>\n</li>\n<li id=\"yiv5783307750ymail_android_signature\"><strong>Late syphilis (tertiary syphilis)</strong> commonly presents as superficial or nodular<strong> punched out ulcers </strong>or <strong>gummas&nbsp;</strong>(granulomas appearing as cutaneous plaques or nodules with central ulceration) appears<strong>&nbsp;</strong>3-10 years after infection.&nbsp;It may also present as red nodules (nodular syphilides),&nbsp;neurosyphilis, and cardiovascular syphilis.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<div>Serological testing is done using standard non-treponemal antibody tests like <strong>VDRL </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;rapid plasma reagin </strong>(RPR).
