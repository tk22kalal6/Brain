The headache is typically <strong>frontal</strong> or<strong> occipital </strong>in distribution and is associated with nausea, neck stiffness, and lower back pain. Most of the headaches <strong>resolve spontaneously</strong> within <strong>7 days</strong>. </p>\n<p>An <strong>epidural blood patch</strong> is the <strong>definitive</strong> management. It is ideally performed <strong>24 hours</strong> after dural puncture and the development of classic symptoms. <strong>15-20 mL</strong> of autologous blood is injected into the <strong>epidural space</strong> at the<strong> same </strong>or <strong>one interspace below </strong>the level of the dural puncture. It acts by stopping the CSF leak by either mass effect or coagulation. Most <strong>patients </strong>will respond to a<strong> single blood patch</strong>, and 90% of initial nonresponders will obtain relief from a second injection (1 to 2 days after the first). A prophylactic epidural patch is not recommended.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: PDPH- Post-Dural Puncture Headache</h3><ul>\n<li>May follow lumbar puncture, spinal anesthesia, wet epidural tap (in which epidural needle pierced dura).</li>\n<li>Onset 12-72hrs and last for 1-2 weeks.</li>\n<li>Aggravated by sitting and relieved by lying down.</li>\n<li>Incidence increases with the larger needle, cutting point (in comparison to pencil point) needle, young age, females, pregnancy.</li>\n<li>Prevention by thinner needle</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Management:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supine position</li>\n<li>IV fluids</li>\n<li>Caffeine and analgesia</li>\n<li>Epidural blood patch</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Factors That Can Increase the Incidence of Headache After Spinal Puncture</h3><ul>\n<li>Age: Younger, more frequent</li>\n<li>Sex: Females &gt; males</li>\n<li>Needle size: Larger &gt; smaller</li>\n<li>Needle bevel: Less when the needle bevel is placed in the long axis of the neuraxis Orienting a needle bevel parallel with the axis of the spine, such that the longitudinal fibers of the dura would more likely be separated than cut, results in a lower incidence of postspinal puncture headache</li>\n<li>Pregnancy: More when pregnant</li>\n<li>Dural punctures: More with multiple punctures</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Factors That Do Not Increase the Incidence of Headache After Spinal Puncture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insertion and use of catheters for continuous spinal anesthesia</li>\n<li><strong>Timing&nbsp;of ambulation</strong></li>\n</ul>",

The most important landmark is the pulse of the <strong>axillary artery</strong> just distal to the pectoralis major near the anterior axillary wall. Usually, the median, ulnar, and radial nerves (close the arterial wall) and the musculocutaneous nerve (showing a characteristic medial-to-lateral course in the axilla) can be seen.</p>\n<p>Although this is a safe and effective technique, the <strong>musculocutaneous nerve fails to be blocked</strong> as it changes its course from adjacent the axillary artery to within the coracobrachialis muscle and then exiting the muscle. However, this can be prevented by ultrasound imaging, which helps in direct visualization of the nerve. </p>\n<p>The arm to be blocked should be <strong>abducted at 90°</strong> and the forearm may be supported horizontally at 90° or above or behind the head for optimal positioning of the patient for the procedure.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/da2acef57bd04f4fbfb764b1826d8508x1280x1762.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Brachial Plexus</h3><p><strong>Brachial Plexus</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>C5 to T1</li>\n<li>Roots (from spinal cord) &gt; Trunks (in the neck)&gt; Divisions (passing behind clavicle) &gt; Cords and Branches (in the axilla).</li>\n<li>Covered by prevertebral fascia extension called \"axillary sheath\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Trunks</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upper trunk: C5 and C6</li>\n<li>Middle trunk: C7.</li>\n<li>Lower trunk: C8 and T1</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Divisions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anterior&nbsp;divisions - Forms lateral and medial cords supplying mainly flexors&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Posterior divisions - Forms posterior cord which suppy mainly extensors&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cords</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lateral cord: Formed by <strong>anterior divisions</strong> of the <strong>upper and middle</strong> trunks.</li>\n<li>Posterior cord: Formed by <strong>all 3 posterior divisions&nbsp;</strong></li>\n<li>Medial cord: Formed by <strong>anterior division</strong> of the <strong>lower</strong> trunk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Branches</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Parts&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Branches</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Roots</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dorsal scapular nerve (C5)</p>\n<p>Long thoracic nerve of Bell (C5-C7)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Upper trunk</td>\n<td>\n<p>Suprascapular nerve (C5, C6)</p>\n<p>Nerve to Subclavius (C5, C6).</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lateral cord (LML)</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>L</strong>ateral pectoral nerve (C5-C7)</p>\n<p><strong>M</strong>usculocutaneous nerve (C5-C7)</p>\n<p><strong>L</strong>ateral root of median nerve (C5-C7)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medial cord (UM4)</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>M</strong>edial pectoral (C8,T1)</p>\n<p><strong>M</strong>edial cutaneous nerve of forearm (C8,T1)</p>\n<p><strong>M</strong>edial cutaneous nerve of arm (C8,T1)</p>\n<p><strong>U</strong>lnar nerve (C8,T1)</p>\n<p><strong>M</strong>edial root of median nerve (C8,T1)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Posterior cord (STARS)</td>\n<td>\n<p>Upper<strong> S</strong>ubscapular nerve (C5,C6)</p>\n<p><strong>T</strong>horacodorsal nerve (C6-C8)</p>\n<p>Axillary (C5,C6)</p>\n<p><strong>R</strong>adial&nbsp;(C5-T1)</p>\n<p>Lower <strong>S</strong>ubscapular (C5,C6)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note :&nbsp;However<strong> Ulnar Nerve</strong> near its <strong>origin</strong>, often receives a communicating branch from the lateral root of the median nerve originating from the lateral cord and carrying fibers from <strong>C7</strong>.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/458c2974cce64f408d370c34cfcc04e3x1280x3167.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d1b0eda952d74e0d8a5a1dc74f003051x1280x1224.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Brachial Plexus Blocks</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Name of Block</td>\n<td>Level of Block</td>\n<td>Adequate Analgesia Seen at</td>\n<td>Limitations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Interscalene</td>\n<td>Superior and middle trunk</td>\n<td>Shoulder and upper arm.
