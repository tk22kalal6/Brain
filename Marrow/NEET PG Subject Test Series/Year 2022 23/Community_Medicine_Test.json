      "solution": "<p>Among the given options, the <strong>A, B, O blood groups</strong> can be measured on a<strong> nominal</strong> scale.</p>\n<p>Data will always fall into one of the following four scales:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nominal</li>\n<li>Ordinal</li>\n<li>Interval</li>\n<li>Ratio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nominal scale data</strong> can be divided into <strong>qualitative</strong> categories or groups. Examples include <strong>male/female</strong>, black/white, or red/green. No order or ratio from the data is implied. Nominal data that falls exclusively into two groups is known as <strong>dichotomous data</strong>. A, B, O blood groups can be clearly divided into qualitative groups and hence can be measured on a nominal scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Ordinal scale data</strong> holds meaning when it is placed in a <strong>particular order</strong>. An example is the ranking of students in a class. But, there is no information about the interval size. This means that the difference between the marks of the first and second students may or may not be the same as the difference between the second and third. An example is the <strong>Glasgow coma scale </strong>and <strong>Child-Pugh score</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Interval scale data</strong> is similar to ordinal data because it can be placed in a meaningful order. Additionally, they have meaningful <strong>intervals</strong> between the items, usually <strong>measurable quantities</strong>. For example, the difference between 100° and 90° is the same as that between 50° and 40° on the temperature scale. But these scales do not have absolute zeroes, which makes ratios between the items meaningless. </p>\n<p><strong>Ratio scale data</strong> have similar properties to interval scale data. In addition, they have an <strong>absolute zero</strong>. Most biomedical variables can be measured on a ratio scale. Examples are weight in pounds or grams, pulse rate in beats/minute, and blood pressure in millimeters of mercury. A pulse rate of 0 indicates a lack of pulse, and a rate of 120/minute is twice as fast as a rate of 60/minute. This means it is possible to calculate <strong>meaningful ratios</strong>. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Glasgow coma scale can be measured on the <strong>ordinal</strong> scale.</p>\n<p>Option C: Intelligence quotient can be measured on the <strong>interval</strong> scale.</p>\n<p>Option D: Respiratory rate<strong> </strong>can be measured with the <strong>ratio</strong> scale.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Scales of data measurement</h3><p>Data can be <strong>quantitative</strong> (numerical values) or <strong>qualitative</strong> (types, labels).</p>\n<p>Quantitative data can be <strong>discrete variables </strong>or<strong> continuous variables.</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Description</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Example</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Discrete data</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Can take&nbsp;<strong>certain values and none in between</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Number of cancer patients in a hospital.&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Continuous data</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Can <strong>take any value </strong>usually in between limits or a range.&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Most biomedical data is continuous.</p>\n<p>Height, weight, blood pressure, etc.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Data always forms one of four <strong>scales of measurement</strong> &ndash; <strong>nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio</strong> scales (mnemonic: <strong>NOIR):</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Nominal Scale Data</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Ordinal Scale Data</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Interval Scale Data</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Ratio Scale Data</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Example</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Male/female; red/green; sub-urban/rural</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Students ranked 1st/2nd/3rd in their class.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A customer feedback survey using terms like very good, good, poor and very poor or the <strong>Likert Scale.</strong></p>\n<p>Severity of a disease as mild, moderate, severe</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>Measurements on the celsius scale.</td>\n<td>Pulse rate;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Notes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Have <strong>no quantitative value</strong>.</p>\n<p>They have no order or ratio.&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Arranged in a <strong>meaningful order.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>No size interval is defined</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Arranged in a <strong>meaningful order </strong>with a<strong> well defined size interval</strong>.</p>\n<p>Example: Temperature in Celsius.

This is a  requirement for this indirect transmission. </p>\n<p>An important distinction has to be drawn between droplet nuclei infection and droplet infection. The main difference between airborne droplet nuclei and droplet transmission is in the size of infected/contagious particles and whether proximity is required for transmission.</p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para\"><strong>Droplet nuclei/residue</strong><strong> </strong>from<strong> evaporated droplets</strong> containing infective microorganisms can result in airborne transmission. The size of these droplet nuclei is <strong>&lt;5 μm</strong> in diameter, and they can remain suspended in the air for significant periods of time, allowing them to be <strong>transmitted over distances</strong> &gt;1 m.  There's no need for close proximity or contact. Diseases like chickenpox, measles, <strong>tuberculosis</strong>, and influenza can spread through airborne transmission.</p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para\"><strong>Droplet transmission</strong> occurs when one coughs or sneezes, and contagious droplets from the infected person travel shortly in the air and directly comes in contact with another person's conjunctiva, mouth, or nasal mucosa. The particle size here is <strong>&gt;5 μm </strong>in diameter. Transmission here requires<strong> close proximity</strong> and<strong> direct contact</strong>. Examples of diseases spread via this route include the <strong>common cold</strong>, diphtheria, and whooping cough.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Modes of Transmission of Communicable Diseases</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Direct</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Indirect</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Direct contact</p>\n<p>Droplet infection</p>\n<p>Contact with soil</p>\n<p>Inoculation into skin or mucosa</p>\n<p>Vertical (transplacental)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vehicle-borne</p>\n<p>Vector borne &ndash; mechanical or biological</p>\n<p>Air borne &ndash; droplet nuclei or dust</p>\n<p>Fomite borne</p>\n<p>Unclean hands and finger</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

It is an <strong>effective</strong> and <strong>economical</strong> method of screening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A<strong>: Mass screening</strong> is the <strong>screening</strong> of a <strong>population</strong> or a sub-group of the population for a disease <strong>irrespective </strong>of the particular<strong> risk</strong> an individual may run of contracting the disease in question. It is not a useful preventive measure unless there is a&nbsp; suitable treatment that alters the duration or outcome of a disease.</p>\n<p>Option B<strong>: Multiphasic screening</strong> is the application of<strong> two </strong>or<strong> more screening tests</strong> (instead of carrying out separate screening tests for a single disease) to a large number of people in the form of health questionnaires, clinical examinations, and investigations. It has not shown any benefit to the population in terms of mortality and morbidity reduction and has instead increased the cost of health services.</p>\n<p>Option C<strong>: Prospective screening</strong> is screening people for the<strong> benefit </strong>of<strong> others</strong>. For example, screening immigrants for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis to protect the home population from the disease.</p>\n<p>Note: <strong>Prescriptive screening</strong> is defined as the presumptive screening of patients for unrecognized diseases for their <strong>own benefit</strong>. It usually does not arise from a patient's request. Examples include screening for bacteriuria in pregnancy and screening for hemolytic disease in a neonate.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Validity of a Screening Test</h3><ul>\n<li><strong>Validity/ accuracy </strong>of a screening test depends upon the <strong>sensitivity, specificity,</strong> and<strong> predictive accuracy</strong> of the test.</li>\n<li>It represents the closeness to a true value/ actual value.</li>\n<li>These are the <strong>inherent properties</strong> of a screening test.</li>\n<li>P<strong>P</strong>V and N<strong>P</strong>V are <strong>dependent</strong> on the <strong>P</strong>revalence of disease.</li>\n<li>Sensitivity &amp; Specificity are independent of prevalence of disease.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/62275b1d441443bc92db11bb3add523ex1280x959.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Formulae</strong>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Sensitivity</span></td>\n<td><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>TP</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span><strong>TP</strong> + FN</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Specificity</span></td>\n<td><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>TN&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><sub><br /></sub>FP + <strong>TN</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Predictive value of a positive test (<strong>P</strong>PV)</span></td>\n<td><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;T<strong>P&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><sub><br /></sub>T<strong>P</strong> + F<strong>P</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Predictive value of a negative test (<strong>N</strong>PV)</span></td>\n<td><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;T<strong>N&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</span><sub><br /></sub>T<strong>N</strong> + F<strong>N</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Percentage of false positives</span></td>\n<td><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FP&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><sub><br /></sub>FP + TN</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Percentage of false negatives</span></td>\n<td><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><sub><br /></sub>TP + FN</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PPV</strong> varies <strong>directly</strong> with prevalence</li>\n<li><strong>NPV</strong> varies <strong>inversely</strong> with prevalence</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Lead Time in Screening</h3><p>Lead time is the period between the <strong>first possible</strong> <strong>time</strong> of detection and the <strong>usual time</strong> of diagnosis.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b6e8bf826a364c7abb0006bc098eef63x1280x1020.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>Lead time is the advantage gained by screening.

It occurs in <strong>cycles</strong> that are spread over short periods of time. This can be days, weeks, months, or even years.  Examples of the cyclic trend include influenza and <strong>rubella</strong>. Some <strong>non-infectious conditions</strong> can also display cyclical trends. An example of this is road traffic accidents occurring more frequently on the weekends. Knowledge of the cyclical pattern of diseases can be used to defend communities against the same.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Seasonal trend</strong> is another type of period fluctuation which refers to<strong> seasonal variation</strong> of diseases. Examples of diseases that follow this trend include <strong>measles</strong>, <strong>malaria</strong>, and upper respiratory tract infections. It can be related to <strong>environmental conditions</strong> such as temperature and humidity. Some non-infectious conditions which follow this trend are <strong>sunstroke</strong>, hay fever, and snakebite. Some epidemiologists consider this a form of cyclic trend.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Secular</strong> or <strong>long-term trend</strong> signifies the changes seen in the occurrence of a disease over a long period of time. It implies a <strong>consistent change</strong> in a particular direction such as a progressive increase or decrease. Examples of conditions that follow this pattern are <strong>coronary heart disease</strong> and <strong>lung cancer</strong> which have shown a consistent upward trend. A decline in the occurrence of diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria has been noted in developed countries. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Point-source epidemic</strong> is a type of common-source epidemic. In this type of epidemic, there are <strong>no secondary waves</strong> and the epidemic curve rises and falls rapidly. There is a <strong>clustering</strong> of <strong>cases</strong> within a narrow interval of time. All the cases develop within <strong>one incubation period</strong> of the specific disease.</p>",

The <strong>primary bacterial indicator</strong> used to assess this is the <strong>coliform group</strong> of organisms. This is because they are present abundantly in the human intestine and can be <strong>easily detected</strong> by culture methods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>presumptive coliform test</strong> can be done by the <strong>multiple tube method</strong> or <strong>membrane filtration</strong> <strong>technique</strong>. In the multiple tube method, the water to be tested is&nbsp;<strong>inoculated&nbsp;</strong>into tubes containing a suitable liquid medium. These tubes are then incubated for 48 hours and examined. The test is called <strong>presumptive</strong> because the reaction observed in the tube may occasionally be due to other organisms. The presumption that the reaction is due to coliform organisms has to be confirmed. <strong>McConkey's lactose bile salt broth</strong> with<strong> bromocresol purple 25</strong> as an indicator is used as the media. The number of tubes with production of <strong>acid</strong> and <strong>gas</strong> can be assessed to estimate the <strong>most probable number</strong> of coliform organisms in <strong>100 ml</strong> of water. <em>Escherichia coli</em> or thermotolerant coliform bacteria should not be detected in any 100 ml sample.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In samples of chlorinated water, confirmation of the presumptive test is necessary. This is done by <strong>subculturing</strong> the positive tubes in two tubes of brilliant green bile broth. It is based on the fact that <em>E.Coli</em> is the only coliform that can produce<strong> gas</strong> from lactose at 44&deg;C.</p>\n<p>Supplementary indicator organisms include <strong>fecal streptococci</strong> and sulfite-reducing <strong>clostridia</strong>.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, 2017</h3><p><strong>WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, 2017</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I)&nbsp;Physical parameters:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Guideline values</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Comments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Turbidity</strong></td>\n<td>Ideally, no visible turbidity but permissible standard is <strong>&lt; 1.0 NTU </strong>(nephelometric turbidity units) for household drinking water.&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>It describes the <strong>cloudiness of water</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&gt;4 NTU </strong>&ndash; cloudiness visible to naked eye.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;4 NTU</strong> &ndash; measured only by instruments.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Color</strong></td>\n<td>Ideally, no visible color but permissible standard is <strong>&lt;15 TCU </strong>(true color units).</td>\n<td>&nbsp;<strong>&gt;15 TCU </strong>is detectable by the naked eye.&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Taste, odor and t</strong><strong>emperature</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>No health based guideline values</strong></td>\n<td>It may be indicative of contamination and pollution.&nbsp;High water temperature may enhance growth of microorganisms and influence taste, odor and color.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>II)&nbsp;Chemical parameters:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Guideline values</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ammonia</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>No health based guideline value</strong>.</p>\n<p>Natural levels in <strong>surface </strong>and<strong> ground water</strong> is <strong>0.2 mg/l</strong>. <strong>Anaerobic groundwater</strong> may have up to <strong>3 mg/l</strong>.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Aluminium</strong></td>\n<td>up to<strong> 0.9 mg/l</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Arsenic</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>up to<strong> 0.01 mg/l</strong></p>\n<p>Levels in natural water range from 1 to 2 &micro;g/l.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Chloride</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>250 mg/l</strong>, as above this a detectable taste appears.</p>\n<p>Maximum permissible level is <strong>600 mg/l.

      "solution": "<p>The<strong> SPEAK&nbsp;</strong>protocol is used to assess <strong>health literacy&nbsp;</strong>in the <strong>geriatric population</strong> in a clinical setting.</p>\n<p>Health literacy<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and <strong>understand</strong> basic <strong>health information</strong> needed to make appropriate <strong>health decisions</strong>. The SPEAK protocol provides a simple framework that healthcare providers can use to assess literacy. SPEAK stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>S - Speech</li>\n<li>P - Perception</li>\n<li>E - Education</li>\n<li>A - Access</li>\n<li>K - Knowledge</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option A: The&nbsp;<strong>GATHER&nbsp;</strong>approach is mainly used for <strong>counseling </strong>(usually, family planning and reproductive counseling)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to help people make decisions about health.
