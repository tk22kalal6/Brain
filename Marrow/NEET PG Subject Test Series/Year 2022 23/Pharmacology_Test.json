Therefore, they only <strong>inhibit </strong>the<strong> conversion of levodopa</strong> into dopamine in the<strong> periphery</strong> and <strong>not in the brain</strong>. This leads to the increased plasma half-life of levodopa, and therefore, lower doses of levodopa can be prescribed.</p>\n<p>Benefits of combination therapy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This therapy inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in the periphery, leading to <strong>increased plasma half-life</strong> of levodopa.</li>\n<li>Combination therapy reduces adverse effects like gastrointestinal side effects, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.</li>\n<li>This therapy allows for increased availability of levodopa in the brain.</li>\n<li>Fluctuation in motor control, where the patient is alternately well and disabled, occurs on prolonged therapy with levodopa. This type of \"<strong>on-off</strong>\" effect is <strong>reduced</strong> in combination therapy because of sustained dopamine levels in the brain.</li>\n<li><strong>Pyridoxine</strong> enhances the peripheral metabolism of levodopa. Hence, combination therapy with carbidopa nullifies the interaction of pyridoxine with levodopa metabolism.</li>\n<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>A<strong> higher&nbsp;degree of improvement</strong> is seen&nbsp;in combination therapy than in monotherapy with levodopa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Demerits of combination therapy:</p>\n<p>This therapy decreases the concentration of levodopa in the periphery, but increases the concentration of levodopa reaching the brain.<strong> Involuntary movements </strong>and <strong>behavioral adverse effects</strong> like confusion, hallucinations,&nbsp;nightmares, and delusions are <strong>not reduced </strong>after the addition of carbidopa<strong>. </strong>In fact, they are <strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;in patients who are taking levodopa <strong>with peripheral carboxylase</strong> inhibitors.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This is because <strong>higher</strong> levels of <strong>dopamine</strong> are formed in CNS.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Medical treatment of Parkinson's disease</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Increase dopaminergic action</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Anti cholinergics</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Dopamine precursor</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Anti muscarinic </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Levodopa</td>\n<td>Benzhexol (trihexyphenidyl)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopa decarboxylase inhibitor </strong></td>\n<td>Benztropine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carbedopa</td>\n<td>Procyclidine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Benserazide</td>\n<td><strong>H1 antagonist </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine agonist-Ergot derivatives</strong></td>\n<td>Promethazine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bromocriptine</td>\n<td>Orphenadrine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cabergoline</td>\n<td>Diphenhydramine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pergolide</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lisuride</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine agonist-Non ergot&nbsp;derivatives</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ropinirole</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pramipexole</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rotigotine</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Apomorphine</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine facilitator </strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amantadine</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>MAO-B inhibitor </strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Selegiline</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rasagiline</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>COMT inhibitor </strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tolcapone</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entacapone</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
