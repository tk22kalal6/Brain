The diagnosis can be confirmed by <strong>gallium-68</strong> somatostatin receptor <strong>DOTATOC PET</strong> scan.</p>\n<p><strong>Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy </strong>shows increased activity in paragangliomas and is a useful technique for identifying extra-adrenal phaeochromocytomas. The compounds often used in molecular imaging with PET include <strong>68Ga-DOTATOC</strong>, <strong>68Ga-DOTATATE</strong>, and <strong>68Ga-DOTANOC</strong>. They bind to somatostatin receptors with varying affinity for different receptors.</p>\n<p>This investigation is useful in the diagnosis of new lesions in patients with or suspected neuroendocrine tumors. </p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>C11 methionine PET</strong> is a radiolabelled amino acid, and tumour uptake reflects cellular proliferation and microvessel density. It is used in the grading of brain tumors, differential diagnosis and identifying recurrence. </p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>18F-NaF PET</strong> uptake reflects blood flow and bone remodelling. It is used for imaging bone pathology by detecting primary and secondary bone tumours. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>99mTc pertechnetate</strong> is useful for thyroid nodules, and ectopic gastric mucosa.</p>\n<p>Note: The investigation of choice for adrenal phaeochromocytoma is contrast-enhanced MRI. </p>",
