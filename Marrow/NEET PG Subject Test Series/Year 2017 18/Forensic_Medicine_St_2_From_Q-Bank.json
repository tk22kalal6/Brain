In India, the law of criminal responsibility is under<strong> Sec 84 I.P.C.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>McNaughten&rsquo;s Rule was formed by the Judges of McNaughten&rsquo;s case, to clarify the common law of insanity in England during 1843. It is similar to IPC 84 which states &ldquo;Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who at the time of doing it by reason of unsoundness of mind is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.</li>\n<li><strong>Curren's rule</strong> of 1961 states that an accused person<strong> </strong>is not criminally responsible if, at the time of&nbsp;committing the act,<strong> </strong>he did not have the<strong> capacity </strong>to<strong> regulate</strong>&nbsp;his conduct to the requirements of the law,&nbsp;<strong>as a result of mental disease</strong>&nbsp;or defect.</li>\n<li><strong>Durham's rule</strong>&nbsp;of 1954 States that an accused person is&nbsp;not criminally responsible&nbsp;if&nbsp;his unlawful act&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<strong>product </strong>of<strong> mental disease</strong>&nbsp;or mental defect.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options -&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A: Criminal responsibility for voluntary intoxication - <span>An intoxicated person (voluntary intoxication) is criminally responsible if he had the intention or knowledge of committing a crime (<strong>Sec 86 IPC</strong>).</span></p>\n<p>Option B: Criminal responsibility for involuntary intoxication - <span>An act done by a person, who is incapable of knowing the nature of the act due to intoxication is not an offence, if the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will (<strong>Sec 85 IPC</strong>)</span></p>\n<p>Option D: Criminal responsibility of a child - <span>Any act which is done by a<strong> </strong>child under seven years of age is not an offence (<strong>Sec 82 IPC</strong>). A child between 7-12 years is presumed to be capable of committing an offence, if he attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion (<strong>Sec. 83 IPC</strong>).
