The tRNA molecules serve as adapters for the translation of the information in the sequence of nucleotides of the <strong>mRNA into specific amino acids.</strong></p>\n<p>There are at least <strong>20 species of tRNA molecules</strong> in every cell, atleast one (and often several) corresponding to <strong>each of the 20 amino acids </strong>required for protein synthesis. The primary structure—that is, the nucleotide sequence—of all tRNA molecules allows extensive folding and intra strand complementarity to generate a secondary structure that appears in two dimensions like a <strong>cloverleaf.</strong></p><p><strong>rRNA</strong></p>\n<p>A ribosome is a cytoplasmic nucleoprotein structure that acts as the machinery for the<strong> synthesis of proteins</strong> from the mRNA templates.On the ribosomes, the mRNA and tRNA molecules interact to translate the information transcribed from the gene during mRNA synthesis<strong> into a specific protein.</strong></p>\n<p>During periods of active protein synthesis, many ribosomes can be associated with any mRNA molecule to form an assembly called the <strong>polysome</strong>.Recent studies indicate that the large rRNA component performs the <strong>peptidyl transferase activity</strong> and thus is a <strong>ribozyme.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>mRNA</strong></p>\n<p>A <strong>messenger RNA (mRNA)</strong> is a single stranded RNA molecule that corresponds to the genetic sequence of a gene that is responsible for the synthesis of a protein molecule. </p>\n<p>Synthesized nucleotside-modified messenger RNA sequence can cause a cell to make a protein, which in turn could directly <strong>treat a disease or could function as a vaccine.</strong></p>",
