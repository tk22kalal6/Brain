It occurs due to infection with <strong>parainfluenza</strong> <strong>viruses</strong> <strong>commonly</strong>, but it may also be caused by influenza viruses type A or B, respiratory syncytial virus, or rhinovirus. Children aged <strong>6 months to 3 years</strong> are commonly affected. Infection results in subglottic and tracheal swelling causing stridor and other signs of respiratory obstruction.</p>\n<p>In infants and young children, the upper and lower airways are small, prone to occlusion by secretions, and susceptible to edema and swelling. As a result, the resistance to laminar airflow increases in inverse proportion to the fourth power of the radius (<strong>Poiseuille's law</strong>). Therefore, a small decrease in the radius of the airway results in a marked increase in resistance to airflow and the work of breathing.
