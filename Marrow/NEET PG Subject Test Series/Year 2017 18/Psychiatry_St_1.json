Though it points to an underlying medical condition, in reality, it arises due to&nbsp;<strong>psychological factors</strong>. The symptoms are&nbsp;<strong>not intentionally produced</strong>&nbsp;and the gain obtained is primarily psychological.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It can be associated with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and somatization disorders. Paralysis,&nbsp;<strong>blindness</strong>, and mutism are the most frequently seen conversion disorder symptoms. Anesthesia and paresthesia of the extremities, abnormal movements, and gait disturbance are the other features commonly seen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Somatic symptom disorder</strong>&nbsp;is characterized by the fear of having a serious illness based on the person's misinterpretation of bodily symptoms. The symptoms are persistent for&nbsp;<strong>over 6 months.&nbsp;</strong>It equally affects men and women and is commonly seen in the&nbsp;<strong>third decade</strong>&nbsp;of life. It is associated with&nbsp;<strong>poor insight.</strong>&nbsp;Patients believe that they have a serious disease that has not yet been detected and they can&shy;not be persuaded otherwise. Their convictions persist despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and reassurances from doctors.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Dysthymic&nbsp;disorder&nbsp;</strong>is the presence of a <strong>persistently depressed mood</strong> that lasts most of the day and is continuous. There are also feelings of guilt, irritability, and anger associated with it. These symptoms are present for <strong>at least 2 years</strong>.&nbsp;It is distinguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that patients mention that they have always been depressed.
