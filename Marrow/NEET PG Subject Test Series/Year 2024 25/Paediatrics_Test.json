It allows the fetus to receive oxygenated blood from the placenta as the lungs do not provide a gaseous exchange. This is due to the vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vessels that divert the blood away from the pulmonary circulation. The umbilical cord consists of 2 umbilical arteries and 1 umbilical vein along with blood vessels of the placenta. The structures unique to the fetus for circulation are <strong>ductus venosus</strong>, <strong>foramen ovale</strong>, and <strong>ductus arteriosus</strong>.</p>\n<p>Mechanism:</p>\n<p>About 50% of the oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein enters hepatic circulation. The rest of the oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein bypasses the liver and enters the IVC via the <strong>ductus venosus</strong>. </p>\n<p>The <strong>right atrium receives the oxygenated blood from the IVC </strong>(option A) and superior vena cava (less oxygenated). The right atrial pressure is more than the left atrial pressure resulting in the major flow of blood from the right atrium to the left atrium via the <strong>foramen ovale</strong>. The blood from the left atrium flows to the left ventricle. The upper part of the fetal body (coronaries, cerebral arteries, and upper extremities) is exclusively perfused by the left ventricle via the ascending aorta.</p>\n<p>Some oxygenated blood from the right atrium also enters the right ventricle which is ejected into the pulmonary artery. Only 5% of the right ventricular outflow enters the lung due to the high pressure from <strong>vasoconstriction </strong>of the <strong>pulmonary arteries</strong> (Option C).

The <strong>epidermal growth factor </strong>present in breast milk helps in intestinal cell maturation and repair. The other components present in breast milk are <strong>secretory IgA</strong>, transforming growth factor, nerve growth factor, platelet-activating factor, bifidus factor, and glutathione peroxidase. Breastmilk has <strong>high</strong> <strong>water content</strong> and infants who are exclusively breastfed need not be supplemented with water during their first few months of life. </p>\n<p>The protein content in breast milk is low compared to animal milk. <strong>Whey</strong> constitutes 70-80% of breast milk's protein content.

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario of excessive crying, lack of neck holding, constipation, and non-fusion of the posterior fontanelle suggests <strong>congenital hypothyroidism</strong>. Congenital hypothyroidism associated with <strong>genitourinary malformations</strong> is associated with a mutation in the <strong>PAX8 gene.</strong></p>\n<p>Non-goitrous hypothyroidism is known to be associated with TSHR, PAX8, and TSHB gene defects. </p>\n<p>Congenital hypothyroidism is the most common <strong>preventable</strong> cause of intellectual disability. Congenital hypothyroidism is mostly asymptomatic at birth and is detected mainly by the neonatal screening of TSH levels in the first few weeks of life. Clinical features present after maternal thyroxine wanes. <strong>Thyroid dysgenesis</strong> is considered the <strong>most common </strong>cause of congenital hypothyroidism in India.</p>\n<p>The clinical features of congenital hypothyroidism include a puffy face, <strong>enlarged fontanelles</strong>, macroglossia, prolonged jaundice, <strong>lethargy</strong>, and a history of poor feeding. The absence of distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphysis denotes the onset of congenital hypothyroidism. These epiphyses are normally present at birth. Epiphyseal dysgenesis, wherein there are multiple foci of ossification in the epiphyses, is common. X-rays of the skull reveal enlarged sella, large fontanelles, <strong>wide sutures</strong>, and intersutural (wormian) bones. </p>\n<p>Management: <strong>Thyroxine replacement</strong> is started immediately after diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism.  Thyroxine is initiated at 10-15 pg/kg/day. The thyroxine dose should be adjusted to achieve free T4 levels in the upper normal range for the age.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> BRCA mutation</strong> in <strong>breast cancer.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>p53 mutation</strong> in <strong>ovarian, colon,</strong> and many other cancers.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>KRAS mutation</strong> in <strong>adenocarcinoma</strong> colon.</p>",
