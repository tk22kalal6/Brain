A defect in the enzyme uridine-5′-monophosphate (UMP) synthase in the <strong>pyrimidine synthesis pathway</strong> results in the failure of conversion of <strong>orotic acid</strong> to <strong>uridine</strong>. As a result, there is increased excretion of orotic acid in urine.</p>\n<p>The condition is characterized by <strong>hypochromic megaloblastic anemia</strong> that is <strong>unresponsive to vitamin B12 and folic acid</strong>, growth retardation, and neurologic abnormalities.</p>\n<p>Treatment includes,<strong> the administration of uridine</strong> (100–200 mg/kg per day), which corrects anemia, reduces orotic acid excretion, and improves the other sequelae of the disorder.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Option A:</strong> <strong>Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase</strong> is responsible for the <strong>degradation</strong> of <strong>uracil and thymine</strong>. Deficiency of the enzyme causes excessive urinary excretion of uracil and thymine. Clinical features are nonspecific cerebral dysfunction with <strong>convulsive</strong> disorders, <strong>motor</strong> retardation, and <strong>mental</strong> retardation. There is no specific treatment available.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Pyrimidine 5′- nucleotidase</strong> catalyzes the <strong>removal</strong> of the<strong> phosphate group</strong> from pyrimidine ribonucleoside monophosphates (cytidine-5′-monophosphate or UMP). Deficiency of this enzyme causes <strong>hemolytic anemia</strong> with prominent basophilic stippling of erythrocytes. The accumulation of pyrimidines or cytidine diphosphate choline induces hemolysis. Acquired pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase deficiency is seen in <strong>lead poisoning</strong> and in <strong>thalassemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: Deficiency of <strong>xanthine oxidase</strong> causes <strong>hereditary xanthinuria</strong>.

In the urea cycle, the enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase catalyzes the <strong>condensation of carbamoyl phosphate with ornithine to form citrulline</strong>. The <strong>deficiency</strong> of this enzyme leads to the <strong>accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate</strong>. There is increased excretion of orotic acid in the urine due to the channeling of carbamoyl phosphate into <strong>pyrimidine synthesis</strong>. Levels of glutamine are elevated in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine as a result of enhanced glutamine synthesis in response to elevated levels of tissue ammonia.</p>\n<p>Clinical symptoms include vomiting, <strong>irritability</strong>, lethargy, and <strong>severe</strong> <strong>mental retardation</strong>. Infants appear normal at birth, but within days progressive <strong>lethargy</strong> sets in. Mild forms show episodes of hyperammonemia, manifested by vomiting and <strong>neurologic abnormalities</strong> (e.g., ataxia, mental confusion, agitation, combativeness, frank psychosis), which are separated by periods of wellness. These episodes usually occur after ingestion of a high-protein diet or as a result of a catabolic state such as infection. <strong>Hyperammonemic coma,</strong> cerebral edema, and <strong>death</strong> may occur during one of these attacks.</p>\n<p>The laboratory findings during the acute attack are hyperammonemia accompanied by marked elevations of <strong>plasma concentrations of glutamine and alanine</strong> with l<strong>ow levels of citrulline and arginine</strong>. The blood level of <strong>urea is usually low</strong>. There is a marked increase in the <strong>urinary excretion of orotic acid. </strong></p>\n<p>The diagnosis is confirmed by <strong>gene analysis.</strong></p>\n<p>Management includes treatment of acute hyperammonemia attacks. For enteral use, <strong>citrulline</strong> is used in place of arginine in patients with OTC deficiency. <strong>Liver transplantation </strong>is a successful treatment for patients with severe OTC deficiency. Long terms treatment consists of a <strong>protein-restricted diet.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p>Option A: Citrullinemia Type I also called classic citrullinemia occurs due to <strong>argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency.</strong> In citrullinemia type I the clinical features seen are due to hyperammonemia and the laboratory findings are similar to those found in patients with OTC deficiency(Type II hyperammonemia), except that the plasma citrulline concentration is markedly elevated.</p>\n<p>Option B: Citrullinemia Type II occurs due to a <strong>defect in the citrin transporter</strong> which is required for the transport of aspartate from mitochondria to cytoplasm. Aspartate is required for the conversion of citrulline to argininosuccinic acid. Deficiency of aspartate results in the accumulation of citrulline.</p>\n<p>Option D: Type 1 hyperammonemia occurs due to a <strong>deficiency of carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 </strong>enzyme.

The most likely pathway responsible for his condition is the <strong>polyol pathway</strong>.</p>\n<p>The polyol pathway involves the conversion of <strong>glucose to sorbitol</strong> by the enzyme <strong>aldose reductase</strong>. Under normal conditions, only a small amount of glucose is processed through this pathway. However, in <strong>chronic hyperglycemia</strong>, as seen in poorly controlled diabetes, the activity of aldose reductase is significantly increased. This leads to an excessive accumulation of sorbitol, especially in tissues that have low sorbitol dehydrogenase activity, such as the <strong>lens</strong> of the eye, <strong>retina, kidney, </strong>and<strong> peripheral nerves</strong>.</p>\n<p>Sorbitol, being an osmotically active substance, cannot easily diffuse across cell membranes and tends to accumulate within the cells. This accumulation causes <strong>osmotic stress</strong>, drawing water into the cells, leading to cellular swelling and damage. In the lens of the eye, this osmotic damage disrupts the normal structure and function of lens proteins, leading to the formation of cataracts. This is why diabetic patients with poorly controlled blood sugar levels are at a higher risk of developing cataracts, as well as other complications such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Galactokinase</strong> catalyzes the conversion of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to mild galactosemia, resulting in cataract formation due to the accumulation of galactitol in the lens of the eye. This condition is unrelated to diabetes mellitus and instead is seen in disorders of galactose metabolism such as galactokinase deficiency.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Aldolase B </strong>converts fructose-1-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde. Overactivity of this enzyme has not been linked to any specific pathological condition. Deficiency of aldolase B results in hereditary fructose intolerance, which is characterized by hypoglycemia and vomiting following the ingestion of fructose-containing foods. This condition does not lead to cataract formation and is unrelated to the metabolic pathways affected in diabetes.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Gluconeogenesis</strong> is the metabolic process by which glucose is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources, such as lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids. While this process is crucial for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting states, it is not directly involved in the formation of cataracts. Cataracts in diabetic patients are primarily due to the osmotic damage caused by the accumulation of sorbitol through the polyol pathway, not gluconeogenesis.</p>",
