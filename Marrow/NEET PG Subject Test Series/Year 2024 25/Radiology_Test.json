The truncus overrides the defect and receives blood from both the right and left ventricles.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8c3acc75aa994cc680debacb9a48410bx1280x1260.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Important radiological signs in cardiology</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Sign</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Condition</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Flask</strong> shaped/ Pear shaped/ <strong>Leather bottle </strong>shaped/ <strong>Money-bag</strong> shaped heart</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Pericardial effusion</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Boot shaped heart/ <strong>Coeur-en-sabot</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Fallot’s tetralogy</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Gooseneck sign</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Endocardial cushion defects</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Box-shaped heart</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Ebstein's anomaly</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Jug handle appearance</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Primary pulmonary artery hypertension</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>“3” like appearance of the aorta</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Coarctation of aorta</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Egg-on-string appearance</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Transposition of great vessels</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Egg in cup appearance, Pericardial calcification</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Constrictive pericarditis</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Snowman’s heart, Cottage loaf appearance, Figure of Eight appearance</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Scimitar</strong> sign</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Calcification in the heart wall</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Carcinoid syndrome</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Calcification of ascending aorta</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Atherosclerosis, Syphilis</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Hilar dance on fluoroscopy</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Atrial septal defect</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Batwing appearance</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Pulmonary edema</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Pruned tree appearance of the pulmonary vasculature</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Pulmonary artery hypertension</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Sitting duck sign of heart</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Persistent Truncus arteriosus</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<div> </div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Radiological findings in some congenital heart defects</h3><p><strong>Boot shaped heart - Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b8d455f894f24e8e9c147e7c3a178428x510x558.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Egg on string appearance - Transposition of Great Arteries (TGA)</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ad3fe6b6422548c8856299317c3e47c5x510x522.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Snowman's heart appearance or figure of 8 appearance</strong> -&nbsp;<strong>Supracardiac TAPVC</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c4d273d1af7445fdad02e659555c9e69x510x494.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Box Shaped Heart - Ebstein's Anomaly</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d07d5041004645849e8cce1dd37bd092x510x640.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification of congenital heart disease</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Acyanotic</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Cyanotic </strong>(5TE&sup2;VP)<strong><br /></strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Left to right shunts</strong>:</div>\n<p>Ventricular septal defect (VSD)</p>\n<p>Atrial septal defect (ASD)</p>\n<p>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)</p>\n<p><strong>Obstructive lesions</strong>:</p>\n<p>Coarctation of aorta</p>\n<p>Infundibular stenosis</p>\n<p>Pulmonary valve stenosis</p>\n<p>Congenital mitral &amp;
