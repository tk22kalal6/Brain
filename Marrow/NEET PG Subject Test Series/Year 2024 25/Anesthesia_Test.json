To prevent rebreathing, <strong>BC systems</strong> require a <strong>higher rate</strong> of fresh gas <strong>inflow</strong> than DEF systems. This is because of the <strong>pop-off valve</strong> present near the fresh gas inflow in <strong>BC systems</strong>. A significant amount of <strong>fresh gas </strong>gets<strong> vented out</strong> through this valve at the end of expiration. In DEF systems, fresh gas flow pushes the exhaled alveolar gas away from the patient and thus reduces rebreathing of CO2.</p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\">For Mapleson A circuits, in <strong>controlled ventilation</strong>, significant rebreathing of CO<sub>2</sub><sub> </sub>occurs. To prevent this, a very high fresh gas inflow (&gt;20 L/min) is required for Mapleson A. The pop-off valve vents out a significant amount of fresh gas during the inspiratory phase. Thus, Mapleson A has the <strong>worst efficiency</strong> in controlled ventilation.</p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\">During <strong>spontaneous breathing</strong>, Mapleson A has the <strong>best efficiency</strong>. During spontaneous ventilation, exhaled alveolar gas is vented through the pop-off during expiration.

The low blood-gas partition coefficient, blood-brain coefficient, and minimal airway irritation of sevoflurane promote rapid induction and rapid recovery. Desflurane is also associated with faster recovery but its irritant effect on the upper airway with risk of laryngospasm prevents its use as an induction agent.</p>\n<p><strong>Rocuronium</strong> is an intermediate-acting muscle relaxant with a <strong>rapid onset</strong> which is used in <strong>daycare</strong> anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and provide surgical relaxation.

Ketamine indirectly <strong>stimulates</strong> the <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>&nbsp;and is thus useful in this patient as he has come with a traumatic injury to the abdomen and is <strong>hemodynamically unstable</strong>.</p>\n<p>Ketamine is a <strong>phencyclidine</strong> derivative that inhibits <strong>NMDA&nbsp;</strong>(N-methyl-D-aspartate) <strong>receptors</strong> resulting in a decrease in excitatory stimulation by glutamate in the brain.&nbsp;It is a strong <strong>analgesic</strong> and <strong>amnestic </strong>agent.&nbsp;It also causes <strong>dissociative anesthesia</strong>.</p>\n<p>On the cardiovascular system, it directly has a cardio-depressive effect and <strong>indirectly</strong> stimulates it by activating the <strong>sympathetic system&nbsp;</strong>and inhibiting the vagus nerve.&nbsp;It <strong>predominantly</strong> shows a <strong>stimulatory</strong> effect hence causing tachycardia, increased cardiac output, and <strong>increased</strong> systemic and pulmonary <strong>hypertension</strong>.</p>\n<p>On the respiratory system, it has a <strong>bronchodilator</strong> effect on bronchial smooth muscles. It increases salivary secretion and bronchial secretion.&nbsp;It also acts on other systems and increases the intracranial and intraocular pressures.</p>\n<p>Uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ketamine is the <strong>intravenous agent of choice</strong> for patients with <strong>shock</strong>, <strong>low cardiac output states,</strong> and <strong>reactive airway diseases.</strong></li>\n<li>It is also used in patients with congenital heart diseases, especially with&nbsp;<strong>right-to-left shunts</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Perioperative analgesia</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ketamine should be <strong>avoided</strong> in patients with a history of seizures, psychiatric illness, or vascular aneurysms. It is also contraindicated in open eye injuries and eye surgeries</p>\n<p>Adverse effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hallucination</strong> is the most common side effect of ketamine.</li>\n<li><strong>Emergence reaction</strong> (vivid dreaming, illusion, etc)</li>\n<li>Increases brain oxygen consumption and metabolic rate leading to increased intracranial tension.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Propofol</strong> is the most commonly used parenteral anesthetic. It is cerebro-protective by decreasing cerebral metabolic rate. It produces dose-dependent hypotension.</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Thiopentone</strong> belongs to the barbiturate group. It is cerebro-protective and is an anticonvulsant. It leads to <strong>hypotension</strong> due to vasodilation. It is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in&nbsp;patients with obstructive airway disease, severe <strong>cardiovascular instability,</strong> and shock, history of porphyrias.</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Midazolam</strong> is a benzodiazepine. It is used in treating seizures and is used in daycare surgeries as an induction agent due to its short half-life.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: A list of anaesthetics and their physiological effects</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Condition</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Anesthetics</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Increased Intracranial tension (ICT)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sevoflurane</p>\n<p>Desflurane</p>\n<p>Isoflurane</p>\n<p>Enflurane</p>\n<p>Methoxiflurane</p>\n<p>Halothane</p>\n<p>Ketamine</p>\n<p>Nitrous Oxide (N2O)</p>\n<p>Succinyl-choline</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Decreased ICT</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Barbiturates (e.g.thiopentone)</p>\n<p>Benzodiazepines</p>\n<p>Cyclopropane</p>\n<p>Droperidol</p>\n<p>Etomidate</p>\n<p>Lidocaine</p>\n<p>Propofol</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Increased Intraocular pressure (IOP)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Barbiturates (e.g. thiopentone)</p>\n<p>Cyclopropane</p>\n<p>Etomidate</p>\n<p>Succinyl Choline</p>\n<p>Ketamine</p>\n<p>N2O</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Decreased IOP</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Morphine</p>\n<p>Halothane</p>\n<p>Hexamethonium</p>\n<p>Trimethaphan</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Increased Blood pressure</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ketamine</p>\n<p>Pentazocin</p>\n<p>Pancuronium</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Bronchodilation (preferred in asthamatics)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ketamine (most potent)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sevofluorane</p>\n<p>Halothane&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Promethazine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Bronchospasmodics (contraindicated in asthamatics)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>d-TC</p>\n<p>N2O</p>\n<p>Thiopentone</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
