However, the patient <strong>need</strong> <strong>not</strong> <strong>prove</strong> any negligence <strong>under Res ipsa loquitur.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>conditions</strong> to be <strong>fulfilled</strong> for Res Ipsa Loquitur are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The injury or <strong>damage</strong> would <strong>not</strong> have <strong>occurred</strong> <strong>without negligence</strong></li>\n<li>The <strong>doctor is in exclusive control</strong> of the instrumentation or <strong>circumstances</strong></li>\n<li>The <strong>patient must not</strong> <strong>contribute</strong> to his own injury or <strong>damage</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several situations can be used as defences by the doctor against medical negligence. This includes no duty owed to the plaintiff/ patient, the doctor's duty has been discharged according to prevailing standards, a scenario of misadventure<strong> </strong>that may be therapeutic, diagnostic, and experimental, or an error of judgment.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Res judicata </strong>- <strong>BNSS Section 337</strong> <strong>(CrPC 300) </strong>states that if a question of negligence against a doctor has already been decided by a court in a dispute between the doctor and his patient, the patient will not be allowed to contest the same question.</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Limitation</strong> or <strong>Res indicata</strong> indicates that a suit for damages for negligence should be filed against the doctor <strong>within two years</strong> from the date of alleged negligence. A suit <strong>filed after two years</strong> will be<strong> dismissed</strong>. But, where a breach of duty to provide care as per a particular contract between a patient and a doctor is committed, legal action can be initiated <strong>up to three years</strong> from the date of alleged negligence.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Novus Actus Interveniens</strong> is a situation where the cause of disability or death passes from the doctor to a later negligent action of some other person. It means a person is responsible not only for his actions but also for the logical consequences of those actions. For a plea of Novus actus, an element of negligence is absolutely essential.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Contributory negligence</h3><p><strong>Contributory negligence</strong> occurs when a <strong>patient</strong> or his <strong>personal attendant</strong> shows unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care, which when combined with the negligence of the doctor, has contributed to the injury. In this case, the patient&rsquo;s or attendant&rsquo;s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.</p>\n<p>So, contributory negligence occurs when <strong>both the doctor and patient are negligent</strong>. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient&rsquo;s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the<strong> patient:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.</li>\n<li>Fails to follow the doctor&rsquo;s instructions</li>\n<li>Refuses to take the treatment</li>\n<li>Leaves the hospital against doctor&rsquo;s advice</li>\n<li>Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contributory negligence is a defence </strong>for doctor&rsquo;s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the <strong>doctrine of comparative negligence</strong>, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>no</strong> <strong>proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is negligent</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<strong>Last clear chance doctrine: </strong>It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>gave proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (<strong>There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

It estimates the <strong>chloride content </strong>of<strong> blood </strong>from <strong>both sides of the heart</strong>.</p>\n<p>Normally, chloride content is equal in the right and left chambers of the heart (approx. 600 mg/100 ml). In<strong> freshwater drowning</strong>, due to <strong>hemodilution</strong>, the chloride content is<strong> decreased on the left side o</strong>f the heart by<strong> 50%</strong>.<strong> </strong>In<strong> saltwater drowning</strong> due to <strong>hemoconcentration</strong>, the chloride content is<strong> increased </strong>in the<strong> left side </strong>of the heart by <strong>30-40%</strong>.</p>\n<p>This test is said to be <strong>negative </strong>in<strong> post-mortem drowning</strong>. </p>\n<p>Limitations of the test:</p>\n<p>No value in atypical drowning, or congenital cardiac defects, if the drowning medium contains the same amount of chloride. There is a progressive loss of chlorine from blood after death. Therefore, the test has to be made within a reasonably short time after death.</p><p><strong>Drowning:</strong></p>\n<p>Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid. <strong>Accidental drowning is the most common</strong> form of drowning, seen among fishermen, bathers, dock workers, intoxicated, and epileptics.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong></p>\n<p>In cases of seawater drowning, <strong>hypernatremia</strong> and <strong>myocardial anoxia</strong> are seen. Seawater being <strong>hypertonic</strong> to plasma causes a shift of fluid from the blood to alveoli causing pulmonary edema. There is a net decrease in blood volume causing <strong>hemoconcentration</strong> and a fall in blood pressure.</p>\n<p>This hemoconcentration in seawater drowning causes increased viscosity of blood and <strong>myocardial anoxia </strong>leading to heart failure. Hyperkalemia is not seen in seawater drowning because RBCs get shrunken in contrast to freshwater drowning.</p>\n<p><strong>Freshwater is hypotonic</strong> to plasma and is rapidly absorbed from the alveoli into the RBCs resulting in <strong>hemodilution</strong> and <strong>hyponatremia</strong>. The RBCs finally swell up and lyse resulting in the release of intracellular potassium causing <strong>hyperkalemia</strong>. Increased intravascular blood volume combined with hyperkalemia causes <strong>arrhythmia</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Autopsy findings in drowning:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Froth in the air passages</strong> - The most useful autopsy sign in drowning.
