It is a disposal technique used for <strong>expired</strong> and <strong>discarded medicines</strong> along with <strong>chemical wastes</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Human anatomical waste</strong> such as an <strong>aborted fetus </strong>is put in a <strong>yellow bag </strong>and is disposed of by either <strong>incineration, plasma pyrolysis,</strong> or <strong>deep burial</strong>. </p>\n<p>The biomedical waste management rule is applicable to all those who collect, receive, store, dispose and treat biomedical waste. The wastes are categorised and segregated at the point of generation of waste. A color<strong> coding system</strong> with <strong>4 colors</strong> namely yellow, red, white, and blue is used for waste segregation. </p>\n<p>The segregated waste is then disposed of by various methods. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Incineration </strong>- this is a dry oxidation process done using high temperatures. The types are rotary kiln, pyrolytic incinerator, and single chamber incinerator.  </li>\n<li><strong>Chemical disinfection </strong>- chemicals are added to waste to kill or inactivate the microorganisms. Mostly used for treating liquid wastes. </li>\n<li><strong>Wet and dry thermal treatment</strong> - shredded infectious waste is exposed to high temperature, high-pressure steam and it resembles an autoclave sterilization process. </li>\n<li><strong>Microwave irradiation </strong>-<strong> </strong>microorganisms are killed using high-frequency microwaves. Its efficiency should be checked routinely. </li>\n<li><strong>Land disposal </strong>- either<strong> </strong>municipal<strong> </strong>disposal sites or sanitary landfills are used. </li>\n<li><strong>Inertization </strong>- waste<strong> </strong>is mixed with cement and other substances before disposal to reduce toxicity. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disposal by <strong>deep burial</strong> is permitted only in rural areas which lack common bio-medical treatment facilities.

This toxin is <strong>water soluble</strong>. The dal must be consumed in large quantities for a period of 2-3 months before the toxin starts having any clinical effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term consumption</strong> of khesari dal leads to <strong>neurolathyrism</strong>. It is characterized by <strong>gradual spastic paralysis</strong> of the lower limbs. The patient is initially able to walk with short jerky steps without any aids, but the progressive spastic paralysis causes a crossed gait, and the patient has to use sticks to maintain his balance. Eventually, the knee joints are unable to support the weight of the body and the patient cannot stand erect at all.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 710\">The <strong>interventions </strong>that can be used <strong>to prevent lathyrism</strong> include:</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page\" title=\"Page 710\"><strong>Vitamin C prophylaxis&nbsp;</strong>(option A)</li>\n<li class=\"page\" title=\"Page 710\"><strong>Limiting the proportion of the dal</strong> to less than a quarter of the total cereals and pulses consumed in a day (option D)</li>\n<li class=\"page\" title=\"Page 710\">Removal of the toxin by:\n<ul>\n<li class=\"page\" title=\"Page 710\"><strong>Parboiling</strong>: this involves soaking the dal in limewater overnight and then boiling it (option C).</li>\n<li class=\"page\" title=\"Page 710\"><strong>Steeping method</strong>: this involves soaking the dal in hot water for a period of 2 hours.
