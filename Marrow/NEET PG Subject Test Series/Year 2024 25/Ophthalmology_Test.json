It is usually seen after <strong>blunt trauma</strong> to the eye and orbit. It usually has about the same diameter as the contracted pupil. The force of the blow drives the cornea and iris backwards, thus producing an impression of the iris on the lens as shown below.

It is caused by leakage of <strong>lipoproteins</strong> (phospholipids and cholesterol) from limbal capillaries into the corneal stroma. Characteristically it is separated from the margin by a narrow zone of comparatively clear cornea. It is the most common peripheral corneal opacity and is usually found in the <strong>elderly</strong> where it is considered a benign condition.

An intravenous loading dose of 200 mg hydrocortisone or 500 mg methylprednisolone administered slowly over one hour is recommended. It is followed by high doses of oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) given daily for the first week.

It is most often caused due to an embolus from an atherosclerotic plaque.

Although it is associated with vasculitides like giant cell arteritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, it doesn't affect the fundus.
