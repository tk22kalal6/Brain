It mostly spreads via the <strong>haematogenous route</strong>. Lymphatic spread is also seen sometimes. It can rarely spread by direct contact with the affected intraabdominal organs or peritoneum. </p>\n<p>The <strong>fallopian tubes</strong> are the <strong>most common site</strong> to be <strong>affected</strong>. The disease subsequently spreads to other genital organs and the peritoneum. The endometrium is involved in 60% of cases. The infection is from the tubes either by <strong>lymphatics</strong> or by<strong> direct spread</strong> through continuity. <strong>Cornual ends</strong> are commonly affected due to their <strong>dual blood supply</strong>, as well as their anatomical proximity to tubes. </p>\n<p>Investigations:</p>\n<p>1<strong>. Complete blood count</strong>, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (<strong>ESR</strong>), enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (<strong>ELISA</strong>) tests - lgG and IgM, and <strong>Mantoux</strong> <strong>tests </strong>are done to evaluate the case of genital tuberculosis. The nucleic acid amplification technique (<strong>NAAT</strong>) can detect tuberculosis within a few hours compared to culture.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>2.

The endometrial scrapings are used for histopathology, PCR testing, and AFB smear and culture. </p>\n<p>4. <strong>Laparoscopy:</strong> Diagnostic laparoscopy is widely used to establish the diagnosis of genital tuberculosis/ abdominal pelvic tuberculosis.

It is found in <strong>ectopic</strong> sites such as the ovary, pouch of Douglas, uterosacral ligaments, appendix, pelvic lymph nodes, lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) scar endometriosis, umbilicus, and lung.</p>\n<p>Endometriosis can present as blue or red powdered burned lesions on the cervix or posterior vaginal fornix, scarring around the tissue (<strong>puckered look</strong>). Other features include <strong>chocolate cysts</strong> causing left/right lower quadrant pain, pain during defecation, chronic pelvic pain and infertility, right lower quadrant pain, and cyclical hemoptysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Laparoscopy</strong> is the gold standard modality for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. 'Powder-burn' - puckered black spots, red vascular, bluish, blackish cysts, chocolate cysts, and dense adhesions in the pelvis, as well as yellow-brown peritoneal fluid, can be seen on laparoscopy.</p>\n<p>For <strong>minimal disease </strong>medical management with <strong>NSAIDs and oral contraceptive pills</strong> are given if associated menstrual complaints are present. OCPs inhibit gonadotropin release and decrease the menstrual flow. For <strong>moderate</strong> to <strong>severe</strong> diseases oral <strong>progestogens, </strong><strong>GnRH agonists or danazol </strong>that antagonize estrogenic effects on the endometrium causing endometrial atrophy are used.</p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><strong>Surgery</strong> is preferred in <strong>infertile women</strong> because hormonal treatment would delay pregnancy. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Endometrial deposits are destroyed by electrocautery/laser and resection of endometrioma can be done. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) to control pain .T</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">otal hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy is a definitive and most effective therapy for women with endometriosis who do not wish to retain fertility.<br /></span></p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease</strong> (PID) closely mimics endometriosis in its symptoms and signs. Both conditions produce pelvic pain, congestive dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and sterility. The uterus is retroverted and fixed. But in chronic PID, thickened and slightly tender fornices or a tubo-ovarian mass is noted and speculum finding as seen in the patient described above is not seen in chronic PID.</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Rectocele</strong> is a form of genital prolapse seen frequently in menopausal women, especially those with a history of pelvic floor injury or multiparity. Patients present with varying degrees of prolapsed mass per rectum that needs splinting for a satisfactory bowel movement. </p>\n<p> Option C - <strong>Adenomyosis</strong>, a condition seen frequently in elderly women (Aged&gt; 40 years), is characterized by endometrial islands in the wall of the uterus, leading to a symmetrically enlarged uterus (not more than 14 weeks size). Usual presenting features include menorrhagia and progressively increasing dysmenorrhea.

      "solution": "<p>The correct answer is <strong>2 and 3.</strong></p>\n<p>The test described is the <strong>Whiff test</strong>, which is <strong>positive</strong> in <strong>Trichomonas vaginalis</strong> infections and <strong>bacterial vaginosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>whiff test</strong> is performed by the addition of 10 percent <strong>potassium hydroxide</strong> (KOH) to a fresh sample of vaginal secretions. In a positive test, it releases volatile amines that have a <strong>fishy odo</strong>r. With bacterial vaginosis, the <strong>vaginal pH is &gt; 4.5</strong>, as a result of diminished acid production by bacteria. Trichomonas vaginalis infection is also associated with <strong>anaerobic overgrowth</strong> and the production of amines. Thus, women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis should have no microscopic evidence of trichomoniasis.</p><p><strong>Bacterial vaginosis</strong> is caused by an alteration in the normal vaginal flora, where a decrease in the number of lactobacilli leads to an increase in the number of other organisms like Hemophilus vaginalis, Gardnerella, Mobiluncus, and Mycoplasma hominis. It is diagnosed using Amsel's criteria, where <strong>at</strong> <strong>least three</strong> of the four following criteria should be present to confirm the diagnosis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homogenous vaginal discharge</li>\n<li>Vaginal pH &gt; 4.5</li>\n<li>Amine like odor on adding KOH (Whiff test positive)</li>\n<li>Clue cells (&gt;20% of cells)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The presence of both clue cells and a positive Whiff test result is pathognomonic of bacterial vaginosis, even if asymptomatic. It is treated with 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 7 days.</p>\n<p><strong>Trichomonas vaginalis</strong> is an infection of the female genital tract with the Trichomonas vaginalis protozoan. It characteristically causes a copious, frothy, offensive yellow-green discharge with vaginal soreness or irritation and urinary frequency. On examination, the vagina looks red and inflamed. The inflamed <strong>cervix looks like a strawberry</strong> with punctate hemorrhagic spots.</p>\n<p>It is treated with metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose (Standard treatment) or tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Vaginal infections</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Bacterial vaginosis</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Trichomonas vaginitis</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Candidal vaginitis</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Causative organism&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Altered vaginal flora- increased concentration of <strong><em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em></strong></td>\n<td><strong><em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em></strong></td>\n<td><strong><em>Candida albicans</em></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aetiology</td>\n<td>Increased vaginal pH</td>\n<td>Sexually transmitted</td>\n<td>Decreased immunity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sexual transmission</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Discharge</td>\n<td>Fishy, thin, yellow</td>\n<td>Frothy, green</td>\n<td>Curdy, white</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Symptoms</td>\n<td>Fishy odour, no itching</td>\n<td>Itching and burning</td>\n<td>Itching, burning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pH</td>\n<td>&gt;4.5</td>\n<td>&gt;4.5</td>\n<td>&lt;4.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Speculum</td>\n<td>No vaginal epithelium inflammation</td>\n<td>Strawberry cervix</td>\n<td>Inflamed-epithelium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>KOH</td>\n<td>Positive Whiff test</td>\n<td>The whiff test can be positive.</td>\n<td>Pseudohyphae seen.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wet mount</td>\n<td>Clue cells.

However, <strong>MR</strong> <strong>imaging</strong> is necessary to define the external or fundal contour.</p>\n<p>A <strong>septate uterus</strong> is characterized by the presence of a <strong>septum in the endometrial cavity </strong>due to the failure of the medial segments of the Müllerian ducts to regress. This creates a permanent septum within the uterine cavity. The septum can project partially from the fundus or can extend completely to the cervical os.
