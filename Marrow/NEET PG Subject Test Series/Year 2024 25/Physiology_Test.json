      "solution": "<p>The correct statement is that the <strong>lung volume</strong> at a given pressure is <strong>higher</strong> during <strong>expiration</strong> than inspiration which is explained by the <strong>hysteresis phenomenon.</strong></p>\n<p>The hysteresis curve demonstrates the difference between the <strong>transpulmonary pressure </strong>of <strong>inspiration </strong>and<strong> expiration</strong>. This difference is mainly due to the presence of surfactant, which forms an <strong>air-fluid interface</strong> in the alveoli, thereby <strong>reducing the surface tension (Option D). </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Transpulmonary pressure = Alveolar pressure - intrapleural pressure</strong></p><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/1e32f6c087c845e79e95f8cffc602769.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>The graph below shows the <strong>variation</strong> in <strong>lung volume</strong> and <strong>pressure</strong> during the respiratory cycle. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/18a7e25acb484a4d8f5d5b4be26a63a8x1280x1877.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Pleural pressure </strong>is the <strong>pressure</strong> in the thin space between the<strong> inner and outer pleural layers</strong>. This pressure is <strong>slightly negative</strong>, providing a little suction. At the beginning of inspiration in the graph, it is -5 cm H2O, which is just enough to keep the lungs open in a resting state. During <strong>inspiration</strong>, more suction pressure is required to draw air into the lungs, so the <strong>pleural pressure decreases</strong> to -7.5 cm H2O. This change in pressure is enough to draw in a tidal volume of 500 ml. It returns to <strong>baseline during expiration.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Alveolar pressure</strong> is the pressure of the <strong>air </strong>present in the <strong>alveoli</strong>. At rest, with the glottis open, the <strong>alveolar pressure equals</strong> the<strong> atmospheric pressure </strong>(zero reference pressure in airways), 0 cm H2O. <strong>During inspiration</strong>, it <strong>decreases to -1 cm H2O</strong> and draws in<strong> 500 ml of tidal volume</strong> <strong>(Option A)</strong>. <strong>During expiration</strong>, it i<strong>ncreases to +1 cm H2O</strong> and pushes out 500 ml of air. So alveolar pressure exceeds the atmospheric pressure during expiration <strong>(Option C) </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Transpulmonary pressure</strong> is the difference between alveolar pressure and pleural pressure. It is also called <strong>recoil pressure</strong>, as it is a measure of the elastic forces that tend to collapse the lungs. It is <strong>always positive</strong> in normal breathing. <strong>During inspiration</strong>, there is an <strong>increase in transpulmonary pressure </strong>as a result of which inflation of the lungs occurs. <strong>During expiration</strong>, <strong>intrapleural pressure</strong> becomes <strong>less nega­tive</strong> which <strong>decreases the transpulmonary</strong> pressure leading to a reduction in lung volume.</p>",

The primary visual cortex lies in the <strong>calcarine fissure area</strong> and the visual pathway terminates here. It has six major layers histologically which helps in binocular vision. The primary visual cortex is also called visual area I or the striate cortex because this area has a grossly <strong>striated appearance</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Bilateral</strong> damage to <strong>Areas 18</strong> and <strong>19</strong> can lead to a condition known as <strong>visual agnosia,</strong> where the patient can see objects but <strong>cannot recognize</strong> or <strong>identify</strong> them. While this could explain the inability to identify objects, it does not account for the patient's <strong>overall inability</strong> to <strong>see. Confabulation</strong> might occur in <strong>visual agnosia,</strong> but the normal optic disc combined with an inability to see altogether points more toward cortical blindness, which is associated with <strong>bilateral damage</strong> to <strong>Area 17.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Damage</strong> to the <strong>right-sided</strong> Area 17 (unilateral damage) typically affects the visual processing of the left visual field, leading to visual field defects such as left homonymous hemianopia. However, it would not result in <strong>complete blindness</strong> or the <strong>inability</strong> to <strong>recognize objects,</strong> as the left Area 17 would still be functional. The patient's symptoms of being unable to see and confabulating to cover up the inability to identify objects suggest a more widespread issue, consistent with bilateral rather than unilateral damage.</p>\n<p>Option D: Areas 18 and 19 are involved in higher-order visual processing, integrating visual information to help recognize and interpret objects, form, and movement. Damage to the right-sided Areas 18 and 19 could impair specific aspects of visual processing, such as <strong>object recognition</strong> or <strong>spatial orientation,</strong> particularly in the left visual field. However, such damage would not typically result in complete <strong>blindness</strong> or the <strong>global inability</strong> to <strong>identify objects.</strong> Instead, it would likely result in <strong>visual agnosia</strong> for objects in the left visual field, but not total visual impairment or confabulation to the extent described in the patient’s case.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Inhibin</strong> synthesized by <strong>Sertoli cells</strong> inhibits the release of FSH from the anterior pituitary.</p>\n<p>The <strong>male hypothalamic-pituitary</strong> axis is regulated by negative feedback through two mechanisms. First, <strong>testosterone inhibits</strong> the secretion of <strong>GnRH from the hypothalamus</strong> and <strong>LH from the anterior pituitary,</strong> reducing the frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses. Second, <strong>Sertoli cells</strong> produce <strong>inhibin,</strong> a glycoprotein that inhibits FSH secretion by the anterior pituitary. Thus, Sertoli cells regulate spermatogenesis by producing inhibin, which acts as a marker of spermatogenic activity.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B and C: <strong>Testosterone</strong> is aromatized in the ovaries in women. Additionally, it only i<strong>nhibits the release of LH from the anterior pituitary not FSH.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Tight junctions</strong> between adjacent Sertoli cells near the basal lamina form a <strong>blood-testis barrier</strong> that prevents many large molecules from passing from the interstitial tissue. However, this has no role to play in the inhibition of FSH secretion.</p>",
