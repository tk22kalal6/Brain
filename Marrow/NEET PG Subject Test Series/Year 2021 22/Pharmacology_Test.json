Through this mechanism, theophylline enhances<strong> </strong>the anti-inflammatory<strong> </strong>effects of corticosteroids.</p>\n<p>Theophylline is a methylxanthine drug used in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Its other mechanisms of action are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inhibits<strong> </strong>phosphodiesterase<strong> </strong>non-selectively, (<strong>PDE3, </strong>PDE4, and PDE5) thereby, increasing cellular cAMP and cGMP, causing bronchodilation</li>\n<li>Adenosine causes bronchoconstriction by releasing histamine and leukotrienes. Theophylline antagonizes adenosine<strong> </strong>receptors causing bronchodilation</li>\n<li>Increases <strong>IL-10 release</strong>, which has an anti-inflammatory effect</li>\n<li>Decreases gene transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines</li>\n<li>Promotes apoptosis of granulocytes, reducing the inflammatory load in the airways</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theophylline is mainly metabolized by the enzyme CYP1A2 enzyme.<strong> </strong>Various <strong>drug interactions </strong>of theophylline include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased clearance (CYP1A2 enzyme induction) by smoking, phenytoin, <strong>rifampicin</strong>, and phenobarbitone.</li>\n<li>Decreased clearance (CYP1A2 enzyme inhibition) by <strong>erythromycin</strong>, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, <strong>oral contraceptives</strong>, and allopurinol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important side effects of this drug due to PDE4 antagonism are nausea, vomiting, and <strong>gastric discomfort</strong>, and those due to adenosine A1 receptor antagonism are diuresis, <strong>cardiac arrhythmias</strong>, and seizures. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: PDE inhibitors</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>PDE inhibitors</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Drugs</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Clinical application</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Non-selective PDE inhibitors</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Methylated xanthines, Caffeine, Theophylline</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Asthma, COPD</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Pentoxifylline</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Peripheral artery disease &nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>PDE 2 inhibitor</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Anagrelide</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Essential thrombocytosis</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>PDE 3 inhibitor</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Cilostazol</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Peripheral artery disease</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Milrinone, Amrinone</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Cardiac failure&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>PDE 4 inhibitor</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Roflumilast</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>COPD</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Drotaverine</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Antispasmodic drug</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>PDE 5 inhibitor</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Sildenafil, Vardenafil, Tadalafil (Also inhibit PDE6)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Erectile dysfunction Pulmonary hypertension</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Drugs which need Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)</h3><p>Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index require therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).</p>\n<p>The mnemonic \"<strong>DATLAAT MC</strong>\" can be used.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>D</strong>: Digoxin</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>: Anti-arrhythmic</li>\n<li><strong>T</strong>: Theophylline</li>\n<li><strong>L</strong>: Lithium</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>: Aminoglycosides</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>: Anti-epileptics</li>\n<li><strong>T</strong>: Tricyclic antidepressants</li>\n<li><strong>M</strong>: Methotrexate</li>\n<li><strong>C</strong>: Calcineurin inhibitors</li>\n</ul>",

Therefore, they only <strong>inhibit </strong>the<strong> conversion of levodopa</strong> into dopamine in the<strong> periphery</strong> and <strong>not in the brain</strong>. This leads to the increased plasma half-life of levodopa, and therefore, lower doses of levodopa can be prescribed.</p>\n<p>Benefits of combination therapy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This therapy inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in the periphery, leading to <strong>increased plasma half-life</strong> of levodopa.</li>\n<li>Combination therapy reduces adverse effects like gastrointestinal side effects, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.</li>\n<li>This therapy allows for increased availability of levodopa in the brain.</li>\n<li>Fluctuation in motor control, where the patient is alternately well and disabled, occurs on prolonged therapy with levodopa. This type of \"<strong>on-off</strong>\" effect is <strong>reduced</strong> in combination therapy because of sustained dopamine levels in the brain.</li>\n<li><strong>Pyridoxine</strong> enhances the peripheral metabolism of levodopa. Hence, combination therapy with carbidopa nullifies the interaction of pyridoxine with levodopa metabolism.</li>\n<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>A<strong> higher&nbsp;degree of improvement</strong> is seen&nbsp;in combination therapy than in monotherapy with levodopa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Demerits of combination therapy:</p>\n<p>This therapy decreases the concentration of levodopa in the periphery, but increases the concentration of levodopa reaching the brain.<strong> Involuntary movements </strong>and <strong>behavioral adverse effects</strong> like confusion, hallucinations,&nbsp;nightmares, and delusions are <strong>not reduced </strong>after the addition of carbidopa<strong>. </strong>In fact, they are <strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;in patients who are taking levodopa <strong>with peripheral carboxylase</strong> inhibitors.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This is because <strong>higher</strong> levels of <strong>dopamine</strong> are formed in CNS.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Medical treatment of Parkinson's disease</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Increase dopaminergic action</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Anti cholinergics</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Dopamine precursor</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Anti muscarinic </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Levodopa</td>\n<td>Benzhexol (trihexyphenidyl)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopa decarboxylase inhibitor </strong></td>\n<td>Benztropine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carbedopa</td>\n<td>Procyclidine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Benserazide</td>\n<td><strong>H1 antagonist </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine agonist-Ergot derivatives</strong></td>\n<td>Promethazine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bromocriptine</td>\n<td>Orphenadrine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cabergoline</td>\n<td>Diphenhydramine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pergolide</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lisuride</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine agonist-Non ergot&nbsp;derivatives</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ropinirole</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pramipexole</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rotigotine</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Apomorphine</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine facilitator </strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amantadine</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>MAO-B inhibitor </strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Selegiline</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rasagiline</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>COMT inhibitor </strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tolcapone</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entacapone</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
