      "solution": "<p><strong>Primordial prevention</strong> is adopted in this scenario.</p>\n<p>The emergence of <strong>risk factors</strong> for <strong>obesity</strong> is prevented by encouraging the child to follow a <strong>healthy lifestyle</strong> from an early age. This reduces the probability of developing obesity in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Primordial prevention</strong> is the prevention of the <strong>emergence</strong>&nbsp;of <strong>risk factors</strong> in populations in which they have not yet appeared. Most adult health problems have their origins in childhood.&nbsp;Efforts are directed toward discouraging children from adopting harmful lifestyles. The <strong>main intervention</strong> in <strong>primordial prevention</strong> is by<strong> individual</strong> and<strong> mass education</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong>&nbsp;Primary prevention</strong> is the action taken <strong>before</strong>&nbsp;the <strong>onset </strong>of the<strong> disease</strong>. This removes the possibility of the occurrence of a disease.&nbsp;Here,<strong> intervention</strong> is initiated in the<strong> pre-pathogenesis phase</strong> of a disease. It is accomplished by&nbsp;<strong>population strategy</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>high-risk strategy</strong>.&nbsp;Examples of primary prevention are immunization and sanitizing hands.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Secondary prevention</strong> is<strong> halting&nbsp;</strong>the progress of a&nbsp;<strong>disease </strong>at its <strong>incipient stage </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>preventing complications. <strong>Intervention</strong> is initiated in the<strong> early pathogenesis phase</strong>. Measures like <strong>early diagnosis</strong> and <strong>treatment</strong> are used to arrest the disease progression. Examples of secondary prevention are <strong>pap smear</strong> for early detection of <strong>cervical cancer</strong> and <strong>mammography</strong> to pick up breast cancer.</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Tertiary prevention</strong> is the action taken to <strong>limit impairment</strong> and <strong>promote rehabilitation</strong> of patients in case of irreversible damage. <strong>Intervention</strong> is done in the<strong> late pathogenesis phase.&nbsp;</strong>An example is rehabilitation is providing walking aid for the crippled.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Levels of Prevention</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Level</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Primordial</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Primary</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Secondary</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Tertiary</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Phase of disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Underlying socio-economic &amp; environmental conditions leading to causation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Specific causal or risk factors</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Early stage of disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Late stage of disease</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Aim</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Establish and maintain conditions that minimize hazards to health</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Reduce the incidence of disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Reduce prevalence by shortening duration</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Reduce number and impact of complications</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Inhibition of emergence of socio-economic, environmental and behavioural conditions</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Protection of personal and community health by eliminating risks</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Early detection and intervention to minimize disability</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Soften the impact of long-term disease and disability, minimize suffering</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Modes of Intervention</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Health education</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Health promotion and specific protection</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Diagnosis and treatment</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Disability limitation and rehabilitation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Targets</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Total population or select groups</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Total population or high risk individuals/groups</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Individuals/ Patients</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Patients</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Typically, there is a pronounced cough, which is hoarse, dry, and hacking. Some children may complain of tightening in the chest. The red eyes are characterized by increased tearing, eye pain that may be severe, and sensitivity to light. Other symptoms that are frequently observed during the prodromal phase include fatigue, irritability, a decreased appetite, a headache, abdominal pain, and a dry mouth and throat.&nbsp;<strong>Koplik spots</strong>&nbsp;are the peculiar&nbsp;<strong>spots</strong>&nbsp;present on the buccal mucosa and are considered to be a diagnostic/pathognomic feature of&nbsp;<strong>measles</strong>/rubeola in the prodromal stage.</p>\n<p><strong>2) The eruptive phase</strong></p>\n<p>Approximately<strong> two to four days after the onset of the symptoms, the rash appears</strong>, marking the beginning of the rash phase.

It <strong>first appears as irregular spots on the upper forehead or behind the ears</strong> and on the neck. Within 24 hours, it progresses to the entire face, head, and neck.
