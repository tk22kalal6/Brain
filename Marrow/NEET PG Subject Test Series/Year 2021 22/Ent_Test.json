      "solution": "<p>The given clinical presentation, with <strong>pearly white keratin debris</strong> in the external auditory canal, suggests the diagnosis of <strong>keratosis obturans</strong>. Narrowing of the meatus is the least likely complication, as this condition is associated with <strong>widening of the meatus.</strong></p>\n<p>Due to the <strong>pressure effect</strong> by <strong>desquamated epithelial cells</strong> in the deep meatus, there is <strong>subsequent</strong> <strong>absorption</strong> of surrounding <strong>bone</strong>, leading to the <strong>widening </strong>of the<strong> meatus</strong><strong>. </strong>Sometimes, the<strong> </strong>extent of bone absorption is such that it leaves the<strong> facial nerve exposed </strong>to<strong> injury </strong>and<strong> subsequent paralysis. Extensive erosion </strong>of the <strong>bone can</strong> also <strong>result in</strong> <strong>automastoidectomy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Keratosis obturans is the <strong>accumulation of</strong> a large plug of <strong>desquamated keratin</strong> in the <strong>external auditory meatus</strong>. Conventionally, epithelium from the surface of the tympanic membrane migrates onto the posterior meatal wall. <strong>Failure of </strong>or any obstruction to this <strong>migration</strong> caused <strong>by wax impacted</strong> in the ear canal may lead to keratosis obturans.</p>\n<p>It is <strong>usually</strong> seen between the ages of <strong>5-20 years</strong> and is commonly <strong>unilateral</strong>. Clinical features include severe otalgia and difficulty in hearing. It is <strong>associated with</strong> systemic conditions like<strong> bronchiectasis</strong> and <strong>chronic sinusitis</strong>. </p>\n<p>On otoscopic examination, there is a <strong>thickening of</strong> the <strong>tympanic membrane</strong> and a <strong>k</strong><strong>eratin plug </strong>appearing like a<strong> pearly white mass</strong> occluding the canal. The <strong>keratin</strong> that is shed from the entire circumference of the deep ear canal <strong>appears</strong> to have an <strong>onion skin</strong> arrangement. There is also hyperemia of canal skin, sometimes with <strong>ulcerations</strong> and <strong>granulations. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> involves the removal of the plug by <strong>syringing or instrumentation</strong>. Any <strong>recurrence</strong> can be <strong>prevented</strong> <strong>with</strong> the use of <strong>keratolytics</strong> such as 2% salicylic acid in alcohol.</p>\n<p>Note: Narrowing refers to a decrease in the diameter of the meatus. Debris in kerotosis obturans or ear wax might cause obstruction (partial or complete) but does not cause narrowing. Narrowing of the meatus is seen in conditions such as ear canal stenosis.</p>",
