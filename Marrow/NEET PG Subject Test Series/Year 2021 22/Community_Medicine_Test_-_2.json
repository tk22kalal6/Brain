This has to&nbsp;be estimated<strong> before&nbsp;</strong>chlorination is done.</li>\n<li>The <strong>point</strong>&nbsp;at which<strong>&nbsp;the chlorine demand </strong>of&nbsp;water&nbsp;is met is called the <strong>breakpoint</strong>.

They have <strong>slow action</strong> and thus are not widely used.</li>\n<li><strong>Perchloron</strong> or <strong>high test hypochlorite (H.T.H.)</strong>: It is a <strong>calcium compound</strong> that has <strong>60 &ndash; 70% of available chlorine</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Break point chlorination:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The point at which the <strong>chlorine demand of water</strong>&nbsp;is met is called<strong>&nbsp;the breakpoint. </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Free chlorine</strong> (HOCl and OCl) appears when <strong>chlorine is added beyond the breakpoint</strong>.</li>\n<li>In other words, at the breakpoint, if chlorine is added, then <strong>all the combined chlorines</strong>&nbsp;would have been completely<strong>&nbsp;destroyed</strong> and <strong>free residual chlorines </strong>begin to&nbsp;<strong>appear</strong>.</li>\n<li>This corresponding dosage to achieve the appearance of free residual chlorine is called <strong>breakpoint dosage</strong> and this method is called <strong>breakpoint chlorination</strong>.</li>\n<li>It is also called <strong>controlled superchlorination</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Superchlorination </strong>followed by <strong>dechlorination </strong>is used to disinfect highly polluted waters whose quality fluctuates greatly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Orthotolidine (OT) test:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>It is a <strong>test for chlorination</strong> and determines <strong>free and combined chlorine</strong> in water, rapidly and accurately.</li>\n<li>The reagent used is <strong>analytical grade Orthotolidine</strong> dissolved in a 10% solution of hydrochloric acid.</li>\n<li>When added to water that contains chlorine, it turns <strong>yellow</strong> with varying intensity.
