Tumours may arise in <strong>major bronchi</strong> or in the <strong>periphery</strong> of the lung. The presence of <strong>neurosecretory granules</strong> and the expression of neuroendocrine markers, such as CD56 and chromogranin, indicate that the tumour is derived from neuroendocrine progenitor cells found in the lining of the <strong>bronchial epithelium.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Bronchial carcinoid tumours</strong> typically arise as <strong>central masses</strong> that grow into <strong>finger-like polypoid</strong> masses that frequently protrude into the <strong>bronchus lumen.</strong> They are associated with features of carcinoid syndrome like <strong>diarrhoea, flushing</strong> and <strong>wheezing.</strong> Biopsy would show clusters of neuroendocrine cells and positive <strong>chromogranin A</strong> staining.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Adenocarcinoma</strong> of the lung is the most common form of lung cancer. It is an <strong>invasive malignant epithelial</strong> tumour with glandular differentiation. It originates from the terminal bronchiole and is typically found in the periphery. Tumour cells frequently <strong>\"crawl\"</strong> along normal-appearing alveolar septa in a <strong>lepidic pattern</strong> of spread near the tumour's periphery. </p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n<p>Common symptoms of lung carcinoma include a persistent cough, weight loss, dyspnea, and non-specific chest pain.

This prevents the reabsorption of amino acids like <strong>cystine</strong>, ornithine, lysine, and arginine. The only known complication of this disease is the <strong>formation of calculi</strong>, because of the low solubility of cystine in the urine. Cystine is more likely to precipitate in acidic urine.</p>\n<p>Prevention of stone formation in patients with cystinuria can be done by <strong>increasing fluid intake</strong> and <strong>alkalinization of the urine</strong> with sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate. Chelating agents such as <strong>penicillamine</strong> have also been found to be useful. <strong>Tiopronin</strong> is currently the best choice drug for cystine reduction, but side effects like nephrotic syndrome may limit its long-term use. A <strong>diet low in methionine</strong> may theoretically reduce the excretion of cystine in the urine by directly reducing its formation.</p><p class=\"p1\">Other options-</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option (A):<strong> Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy </strong>(ESWL) is a non-invasive method that generates shockwaves outside the body, which are focused on the stones. It is the most common method of treating urinary tract stones. Stones <strong>up to</strong> approximately <strong>1.5 cm</strong> in size <strong>are suitable</strong> for this form of treatment. <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cystine stones which are are <strong>often multiple</strong>, <strong>and very hard</strong> are relatively <strong>resistant</strong> <strong>to ESWL</strong> due to their hardness.</span></p><p> Option (C):<strong> Open surgery- </strong>A <strong>longstanding obstructing calculus </strong>can result in <strong>chronic inflammatory</strong> change in the kidney. Open surgeries are generally indicated for xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). Generally, in such cases, a <strong>subcapsular nephrectomy</strong> is performed. In extremely rare cases where both PCNL and ESWL are contraindicated, one might resort to open/laparoscopic surgery. </p>\n<p>Option (D):<strong> Ureteroscopic removal- </strong>Semi-rigid ureteroscopes are frequently used to directly visualize ureteric calculi. Advances in the design of ureterorenoscopy have made it easier to access these stones by endoscopic examination.  Stones can also be fragmented using mechanical disintegration using the lithoclast. This method is generally preferred for stones &lt;6mm and specifically those present in the <strong>distal ureter.</strong></p>\n<p>The image below summarizes how the Dormia basket works with ureteroscopy-</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/3a0e9b1f9b2d410bb9eb75427f29a656x1280x1688.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Microscopic Appearance of Various Stones</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/15e48f770c514c65b97b1eefea14db50x1280x2927.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>Xanthine, indinavir, and triamterene stones are <strong>radiolucent</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Management of renal and ureteric calculi</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4cfbb28a9c864211aae21deaebd2fc99x1280x2912.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>ESWL: Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy</p>\n<p>PCNL:&nbsp;Percutaneous nephrolithotomy</p>\n<p>URS: Ureteroscopic retrieval of stones</p>",
