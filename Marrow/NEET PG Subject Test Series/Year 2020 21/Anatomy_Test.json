It contains keratinocytes and is also called stratum germinativum. </li>\n<li><strong>Stratum spinosum </strong>- Contains several layers of polygonal keratinocytes. These cells are connected with the help of desmosomes. This is also called the prickle cell layer.</li>\n<li><strong>Stratum granulosum </strong>- These are made up of flattened cells that have deeply staining granules in their cytoplasm. The granules contain keratohyalin.</li>\n<li><strong>Stratum lucidum </strong>- It lies superficial to the stratum granulosum. The cell boundaries are indistinct, and this layer appears homogenous.</li>\n<li><strong>Stratum corneum </strong>- It is the most superficial layer of the epidermis. This layer is acellular. It is made up of flattened scale-like elements (squames) containing keratin filaments within a protein.

Unilateral palsy is more common on the <strong>left side</strong> because of the long course of the nerve. They are more commonly injured during <strong>thyroid surgeries</strong>, neck trauma, thyroid disease, and<strong> bronchogenic carcinoma.</strong></p>\n<p>The recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies all the muscles of the larynx except for the <strong>cricothyroid.</strong> Therefore, in unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, these muscles are paralysed. The affected vocal cord lies in the <strong>paramedian position </strong>(option B).</p>\n<p>Postoperatively, the injury can go <strong>unnoticed,</strong> or the patient may complain of <strong>mild hoarseness in the voice</strong>. This hoarseness is because the paralysed muscle cannot close the glottis during phonation.</p>\n<p>Hoarseness might <strong>improve</strong> over time because the unaffected muscle compensates and closes the glottis by hyperadduction of the cord. The patient will not have difficulty in breathing or stridor (option C).</p>\n<p>Generally, <strong>no treatmen</strong>t is required (option A). Laryngoplasty type I is needed if there is no compensation from the normal muscle.</p>\n<p>In <strong>bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, </strong>both the vocal cords are paralysed and assume the paramedian position.

The medulla contains pink rounded masses called <strong>Hassell's corpuscles.</strong></p><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/70e56f13d60940f1885dae76de498fe0x250x370.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Structure of a lymph node</strong></p>\n<p>Each lymph node is <strong>bean-shaped.</strong> The concave part consists of the hilum, through which the blood vessels enter and leave the node. Microscopy shows the following features:</p>\n<p>Each lymph node is surrounded by a thin capsule. Below the capsule is the clear space, which is called the <strong>subcapsular sinus.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The lymph node contains the outer cortex and an inner medulla. <strong>The cortex</strong>&nbsp;consists of densely packed lymphocytes and therefore stains <strong>dark</strong>. Numerous <strong>follicles</strong> can be seen in the cortex. Each nodule has a pale-staining <strong>germinal center</strong> surrounded by a zone of densely packed lymphocytes. <strong>The medulla</strong>&nbsp;consists of lymphocytes arranged in the form of <strong>anastomosing cords.</strong> It appears pale. Numerous <strong>blood vessels</strong> can be seen in this area.</p>\n<p>The image below shows the histology of the lymph node:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a992c3c5d8ae43ffb2ea6624f8d8d4edx1280x1010.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Structure of spleen (Option A)</strong></p>\n<p>The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ of the body.</p>\n<p>Microscopic features of the spleen:</p>\n<p>It is surrounded by a thick capsule. This capsule extends into the organ forming <strong>trabeculae. </strong>The substance of the spleen consists of <strong>red pulp</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>white pulp</strong>. In red pulp, the lymphocytes are diffusely distributed and&nbsp;contain numerous sinusoids. In white pulp, the lymphocytes are densely packed and arranged in the form of <strong>cords</strong> around the <strong>arterioles.</strong></p>\n<p>When cut transversely, the cords are similar to the nodules in the lymph nodes. They have a pale <strong>germinal center</strong> surrounded by a <strong>ring</strong> of densely packed lymphocytes. However, there is an <strong>eccentrically</strong> placed <strong>arteriole</strong> within the germinal center.</p>\n<p>The image below shows the spleen: WP- white pulp, RP- Red pulp, CR- central arteriole.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4001334811e3425ba537e7df3024eae9x263x274.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Structure of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (Options B and C)</strong></p>\n<p>The aggregations are in the form of lymphatic follicles.

      "solution": "<p>The clinical scenario describes <strong>hypospadias.&nbsp;</strong>It occurs due to the<strong> incomplete fusion</strong> of the <strong>urethral folds.</strong></p>\n<p>Development of external genitalia in males</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It is under the influence of androgens secreted by the fetal testes. The genital tubercle elongates to form <strong>phallus</strong>. During this elongation, the phallus pulls the urethral folds forward so that they form the lateral walls of the <strong>urethral groove.</strong> This groove extends along the ventral aspect of the elongated phallus, but not up to the glans. The urethral folds which form the lateral wall of the urethral groove fuse to form the penile urethra. The most distal part of urethra is formed by the penetration of the ectodermal cells from the tip of the glans. These form a short epithelial cord that forms the <strong>external urethral meatus.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Incomplete fusion&nbsp;</strong>of the urethral folds leads to hypospadiasis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option A- Splitting of genital tubercles leads to <strong>bifid</strong> or <strong>double penis.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C- Improper development of urorectal septum or cloaca leads to <strong>rectovaginal fistulas.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D- Improper developmental paramesonephric duct leads to uterine anomalies like <strong>uterus didelphys,</strong> uterus arcuatus, uterus bicornis, etc.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/9eff50fe8fee4fe8a0f8a128eb32e983x1280x2289.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Derivatives of Mesonephric (Wolffian) duct and Paramesonephric (Mullerian) duct</h3><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Structures arising from mesonephric/Wolffian duct</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Males</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Females</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ureteric bud and its derivatives</td>\n<td>Ureteric bud and its derivatives</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trigone of bladder</td>\n<td>Trigone of bladder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The proximal part of the prostatic urethra</td>\n<td>The posterior wall of the urethra</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spermatic pathway</td>\n<td>Gartner's duct</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Appendix of epididymis</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Structures arising from the paramesonephric/Mullerian duct</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Males</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Females</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Appendix of testis</td>\n<td>Fallopian tube</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prostatic utricle</td>\n<td>Uterus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Cervix</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Upper vaginal wall</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Homologous structures in male and female genitalia</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Females</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Embryonal structure</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Males</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ovary</td>\n<td><strong>Genital ridge</strong></td>\n<td>Testis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ova</td>\n<td><strong>Primordial germ cells</strong></td>\n<td>Spermatozoa</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Labia majora</td>\n<td><strong>Labioscrotal swelling</strong></td>\n<td>Scrotum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Labia minora</td>\n<td><strong>Urogenital folds</strong></td>\n<td>Ventral aspect of the penis - penile urethra</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Glans clitoris</td>\n<td><strong>Genital tubercle</strong></td>\n<td>Glans penis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\">Vestibular bulbs</p>\n&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Genital tubercle</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\">Corpus cavernosum</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Corpus spongiosum</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\">Urethral and paraurethral glands /Skene's glands</p>\nLower part of Vagina&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Urogenital sinus</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;\n<p class=\"p1\">Prostate gland</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Greater vestibular glands/Bartholin's glands</td>\n<td><strong>Urogenital sinus</strong></td>\n<td>Bulbourethral glands/Cowper's glands</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Granulosa cells</td>\n<td><strong>Sex cords</strong></td>\n<td>Seminiferous tubules and Sertoli cells</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Round ligament</td>\n<td><strong>Gubernaculum</strong></td>\n<td>Gubernaculum testis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Epoophoron and paroophoron</td>\n<td><strong>Mesonephric tubules</strong></td>\n<td>Efferent ductules and paradidymis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gartner duct (remnant structure)</td>\n<td><strong>Mesonephric duct/Wolffian duct</strong></td>\n<td>Epididymis, ductus deferens, and ejaculatory duct</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uterus, fallopian tube, cervix and the upper vaginal wall</td>\n<td><strong>Paramesonephric duct/Mullerian duct</strong></td>\n<td>Prostatic utricle and the appendix of testis (remnant structure)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
