G</strong><strong>lobin gene sequencing is </strong>used for its <strong>definitive diagnosis</strong>. </p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\">High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used as a <strong>screening test</strong> for thalassemia (option A). </p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\"><strong>Thalassemia</strong> is a hemoglobinopathy that arises due to deficient <strong>synthesis of the globin chains</strong>. Depending on the chain affected, it is classified into <strong>α-thalassemia</strong> and <strong>β-thalassemia</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\">β-thalassemia is caused by <strong>point mutations</strong> of the β-thalassemia gene on chromosome 11, which diminish the synthesis of β-globin chains.<strong> Splicing mutations</strong> are the <strong>most common</strong> cause of (β+) thalassemia. </p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\">There is a deficit in the synthesis of HbA with an <strong>elevation of HbA2</strong> and<strong> HbF</strong> levels in β-thalassemia. Children with severe thalassemia present with distinctive facial features such as <strong>maxilla hyperplasia</strong>, a <strong>flat nasal bridge</strong>, and <strong>frontal bossing</strong>. Other manifestations include pathologic <strong>bone fractures</strong>, significant<strong> hepatosplenomegaly</strong>, and cachexia. </p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\">Blood smears show marked <strong>anisocytosis</strong>, <strong>poikilocytosis</strong>, and microcytic hypochromic anemia. <strong>Target cells</strong>, basophilic stippling, and fragmented red cells also are common. A radiographic image of the skull shows the <strong>classic 'crew cut'</strong> appearance.</p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\"><strong>Hb Electrophoresis</strong> and<strong> high-performance liquid chromatography</strong> (HPLC) are used as <strong>screening tests</strong> for thalassemia. <strong>DNA diagnosis</strong> to detect β-thalassemia mutations is used for definitive diagnosis. The <strong>Mentzer index</strong> is the ratio of MCV to RBC count. It is used to differentiate between iron-deficiency anemia and β-thalassemia trait. The Mentzer index is <strong>&lt;13</strong> in <strong>thalassemia minor</strong> syndrome.</p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\">Transfusions are administered every 3-4 weeks to maintain a pretransfusion hemoglobin level of 9.5-10.5 g/dL. <strong>Transfusion-induced hemosiderosis</strong> is a significant complication in transfusion-dependent thalassemia.

It is associated with prematurity, <strong>Down&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>syndrome</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>polyhydramnios</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is usually identified during the prenatal ultrasound, where it shows the presence of a double bubble sign. If the atresia goes unnoticed during the prenatal period, the babies usually present with <strong>bilious vomiting </strong>soon after birth. This is because the obstruction is<strong> distal</strong> to the <strong>ampulla</strong> of <strong>Vater</strong> in most cases. Abdominal radiographs also show the <strong>double-bubble sign&nbsp;</strong>if done before orogastric tube decompression.
