The&nbsp;<strong>hydatid cyst</strong>&nbsp;usually develops<strong>&nbsp;three weeks</strong>&nbsp;after the infection.

The cyst wall is composed of two layers,&nbsp;<strong>ectocyst</strong>&nbsp;(outer gelatinous membrane), and&nbsp;<strong>endocyst</strong>&nbsp;(inner germinal membrane).

Bariatric surgery, specifically, <strong>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery</strong> is associated with the <strong>creation of mesenteric defects.</strong> The small bowel can herniate through these defects (<strong>internal hernia</strong>) and get strangulated, resulting in bowel obstruction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, as the person <strong>loses weight</strong> (due to the bariatric procedure), the protective, space-occupying effect of the <strong>mesenteric fat is lost</strong> and <strong>hernia spaces open u</strong>p, further increasing the risk of internal hernia. The<strong> laparoscopic</strong>&nbsp;procedure has a <strong>higher risk</strong> compared to open surgery since fewer adhesions form to tether small-bowel loops and prevent them from herniating.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Adequate closure of the mesenteric defects</strong> by the surgeon at the time of operation significantly reduces the risk of internal hernia.</p>\n<p><strong>Other complications</strong> specific to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nutritional deficiencies: <strong>iron </strong>(most common), folate, Vitamin A, D, K and B12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Anastomosis site leak&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Bleeding from the site of gastrojejunostomy&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Dumping syndrome</li>\n<li>Marginal ulcers</li>\n<li>Increased risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option A: Sleeve gastrectomy is often complicated by <strong>staple line leak</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is associated with <strong>band slippage and erosion</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: Endoluminal stapling is also used to create a gastric sleeve. It is associated with postoperative nausea, vomiting, <strong>abdominal pain</strong>, and transient dysphagia.</p>",

Protection from cold can help.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Diabetic foot </strong>also occurs as a result of <strong>peripheral neuropathy </strong>and <strong>atherosclerosis</strong> of<strong> small arteries</strong> in the <strong>legs </strong>and <strong>feet. </strong>Hence, improving venous circulation with compression stockings will have no benefit in this condition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Buerger's disease </strong>or <strong>thromboangiitis obliterans</strong> involves occlusive disease of <strong>small- </strong>and <strong>medium-sized arteries</strong>, thrombophlebitis of the superficial or deep veins, and Raynaud&rsquo;s syndrome<strong>. </strong>It occurs in<strong> male smokers,</strong> usually under the age of 30 years.

Sometimes, a 3-dimensional mesh is kept in the defect to prevent future herniation through the defect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The most appropriate mesh used in hernioplasty is a&nbsp;<strong>l</strong><strong>ightweight mesh with large pores.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lightweight meshes</strong>&nbsp;generally contain less material and induce a less-pronounced foreign body reaction and&nbsp;<strong>decreased inflammatory response</strong>, which results in better tissue incorporation, increased prosthesis compliance, and decreased patient discomfort and pain.</p>\n<p>Meshes with&nbsp;<strong>large pores</strong>&nbsp;exhibit<strong>&nbsp;less inflammatory infiltration</strong>, connective tissue, and scar bridging, which allows&nbsp;<strong>increased soft tissue ingrowth.</strong>&nbsp;They have&nbsp;<strong>greater elasticity</strong>&nbsp;and flexibility and also&nbsp;<strong>shrink less </strong>than other meshes. This results in&nbsp;<strong>fewer adhesions</strong>, better tissue incorporation, and less patient discomfort and pain than that observed with other meshes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Meshes used in hernioplasty can be synthetic or biological mesh depending on their composition.</p>\n<p><strong>Synthetic meshes</strong>&nbsp;are more commonly used these days. They are made from polymers of polypropylene, polyester, or PTFE polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Polypropylene</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Polyester</strong></td>\n<td><strong>PTFE</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monofilament</td>\n<td>multifilament</td>\n<td>solid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hydrophobic</td>\n<td>hydrophilic</td>\n<td>hydrophobic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rigidity</td>\n<td>elastic</td>\n<td>rigid</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><strong>PTFE</strong>&nbsp;meshes are hydrophobic and have a&nbsp;<strong>higher risk</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>adhesion</strong>&nbsp;compared to polyester meshes.</p>\n<p><strong>Biological meshes</strong>&nbsp;are acellular matrix materials derived from humans or animals and have <strong>fewer&nbsp;complications</strong> than other meshes.

This allows bacteria (&lt; 1 &mu;m) to survive unchallenged within the pores and braids.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
