      "solution": "<p>The most likely diagnosis based on the clinical vignette given is <strong>conversion disorder</strong> /functional neurologic symptom disorder.</p>\n<p>Conversion disorder is a condition with symptoms or deficits that involve <strong>voluntary motor</strong> or <strong>sensory functions</strong>. Though it points to an underlying medical condition, in reality, it arises due to <strong>psychological factors</strong>. The symptoms are <strong>not intentionally produced</strong> and the gain obtained is primarily psychological. </p>\n<p>It can be associated with <strong>depressive disorders</strong>, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and somatization disorders. Paralysis, <strong>blindness</strong>, and mutism are the most frequently seen conversion disorder symptoms. <strong>Anaesthesia</strong> and<strong> paresthesia </strong>of the extremities, abnormal movements, and gait disturbance are the other features commonly seen. </p>\n<p>Conversion disorder usually <strong>resolves spontaneously</strong>. Insight-oriented or <strong>behavioural therapy</strong> is also helpful. Hypnosis and <strong>anxiolytics</strong> are used in some cases. </p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Catatonia</strong> is a condition seen in advanced<strong> primary mood</strong> or <strong>psychotic illnesses</strong>. Some conditions that can cause catatonia include <strong>head trauma</strong>, encephalitis, and <strong>hepatic encephalopathy</strong>. Some medications such as<strong> corticosteroids</strong>, immunosuppressants, or antipsychotics can also result in the condition. Some clinical features include <strong>grimacing</strong>, mutism, <strong>echolalia,</strong> stupor, and posturing.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)</strong>, especially in its<strong> ischemic </strong>form, usually presents with <strong>severe visual loss</strong>, marked<strong> retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, optic disc oedema</strong>, and a <strong>relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD)</strong>, often accompanied by detectable abnormalities on ophthalmic examination. However, this patient has normal visual acuity, normal pupillary reactions, and no detectable abnormalities on ophthalmic or neurological exams, making CRVO an unlikely diagnosis in this case.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Eales' disease</strong>, common in <strong>young Asian males</strong>, features <strong>recurrent vitreous haemorrhage</strong> and <strong>retinal neovascularization</strong> due to peripheral <strong>retinal vein inflammation</strong>. It presents with a <strong>reddish vitreous mass</strong> and can lead to <strong>vision loss</strong> and complications like <strong>retinal detachment</strong>. However, it is less likely here due to the patient’s demographics and absence of characteristic findings.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Conversion Disorder</h3><p><strong>Conversion disorder</strong>: Also called functional neurological symptom disorder.</p>\n<p><strong>Common presenting symptoms</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weakness and/or paralysis</li>\n<li>Non-epileptic seizures</li>\n<li>Movement disorders</li>\n<li>Speech or visual impairment like mutism or blindness</li>\n<li>Swallowing difficulty</li>\n<li>Sensory disturbances</li>\n<li>Cognitive symptoms</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Diagnostic criteria</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Symptoms of altered neurological function-voluntary motor or sensory</li>\n<li>Often precipitated by a psychological stressor (the temporal relationship between stressor and symptoms is present)</li>\n<li>Not feigned or intentionally produced (as in factitious disorder or malingering)</li>\n<li>Findings incompatible with a recognized neurological condition</li>\n<li>Symptoms cause significant social or occupational impairment</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other important features</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Primary gain</strong> - Unconscious relief from stress&nbsp;as the focus of the patient shifts to&nbsp;the symptoms.</li>\n<li><strong>Secondary gain</strong> - Attention gained by the patient (from bystanders) as a result of the symptoms.</li>\n<li><strong>La-belle indifference </strong>-&nbsp;refers to an absence of concern towards one&rsquo;s problem despite severe disability</li>\n<li><strong>Astasia abasia</strong> - Wildly ataxic, staggering gait accompanied by irregular, jerky truncal movements, thrashing and waving arm movements</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Management options</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First-line: Education and self-help technique</li>\n<li>Second-line: Cognitive-behavioral therapy</li>\n<li>Physical therapy for motor symptoms</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Somatoform Disorder</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Somatoform Disorder</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Key features of somatic symptom and related disorders</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Somatic symptom disorder</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Excessive anxiety and preoccupation with &ge;1 unexplained symptom</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Illness anxiety disorder</span></p>\n<p><span>(hypochondriasis)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Fear of having a serious illness despite few or no symptoms and consistently negative evaluations</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Conversion disorder</span></p>\n<p><span>(functional neurologic symptom disorder)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Neurologic symptom&nbsp; incompatible with any known neurologic disease, often acute onset associated with stress</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Factitious disorder</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Intentional falsification or inducement of symptoms with a goal to assume the sick role</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Malingering</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Falsification or exaggeration of symptoms to obtain external incentives (secondary gain)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification of somatic symptom disorders: DSM-5 vs ICD-10</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>DSM-5</strong></p>\n<p><span>(S</span><span>omatic symptom and related disorders)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;ICD-10</strong></p>\n<p><span>(Somatoform disorders)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Somatic symptom disorder</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Somatization disorder</span></p>\n<p><span>Undifferentiated somatoform disorder</span></p>\n<p><span>Persistent somatoform pain disorder</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Conversion disorder</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>(functional neurological</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>symptom disorder)</span></td>\n<td><span>Dissociative (conversion) disorder</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Illness anxiety disorder</span></td>\n<td><span>Hypochondriacal disorder</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Factitious disorder</span></td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Somatoform disorder NEC</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Somatoform autonomic dysfunction</span></p>\n<p><span>Other somatoform disorders</span></p>\n<p><span>Somatoform disorder unspecified</span></p>\n<p><span>Neurasthenia (neurotic</span><br /><span>disorders category)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Psychological factors affecting another medical condition</span></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
