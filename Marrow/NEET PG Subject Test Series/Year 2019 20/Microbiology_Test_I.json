It consists of 4 distinct phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Lag</strong> phase (A) - The bacteria adapt to a new environment. They synthesize and accumulate enzymes and metabolic intermediates required for multiplication. Thus, there is no increase in cell number but cell size increases. <strong>Maximum cell size</strong> is obtained towards the end of this phase.</li>\n<li><strong>Log </strong>or <strong>exponential </strong>phase<strong> </strong>(B) - The bacteria<strong> </strong>start <strong>dividing</strong> and their <strong>numbers increase</strong> exponentially with time. Cells are smaller and stain uniformly. The growth rate is constant. </li>\n<li><strong>Stationary </strong>phase<strong> </strong>(C) - There is depletion of nutrients and accumulation of toxic products. Thus, cell division reduces and a state of <strong>equilibrium </strong>is attained, where the number of new cells formed equals the number that die. Growth rate is zero. <strong>Sporulation</strong> occurs during this phase. Many bacteria produce secondary metabolic products such as <strong>exotoxins</strong> and <strong>antibiotics.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Death</strong> phase or the<strong> </strong>phase of<strong> decline </strong>(D) - Growth rate is negative. The <strong>population decreases</strong> due to cell death from nutritional exhaustion, toxin accumulation and the action of autolytic enzymes. Involution forms are common.</li>\n</ol><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0c3dcc2e65fe4335a5e221dc2852bfc7x1280x1252.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

It has both a <strong>free-living</strong> and a <strong>parasitic</strong> life cycle. Its natural host is man. The <strong>infective form</strong> to man is the <strong>filariform larva. </strong>Infection occurs through penetration of the skin by larvae in the soil. Then, the larvae migrate to the small intestine. They molt twice and become adult female worms in the small intestine. The eggs laid in the mucosa of the intestine hatch immediately releasing the <strong>rhabditiform larva</strong> (L1 stage). Thus, it is <strong>ovoviviparous</strong>. These rhabditiform larvae in the bowel can develop directly into filariform larvae that penetrate the colonic wall or perianal skin and enter the circulation to repeat the migration. This establishes ongoing<strong> internal reinfection.</strong></p>\n<p>The rhabditiform larva can also be passed in the stool. It may directly metamorphose to the infective filariform larva in the soil, or develop into adult worms. The free-living adult worms then pass eggs, which hatch and mature to form infective filariform larvae. </p>\n<p> In <em>Ancylostoma duodenale</em> infestation, eggs containing <strong>segmented ova </strong>(not rhabditiform larvae) are passed in the stool.
