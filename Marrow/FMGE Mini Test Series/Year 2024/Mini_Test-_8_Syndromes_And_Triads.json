It has an <strong>X-linked dominant</strong> pattern of inheritance. The onset is <strong>after a few months</strong> of apparently normal development. Under the international classification of diseases, the tenth revision it falls under pervasive development disorder. The Diagnostic and statistical manual, 5th Edition (DSM-5) considers it an <strong>autism spectrum disorder,</strong> though there are marked differences between them.</p>\n<p>Between the ages of <strong>6 months to 2 years</strong>, affected children develop progressive encephalopathy. Other clinical features include <strong>stereotypic hand movements</strong> such as hand wringing, biting, or licking the fingers, and poor muscle coordination. Marked regression of all language skills and plateaued communicative and social skills can also be seen. <strong>Microcephaly </strong>develops as age progresses. Head circumference is normal at birth, but between the age of 6 months to 1 year, growth begins to decelerate. Seizures are an associated feature in a large number of cases. </p>\n<p>Supportive treatment is given. Physiotherapy is beneficial for muscular dysfunction. Anticonvulsants may be required to control seizures.</p>\n<p><strong>Trofinetide</strong> is a synthetic analogue of the amino‐terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) designed to treat the core symptoms of Rett syndrome by potentially reducing neuroinflammation and supporting the synaptic function of the protein fragment glypromate (GPE). IGF-1 is produced by both major types of brain cells – neurons and glia; IGF-1 in the brain is critical for both normal development and response to injury and disease. Trofinetide has been shown to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines, inhibit overactivation of microglia and astrocytes, and increase the amount of available IGF-1 that can bind to IGF-1 receptors.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Autism Spectrum Disorder</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ecffbe7148cc48b9a560f2b51d460118x709x1071.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Autism</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Rett syndrome</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Asperger syndrome</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Heller syndrome</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Onset</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Before 3 years</span></td>\n<td><span>After 5 months</span></td>\n<td><span>After 3 years</span></td>\n<td><span>After 2 years</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Gender predilection</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Boys</span></td>\n<td><span>Girls</span></td>\n<td><span>Boys</span></td>\n<td><span>Boys</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Intellectual disability</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Present in 30% of the cases</span></td>\n<td><span>Present</span></td>\n<td><span>Absent</span></td>\n<td><span>Present</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Language</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Mostly poor</span></td>\n<td><span>Mostly poor</span></td>\n<td><span>Normal</span></td>\n<td><span>Mostly poor</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Remarks</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>---</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Normal head circumference at birth.</span></p>\n<p><span>Regression of milestones</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>---</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Normal head circumference at birth.</span></p>\n<p><span>Regression of milestones</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Heller syndrome is also known as childhood disintegrative disorder.</p>",

Adrenal cortical tumors, carcinoid tumors, facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, thyroid tumors, and lipomas may also occur. MEN 1-associated tumors are usually multiple, larger, and more aggressive, resulting in resistance to treatment and poor patient outcomes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Parathyroid tumors-</strong>&nbsp;<strong>primary hyperparathyroidism</strong> is the <strong>most common</strong> feature of MEN 1. <strong>Hypercalcemia</strong> with or without symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, dyspepsia), nephrolithiasis, and osteitis fibrosa cystica may also occur.&nbsp;All four parathyroid glands are usually affected with multiple adenomas or hyperplasia.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Pancreatic islet cell tumors-</strong>&nbsp;these are <strong>neuroendocrine tumors</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gastrinoma</strong> (gastrin-secreting tumors)- associated with increased gastric acid secretion and multiple peptic ulcers (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Patients may present with diarrhea and steatorrhea. Gastrinomas are the<strong> major cause</strong> of <strong>mortality</strong> and morbidity.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Insulinoma</strong>&nbsp;(insulin-secreting tumors)- patients present with <strong>hypoglycemic symptoms</strong> (weakness, headaches, sweating, seizures, weight gain) that develop after fasting or exertion and improve after glucose intake. Along with increased plasma insulin levels and hypoglycemia, increased C peptide and proinsulin levels help in diagnosing the condition.</li>\n<li><strong>Glucagonoma</strong>&nbsp;(glucagon-secreting tumors)- may be associated with necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, anemia, and stomatitis.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>VIPomas</strong> (Vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIP]-secreting tumors): The VIPoma syndrome, also known as Verner-Morrison syndrome, is characterized by watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria.

Appropriate medical therapy can be used for some tumors when surgery is contraindicated or unsuccessful (calcimemetics for parathyroid tumors, parietal cell H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitors for gastrinomas).

It is inherited in an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> fashion and presents with multiple cutaneous findings which are divided into major and minor features.</p>\n<p>Major features :</p>\n<p><strong>Ash leaf macules</strong> -lance ovate shaped, hypopigmented lesions which are the earliest to manifest( at birth or early infancy)<br /><strong>Adenoma sebaceum</strong> - facial angiofibromas, which are the characteristics lesions of tuberous sclerosis. Usually appear between 3 to 10 years and become extensive at puberty<br /><strong>Shagreen patches</strong> - collagenomas which are leathery in texture and found in the lumbosacral region<br /><strong>Koenen tumors</strong> - <strong>periungual fibroma</strong>s, with appear at or after puberty</p>\n<p><strong>Minor features</strong> :</p>\n<p>Hypopigmented confetti macules<br />Dental enamel pits<br />Gingival fibromas</p>\n<p>The central nervous system lesions include cortical tubers, subependymal nodules and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas.The other systemic manifestations are renal angiomyolipoma, cardiac rhabdomyoma and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Lynch syndrome</strong> is the most common inherited cause of <strong>colonic cancer</strong> (right colon). Inherited mutations of genes MSH2 or MLH1 leading to defective DNA mismatch repair results in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. It is mainly associated with early-onset endometrial cancer, urothelial cancers of renal pelvis and cutaneous manifestations such as sebaceous adenomas.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Cowden’s syndrome</strong> is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by familial germline loss of function mutation of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN on chromosome 10 resulting in increased PI3K/AKT pathway signalling. It predisposes to various <strong>epithelial tumours.</strong></p>\n<p>Epithelial tumours associated with Cowden’s syndrome are <strong>multiple hamartomatous</strong> GI polyps, breast cancer, endometrial cancer and thyroid cancer. Mucocutaneous manifestations of the syndrome include facial trichilemmomas which is a benign appendageal tumor, oral mucosal papillomatosis showing cobblestone appearance, acral keratosis and palmoplantar keratosis.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Gardner syndrome</strong>, a variant of <strong>familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)</strong> syndrome is associated with <strong>hepatoblastoma. </strong>Activation of WNT <strong>signalling</strong> plays a major role in hepatoblastomas. This occurs by a variety of mechanisms including mutations in APC gene. Hence, patients with FAP syndromes frequently develop hepatoblastomas.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Cutaneous lesions of Tuberous sclerosis</h3><p>Tuberous sclerosis (TS)&nbsp;is also known as&nbsp;tuberous sclerosis complex&nbsp;or&nbsp;Bourneville disease.
