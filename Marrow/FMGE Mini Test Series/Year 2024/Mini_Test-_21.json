      "solution": "<ul>\n<li>MRI is a technique that produces topographic images by means of <strong>magnetic fields </strong>and <strong>radiofrequency waves.</strong></li>\n<li>MRI is based on the ability of a small number of protons within the body to absorb and emit radio wave energy when the body is placed within a strong magnetic field. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays are ionizing radiations. Alpha and beta rays are <strong>particulate radiation</strong> (Particles) whereas gamma and x-rays are <strong>electromagnetic rays</strong> (No mass).</li>\n</ul><p>Physicists <strong>Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur</strong> developed MRI-related techniques and they were awarded the 2003 Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine&nbsp;for their discoveries.</p>",
