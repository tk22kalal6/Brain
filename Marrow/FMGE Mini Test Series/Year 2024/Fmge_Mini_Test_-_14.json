      "solution": "<p>The newborn with persistent jaundice for more than 14 days, clay-coloured stool, and hepatomegaly is likely to have <strong>biliary atresia</strong>. The ultrasound confirms the diagnosis by demonstrating the <strong>triangular cord sign</strong>. </p>\n<p>The <strong>triangular cord sign</strong> represents the <strong>cone-shaped fibrotic mass</strong> cranial to the bifurcation of the portal vein. This density is echogenic and represents the fibrous remains of the porta hepatis. A <strong>≥ 4 mm thickness</strong> of the echogenic anterior wall of the right portal vein (EARPV) measured on a longitudinal ultrasound scan, strongly suggests biliary atresia.</p>\n<p><strong>Biliary atresia</strong> is a rare, life-threatening condition in <strong>newborns</strong> where the<strong> bile ducts</strong> inside or outside the liver are<strong> blocked or absent</strong>, preventing bile flow from the liver to the intestine. This leads to bile buildup, liver damage, and eventually <strong>cirrhosis </strong>if untreated. The exact cause is unknown, but it may involve genetic and environmental factors. Symptoms include<strong> jaundice</strong>, pale stools, dark urine, and an enlarged liver. Diagnosis involves blood tests, imaging, and sometimes a <strong>liver biopsy</strong>. The primary treatment is the <strong>Kasai procedure,</strong> which can restore bile flow, but many children eventually require a liver transplant.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: The <strong>falciform ligament sign</strong> is seen in the case of <strong>pneumoperitoneum.</strong> Here, the air outlines the appearance of the falciform ligament as seen in the X-ray below. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1f66f916ed17450e9dc4793bc998559dx765x1024.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C: <strong>Double bubble sign</strong> occurs due to dilated stomach and duodenum in <strong>duodenal atresia.</strong> It is seen in X-rays and ultrasound.
