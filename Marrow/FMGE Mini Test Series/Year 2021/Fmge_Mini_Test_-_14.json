However, under anesthesia, muscle tone is reduced and work of breathing is increased.

It is measured in terms of elastic recoil. With reduced diaphragmatic tone, the abdominal contents push the lung cephalad, making it difficult for lung expansion during inhalation. Hence compliance is decreased under anesthesia.</p>\n<p>Functional residual capacity or <strong>FRC is the volume of air in the lung after quiet expiration</strong>. It is greatly affected by sex, body habitus, and posture. It reduces from standing or sitting to supine and even furthermore in the prone position. In the supine position (which is usually the case in inhalation anesthesia), the abdominal contents push the lung upwards, causing a decrease in FRC.</p>\n<p>Closing capacity is the minimum lung volume after which the smaller airways start collapsing. The smaller airways lack cartilaginous support and to keep them open, it needs to have air inside it. Thus further reducing the lung volume would cause them to close. It is generally agreed that it decreases in anesthesia.</p>",
