      "solution": "<p>The given history of a sharply demarcated erythematous lesion on the 5th day of initiating of a certain drug, which progressed to form large, hemorrhagic bullae with necrosis &amp; slow healing eschar formation (above image) is strongly suggestive of <strong>Warfarin-induced Skin Necrosis.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Skin Necrosis </strong>is a very rare, potentially life-threatening side-effect of <strong>warfarin</strong> use that usually begins <strong>2-5 days after initiation</strong> of therapy.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The lesions typically begin as sharply demarcated, erythematous indurations or purpura. This may progress to form large, hemorrhagic bullae with eventual necrosis and slow-healing eschar formation.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Usual sites involved are <strong>breasts, thighs, buttocks, and toes</strong>.</li>\n<li>Individuals with <strong>Protein C &amp; S deficiency</strong> are, particularly at <strong>risk</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The pathogenesis involves a sudden drop in plasma levels of <strong>Protein C &amp; S (Vit K dependent anticoagulant proteins)</strong> by Warfarin. This sudden drop promotes hypercoagulability and consequent thrombosis of microvasculature which leads to necrosis.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Treatment involves&nbsp;<strong>discontinuation</strong>&nbsp;of warfarin and&nbsp;<strong>reversal with vitamin K</strong>, if necessary. An alternative anticoagulant, such as heparin or LMWH, should be given in patients with thrombosis. Protein C concentrate can be given to protein C&ndash;deficient patients which may help faster healing of the skin lesions.</li>\n<li>Skin grafting may be necessary.</li>\n</ul>",
