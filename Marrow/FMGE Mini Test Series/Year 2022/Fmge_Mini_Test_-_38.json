      "solution": "<p><strong>The influenza pandemic</strong> is an example of a <strong>cyclical trend</strong>.</p>\n<p>A cyclical trend is a type of<strong> periodic fluctuation</strong>. It occurs in <strong>cycles</strong> that are spread over short periods of time. This can be days, weeks, months, or even years. Influenza pandemics are known to occur at intervals of 7- 10 years, due to antigenic variations. Some <strong>non-infectious conditions</strong> can also display cyclical trends. An example of this is road traffic accidents occurring more frequently on the weekends. Knowledge of the cyclical pattern of diseases can be used to protect communities against the same.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Seasonal trend</strong> is a type of period fluctuation which refers to<strong> seasonal variation</strong> of diseases. Examples of diseases that follow this trend include <strong>measles</strong>, <strong>malaria</strong>, and upper respiratory tract infections. It can be related to <strong>environmental conditions</strong> such as temperature and humidity. Some non-infectious conditions which follow this trend are <strong>sunstroke</strong>, hay fever, and snakebite.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Secular</strong> or <strong>long-term trend</strong> signifies the changes seen in the occurrence of a disease over a long period of time. It implies a <strong>consistent change</strong> in a particular direction such as a progressive increase or decrease. Examples of conditions that follow this pattern are <strong>coronary heart disease</strong> and <strong>lung cancer</strong> which have shown a consistent upward trend. A decline in the occurrence of diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria has been noted in developed countries. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Point-source epidemic</strong> is a type of common-source epidemic. In this type of epidemic, there are <strong>no secondary waves</strong> and the epidemic curve rises and falls rapidly.

      "solution": "<p>The transfer of genes for diphtheria toxin on a corynebacteriophage occurs by <strong>transduction</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Transduction</strong>&nbsp;can be defined as the transfer of a portion of DNA from one bacterium to another by a <strong>bacteriophage</strong>. This type of horizontal gene transfer may occur by two mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lytic cycle&nbsp;</strong>- In the lytic cycle, also known as the virulent cycle, a large number of progeny phages build up inside the host bacterium; eventually, the host cell ruptures, releasing the bacteriophages. Some of the bacteriophages will now contain bacterial DNA, which can then be transferred to other bacteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Lysogenic cycle&nbsp;</strong>- In the temperate or non-lytic cycle, the host bacterium is not lysed. Rather, the phage DNA becomes integrated with the bacterial chromosome. This phage DNA multiplies with the host cell and is transferred to daughter cells.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option A -&nbsp;<strong>Conjugation</strong> is the method of&nbsp;gene transfer in bacteria that involves physical contact by a male or donor bacterium with a female or recipient bacterium through an extracellular protein extrusion or appendage called the <strong>sex pili.</strong> The genetic material that is transferred is usually derived from plasmids.&nbsp;The bacteria that possess the ability to form the sex pili contain the F<sup>+</sup> plasmid and are designated as F<sup>+</sup>. The F<sup>+</sup> bacteria can transfer a single strand of the F<sup>+</sup> plasmid DNA to F<sup>-</sup> bacteria via the sex pili.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C -&nbsp;<strong>Transformation</strong> is the direct uptake of naked DNA by the bacterial cell from the environment. Several bacteria such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Neisseria</em> undergo transformation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D -&nbsp;<strong>Transposition</strong> is a process of gene transfer that involves special segments of DNA called transposons (jumping genes).</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1ff528084ce04586b400f1dc77721ff6x1117x517.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
