      "solution": "<p>The most likely diagnosis is <strong>Perthes disease</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Perthes disease</strong>, also known as Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, is the avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis. It is <strong>most commonly</strong> seen in the age group of <strong>4-8 years</strong>. The incidence is more in boys than girls. It is usually unilateral disease but can occur bilaterally in 10% of the cases. Risk factors include low birth weight, passive smoking, family history, low socioeconomic status, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Perthes disease is associated with thrombophilia,<strong> protein C </strong>and<strong> S deficiencies.</strong></p>\n<p>The disease is characterized by the disruption of blood flow to the femoral head due to which the bone goes for <strong>osteonecrosis</strong> and <strong>stops growing</strong>. The lateral epiphyseal artery, a branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery is involved. Over time, healing and fibrosis occur by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and weakening of the femoral head. </p>\n<p>Clinical features include<strong> pain</strong> and <strong>limping</strong>. Pain aggravates on doing any activity and relieves by rest. Physical examination reveals pain on passive movement of the hip and <strong>abduction with internal rotation</strong> movement is<strong> limited</strong>.</p>\n<p>Xray findings depend on the stages </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial phase</strong>: Medial joint space widening and increased density in the ossific nucleus</li>\n<li><strong>Fragmentation phase</strong>: Alternating patches of sclerosis and fibrosis</li>\n<li><strong>Re-ossification phase</strong>: Complete removal of necrotic bone.
