The latter is done by <strong>intravenous</strong> administration of class III antiarrhythmic - <strong>ibutilide</strong>. In a <strong>stable patient</strong>, ventricular rate control is the primary aim. This is done by intravenous or oral administration of <strong>beta-blockers</strong>. Calcium channel blockers such as <strong>verapamil </strong>and <strong>diltiazem </strong>can also be used. </p>\n<p>If the current episode duration is <strong>&gt;48 hours</strong>, cardioversion can precipitate thromboembolic complications. In such cases, cardioversion should be carried out only<strong> after 3 weeks</strong> of anticoagulation. It has to be continued for<strong> 4 weeks</strong> after cardioversion. Another option is to evaluate the presence of a thrombus in the left atrial appendage. This can be done either by <strong>transesophageal echocardiography</strong> (TEE) or <strong>high-resolution CT.</strong></p>\n<p>If the duration is <strong>&lt;48 hours</strong> and there are no high-risk factors,<strong> cardioversion</strong> can be done. The <strong>CHA2DS2-VASc</strong> scoring system is used to assess <strong>stroke risk</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Warfarin</strong> is recommended in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves who present with atrial fibrillation. In<strong> mitral stenosis</strong>, thrombi arise frequently from the dilated left atrium. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of mitral stenosis is known as nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Oral factor Xa inhibitors such as <strong>apixaban, </strong>edoxaban, or rivaroxaban can be used in such cases. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/3fcadae984594cca94f269c405d843ccx1280x2006.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
