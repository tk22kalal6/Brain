It can present de novo as primary myelofibrosis (PMF), a chronic progressive myeloproliferative disorder or due to an underlying disorder such as leukemia or hyperparathyroidism, in which case it is called secondary or reactive myelofibrosis.</p>\n<p>Primary myelofibrosis occurs in individuals<strong> over 60 years </strong>of age<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations are seen in the majority of the cases<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Patients present with vague, constitutional symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, low-grade fever, cachexia, fatigue, and pruritus. There might be a history of exposure to industrial <strong>solvents</strong> or <strong>radiation</strong>. Later in the disease, there may be a sensation of fullness in the upper left quadrant due to splenomegaly. Hyperuricemia and secondary gout may also occur.</p>\n<p>Peripheral smear shows the presence of normochromic normocytic anemia and <strong>leukoerythroblastosis. </strong>There is a release of nucleated erythroid and early granulocyte progenitors from the bone marrow and the presence of <strong>dacryocytes</strong>, which are <strong>tear-drop-shaped</strong> red cells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Early</strong> in the disease, the <strong>WBC count is markedly elevated</strong> up to 100,000 cells/mm3 but later the count usually returns to normal or is reduced, even.</p>\n<p>The chief pathologic feature is the <strong>extensive deposition of collagen</strong> in the <strong>marrow</strong> by fibroblasts. The fibrosis of bone marrow is thought to be caused by the inappropriate release of <strong>platelet-derived growth factor&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>TGF-&beta;</strong>. Early in the disease, the marrow is hypercellular with an increase in the maturation of cells of all lineages but with <strong>disease progression</strong> and collagen deposition, the bone marrow becomes <strong>hypocellular</strong> and <strong>diffusely fibrotic. </strong>Eventually, the fibrotic marrow space is converted to bone, which is called <strong>osteosclerosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Due to the obliteration of marrow space by fibrotic changes, there is extensive <strong>extramedullary hematopoiesis</strong> mainly in the spleen, giving rise to <strong>massive splenomegaly</strong>. Subcapsular infarcts are common and there may be moderate enlargement of the liver. There is no significant lymphadenopathy, though hematopoiesis may occur even in the lymph nodes.</p>\n<p>The complications include recurrent infections, thrombotic episodes, platelet anomalies leading to bleeding diathesis, and sometimes, transformation into <strong>acute myeloid leukemia</strong> (AML).</p>\n<p>Janus kinase inhibitors like <strong>ruxolitinib</strong> and <strong>fedratinib</strong> have been approved for management. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation may also be considered depending on factors like the patients' age and fitness for the procedure.</p>",
