The major families of proteins involved in adhesion and migration are <strong>selectins</strong> and <strong>integrins</strong> and their ligands.</li>\n<li><strong>Adhesions</strong>: the weak rolling interactions slow down the leukocytes and allow them to bind more firmly to the endothelium. <strong>Chemokines</strong> that were produced at the site of injury bind to the endothelial cell proteoglycans. These chemokines then bind to the rolling leukocytes and activate them. This is turn converts the ligands for&nbsp;&beta;1 and&nbsp;&beta;2 integrins, <strong>VLA-4</strong> and <strong>LFA-1 </strong>present on the leukocytes to a <strong>high-affinity state</strong>.</li>\n<li>This combination of cytokine-induced expression of integrin ligands on the endothelium and increased integrin affinity on the leukocytes leads to firm <strong>adhesion</strong> of leukocytes to the endothelium at the site of inflammation.</li>\n<li><strong>Leukocyte migration</strong>: this is the movement of leukocytes through intact endothelium, called transmigration or diapedesis. This occurs in postcapillary venules. This migration occurs through the inter endothelial gap towards the chemical concentration gradient created by the chemokines at the site of injury. This occurs with the help of adhesion molecules present in the intercellular junctions such as&nbsp;<strong>Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule</strong> (<strong>PECAM-1</strong>) or <strong>CD31</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6879d8edb739418f87417f5d33e373ddx1280x2359.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
