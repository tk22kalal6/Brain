It may present as a severe, rapidly progressive disease with <strong>high fever, chills, hypoxia, diarrhea,</strong> and <strong>delirium</strong>. On chest x-ray, <strong>patchy</strong>, often <strong>multilobar consolidation</strong> is seen. <strong>Pleural effusion</strong> may also occur.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A milder form of a clinical syndrome known as <strong>P</strong><strong>ontiac fever,&nbsp;</strong>which is usually <strong>self-limiting</strong> and only has mild symptoms of fever, myalgia, and headache.</p>\n<p>Microscopy of the sputum samples shows numerous leucocytes without any organism.
