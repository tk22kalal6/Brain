      "solution": "<p><strong>Non-sense mutation</strong> is seen in <strong>&beta;<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;thalassemia.</strong></p>\n<p>A <strong>point mutation</strong> is a change in which a single base is substituted with a different base. The point mutations within the coding sequences of the DNA (i.e., the region of the DNA that&nbsp; codes for proteins) are of two types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Missense mutations</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Non-sense mutations</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>1. Missense mutations: </strong>These mutations may involve <strong>alteration of a single base in a triplet of bases</strong> and lead to the <strong>replacement of one amino acid by another in the gene product.</strong>&nbsp;Because these mutations alter the meaning of the sequence of the encoded protein, they are often referred to as missense mutations.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Based on the substituted amino acid coded, the missense mutations are again of two types:</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;<strong>Conservative missense mutation: </strong>The substituted amino acid is biochemically similar to the original. It typically causes little change in the function of the protein.</p>\n<p>b)&nbsp;<strong>Non-conservative missense mutation: </strong>This type of mutation replaces the normal amino acid with a biochemically different one. An example of this type of mutation is <strong>sickle-cell anemia, </strong>which is characterized by point mutation affecting the <strong>&beta;-globin chain of the hemoglobin, </strong>where the nucleotide triplet <strong>CTC</strong> (or GAG in mRNA), which encodes glutamic acid, is changed to <strong>CAC</strong> (or GUG in mRNA), which <strong>encodes valine</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Nonsense mutations: </strong>It is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon. For example, a point mutation affecting the codon for glutamine (CAG) creates a <strong>stop codon (UAG)</strong> if U is substituted for C. This change leads to premature termination of &beta;-globin gene translation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded. The resulting deficiency of &beta;-globin chains can give rise to a severe form of anemia called&nbsp;<strong>&beta;<sup>0</sup> t</strong><strong>halassemia.</strong></p><p><strong>The illustration below shows various types of point mutations:</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a42b131ed0b94da48af9e2f5309f4eebx1280x917.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Other options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Option b: The &alpha;-thalassemias</strong> are caused by inherited deletions that result in the reduced or absent synthesis of &alpha;-globin chains.</li>\n<li><strong>Option c: Sickle-cell anemia</strong> is an example of non-conservative missense mutation.</li>\n<li><strong>Option d: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS)</strong> is an inherited disorder caused by intrinsic defects in the red cell membrane skeleton that render red cells spheroid less deformable and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction.</li>\n</ul>",
