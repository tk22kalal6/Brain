      "solution": "<p>The appearance of the above clinical features after the initiation of<strong> fruit juice</strong> (rich in fructose) suggests a<strong> disorder of fructose metabolism</strong>. <strong>Seliwanoff's reagent</strong> gives a positive reaction in this condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI)</strong> is due to a <strong>deficiency </strong>of the enzyme<strong> aldolase</strong> <strong>B</strong>. It is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> inborn error of metabolism. Defective aldolase B causes the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. This will inhibit glycogen phosphorylase and cause glycogen accumulation in the liver and associated hypoglycemia.</p>\n<p>Symptoms occur when sucrose (fructose+glucose) is introduced into the diet of infants, usually around 6 months of age. Patients will present with vomiting, loss of appetite, and failure to thrive. Hepatomegaly and <strong>jaundice</strong> may occur. If liver damage progresses, death will occur. </p>\n<p>Fructose is also excreted in the urine. This gives a positive reducing sugar test (<strong>Benedict's test</strong>), a positive test for <strong>furfural derivatives</strong>, and specifically a positive <strong>Seliwanoff's test </strong>(for fructose).<strong> </strong>Withdrawal of fructose from the diet will immediately relieve the symptoms</p>\n<p><strong>Seliwanoff's test</strong> will <strong>distinguish glucose</strong> and <strong>fructose</strong>. The reagent is resorcinol in HCl. 3 ml of the reagent and 0.5 ml of urine are heated for 30 seconds up to a boiling point. A red color indicates the presence of fructose.</p>\n<p><strong>Benedict's test </strong>detects the excretion of<strong> reducing substances </strong>in the urine. About 0.5 ml of urine is boiled with 5 ml of Benedict's reagent for 2 minutes. The formation of a precipitate is observed on cooling. The test is semi-quantitative and the color of the precipitate roughly parallels the concentration of reducing sugar. The blue color indicates the absence of sugar in the urine. The green precipitate means 0.5%, yellow (1%), orange (1.5%) and red indicates 2% or more sugar (1% means 1 g per 100 ml). </p>\n<p><strong>Furfural test: Monosaccharides</strong> when treated with concentrated sulphuric acid undergo dehydration with the removal of 3 molecules of water. Hexoses give hydroxymethylfurfural and pentoses give furfural. The furfural derivative can condense with phenolic compounds to give colored products. This forms the basis of the <strong>Molisch test</strong>. It is a general test for carbohydrates. </p>\n<p>The image summarizes the metabolic pathways involved in the metabolism of fructose:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5f39f85ceb46421fbc5a2811f429bb43x1280x1703.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Reactions or Tests to Identify Specific Groups or Amino Acids</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Reactions</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Specific Group or Amino Acid</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Biuret Reaction</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Two peptide linkages</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ninhydrin Reaction</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Alpha-amino acids</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Xanthoproteic Reaction</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Benzene ring of aromatic amino acids</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Millons Reaction</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Phenolic group (Tyrosine)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hopkins-Cole Reaction</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Indole ring (Tryptophan)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Sakaguchi Reaction</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Guanidine group (Arginine)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Nitroprusside Reaction</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sulfhydryl groups (Cysteine)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Sulfur Test</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sulfhydryl groups (Cysteine)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Pauly&rsquo;s Test</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Imidazole ring (Histidine)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Folin-Ciocalteu&rsquo;s Test</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Phenolic group (Tyrosine)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
