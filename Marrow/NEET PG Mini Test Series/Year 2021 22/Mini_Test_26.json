Raised end-diastolic LV volume and reduced LV compliance lead to increased LV pressure, leading to elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

This results in<strong> </strong>jerky, hyperkinetic movements called <strong>chorea </strong>and<strong> dementia. </strong>It is commonly seen in the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> decades of life.
