Among the given options, pericardial knock is not a clinical feature of cardiac tamponade. It<strong> </strong>is a sign of constrictive pericarditis. </p>\n<p>Cardiac tamponade is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, leading to the impairment of diastolic relaxation of the cardiac chambers. This leads to a decline in cardiac output. The characteristic signs of cardiac tamponade include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pulsus paradoxus - </strong>This is a paradoxical reduction in the systemic blood pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) on inspiration. In tamponade, the increase in venous return to the right side (during inspiration) of the heart causes the interventricular septum to bow towards the left ventricle (fixed total heart volume), thereby reducing the left heart volume. This leads to a reduction in stroke volume and systemic blood pressure. </li>\n<li><strong>Beck's triad - </strong>This is a triad of findings in tamponade that consists of <strong>hypotension </strong>(90/56 mmHg), <strong>muffled heart sounds, </strong>and <strong>elevated jugular venous pressure. </strong>Features of JVP in tamponade include prominent x descent and absent y descent.<strong> </strong></li>\n<li><strong>ECG - </strong>ECG shows<strong> </strong>reduced voltage and electrical alternans. Electrical alternans is a specific finding caused by the anteroposterior swinging of the heart with each contraction. When the heart is nearer to the chest wall, the amplitude deflection on the ECG is increased; in contrast, when the heart moves away from the chest wall, the amplitude deflection is lower.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1c6c060940e3403eb77355813df0c89ax1280x1090.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Management of cardiac tamponade - In a patient with clinical features suggestive of tamponade, the best course of action is performing <strong>pericardiocentesis, </strong>preferably carried out under echocardiographic guidance. In cases of recurrent tamponade, a small catheter may be left in place to drain subsequent collections of fluid. </p>\n<p>Note - <strong>Constrictive pericarditis </strong>is characterized by a progressive fibrotic change in the pericardium that causes it to thicken and calcify. This leads to impaired cardiac contraction and filling. This gives rise to fatigue, elevated JVP (rapid y descent), ascites, and pulsus paradoxus.</p>\n<p>A notable finding on cardiac auscultation is the <strong>pericardial knock, </strong>which is an early diastolic sound. It is best appreciated over the left sternal border and/or the cardiac apex.

      "solution": "<p>The ECG interval with a normal duration of 0.12-0.2 seconds is the <strong>PR interval</strong><strong> </strong>(3 to 5 small boxes).</p>\n<p><strong>PR interval</strong> is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. It represents the time from the beginning of atrial depolarization to the beginning of ventricular depolarization. The physiologic delay imposed by stimulation of cells in the AV junction area is also measured in the PR interval. It is said to be <strong>prolonged if it is &gt; 0.2 seconds</strong>. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Interval 4</strong> as given in the image is the <strong>QT interval</strong>. It covers primarily the ventricular repolarization time but also ventricular depolarization. The QT interval is inversely proportional to the heart rate. Hence, a rate-related (“corrected”) QT interval, QTc, is calculated as QT/√R. This is called <strong>Bazett's formula.</strong> The <strong>normal duration of QTc</strong> is<strong> ≤0.44 s</strong> and upper normal limits as 0.45 s in men and 0.46 s in women according to some references.</p>\n<p>Option C -<strong> Interval 1</strong> as given in the image is the <strong>RR interval</strong>. It is used to calculate the heart rate. As the normal range of heart rate is 60 to 120 beats per minute, the duration of the RR interval is 0.6 to 1.2 seconds. </p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Interval 3</strong> is the <strong>QRS interval</strong> and is normally 100–110 ms or less.

It is characterized by a premature ventricular beat that induces a pause, followed by a sinus beat with a <strong>longer</strong> <strong>QT</strong> <strong>interval</strong>. The T wave is interrupted by a premature ventricular beat, which is the first beat of the polymorphic VT.</p>\n<p>Management of a patient with Torsade de Pointes if the tachycardia is <strong>stable</strong>, includes IV MgSO<sub>4,</sub> 1-2g over 5-60 minutes, followed by an infusion, which is highly effective for both treatment and prevention, of recurrence of long QT-related ventricular ectopic beats that trigger torsades de pointes. Discontinue the offending drug and correct electrolyte abnormalities. </p>\n<p>If this condition progresses into <strong>ventricular fibrillation</strong>, the appropriate course of action is to perform <strong>defibrillation</strong>. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Drugs causing QT prolongation and torsades de pointes</h3><p>Drugs Associated with QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes:</p>\n<p>Antiarrhythmics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sotalol</li>\n<li>Amiodarone</li>\n<li>Quinidine</li>\n<li>Procainamide</li>\n<li>Dofetilide</li>\n<li>Ibutilide</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antimicrobials:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Levofloxacin</li>\n<li>Ciprofloxacin</li>\n<li>Gatifloxacin</li>\n<li>Moxifloxacin</li>\n<li>Clarithromycin</li>\n<li>Erythromycin</li>\n<li>Ketoconazole</li>\n<li>Itraconazole</li>\n<li>Rilpivirine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antidepressants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amitriptyline</li>\n<li>Desipramine</li>\n<li>Imipramine</li>\n<li>Doxepin</li>\n<li>Fluoxetine</li>\n<li>Sertraline</li>\n<li>Venlafaxine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Antipsychotics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Haloperidol</li>\n<li>Droperidol</li>\n<li>Quetiapine</li>\n<li>Ziprasidone</li>\n<li>Thioridazine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Others:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cisapride</li>\n<li>Sumatriptan</li>\n<li>Zolmitriptan</li>\n<li>Arsenic</li>\n<li>Dolasetron</li>\n<li>Methadone<br />&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Anti-arrhythmic drugs</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7d6c4d5ed4a54f70b2030d71f3d06969x1280x1697.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Class of antiarrhythmic drugs&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Mechanism of action</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Effect on action potential duration</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Class I</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Class IA</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>Procainamide</span></p>\n<p><span>Quinidine</span></p>\n<p><span>Disopyramide</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Na+ channel blockers with significant K<sup>+</sup> channel blocking property</span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Prolonged</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Class IB</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>Lidocaine</span></p>\n<p><span>Mexiletine</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Na+ channel blockers with K<sup>+</sup> channel opening property&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Shortened or no effect</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Class IC</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>Flecainide</span></p>\n<p><span>Propafenone</span></p>\n<p><span>Moricizine</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Na+ channel blockers with negligible K<sup>+</sup> channel blocking property&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Variable or no effect</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Class II</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Propranolol</span></p>\n<p><span>Esmolol</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>&beta;- blockers</span></td>\n<td><span>-&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Class III</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Amiodarone, dronedarone</span></p>\n<p><span>Dofetilide</span></p>\n<p><span>Sotalol</span></p>\n<p><span>Ibutilide</span></p>\n<p><span>Vernakalant</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td><span>Prolonged&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Class IV</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Verapamil</span></p>\n<p><span>Diltiazem</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Adenosine</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Activates adenosine receptors</span></td>\n<td><span>Shortened</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Digoxin</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase inhibitor</span></td>\n<td><span>Increases AV node refractoriness</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Magnesium</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Unknown</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
