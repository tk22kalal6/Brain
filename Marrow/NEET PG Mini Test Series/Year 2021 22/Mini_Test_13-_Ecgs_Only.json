      "solution": "<p>A heart rate of <strong>less than 40 beats/minute</strong> is consistent with <strong>idioventricular rhythm</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Idioventricular rhythm</strong> occurs when <strong>both</strong> the <strong>sinoatrial</strong> node (SAN) and <strong>atrioventricular</strong> node (AVN) do not function. This leads to the <strong>Purkinje</strong> system taking over as a <strong>pacemaker</strong> to ensure ventricular contraction. The rate is usually less than 40 beats/minute. </p>\n<p>Causes of idioventricular rhythm include electrolyte abnormalities, <strong>digitoxin</strong> toxicity, anesthetic agents, cocaine, and isoprenaline. </p>\n<p>The usual findings of idioventricular rhythm include a heart rate of fewer than 40 beats per minute. The ECG may or may not have P waves. If there is a complete AVN block leading to sinus rhythm with idioventricular escape rhythm it will have P waves. Idioventricular rhythm without<strong> P waves </strong>is of poor prognosis. This usually proceeds a flat line. </p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A - A heart rate of more than 300 beats/minute is seen in <strong>atrial flutter.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C - A heart rate of 50 - 100 beats per minute is seen in <strong>normal sinus rhythm</strong> and <strong>accelerated idioventricular rhythm</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option A - A heart rate of more than 100 beats/ minute is seen in <strong>sinus tachycardia</strong> and <strong>non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. </strong></p>",
