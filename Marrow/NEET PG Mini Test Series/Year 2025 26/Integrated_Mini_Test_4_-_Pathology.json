Out of the atypical mycobacteria, Mycobacterium kansasii infection is a unique feature of hairy-cell leukemia.<br><br>Annexin A1 on bone marrow specimens has been shown to have 100% sensitivity and specificity in differentiating hairy cell leukemia from other B cell malignancies. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) stain is an important tool in the clinical diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia and yields positive results in ≈95% of the cases.<br><br>Hairy cells on Wright-stained peripheral blood smear is an important diagnostic finding. However, these can be seen in other B-cell disorders also. Typical hairy cells are mononuclear cells with abundant pale blue-grey agranular cytoplasm with elongated (hairy) projections.<br><br>Fried eggs in pathology:<br><br>* Oligodendroglioma on histopathology<br><br>* Hairy cell leukemia on bone marrow biopsy<br><br>* Seminoma/Dysgerminoma on light microscopy<br><br>* Mycoplasma pneumonia fried egg colonies on Eaton agar<br><br>Pearl PM1868: Immune Cell Antigens Detected by Monoclonal Antibodies<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><span class=\"TextRun SCXW86796565\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW86796565\">Antigen</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW86796565\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW86796565\"> </span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW86796565\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW86796565\">Designation</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW86796565\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW86796565\"> and their </span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW86796565\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW86796565\">Normal Cellular Distribution</span></span><span class=\"EOP SCXW86796565\"> </span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><span class=\"TextRun SCXW130168874\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW130168874\">Primarily T-Cell Associated</span></span><span class=\"EOP SCXW130168874\"> </span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li aria-setsize=\"-1\">CD1 Thymocytes and Langerhans cells </li>\n<li aria-setsize=\"-1\">CD3 Thymocytes, mature T cells </li>\n<li aria-setsize=\"-1\">CD4 Helper T cells, subset of thymocytes  </li>\n<li aria-setsize=\"-1\">CD5 T cells and a small subset of B cells  </li>\n<li aria-setsize=\"-1\">CD8 Cytotoxic T cells, subset of thymocytes, and some NK cells </li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><span class=\"TextRun SCXW177769382\" lang=\"EN-GB\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW177769382\">Primarily B-Cell Associated</span></span></strong><span class=\"EOP SCXW177769382\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li aria-setsize=\"-1\">CD10 Pre-B cells and germinal-center B cells </li>\n<li aria-setsize=\"-1\">CD19 Pre-B cells and mature B cells, but not plasma cells </li>\n<li aria-setsize=\"-1\">CD20 Pre-B cells after CD19 and mature B cells, but not plasma cells </li>\n<li aria-setsize=\"-1\">CD21 EBV receptor;

Patients experience extensive skin damage resembling systemic sclerosis, cholestatic jaundice, and esophageal strictures.

Thrombo-embolic complications in nephrotic syndrome are due to the loss of endogenous anticoagulants such as antithrombin III in the urine.<br><br>Nephrotic syndrome is a condition that occurs due to damage in the glomerular capillary walls thereby leading to increased capillary permeability to plasma proteins. The manifestations and the mechanisms of nephrotic syndrome are:<br><br>* Massive proteinuria (>3.5 grams) as a result of leakage in the barrier formed by glomerular basement membrane, endothelium, and visceral epithelial cells.<br><br>* Hypoalbuminemia (albumin <3g/dL) occurs as a consequence of proteinuria. Also, increased catabolism of the kidney contributes to hypoalbuminemia. <br><br>* Generalized edema is seen. The edema is soft and pitting seen in periorbital and dependent portions of the body. It occurs as a result of decreased intravascular colloid osmotic pressure and other factors like sodium and water retention lead to edema. <br><br>* Hyperlipidemia occurs following the increased synthesis of lipoproteins, lipid particles, and decreased catabolism of lipids.<br><br>* Lipiduria is due to leakage of lipids through the glomerular capillary wall.<br><br>Increased susceptibility to infections is another complication.

The most common causes of DIC are obstetric complications like amniotic fluid embolisms and retained products of conception.

Normal aPTT is 25–35 seconds. A relatively rare cause of prolonged aPTT is the presence of antibodies against coagulation plasma proteins called inhibitors. It can be seen due to the following reasons: Hemophilia A and B patients receiving clotting factors to control their bleeding episodes, Pregnancy, Autoimmune diseases, Malignancies (lymphoma, prostate cancer), and Dermatologic conditions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thrombin time (TT)</td>\n<td>It is used for testing the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin and depends on adequate fibrinogen levels. </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bleeding time (BT)</td>\n<td>It is the time taken for a standardized skin puncture to stop bleeding. It tests the ability of blood vessels to constrict and platelets to form a hemostatic plug. </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fibrin degradation products (FDPs)</td>\n<td>They are used to assess the fibrinolytic activity, and they are increased in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
