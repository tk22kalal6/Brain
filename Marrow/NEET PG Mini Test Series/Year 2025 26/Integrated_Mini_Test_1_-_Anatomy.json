The median arcuate ligament is a band of fibrous tissue that connects the diaphragmatic crura anteriorly to the aortic hiatus. A lower diaphragmatic crura insertion or a higher celiac artery origin is likely to cause MALS. Sometimes median arcuate ligament crosses the lower abdominal aorta causing compression.<br><br>It is more common in females in the 3rd to 5th decade of life. Symptoms include postprandial symptoms including pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss.<br><br>CT angiography (CTA) aids in the diagnosis by enabling the visualization of the compressed celiac artery in 3D. Duplex ultrasonography can also be performed, but it is operator-dependent.<br><br>Treatment aims to decompress the celiac trunk using open, laparoscopic, or robotic methods in addition to adjuvant interventional procedures such as stenting and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/eba4c18ebe494f508422079bc6531d2bx1279x1382.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Wilkie syndrome is associated with obstruction of the 3rd part of the duodenum due to the decreased angle between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the aorta. <br><br>Option B: May Thurner syndrome is associated with compression of the left iliac vein at the point where the right iliac artery crosses over it.

      "solution": "The most likely site of brain herniation leading to this presentation is '3' (uncal herniation).<br><br>The given clinical scenario with a unilateral pupillary dilatation with signs of ipsilateral upper motor neuron (UMN) palsy [Babinski's sign positive], is suggestive of Kernohan's notch phenomenon, which can occur due to uncal herniation.<br><br>Herniation of the uncus (anterior medial temporal gyrus) from the supratentorial to the infratentorial region results in compression of the ipsilateral third cranial nerve. This results in pupillary dilatation of the same side (parasympathetic fibers are present superficially in the nerve).<br><br>As the herniation progresses, the contralateral midbrain and thus the contralateral cerebral peduncle gets compressed against the tentorial edge on that side. This presents as a UMN palsy of the same side as uncal herniation with a positive Babinski's sign. Normally the side opposite the herniation would be expected to show hemiparesis but when the same side shows hemiparesis as explained above, it is termed as Kernohan's notch.<br><br>Kernohan's notch is a false localizing sign because even though the herniation is on the ipsilateral side of the brain, the hemiparesis may present ipsilaterally because of compression of descending tracts on the opposite side. For example, a patient with left side herniation would be expected to present with right side paresis, but due to Kernohan's notch, he may present with left side paresis.<br><br>Subfalcine herniation (labeled 1) refers to the herniation of the cingulate gyrus under the falx cerebri. It presents initially with headache. Once it compresses the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery it can result in contralateral lower limb weakness. This type of herniation does not involve the pupillary functions.<br><br>Central herniation/central transtentorial herniation(labeled 4) would present with the initial signs of mitotic pupils and drowsiness due to the downward displacement of the thalamic structures through the tentorial opening, resulting in compression of the upper midbrain. It can later progress to damage the pons and medulla as well.<br><br>Foraminal herniation (labeled 2) refers to the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. This results in early compression of the medulla, leading to respiratory arrest and death.<br><br><img
