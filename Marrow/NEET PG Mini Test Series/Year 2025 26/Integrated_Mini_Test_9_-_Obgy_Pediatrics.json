Severe itching can occur before any skin lesions become apparent. Initially, erythematous urticarial papules and plaques typically develop on the abdomen, characteristically involving the periumbilical region, and later progress to tense blisters, resembling bullous pemphigoid. Complement-fixing IgG antibodies against BP 180 antigen of the hemidesmosomes at the dermoepidermal junction are responsible for the linear immunofluorescence.<br><br>Other options :<br><br>Option A: Although bullous pemphigoid can cause tense blisters with linear immunofluorescence, it presents in the older age group. The history of pregnancy and involvement of the umbilicus make the diagnosis of pemphigoid gestationis more likely.<br><br>Option B:  Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy is another pruritic inflammatory condition affecting pregnancy. It typically starts on the abdomen, often within the striae distensae if present, with severely pruritic urticarial papules that coalesce into plaques, spreading to the buttocks and proximal thighs. However, it spares the umbilicus and never develops into blisters.

The radiological finding obtained on the barium study is a windsock deformity.<br><br>In Type I duodenal atresia (duodenal web), the mucosa and submucosa form a thin, distensible membrane that may contain a small central aperture. Repeated peristaltic forces cause this membrane to balloon distally, producing a sac-like intraluminal projection known as a windsock web. On contrast study, this appears as a windsock deformity.<br><br>Duodenal atresia is the blockade of the duodenum caused due to the failure of the vacuolization of the solid duodenum. It is usually identified during the prenatal ultrasound, where it shows the presence of a double bubble sign. If the atresia goes unnoticed during the prenatal period, the babies usually present with bilious vomiting soon after birth. This is because the obstruction is distal to the ampulla of Vater in most cases. Non-bilious vomiting would favour a more proximal obstruction, such as in congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.<br><br>The plain abdominal radiograph shows a typical double-bubble sign:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5b2d88f93f4945b1a794e1654315ad21x400x505.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Three types of duodenal atresia are described as follows:<br><br>Type I: most common; mucosal web with intact muscle wall (so-called windsock deformity)\nType II: two ends separated by a fibrous cord, but muscle continuity present\nType III: complete separation of two ends with a gap within the duodenum<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a5b8decd3d1b470a9883a4c7854bb1e3x1279x1159.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Intestinal obstruction from atresias, more common in the jejunum, presents with hypoactive bowel sounds, abdominal distension, and bilious emesis. Proximal atresia shows less distension but significant emesis, with air-fluid levels and absent distal gas on radiographs. Distal atresia causes more distension. Initial management includes nasogastric decompression, IV fluids, and parenteral nutrition. Evaluation for associated anomalies includes echocardiography, renal ultrasound, and chest/spine radiographs.

This vascular pattern and finding on TVS is also seen with corpus luteum cysts, although the wall is less echogenic compared to a tubal ectopic. <br><br>The fallopian tubes are the most common site for ectopic pregnancy. It should be suspected in any female of reproductive age presenting with an acute abdomen, and a urine pregnancy test should be performed for all such patients. Tubal ectopic pregnancy may be diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), which will show the tubal ring sign, also called the bagel sign or blob sign. It refers to the appearance of a gestational sac in the adnexa with a hyperechoic ring. Doppler imaging reveals the flow of blood in the periphery of the sac, which gives the ring of fire appearance.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/580a0e1ec32a4a73ba72d6530ac2f6edx512x935.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Molar pregnancy is associated with snowstorm appearance on ultrasound.<br><br>Option B: Dichorioinic twin pregnancy is associated with twin peak or lambda sign on ultrasound.<br><br>Option D: Intrauterine death is associated with Spalding sign on ultrasound.<br><br>Pearl PM2262: Radiological Signs in Obstetrics<br><br>Bagel Sign (USG)<br><br>It is seen in unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy.
