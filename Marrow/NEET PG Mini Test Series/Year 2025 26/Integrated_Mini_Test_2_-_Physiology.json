This is because visual information is not processed and transmitted to the Wernicke area.<br><br>The angular gyrus processes information from words that are read in such a way that they can be converted into the auditory forms of the words in Wernicke's area. When a lesion damages the angular gyrus, without affecting Wernicke or Broca areas:<br><br>* Speech is intact<br><br>* Comprehension is intact<br><br>* Repetition is intact<br><br>* Confrontation naming impaired (there is difficulty in understanding written language or pictures)<br><br>* Word-finding and spelling are impaired. <br><br>The lesion sites can be anywhere within the left hemisphere language network, including the angular gyrus, middle and inferior temporal gyri. Anomic aphasia is commonly seen in the following conditions:<br><br>* Alzheimer's disease<br><br>* Metabolic encephalopathy<br><br>* Head trauma<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Wernicke’s area is located at the parieto-temporal junction. A lesion here causes fluent aphasia. The speech itself is normal but it is full of jargon and neologisms that make little sense. The patient also fails to comprehend the meaning of spoken or written words, so other aspects of the use of language are compromised.<br><br>Option C: Lesions at the superior temporal gyrus cause pure word deafness. Comprehension of spoken language and repetition is impaired. Naming and fluency is preserved. Most commonly due to bilateral or left-sided MCA strokes<br><br>Option D: Lesions at the right inferior temporal lobe can cause prosopagnosia, which is the inability to recognize faces.

      "solution": "Diuresis results in decreased ECF, increased ICF, and reduced plasma sodium, leading to hypoosmotic volume contraction.<br><br>Diuresis causes loss of both water and sodium, with a greater proportion of water being excreted. This triggers the release of vasopressin, which facilitates the reabsorption of free water in the collecting ducts. Consequently, plasma osmolarity becomes hypotonic, causing fluid to shift into the intracellular compartment to restore osmolar balance.<br><br>As a result, the  ICF volume increases, while the ECF volume remains low due to both translocation to the ICF and diuretic loss. Despite the reduced ECF volume, plasma sodium levels are also low.<br><br>Diuretic overuse → Sodium & water loss → ↓ECF volume, ↓ECF osmolarity → Water shifts into cells → ↑ICF volume + ↓Plasma Na⁺.<br><br>A similar picture is seen in adrenal insufficiency.  In adrenal insufficiency, the key defect is aldosterone deficiency (low mineralocorticoid activity):<br><br>* ↓ Aldosterone → ↓ Na⁺ reabsorption + ↑ Na⁺ loss in urine → ↓ECF sodium content → ↓ECF volume.<br><br>* Plasma osmolarity falls (hyponatremia) because Na⁺ is the main ECF osmole.<br><br>* Hypoosmolar ECF draws water into ICF → ↑ICF volume. <br><br>Diuretic abuse has been documented in patients with bulimia and in athletes. It is often driven by the desire for rapid weight loss, fluid depletion, or meeting weight-class requirements. In bulimia, diuretic misuse often coexists with laxative abuse and vomiting, compounding risks. In athletes, it is considered doping and carries both medical and legal consequences.<br><br>Other Options:<br><br>Option A: This is seen in cases of hypoosmotic volume expansion like in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and bronchogenic tumors. <br><br>SIADH is associated with euvolemic hyponatremia. This leads to a decrease in the osmolarity of the ECF. This causes a fluid shift from the ECF to the ICF until the osmolarity of both compartments becomes equal. The fluid influx also leads to a decrease in the ICF's osmolarity. Therefore, the net effect is an increase in extracellular volume, an increase in intracellular volume, and a fall in osmolarity in both compartments.<br><br>Option B: This is seen in cases of hyperosmotic volume contraction like in diabetes insipidus and excessive sweating. <br><br>Option D: This is seen in cases of hyperosmotic volume expansion like in high NaCl intake. The addition of excess NaCl to ECF pulls the fluid from ICF into the ECF. This results in a decreased volume of ICF, increased volume of ECF, and increased osmolarity in both ECF and ICF.<br><br>The illustration given below shows the Darrow-Yannet diagram in various conditions.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/16bb3190a1af49888158514d108b001ax1279x1689.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM0463: Distribution of body fluids<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Type</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>ECF volume</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>ICF volume</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Osmolarity</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Hematocrit</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Plasma proteins</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Isosmotic volume contraction</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Diarrhea,</p>\n<p>Burns</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No change</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No change</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hyperosmotic volume contraction</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sweating,</p>\n<p>Fever,</p>\n<p>Diabetes insipidus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No change</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hyposmotic volume contraction</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Adrenal insufficiency</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Isosmotic volume expansion</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Infusion of isotonic NaCl</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No change</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No change</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hyperosmotic volume expansion</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>High NaCl intake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hyposmotic volume expansion</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>SIADH</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↑</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No change</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>↓</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

This causes the accumulation of toxic metabolites and depletion of intra-cellular energy that further leads to neuronal injury and death.<br><br>Therapeutic Hypothermia involves systemic cooling to achieve a core temperature of 33.5°C within the first 6 hours after birth, for a period of 72 hours. This causes a reduction in the rate of production of toxic compounds and reduces seizure activity, thereby favoring cerebro-protection, especially in HIE due to intrapartum insult. It has been shown to reduce mortality and neuro-development impairment. In adults, therapeutic hypothermia also has a role in the treatment of cardiac arrest to prevent global cerebral ischemia.<br><br>The clinical grading is based on Sarnat & Sarnat Staging and HIE is
