The ectatic portion is detected by fundoscopy and B-scan ultrasonography. Indirect ophthalmoscopy shows a <strong>posterior outward curvature of the globe</strong> seen as a crescentic shadow in the macular region. The retinal vessels dip down into the region. The staphylomatous area appears pale due to degeneration of the retina, pigment epithelium, and occasionally the choroid. The most common cause is <strong>degenerative high axial myopia</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Anterior</strong> staphyloma: It is characterized by <strong>ectasia of the pseudo-cornea,</strong> which occurs after the total sloughing of the cornea. It is lined internally by the iris and externally by the newly formed epithelium. The most common cause is a <strong>perforated sloughing corneal ulcer</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Intercalary</strong> staphyloma: This is located <strong>at the limbus</strong> and is lined by the root of the iris and the anterior-most part of the ciliary body.
