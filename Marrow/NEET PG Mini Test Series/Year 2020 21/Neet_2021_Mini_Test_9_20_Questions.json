American Heart Association recommends the&nbsp;intraosseous IO route as an alternative to an intravenous route in order to deliver drugs and fluids, especially in children. This is because intraosseous access can easily be made in 30-60 seconds and thus provide emergency vascular access.</p>\n<p>The fluids are administered under pressure because of the resistance to fluid flow from the IO catheter into the IO space. The disadvantage with this route is the risk of osteomyelitis, compartment syndrome, bone marrow, or fat embolism. IO access is superior to the endotracheal route for cardiac resuscitation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Absolute contraindications<br />As the technique is primarily indicated in life-threatening emergencies, there are relatively few absolute contraindications to intraosseous (IO) infusions. If possible, IO cannulation should be avoided in the following patients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A fractured bone or previously penetrated bone cannot be used because fluids will exit through the fracture or puncture site.</li>\n<li>An extremity with vascular interruption, either from trauma or cutdown attempt, is not suitable for IO infusion because the fluid or drugs administered into the bone marrow will<br />leak through the open blood vessel.</li>\n</ul>",
