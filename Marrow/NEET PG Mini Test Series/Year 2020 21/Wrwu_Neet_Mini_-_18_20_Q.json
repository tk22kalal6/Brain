However, <strong>fertility may be reduced</strong> as amputation of the cervix may cause :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loss of cervical mucus</li>\n<li>Incompetent cervical os</li>\n<li>Habitual abortions</li>\n<li>Preterm deliveries. </li>\n<li>Excessive fibrosis leading to cervical stenosis and dystocia during labor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option B: Le forte's repair is done for the very elderly menopausal patient with an advanced prolapse, or for those who are unfit for any major surgical procedure.</p>\n<p>Under sedation and local anesthesia, or epidural anesthesia, the flaps of the vagina from the anterior and posterior vaginal walls are excised and sutured together. This creates a wide area of adhesion in the midline preventing the uterus from prolapsing. Small tunnels on either side are left, permitting drainage of discharge. It is not done for women who are leading an active sexual life, menstruating women, diseased cervix, and uterus. Prior to the procedure, a Pap smear and pelvic sonography should be done to exclude possible pelvic pathology. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a588c804f1284f4aa2f15fa56c133d42x1280x2558.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Management of Uterine prolapse</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Treatment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nulliparous or congenital prolapse&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Abdominal sling operations:</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 374\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>Abdominal wall cervicopexy</li>\n<li>Shirodkar&rsquo;s abdominal sling operation</li>\n<li>Khanna&rsquo;s abdominal sling operation</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pregnancy and postnatal period</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ring pessary (up to 16 weeks period of gestation)</li>\n<li>Pelvic floor exercises</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&lt;40 years&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Fothergill's repair (Manchester operation)</li>\n<li>Shirodkar's procedure</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&gt;40 years - with completed family&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Vaginal hysterectomy and pelvic floor repair&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&gt;60 years - unfit for surgery&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Le Fort's repair</li>\n<li>Colpocleisis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are done if the patient doesn't want to retain sexual function&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It is exaggerated if there is dehydration associated.</p>\n<p><strong>Carotid sinus baroreceptors</strong> sense the arterial hypotension and trigger afferent fibers that send autonomic signals resulting in an increase in heart rate and contractility, while pressure receptors in the left ventricular wall send signals that trigger paradoxical bradycardia and decreased contractility. This results in suddenly marked hypotension and the individual feels lightheaded and may lose consciousness for a brief period.</p>\n<p><strong>The activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibres</strong> in the cardiopulmonary region (e.g. Juxta capillary region of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary artery) that causes profound <strong>brady&shy;cardia, hypotension and a brief period of apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing is the Bezold Jarisch reflex.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>It can be elicited by :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Substance like capsaicin, serotonin, phenylbiguanide, veratridine</li>\n<li>myocardial ischemia and reperfusion as a result of increased production of oxygen radicals&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Radiocontrast agents for coronary angiography</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Option A</strong>: Tachycardia following acute volume overload is due to the <strong>Bainbridge Reflex</strong>. The stretch receptors of the atria that elicit the Bainbridge reflex transmit their afferent signals through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain.&nbsp;Efferent signals are then transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase heart rate and strength of heart contraction.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B</strong>: Hypertension following a head injury is due to the <strong>Cushing Reflex</strong>. When the intracranial pressure is increased, the blood supply to RVLM neurons is compromised. The local hypoxia and hypercapnia cause an increase in discharge from the neurons, producing hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respiration.&nbsp;The resultant rise in systemic arterial pressure tends to restore the blood flow to the medulla.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C:</strong> Apnea followed by rapid breathing after iv capsaicin is due to the <strong>J Reflex</strong>. C fiber-endings close to the pulmonary vessels are called&nbsp;J (juxtacapillary) receptors. These receptors are stimulated by hyperinflation of the lungs or intravenous administration of capsaicin. The reflex produced is apnea followed by rapid breathing, bradycardia, and hypotension. This is called the&nbsp;J reflex or <strong>pulmonary</strong> chemoreflex. A similar response is produced by receptors in the <strong>heart</strong> (Bezold-Jarisch reflex or the <strong>coronary</strong> chemoreflex).</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Flooding is not a part of systematic desensitization.</p>\n<p><strong>Systematic desensitization&nbsp;</strong>is based on the behavioral principle of <strong>counterconditioning</strong> and was developed by Joseph Wolpe. Counterconditioning involves a <strong>gradual approach</strong> to a <strong>feared situation</strong>, in a psychophysiological state that inhibits anxiety, to overcome the maladaptive anxiety elicited by that situation. It works best in cases of a clearly identifiable anxiety-provoking stimulus. It has been successfully used in the treatment of phobias, obsessions, compulsions, and certain sexual disorders.</p>\n<p>It consists of three steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relaxation training</strong> - Patients attain a state of complete relaxation and are then exposed to the stimulus that elicits the anxiety response. Relaxation methods like <strong>yoga</strong>, <strong>progressive relaxation</strong>, <strong>hypnosis</strong>, and <strong>mental imagery</strong> can be used. The physiological changes during the relaxation process; slow heart rate, increased peripheral blood flow, and neuromuscular stability; are opposite to that of the adrenergic response invoked during anxiety. The relaxed state inhibits the negative reaction of anxiety associated with the phobia and this is known as <strong>reciprocal inhibition</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Hierarchy construction&nbsp;</strong>- The therapist determines all the conditions that elicit anxiety and the patients prepare a <strong>graded list or hierarchy</strong> of 10-12 fear-provoking scenes in the order of increasing anxiety.</li>\n<li><strong>Desensitization of the stimulus&nbsp;</strong>- Patients proceed systematically through the list from the least to the most anxiety-provoking scene while in a deeply relaxed state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Flooding</strong>&nbsp;involves repeated and prolonged exposure to fear cues of high intensity<strong>&nbsp;without</strong>&nbsp;a<strong>&nbsp;hierarchy</strong>. It is based on the premise that anxiety gets reinforced by conditioning when the patient escapes from the anxiety-provoking situation. Patients are encouraged to face the feared situations directly and are prevented from escaping. There is <strong>no gradual build-up</strong> or use of relaxation techniques.</p>\n<p>Phobia refers to&nbsp;<strong>excessive fear</strong>&nbsp;of a specific circumstance, situation, or object. A&nbsp;<strong>specific phobia</strong>&nbsp;is a strong and per&shy;sisting fear of a particular situation or an object.&nbsp;<strong>Exposure</strong>&nbsp;or<strong>&nbsp;anticipation</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>contact</strong>&nbsp;with the situation/object triggers an&nbsp;<strong>anxiety reaction</strong>. This inadvertently leads to&nbsp;<strong>panic attacks</strong> in people who are susceptible. The person goes to great lengths to avoid this situation or object. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (DSM-5), &nbsp;phobias are classified under&nbsp;<strong>Anxiety disorders</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Behavior therapy</strong> is considered the <strong>most effective</strong> treatment for phobias. Systemic desensitization is the most common behavior therapy used for phobias. Other modes of treatment of phobias include insight-oriented psychotherapy, virtual therapy, hypnosis, and family therapy.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Anxiety disorders</h3><div>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Disorder&nbsp;</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Feature</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Panic disorder</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>1.
