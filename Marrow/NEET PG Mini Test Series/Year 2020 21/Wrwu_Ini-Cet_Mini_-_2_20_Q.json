By this definition, it is evident that if a substance is <strong>completely cleared</strong> from the plasma in a unit of time, then the <strong>clearance</strong> of the substance <strong>will be equal</strong> to that of <strong>renal plasma flow</strong>. Eg. <strong>para-amino hippuric acid</strong>. It is around 90% cleared from the kidneys. Therefore it is used in the calculation of RPF.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Therefore, RPF will be equal to the clearance of PAH (C<sub>PAH</sub>) which is given by the formula,</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">C<sub>PAH</sub>= (U<sub>PAH</sub> X V)/P<sub>PAH&nbsp;</sub></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Where&nbsp;P<sub>PAH</sub><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span>is the plasma concentration of the PAH, U<sub>PAH</sub><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span>is the urine concentration of PAH, and V is the urine flow rate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By this, we can understand that it is directly proportional to the urinary concentration of PAH and inversely proportional to the plasma concentration. The substances which are secreted have a transport maximum which is the maximum limit of the rate of secretion. Once this is achieved, the urinary concentration of the solute will remain constant. Therefore, when <strong>higher doses</strong> of PAH are administered, the <strong>plasma concentration rises</strong>, but the <strong>urine concentration will remain constant</strong>. This will lead to a falsely low estimation of RPF.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Formulae in renal physiology</h3><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 355\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<table><colgroup><col /><col /><col /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Term</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Equation</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Clearance rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>U<sub>s</sub> &times;V / P<sub>s</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Glomerular filtration rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>U<sub>inulin</sub> &times; V / P<sub>inulin</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Clearance ratio</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>C<sub>s</sub>/C<sub>inulin</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Effective renal plasma flow</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>E<sub>RPF</sub>=C<sub>PAH</sub>=U<sub>PAH</sub> &times;V / P<sub>PAH</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Renal blood flow</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>RPF / (1&minus; Hematocrit)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Excretion rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>U<sub>s</sub> &times;V</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Reabsorption rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>=Filtered load &minus;Excretion rate</p>\n<p>=(GFR&times;P<sub>s</sub>)&minus;(U<sub>s</sub> &times;V)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Secretion rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Excretion rate&minus;Filtered load</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Cs - clearance rate of substance &ldquo;s&rdquo;</p>\n<p>EPAH&nbsp; - PAH extraction ratio</p>\n<p>ERPF - effective renal plasma flow</p>\n<p>GFR - glomerular filtration rate</p>\n<p>P - plasma concentration</p>\n<p>PAH - para-aminohippuric acid</p>\n<p>PPAH - renal arterial PAH concentration</p>\n<p>RBF - renal blood flow</p>\n<p>RPF - renal plasma flow</p>\n<p>S - a substance</p>\n<p>U - urine concentration</p>\n<p>V - urine flow rate</p>\n<p>VPAH - renal venous PAH concentration</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
