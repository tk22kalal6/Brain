In secondary dysmenorrhea, treating the cause is needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Fibromyalgia</strong> is a disorder with diffuse musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood issues. It is <strong>associated with</strong>&nbsp;irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, and depression. There is <strong>no cure</strong> for fibromyalgia as of now, although the symptoms can be controlled by medications.&nbsp;Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals.</p>",
