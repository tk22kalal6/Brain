The defect in this enzyme will lead to the accumulation of homogentisic acid that  oxidizes into benzoquinone acetate. Later, benzoquinone acetate polymerizes and binds to tissues (especially collagen fibres).</p>\n<p>This oxidation process produces free radicals that cause tissue damage and incite inflammation.

This patient's clinical picture of amenorrhea, short stature, webbed neck,&nbsp;low posterior hairline, widely spaced nipples, and lack of secondary sexual characteristics is seen in <strong>Turner's syndrome.</strong> Turner's syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality with partial or complete monosomy of the X chromosome (45+XO).</p>\n<p>In Turner's syndrome, <strong>gonadal dysgenesis</strong> causes primary ovarian failure that is <strong>hypogonadism</strong>. The levels of follicle-stimulating hormone<strong> (FSH), </strong>and luteinizing hormone <strong>(LH)&nbsp;</strong>are indicative of the cause of hypogonadism. Increased levels of FSH and LH as seen in this patient are indicative of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is defined as 1) a decrease or absence in ovarian function and 2) due to absent negative sex-steroid feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The pathophysiology in Turner's syndrome is<strong>&nbsp;</strong>primary hypergonadotropic hypogonadism where there is&nbsp;<strong>oocyte</strong>&nbsp;<strong>atresia</strong> and the replacement of ovaries by <strong>fibrous streaks.</strong> This causes a decrease in serum estrogen levels which by <strong>negative feedback</strong>&nbsp;causes a <strong>rise in g</strong>onadotropin-releasing hormone<strong> (GnRH), </strong><strong>FSH, </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>LH </strong>(gonadotropic hormones)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>as seen in this patient. <strong>Hypogonadism with</strong> a <strong>rise</strong> in <strong>gonadotropic hormones</strong> is known as <strong>hypergonadotropic hypogonadism</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option (B): <strong>Secondary hypergonadotropic hypogonadism</strong>&nbsp;patients also present with primary ovarian failure with increased levels of FSH and LH.

This patient has no history suggestive of a secondary cause.</p>\n<p>Options (C and D):<strong> Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism</strong> results when there is a primary <strong>abnormality</strong> in the <strong>hypothalamic-pituitary axis</strong>. Loss of hypothalamic function causes a decrease in the production of GnRH or pituitary dysfunction causes <strong>decreased</strong> production of <strong>FSH and LH</strong> which results in decreased ovarian function and reduced serum estrogen levels. It can be divided into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inherited hypothalamic abnormalities:&nbsp;<strong>Kallmann's syndrome</strong>&nbsp;(Option C)</li>\n<li>Acquired (functional) hypothalamic dysfunction:&nbsp;<strong>eating disorders</strong>, in patients who <strong>exercise excessively</strong>, and during <strong>periods of stress </strong>(Option D). Although this patient is an athlete, her FSH and LH levels are increased suggesting hypergonadotropism.</li>\n</ul>",
