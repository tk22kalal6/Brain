The symptoms are <strong>not intentionally produced</strong> and the gain obtained is primarily psychological. </p>\n<p>It can be associated with <strong>depressive disorders</strong>, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and somatization disorders.

It presents with a <strong>reddish vitreous mass</strong> and can lead to <strong>vision loss</strong> and complications like <strong>retinal detachment</strong>.
