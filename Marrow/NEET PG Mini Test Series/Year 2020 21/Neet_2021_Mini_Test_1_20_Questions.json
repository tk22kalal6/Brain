Re-evaluation should be done after birth and in cases presenting with <strong>symptoms of recurrent UTI, palpable flank mass or pain, urinary obstruction, and in cases of failure to thrive</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the hydronephrosis is persistent, its <strong>severity</strong> is <strong>graded</strong> by the extent of the dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system and parenchymal thickness. It needs to be ascertained whether the other kidney is involved, the lower ureter is dilated, the bladder wall is thickened, and whether emptying of the bladder is incomplete. Based on these findings, a diagnosis can be made.</p>\n<p>In cases of hydronephrosis, <strong>long-standing urine stasis</strong> and pressure may <strong>damage the kidney</strong>s.</p>\n<p>The causes of UPJ obstruction are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intrinsic (due to an adynamic or stenotic segment of the proximal ureter) or&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Extrinsic (e.g. compression by accessory renal arteries). This needs to be corrected primarily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The renal anatomy and function can be assessed using <strong>radioscintigraphy</strong> studies. The&nbsp;<strong>investigation of choice</strong>&nbsp;for UPJ obstruction is<strong>&nbsp;</strong><sup>99m</sup>Tc-MercaptoAcetyl-triGlycine<strong>&nbsp;(MAG3) scan.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Micturating cystourethrogram</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;investigation of choice in&nbsp;<strong>vesicoureteric reflux.</strong> <sup>99m</sup>Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid&nbsp;<strong>(DMSA) scan</strong>&nbsp;is used for assessing&nbsp;<strong>renal scarring</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> of intrinsic UPJ obstruction is done <strong>surgically if renal function is compromised</strong> or if there is bilateral involvement of the kidneys. In other cases, <strong>serial follow-up with ultrasonography</strong> is done to assess the spontaneous resolution of hydronephrosis.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Vesicoureteral reflux</strong> is the <strong>second most common</strong> cause of hydronephrosis after UPJ obstruction.&nbsp;In vesicoureteric reflux, the&nbsp;valve that prevents the backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter is defective;&nbsp;hence, abnormal <strong>backflow of urine</strong> occurs <strong>from</strong> the&nbsp;<strong>bladder</strong> into the <strong>ureter</strong>. It may also present with hydronephrosis; however, the distal ureter is also involved, unlike in this case.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Ureterocele</strong> is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, thought to result from the persistence of the membrane between the ureteral bud and urogenital sinus. Since the distal urinary tract is normal-looking in this case, this diagnosis is unlikely.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Posterior urethral valve</strong> is an <strong>obstructing membrane</strong> in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in-utero&nbsp;development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. As a result, bilateral hydronephrosis and bladder dilatation is seen, unlike the unilateral involvement in this case.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of Hydronephrosis</h3><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1306\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1306\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Unilateral hydronephrosis</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Extramural obstruction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tumor from adjacent structures, e.g., cervix, prostate, rectum, colon, or cecum</li>\n<li>Retrocaval ureter</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Aberrant renal vessels</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond&rsquo;s disease)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Intramural obstruction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Congenital PUJ obstruction</strong> - most common congenital cause</li>\n<li>Congenital stenosis</li>\n<li>Ureterocele</li>\n<li>Ureteric stricture - iatrogenic/ inflammatory</li>\n<li>Neoplasm of the ureter or bladder involving the ureteric orifice</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Intraluminal obstruction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Renal stones</strong> - most common acquired unilateral cause</li>\n<li>Sloughed papilla in papillary necrosis (especially, in patients with diabetes, analgesic abuse, or sickle cell disease)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><strong><span><span>Bilateral hydronephrosis</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Congenital</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span>Posterior urethral valves (associated with pulmonary hypoplasia)</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Urethral atresia</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>PUJ obstruction</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Acquired &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Benign prostatic hypertrophy or carcinoma of the prostate</li>\n<li>Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis <span><span>(Ormond's disease)</span></span></li>\n<li>Postoperative bladder neck scarring</li>\n<li>Urethral stricture</li>\n<li>Phimosis</li>\n</ul>",

Parents must be <strong>reassured</strong> and explained about the condition.</p>\n<p>Mongolian spots are <strong>benign blue or slate-grey macular lesions</strong>, with <strong>clearly defined margins</strong>, that appear over the presacral region (most common), posterior thighs, legs, back, and forearms. These spots occur due to the presence of <strong>melanin-containing melanocytes</strong> in the dermis, which is arrested during the migration from neural crest cells to the epidermis. They are <strong>non-tender</strong> and do not rapidly change in colour or size. They <strong>do not require any treatment</strong> and fade by age 1-6 years of age.</p>\n<p>Congenital dermal melanocytosis is a <strong>clinical diagnosis.</strong> Since this baby has a classic presentation of mongolian spots, skin biopsy is not required for diagnosis. Topical steroid application has no role in the treatment of dermal melanocytosis.</p>\n<p>Grey-baby syndrome is caused by the increased levels of chloramphenicol in the baby, when a breastfeeding mother is treated with chloramphenicol. It is characterized by abdominal distension, flaccidity, cyanosis appearing as ashen-gray color, circulatory collapse and death. This baby has stable vital signs and the bluish-gray discoloration is limited to the buttocks, ruling out gray-baby syndrome. This baby's mother must have received alternate antibiotics for typhoid. Hence, serum chlroramphenicol levels need not be measured.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Benign findings in a newborn</h3><p><strong>1.

Hence, a part of the right ventricle is now located above the tricuspid valve. This is called atrialization of the ventricle. There can be associated tricuspid regurgitation with or without stenosis. Chest x-ray findings depend on the degree to which the tricuspid valve is displaced downwards.

      "solution": "<p>In the given scenario, the patient has <strong>mild depressive symptoms </strong>within the <strong>first week </strong>of <strong>delivery</strong>. So the most likely diagnosis is <strong>postpartum blues</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Postpartum blues, also called <strong>maternity blues</strong>, typically develop <strong>within one week </strong>of <strong>delivery, </strong>usually on the fourth or fifth postpartum day. The affected mothers are <strong>emotionally labile</strong> and the symptoms include changes in mood, <strong>sudden crying outbursts</strong>, and a <strong>lack </strong>of<strong> interest</strong> in the<strong> baby</strong>. They may also have insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and irritability.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These feelings have been ascribed to rapid changes in women's hormonal levels, the stress of childbirth, and the awareness of the increased responsibility that motherhood brings. This usually <strong>resolves spontaneously</strong> within <strong>10-14 days</strong>. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Management involves <strong>reassurance, education, </strong>and <strong>support.</strong> The patient must be followed-up and assessed for the possible development of a major depressive disorder.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option B: Symptoms should<strong> persist </strong>for<strong> &gt;2 weeks</strong> to make the diagnosis of <strong>post-partum depression.</strong> A <strong>minimum</strong> of <strong>5 symptoms</strong> of major depressive disorder i.e. impaired sleep, interest, guilt, energy, concentration, appetite, psychomotor activity, and suicidal ideation must be present. This patient is able to do her daily chores, enjoys watching TV, has a good appetite, and does not have guilt or suicidal ideation. Although this patient has disturbed sleep and fatigue, these are common physiological postpartum findings.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C:<strong> Post-partum psychosis</strong> is a <strong>psychiatric</strong> <strong>emergency</strong> and usually has a mean time of onset is <strong>2-3</strong> <strong>weeks postpartum</strong>. The predominant symptoms are <strong>hallucinations</strong>, <strong>delusions</strong>, <strong>suicidal</strong> <strong>thoughts</strong>, and<strong> thoughts</strong> of <strong>harming </strong>the <strong>baby</strong>. The onset of psychotic symptoms is usually preceded by signs such as insomnia, restlessness, labile mood, and agitation. <strong>Lithium</strong>, often in combina­tion with an <strong>antidepressant</strong>, is the treatment of choice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D: Episodes of <strong>delirium </strong>in the <strong>postpartum period</strong> are characterized by a <strong>fluctuating</strong> <strong>level</strong> of <strong>awareness</strong> or attention. In this patient, there is no altered sense of awareness.</p>\n<p>Note:  Zuranolone is the first-ever oral drug to be approved specifically for the treatment of postpartum depression. It is a neuroactive steroid that enhances the action of GABA in the brain and regulates mood. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Postpartum mood disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Disorders and features</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Incidence and timeline</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Harmful thoughts</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Treatment</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Postpartum blues</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><span>Depressed affect, tearfulness and fatigue</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>30-75%</span></p>\n<p><span>Starts 2-3 days after delivery.
