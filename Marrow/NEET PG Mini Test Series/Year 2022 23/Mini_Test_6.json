This drug enters bacilli by <strong>passive diffusion</strong>. It then gets activated to its toxic form by the enzyme <strong>catalase-peroxidase&nbsp;</strong>(the enzyme encoded by the <strong>Kat gene</strong>).</p>\n<p>Normally, InhA and KasA are involved in the synthesis of mycolic acid. Upon activation, the reactive metabolite of isoniazid forms complexes with <strong>NAD</strong> that inhibit <strong>InhA</strong> and <strong>KasA</strong>. Hence, isoniazid inhibits the production of <strong>mycolic acid</strong>.</p>\n<p>The reactive isoniazid metabolite also forms complexes with <strong>NADP</strong>. This complex inhibits mycobacterial dihydrofolate reductase which results in the interruption of <strong>DNA synthesis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Side effects of isoniazid include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Peripheral neuritis</strong> due to interference with the production of active coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate from pyridoxine. Therefore, <strong>pyridoxine 10 mg/day (vitamin B6)</strong> is given prophylactically along with isoniazid to prevent neurotoxicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Hepatitis- isoniazid</strong> must be stopped at the first sign of hepatotoxicity.</li>\n<li>Rashes</li>\n<li>Anemia</li>\n<li>Arthralgia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Toxicity of isoniazid results in <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong> and <strong>seizures</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Rifampin</strong> is the first-line antitubercular drug.

Side effects of rifampin are <strong>hepatitis</strong>, flu-like illness, and urine and secretions may become <strong>orange-red</strong> but this is harmless.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Pyrazinamide</strong> is a prodrug that is activated by the enzyme pyrazinamidase (encoded by the <strong>pncA gene</strong>). It is converted into an active metabolite pyrazinoic acid. This metabolite makes the intracellular environment acidic which collapses the <strong>transmembrane proton motive force, </strong>thereby killing the bacteria. Hepatotoxicity and hyperuricemia are the common side effects.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Ethambutol</strong> inhibits arabinose transferase III, thereby decreasing arabinogalactan biosynthesis.

Anesthesia and paresthesia of the extremities, abnormal movements, and gait disturbance are the other features commonly seen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Somatic symptom disorder</strong>&nbsp;is characterized by the fear of having a serious illness based on the person's misinterpretation of bodily symptoms. The symptoms are persistent for&nbsp;<strong>over 6 months.&nbsp;</strong>It equally affects men and women and is commonly seen in the&nbsp;<strong>third decade</strong>&nbsp;of life. It is associated with&nbsp;<strong>poor insight.</strong>&nbsp;Patients believe that they have a serious disease that has not yet been detected and they can&shy;not be persuaded otherwise. Their convictions persist despite negative laboratory results, the benign course of the alleged disease over time, and reassurances from doctors.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Dysthymic&nbsp;disorder&nbsp;</strong>is the presence of a <strong>persistently depressed mood</strong> that lasts most of the day and is continuous. There are also feelings of guilt, irritability, and anger associated with it. These symptoms are present for <strong>at least 2 years</strong>.&nbsp;It is distinguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that patients mention that they have always been depressed.

Before performing massage the doctor should always auscultate to check for the presence of <strong>carotid bruit</strong>. If bruit is present, it should not be performed. The area of the carotid sinus, at the artery&rsquo;s bifurcation, is palpated with two fingers at the angle of the jaw until a good pulse is felt. A minimal amount of pressure is applied over the carotid sinus. If there is no effect, a side-to-side or rotating motion of the fingers over the site is performed for up to 5 seconds. ECG should be performed to assess the response.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism</strong></p>\n<p>Pressure over the carotid sinus stimulates the baroreceptors. These&nbsp;signals are transmitted through small <strong>Hering&rsquo;s nerves</strong> to the <strong>glossopharyngeal nerves</strong> and then to the <strong>nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)</strong> in the medulla.
