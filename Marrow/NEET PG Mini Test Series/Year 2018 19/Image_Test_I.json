Patients also have relative positive scotoma, micropsia and metamorphopsia. On ophthalmoscopy, a circular ring reflex present. The foveal reflex is absent. On fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), an <strong>enlarging ink-blot pattern</strong> or <strong>smoke-stack pattern </strong>is seen.</p>\n<p>Treatment is generally not required. It is usually <strong>self-limiting,</strong> but often <strong>recurrent. </strong><strong>Steroids</strong> are <strong>contraindicated</strong>.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6ec581079d2445249767a15f82b3fe0fx598x491.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
