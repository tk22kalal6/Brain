This recommendation supersedes the recommendation on TXA in the existing 2012 WHO recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PPH.&nbsp;The goals of the WHO 2017 recommendation on TXA for PPH treatment are to improve the quality of care for women with PPH and prevent maternal deaths due to PPH</p><p><strong>Recent Update:</strong> In 2020, the WHO issued a guideline which recommends the<strong> preference of IV oxytocin over IM oxytocin</strong> for the <strong>prevention of PPH</strong>, in situations where women giving birth vaginally already have IV access. This recomendation supercedes its 2012 recommendation for the prevention of PPH.&nbsp;</p>",
