      "solution": "<p>The ECG is suggestive of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). As the patient is stable, the doctor has performed a carotid sinus massage to slow the heart rate and to convert to sinus rhythm. This stimulates the <strong>baroreceptor reflex</strong>, whose <strong>afferent</strong> nerve is the <strong>glossopharyngeal nerve. </strong></p>\n<p>Features suggestive of PSVT are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Narrow complex tachycardia at 150 bpm</li>\n<li>No visible P waves</li>\n<li>Pseudo R’ waves in lead aVR due to retrograde atrial activation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Carotid sinus massage:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Procedure</strong>- It is performed with the patient supine and the head turned slightly away from the side being stimulated. Before performing massage the doctor should always auscultate to check for the presence of <strong>carotid bruit</strong>. If bruit is present, it should not be performed. The area of the carotid sinus, at the artery’s bifurcation, is palpated with two fingers at the angle of the jaw until a good pulse is felt. A minimal amount of pressure is applied over the carotid sinus. If there is no effect, a side-to-side or rotating motion of the fingers over the site is performed for up to 5 seconds. ECG should be performed to assess the response.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>- Pressure over the carotid sinus stimulates the baroreceptors. These signals are transmitted through small <strong>Hering’s nerves</strong> to the <strong>glossopharyngeal nerves</strong> and then to the <strong>nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)</strong> in the medulla. These signals<strong> inhibit</strong> the <strong>vasoconstrictor</strong> center of the medulla and <strong>excite</strong> the <strong>vagal</strong> parasympathetic centre. The <strong>stimulation of the vagus</strong> results in a <strong>slowing </strong>of<strong> impulse generation </strong>in the <strong>SA node </strong>and a <strong>slowing </strong>of <strong>conduction </strong>velocity in the <strong>AV node.  </strong></p>\n<p>Other vagal maneuvers which are used to treat cardiac arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities are,</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Valsalva manoeuvre- </strong>the patient is placed in a supine or semirecumbent position and instructed to exhale forcefully against a closed glottis. The patient should maintain this strain for 10-15 seconds and then start breathing normally. It decreases the heart rate and can be used in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.</li>\n<li><strong>Diving reflex</strong>- A patient holds his breath and then immerses his face in the water at a temperature of 10-20 degrees Celsius. It results in bradycardia and can be used to terminate paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note- <strong>Vagus nerve</strong> is an afferent for the impulses from the <strong>aortic baroreceptors</strong> in the arch of the aorta.</p>",

This leads to a combination of abnormal rhythms, including atrial bradyarrhythmias, atrial tachyarrhythmias, and sometimes a pattern of alternating bradycardia and tachycardia, known as tachy-brady syndrome.

      "solution": "<p>An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) insertion is the most appropriate <strong>long-term management strategy</strong> for this patient. Patients with <strong>long QT syndrome</strong> (LQTS) who continue to experience <strong>recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT)</strong> despite optimal medical therapy are at high risk for sudden cardiac death. An ICD continuously monitors the heart's rhythm and can deliver life-saving shocks to terminate life-threatening arrhythmias such as VT.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Beta-blockers</strong> are effective in reducing the risk of arrhythmic events in long QT syndrome, particularly in LQT1 and LQT2. However, in high-risk patients who continue to experience arrhythmias despite optimal medical therapy, beta-blockers alone are not sufficient.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Magnesium sulfate</strong> is an effective <strong>acute treatment for torsades de pointes</strong>, a type of polymorphic VT associated with long QT syndrome. However, it is not suitable for long-term management due to the need for continuous intravenous access and potential side effects. Long-term use is impractical and does not address the underlying risk of sudden cardiac death.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Amiodarone</strong> is an antiarrhythmic drug used for various types of arrhythmias. However, it is not the first-line therapy for patients with long QT syndrome due to its potential to further prolong the QT interval and cause proarrhythmic effects. Additionally, ICDs have a proven track record of reducing mortality in high-risk patients, making them the preferred choice over long-term pharmacological therapy.</p>",
