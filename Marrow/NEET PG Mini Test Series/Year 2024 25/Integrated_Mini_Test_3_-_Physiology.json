      "solution": "<p><strong>Kartagener’s syndrome</strong>, a type of primary ciliary dyskinesia, affects specialized cellular appendages known as<strong> cilia</strong> in various parts of the body, including the respiratory tree<strong>,</strong> where they help in expelling mucus. The <strong>true</strong> statement regarding cilia is <strong>2 and 3.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cilia</strong> are present in the epithelium of the respiratory passages, starting from the <strong>anterior third</strong> of the <strong>nose</strong> and extending to the <strong>bronchioles.</strong> However, they are<strong> absent</strong> in the last few generations of the airways, including the <strong>alveoli </strong>(statement 1). Cilia play a crucial role in clearing the airways as part of the '<strong>mucociliary escalator.</strong>' </p>\n<p>On top of them, a <strong>mucus layer</strong> is present, aiding in<strong> trapping foreign particles</strong>. These particles are then transported through the <strong>synchronized</strong> <strong>metachronal rhythm</strong> of the cilia, which<strong> </strong>beat at a frequency of 10-20 times per second (statement 5). The direction of their 'power stroke' is always toward the pharynx; that is, the cilia in the <strong>lungs</strong> <strong>beat upward</strong>, whereas those in the <strong>nose beat downward </strong>(statement 4) This continual beating causes the<strong> </strong>mucus coat to flow slowly toward the pharynx. Subsequently, the mucus and its entrapped particles are either swallowed or coughed to the exterior.</p>\n<p>Cilia may be either <strong>motile </strong>(called secondary cilia) or <strong>non-motile</strong> (called primary cilia). The <strong>motile</strong> cilia<strong> </strong>contain a <strong>microtubule</strong> core arranged in a “<strong>9+2</strong>” pattern (nine pairs of microtubules around the circumference of the cilium and one pair of microtubules in the center) (statement 3). <strong>Dynein</strong> is the <strong>molecular</strong> <strong>motor</strong> that drives the movement<strong> </strong>of the cilium (statement 2).  </p>\n<p>Other<strong> </strong>sites where cilia are present include the <strong>fallopian tube, kidney</strong>, and <strong>inner ear</strong>. <strong>Nonmotile cilia</strong> serve as <strong>mechanoreceptors </strong>and are involved in determining<strong> left-right asymmetry</strong> of organs during<strong> </strong>embryological development, as well as sensing the flow rate of fluid in the nephron of the kidney.</p>\n<p><strong>Kartagener’s syndrome </strong>or primary ciliary dyskinesia (also called immotile cilia syndrome) is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder affecting ciliary motility. It occurs due to defects in the dynein arm of the cilia. This causes the retention of secretions due to a failed mucociliary clearance mechanism. Clinically, this manifests as the classical <strong>triad</strong> of <strong>s</strong><strong>itus inversus</strong>, <strong>c</strong><strong>hronic sinusitis</strong>, and <strong>b</strong><strong>ronchiectasis.</strong> Male patients with this condition tend to be <strong>infertile</strong>, due to <strong>asthenospermia</strong> (immotile spermatozoa due to impaired sperm flagella function). </p>",

This reduction in the heart rate <strong>decreases the myocardial oxygen demand.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The oxygen requirement of the heart mainly depends on the work done by the heart.

An increase in these parameters will increase the oxygen requirement of the heart.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Important determinants of cardiac output are:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Stroke volume</strong>- It is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat. This stroke volume increases whenever, there is <strong>increased venous</strong> return to the heart, increased end-diastolic volume (<strong>preload</strong>), and increased contractility. Contractility further depends on the <strong>initial length</strong> of the cardiac muscle fiber and the <strong>autonomic innervation.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Heart rate</strong>- Increased heart rate increases the cardiac output which in turn increases the oxygen requirement. Heart rate is controlled primarily by the autonomic nerves, with sympathetic stimulation increasing the rate and parasympathetic stimulation decreasing the rate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Afterload-</strong> The tension at which the load is lifted is called afterload.

TSH stimulates hypertrophy and hyperplasia of follicular cells and the secretion of large amounts of thyroglobulin. Thus, the thyroid gland enlarges. This condition is known as <strong>endemic goiter.</strong></p>\n<p>Other causes of <strong>hypothyroidism</strong> resulting in goiter are <strong>autoimmune thyroiditis, deiodinase deficiency</strong>, and disorders of iodide trapping, peroxidase, or coupling systems. Consumption of food containing <strong>goitrogenic</strong> <strong>substances</strong> (eg: turnips, cabbages) also results in goiter.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Wolff-Chaikoff effect </strong>is the transient inhibition of the organification of iodide when<strong> large doses</strong> of<strong> iodide</strong> are consumed. This results in a decrease in thyroid hormone synthesis.  This effect will not be seen in this patient who consumes non-iodized salt.</p>\n<p>Option C: In <strong>Grave’s disease</strong>,<strong> TSH-receptor antibodies</strong> are present. They act similar to TSH and stimulate excessive secretion of thyroid hormones. Patients with Grave’s disease present with goiter, weight loss, exophthalmos, tremors, and tachycardia.  </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Mucopolysaccharide</strong> deposition is the mechanism of <strong>myxedema</strong> formation in <strong>hypothyroid </strong>patients. The deposition results in fluid filtration out of the capillaries and the formation of <strong>non-pitting edema.</strong></p>",
