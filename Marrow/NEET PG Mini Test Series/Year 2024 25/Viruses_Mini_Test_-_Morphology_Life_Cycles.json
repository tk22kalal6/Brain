HSV-DNA demonstration in CSF by PCR is the investigation of choice for HSV encephalitis. <br><br>Steps of HSV replication:<br><br>The virus enters the cell by fusing with the plasma membrane, and viral DNA is released from the capsid at the nuclear pore. This is followed by the circularization of the genome and transcription of immediate-early genes.<br><br>α-Proteins are products of immediate-early genes. These proteins stimulate the transcription of early genes. β-proteins are products of early genes. These proteins function in DNA replication, to yield concatemeric DNA. Transcription of late genes gives rise to γ-proteins. These primarily consist of viral structural proteins and participate in virion assembly.<br><br>Viral DNA is cleaved from concatemers and then packaged into capsids. Enveloped viral particles collect in the endoplasmic reticulum and are then transported by a vesicular movement to the cell surface.<br><br>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is defined as inflammation of brain parenchyma caused by the herpes virus, and it typically presents as an acute febrile illness. Patients typically present with acute onset of fever, altered levels of consciousness, personality changes, and evidence of either focal or diffuse neurologic signs and symptoms, especially in the temporal lobe. Focal or generalized seizures occur in many patients with HSV encephalitis. Other most commonly encountered focal findings include aphasia, ataxia, upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron type lesions, and cranial nerve deficits.<br><br>HSV-DNA demonstration in CSF by PCR is the investigation of choice for HSV encephalitis. Other investigations that can help include CSF examination, CSF culture, serological studies, MRI, CT, EEG, and brain biopsy. The T2-weighted MRI of the brain will show hyperintensity in the temporal lobe in most of the patients. Bilateral involvement of the temporal lobe is more common in HSV encephalitis.<br><br>Management includes supportive therapy (monitoring of intracranial pressure, fluid restriction, avoidance of hypotonic IV fluids), anticonvulsants for seizures, and intravenous acyclovir is beneficial in treating HSV encephalitis.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: CSF culture in chick embryos - It is not a sensitive test used for the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis. Negative CSF viral cultures have no value in ruling out HSV encephalitis. Although this method can be used to isolate HSV, it is not as sensitive or specific as PCR for viral DNA and it can take a longer time to obtain results. <br><br>Option B: Tzanck smear of CSF - A positive smear shows multinucleated giant cells with faceted nuclei and ground glass appearance. It is a rapid, inexpensive, and fairly sensitive diagnostic test. The Tzanck smear is typically used to diagnose cutaneous herpes infections, such as herpes simplex or varicella-zoster virus. It is not an appropriate diagnostic test for HSV encephalitis, as it does not provide definitive confirmation of the presence of HSV in the CSF.<br><br>Option D: Brain biopsy was used earlier to establish a diagnosis and begin early specific therapy, but now has been replaced by HSV DNA detection by CSF PCR.<br><br>Pearl PM2434: CSF findings in meningitis<br><br>| Glucose \n(mg/dL) | Protein\n(mg/dL) | WBC (per μL)\nNormal | 40-85 | 15-45 | <5<br><br>60-70% lymphocytes, ≤30% monocytes / macrophages\nBacterial | <40 | >100 | >1000<br><br>↑↑PMNs (≥80%)\nViral | Normal | 20-80 | 25-500<br><br>Predominantly lymphocytes\nTuberculous | <50 \nin 75% cases | 100-200 | 25-100<br><br>Predominantly lymphocytes\nFungal | ↓ to normal | 150-300 | 40-600<br><br>Lymphocytes or PMNs, depending on specific organism\nParasitic | Normal | 50-200 | 150-2000<br><br>↑↑ Eosinophils (≥50%)",

      "solution": "The transmission cycle of the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is shown in the image. <br><br>Japanese encephalitis follows bird-arthropod-human transmission. Humans are the dead-end hosts, pigs are the amplifier hosts, and herons act as reservoir hosts. The disease is transmitted by the bite of Culex mosquitoes, specifically Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex vishnui (common in India)<br><br>Clinical features include high fever, headache, and vomiting. Signs of encephalitis such as convulsions, neck rigidity, and altered sensorium appear after 1-6 days. Measures like mosquito control, and locating piggeries away from houses can be done.<br><br>Inactivated vero cell culture-derived SA-14-14-2 vaccine is approved for use in India. JE vaccine is given in two doses- at 9-12 months of age and at 16-24 months of age in areas that are endemic to the disease, according to the National Immunization Schedule. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option-A: Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus, which is transmitted from pigs to humans. Fruit bats are the natural hosts. It causes severe encephalitis with high mortality. <br><br>The image given below depicts the life cycle of the Nipah virus:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2a1283ae8d794dfab9ab1f1508cdf977x720x1440.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option B: Ebola virus belongs to the family Filoviridae and is transmitted by bats. Human-to-human transmission through blood or body fluids can occur. It causes fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hemorrhage. <br><br>The image below shows the lifecycle of the ebola virus:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/284357f651da44678d2e4350f7997e78x720x449.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option D: Zika virus is transmitted to human beings by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. It can also be transmitted trans-placentally, causing microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects.",
