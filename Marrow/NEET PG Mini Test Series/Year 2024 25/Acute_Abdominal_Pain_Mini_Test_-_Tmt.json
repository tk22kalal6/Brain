This patient's <strong>Hemoglobin</strong> is <strong>reduced,</strong> despite consuming an adequate diet indicating a nondietary cause of <strong>anemia. Meckel's diverticulum</strong> could be a likely cause of his anemia and a potential cause of the intussusception and should be evaluated for with a <strong>radionuclide pertechnetate scan.</strong> </p>\n<p>Intussusception occurs when a portion of the bowel is<strong> telescoped</strong> into an adjacent segment.<strong> </strong>Patients present with <strong>cramping abdominal pain</strong>, <strong>palpable sausage-shaped abdominal mass</strong>, and passage of <strong>red currant jelly stools</strong>. <strong>Vomiting </strong>may not begin later and with time, <strong>may be bile-stained. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Meckel's diverticulum</strong> is a portion of the <strong>vitelline duct</strong> that persists as an <strong>outpouching</strong> of the <strong>ileum</strong>. The diverticulum is usually asymptomatic unless it contains <strong>heterotopic pancreatic</strong> or <strong>gastric mucosa,</strong> which may lead to <strong>bleeding, ulceration,</strong> or <strong>perforation.</strong> Usually, the bleeding goes unnoticed and only comes to light on routine exams which shows anemia and is evaluated further. A Technitium 99 pertechnetate scan is used for the evaluation of Meckels diverticulum. </p>\n<p>Intussusception is one of the common causes of intestinal obstruction in a paediatric patient.<strong> Ileo-colic junction </strong>is the most common site of involvement. The condition may arise due to the presence of <strong>lead points</strong> as seen in enlarged submucosal <strong>Payer's patch</strong>, <strong>Meckel's diverticulum </strong><strong>,</strong>intestinal polyp, inflamed appendix, submucosal hemorrhage seen in <strong>Henoch-Schonlein purpura</strong>, and intestinal duplication cysts.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis is confirmed by <strong>abdominal ultrasound </strong>which shows the pathognomonic<strong> t</strong><strong>arget sign/bull's eye sign </strong>(shown below).<strong> </strong></p>\n</div>\n</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d81d8af7dc2c42c1847e0212ef827ddfx720x598.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Treatment of intussusception includes <strong>hydrostatic reduction</strong> by enema using contrast material or air. <strong>S</strong><strong>urgical</strong> reduction is only done in the presence of refractory <strong>shock,</strong> suspected bowel necrosis or <strong>perforation,</strong> <strong>peritonitis,</strong> and multiple recurrences after hydrostatic reduction. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>CT angiography</strong> can be used to diagnose a cause of GI bleeds, but is usually <strong>less sensitive</strong> for <strong>Meckels diverticulum.</strong> </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Serum WBC counts</strong> are a non-specific test but can be helpful in diagnosing appendicitis.
