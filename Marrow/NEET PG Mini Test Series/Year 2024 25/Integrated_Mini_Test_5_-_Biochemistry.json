NHEJ is a predominant pathway for DNA double-stranded break repair. NHEJ deficiency confers (severe) combined immunodeficiency due to a failure to carry out V(D)J recombination efficiently. NHEJ also functions in class switch recombination, another step enhancing T and B cell diversity.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>The deficiency of adenosine deaminase enzyme was the <strong>first</strong> pathophysiologic condition to be treated by <strong>gene therapy</strong>. In1990, Dr. William French Anderson introduced a new copy of this gene, which was carried on a retroviral vector, into a 4-year-old girl suffering from severe combined immunodeficiency (bubble boy disease).</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Human Diseases of DNA Damage Repair</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>DNA damage repair type</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Diseases</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective Nonhomologous End Joining Repair (NHEJ)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID)</p>\n<p>Radiation sensitive severe combined immunodeficiency disease(RS-SCID)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective Homologous Repair (HR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AT-like disorder (ATLD)</p>\n<p>Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)</p>\n<p>Bloom syndrome (BS)</p>\n<p>Werner syndrome (WS)</p>\n<p>Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS)</p>\n<p>Breast cancer suspectibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1, BRCA2)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)</p>\n<p>Cockayne syndrome (CS)</p>\n<p>Trichothiodystrophy (TTD)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Base Excision Repair (BER)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

For studying gene expression, mRNA is taken from the sample and then its complementary DNA (cDNA) is made. This cDNA from the normal cell is labeled with green fluorescence, and the cDNA from the cancer cell is labeled with red fluorescence. Then, both are allowed to hybridize with the DNA on the chip.</p>\n<p>Interpretation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Black spots represent no expression by both normal and cancer cells.</li>\n<li>Red spots represent more expression by the cancer cells.</li>\n<li>Green spots represent more expression by normal cells.</li>\n<li>Yellow spots represent equal expression by both cells.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using the microarray technique, the differing patterns of gene expression between two types of cells can be analyzed.</p>\n<p>Option B - A <strong>northern blot</strong> only measures mRNA production from one gene at a time.<br />Option C - <strong>Southern blot</strong> can only analyze DNA not the products of DNA expression.<br />Option d - <strong>Western blot</strong> measures protein production.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The clinical scenario of multiple lesions on the <strong>sun-exposed area</strong> and multiple <strong>cutaneous malignancies</strong> are suggestive of <strong>Xeroderma pigmentosum.</strong> The DNA repair mechanism that is defective in this condition is <strong>n</strong><strong>ucleotide excision repair (NER).</strong></p>\n<p>Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) is a rare <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> genetic disorder characterized by defective DNA repair which leads to clinical and cellular hypersensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.</p>\n<p>UV radiation leads to <strong>pyrimidine dimerization</strong> in DNA strands, preventing further replication by DNA polymerase. The nucleotide excision repair mechanism corrects the dimer formation in DNA. In XP there is an inability<span class=\"fontstyle0\"> to repair DNA pyrimidine dimers caused by UV exposure.</span></p>\n<p>In XP the skin is normal at birth. Initially, there will be diffuse erythema, scaling, and freckle lesions. As age progresses a characterized lesion called poikiloderma occurs. It consists of skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and mottled hyper and hypopigmented areas. By the age of<strong> 4 -5 years</strong>, they present with multiple malignancies including <strong>squamous cell carcinoma</strong>, malignant melanoma, <strong>basal cell carcinoma</strong>, and fibrosarcoma.</p>\n<p>Most of the cases with XP have ocular manifestations. Initially, it appears as <strong>photophobia</strong>, <strong>conjunctivitis</strong>, ectropion, and symblepharon with ulceration. Accumulation of pyrimidine dimer causes <strong>corneal opacification</strong> and <strong>neovascularization</strong>. Ocular malignancies are common in the lids, conjunctiva, and cornea as they are exposed to as much as facial skin.</p>\n<p>XP is ultimately fatal, and early detection of the skin lesions and their management with prevention of UV rays exposures prolong the life.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Human Diseases of DNA Damage Repair</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>DNA damage repair type</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Diseases</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective Nonhomologous End Joining Repair (NHEJ)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID)</p>\n<p>Radiation sensitive severe combined immunodeficiency disease(RS-SCID)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective Homologous Repair (HR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AT-like disorder (ATLD)</p>\n<p>Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)</p>\n<p>Bloom syndrome (BS)</p>\n<p>Werner syndrome (WS)</p>\n<p>Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS)</p>\n<p>Breast cancer suspectibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1, BRCA2)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)</p>\n<p>Cockayne syndrome (CS)</p>\n<p>Trichothiodystrophy (TTD)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Base Excision Repair (BER)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
