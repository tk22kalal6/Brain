Since nitrates also act by increasing cyclic GMP mechanism, they can therefore potentiate the effects of PDE-5 inhibitors. Hence, men treated with PDE-5 inhibitors and nitrates are at risk for<strong> severe hypotension </strong>and<strong> syncope.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Adverse effects of PDE-5 inhibitors-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The most common side effects reported include headache, flushing, nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis, and dyspepsia.
