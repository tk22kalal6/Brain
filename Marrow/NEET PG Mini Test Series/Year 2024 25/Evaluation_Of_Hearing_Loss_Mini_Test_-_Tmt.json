A Tone of 4000Hz is presented at 5dB above the patient&rsquo;s threshold of hearing for 60 seconds. A normal ear can hear continuously for a minute but a patient with abnormal hearing stops hearing before 1 minute. Loudness is increased until the patient can hear the sound. If loudness has to be increased by <strong>more than 30dB, it indicates retrocochlear hearing loss</strong>.</p>",
