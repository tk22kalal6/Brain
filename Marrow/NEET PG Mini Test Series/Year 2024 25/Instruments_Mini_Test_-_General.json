      "solution": "<p>The given X-ray and the history of falls on the outstretched hands suggest the diagnosis of <strong>scaphoid fracture.</strong> <strong>Herbert screw</strong> is commonly used to treat this fracture.</p>\n<p>Herbert screw is a <strong>cannulated variable pitch</strong> screw, which is used to fix <strong>unstable or displaced</strong> fractures of small articular bones such as the scaphoid. This screw helps in quick healing by <strong>providing compression</strong> at the fracture site and early return to normal activities. The advantage of cannulated screws is that we <strong>can use </strong>a<strong> guidewire </strong>under videofluoroscopy to assist in the <strong>accurate placement</strong> of the screw during surgery.</p>\n<p>Scaphoid fractures occur most commonly after a <strong>fall</strong> on an <strong>outstretched hand.</strong> The <strong>waist</strong> of the scaphoid is the <strong>most common site</strong> of fracture. Initial x-rays are done in anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views. Even if the x-rays appear normal, if there is clinical suspicion, a glass holding cast should be applied for 2 weeks followed by repeat imaging.</p>\n<p>Management depends upon the type of fracture. If the scaphoid <strong>tubercle</strong> is fractured, the patient is given a <strong>glass-holding cast</strong> for <strong>4-6 weeks</strong>. In case of <strong>undisplaced waist fractures</strong>, most people will recover with a <strong>cast</strong> in place for <strong>6-8 weeks</strong>. Percutaneous screw fixation with the <strong>Herbert screw</strong> can be offered to those with <strong>displaced or undisplaced</strong> fractures of the waist when the patient does not want to undergo prolonged cast immobilization, or if they wish to return to work/daily activities sooner. Reducing and fixing displaced fractures also <strong>reduces</strong> the <strong>risk </strong>of <strong>non-union</strong>.</p>\n<p>The most common complications include <strong>nonunion,</strong> <strong>avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) </strong>of the <strong>proximal </strong>fracture <strong>segment, </strong>and <strong>osteoarthritis. </strong></p>\n<p>Herbert screw is shown below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f984677a257341a88825c039a7cd068ex1280x1223.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Cannulated cancellous screws</strong> are commonly used to treat fractures of the <strong>neck of </strong>the <strong>femur.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: The <strong>interference screw </strong>is a biodegradable screw used during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This screw is made of polymers that increase its strength so as to improve cortical bone formation at the site as well as to ensure that the tibial tunnel is not too wide during the insertion of the newly reconstructed ligament.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Pedicle screws</strong> are used in spinal fusion surgery to provide added strength and support. They are placed<strong> </strong>above and below the <strong>vertebrae</strong> that were <strong>fused</strong>. Rods are used to connect the <strong>screws, </strong>which prevent their movement and allow the <strong>bone</strong> to heal. They are also used in the correction of scoliosis.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Plaster casts and their uses:</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp; <strong>Name of cast</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Usage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Minerva cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Cervical and upper thoracic spine disease</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Risser&rsquo;s cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Scoliosis&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Turn-buckle cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Scoliosis&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Shoulder spica</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Shoulder immobilization&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>U-slab/hanging cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture of the humerus&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Hip spica</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture of the femur</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Patellar tendon bearing cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture of tibia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Colle&rsquo;s cast (handshaking)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture lower end radius</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Bachelor cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Developmental Dysplasia of Hip</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Glass holding cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture scaphoid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Burkhalter cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Metacarpal or phalangeal fractures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>James slab</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Metacarpal and phalangeal fracture&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2ddfb024ce794679a717efd532820487x1280x4597.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Common X-Ray views</h3><p><strong>Schuller's view:</strong> Mastoid and temporal bone&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Open mouth view:</strong> Odontoid</p>\n<p><strong>Waters' view:</strong>&nbsp;Paranasal sinuses</p>\n<p><strong>Swimmers view:</strong> Cervicothoracic junction</p>\n<p><strong>Stryker notch view:</strong> Hillsach's lesion</p>\n<p><strong>West point axillary view</strong>: Bankart's lesion&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Zanca view:</strong> Acromioclavicular joint</p>\n<p><strong>Oblique view:</strong> Scaphoid</p>\n<p><strong>Judet view:</strong> Acetabulum</p>\n<p><strong>Shenton's arch:</strong> Pelvis</p>\n<p><strong>Von Rosen view</strong>: Developmental dysplasia of hip</p>\n<p><strong>Skyline view:</strong> Patella</p>\n<p><strong>Mortise view:</strong> talus&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broden's view: </strong>Subtalar joint</p>\n<p><strong>Kite's view:</strong> CTEV</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</h3><p>It is a rare but severe complication of certain fractures when the blood supply to a segment of bone is affected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Common sites of AVN are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head of the femur in fracture neck of femur and posterior dislocation of the hip</li>\n<li>Body of talus in a fracture through the neck of talus</li>\n<li>Proximal pole of the scaphoid in a fracture through the waist of the scaphoid</li>\n<li>Head of the humerus</li>\n<li>The capitulum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Non-traumatic causes of AVN are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Idiopathic</li>\n<li>Steroids</li>\n<li>Sickle cell disease</li>\n<li>Caisson's disease</li>\n<li>Gaucher's disease</li>\n<li>Lupus Erythematosus</li>\n<li>Radiation therapy</li>\n<li>Alcoholism</li>\n<li>Hyperlipidemia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important signs related to avascular necrosis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Crescent sign</strong>- Seen in osteonecrosis of the femoral head.
