      "solution": "<p>The pathogenesis of breast milk jaundice is <strong>increased ß-glucuronidase</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Breast milk jaundice</strong> is a type of neonatal jaundice that occurs in neonates due to <strong>breast milk feeding</strong>. It usually happens within the first week of life due to the abnormal accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin, leading to jaundice. The pathology of <strong>breast milk jaundice</strong> is attributed to the <strong>contents of breast milk</strong> whereas in <strong>breastfeeding jaundice</strong> there is <strong>inadequate breastfeeding</strong>.      </p>\n<p>Breast milk contains <strong>inhibitors</strong> of <strong>UDP-glucuronyl transferase</strong> that prevents hepatic conjugation of unconjugated bilirubin. Another constituent of breast milk is <strong>ß-glucuronidase</strong> which is an enzyme that <strong>deconjugates bilirubin</strong> in the intestinal brush border, leading to increased serum reabsorption instead of excretion of bilirubin. Thus<strong> increases enterohepatic recirculation</strong> of unconjugated bilirubin. </p>\n<p>Infant factors contributing to breast milk jaundice include <strong>decreased gut flora</strong> that converts conjugated bilirubin into stercobilinogen and excreted in stools. As well as <strong>increased gut permeability</strong> in infants promotes the enterohepatic recirculation of bilirubin. </p>\n<p>Breast milk jaundice usually is self-limiting in the <strong>2nd to 3rd week of life</strong>. Other causes should be ruled out in infants with severe or persistent jaundice. Rarely due to persistent elevated bilirubin levels, they may require changing from breast milk to infant formula for 24-48 hr and/or treatment with phototherapy without cessation of breastfeeding. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Breastfeeding jaundice</strong> occurs due to<strong> inadequate breastfeeding</strong> which typically reaches its peak between the <strong>third and fifth day</strong> <strong>after birth </strong>and is often accompanied by <strong>excessive weight loss</strong>. They also show increased<strong> unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Dubin Johnson syndrome</strong> shows <strong>multi-drug-resistant protein 2(MRP- 2) mutation</strong>. It is an autosomal recessive hyperbilirubinemia syndrome characterised by <strong>conjugated </strong>hyperbilirubinemia and <strong>black-pigmented</strong> liver on biopsy due to an epinephrine metabolite. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type-I</strong> is due to the<strong> absence of UDP-glucoronyl transferase</strong> enzyme. It is an autosomal recessive hyperbilirubinemia syndrome characterized by severe <strong>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong> and usually presents with <strong>kernicterus</strong>. It is usually fatal in the neonatal period.  </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hyperbilirubinemia- Causes</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<strong>Predominantly Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Excess production of bilirubin</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hemolytic anemias</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Biliary tract obstruction</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Resorption of blood from internal hemorrhage (e.g., alimentary tract bleeding, hematomas)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;Biliary tract diseases like primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ineffective erythropoiesis (e.g., pernicious anemia, thalassemia)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Reduced hepatic uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Drug interference with membrane carrier systems</p>\n</td>\n<td>Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Some cases of Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired bilirubin conjugation</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Physiologic jaundice of the newborn (decreased UGT1A1 activity, decreased excretion)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Breast milk jaundice (&beta;-glucuronidases in milk)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Genetic deficiency of UGT1A1 activity (Crigler-Najjar syndrome types I and II)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Diffuse hepatocellular disease (e.g., viral or drug-induced hepatitis, cirrhosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hereditary Hyperbilirubinemias</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disorder</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Inheritance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Defects in bilirubin metabolism</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Clinical course</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fatal in the neonatal period</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Generally mild,</p>\n<p>occasional kernicterus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR (common)</p>\n<p>AD (occasional)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin-Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired biliary excretion of bilirubin glucuronides due to a mutation in canalicular multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous with black pigmentation of liver</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased hepatic uptake and storage</p>\n<p>Decreased biliary excretion</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Some patients might have <strong>intermittent ataxia</strong> manifested as unsteady, wide-based gait. Cognitive development is usually normal, but there may be <strong>episodic psychiatric manifestations</strong> such as irritability, emotional instability, and depression.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The diagnosis of Hartnup disorder is established by typical clinical history and the <strong>presence of neutral amino acids in the urine</strong>. <strong>Urinary excretion of other amino acids remains normal</strong>, which differentiates it from causes of generalized aminoaciduria like Fanconi syndrome.&nbsp;<strong>Treatment</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>nicotinamide</strong> and a high-protein diet gives a good response in symptomatic patients.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Benedict's test&nbsp;</strong>detects the excretion of<strong>&nbsp;reducing substances&nbsp;</strong>in the urine. About 0.5 ml of urine is boiled with 5 ml of Benedict's reagent for 2 minutes. The formation of a precipitate is observed on cooling. The test is semi-quantitative and the color of the precipitate roughly parallels the concentration of reducing sugar.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Guthrie bacterial inhibition</strong>&nbsp;test is a screening test for phenylketonuria. This test uses a phenylalanine requiring strain of&nbsp;<strong><em>Bacillus subtilis.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Seliwanoff's test</strong>&nbsp;will&nbsp;<strong>distinguish glucose</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>fructose</strong>. The reagent is resorcinol in HCl. 3 ml of the reagent and 0.5 ml of urine are heated for 30 seconds up to a boiling point. A red color indicates the presence of fructose.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Conditions Associated with Pellagra-like Symptoms</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Condition/Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Reason for niacin deficiency</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hartnup disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Intestinal &amp; renal malabsorption of tryptophan</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Carcinoid syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Overproduction of serotonin that causes diversion of  tryptophan from NAD+ Pathway</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Vitamin B6 deficiency</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Defective kynureninase pathway</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Maize rich diet</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Niacin is in unavailable niacytin form</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Jowar diet (Sorghum)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Increase leucine content inhibit QPRTase enzyme</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
