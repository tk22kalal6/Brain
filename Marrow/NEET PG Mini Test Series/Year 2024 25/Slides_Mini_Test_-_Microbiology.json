T. brucei rhodesiense and T. brucei gambiense are indistinguishable morphologically.<br><br>The most reliable method for differentiating the trypomastigotes of T. brucei and T. cruzi is by the size of the kinetoplast.

It acts by inhibiting protein synthesis. Fragment B helps in binding the toxin to the cells while fragment A inactivates the elongation factor (EF-2) by ADP ribosylation responsible for protein synthesis and the iron level regulates the toxin production.<br><br>The clinical manifestation of diphtheria depends on the site of infection. Pharyngeal/faucial diphtheria is the most common presentation. The patient has marked adenitis and a bull neck. Pseudomembrane over the tonsils is characteristic. Bleeding from the tonsils can occur. It leads to life-threatening complications such as asphyxia, circulatory failure, post-diphtheritic paralysis, and toxaemia.<br><br>Cutaneous diphtheria may manifest as diphtheritic whitlow or skin ulcer.<br><br>The image below shows the pseudomembrane over the tonsil typically seen in diphtheria.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6547702439144d15ba7e700253a8f4d9x720x1019.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Image below shows bull neck:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b8f618e599d84c3eac0868cdb45484e1x268x332.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Treatment of diphtheria consist of administering diphtheria anti-toxin (20,000 - 100,000 units) and supplementing with antibiotics (penicillin and erythromycin).<br><br>Pearl PM0099: Toxins that are coded by phage DNA - Mnemonic<br><br>A: Group A strep (S. pyogenes): pyrogenic exotoxins SpeA and SpeC<br><br>B: Botulinum toxin C & D<br><br>C: Cholera toxin<br><br>D: Diphtheria toxin<br><br>E: E.coli(EHEC): Verocytotoxin (Shiga-like toxin)<br><br>Pearl PM2032: Mechanism of action of various bacterial toxins<br><br>The mechanism of action of various bacterial toxins are as given below:<br><br>Increase in cAMP<br><br>* Bordetella pertusis<br><br>* Bacillus anthracis<br><br>* Vibrio cholerae - Cholera toxin<br><br>* Enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC) - heat labile toxin<br><br>Increase in cGMP<br><br>* Enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC) - heat stable toxin<br><br>Inhibition of protein synthesis<br><br>* Diptheria toxin: inhibit elongation factor-2 (EF-2)<br><br>* Pseudomonas: inhibit elongation factor-2 (EF-2)<br><br>* Clostridium difficile<br><br>* Enterohemorrhagic E.coli (EHEC)-Shiga-like toxin: inhibit 60S<br><br>* Shigella dysenteriae- Shiga toxin: inhibit 60S",
