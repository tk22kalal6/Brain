      "solution": "<p>All of the above statements are true regarding tropical chronic pancreatitis except <strong>alcohol consumption</strong> plays a role in the etiology of tropical chronic pancreatitis. </p>\n<p><strong>Tropical chronic pancreatitis</strong></p>\n<p>It usually affects the younger generation in poor socioeconomic strata. <strong>Cassava </strong>(tapioca) ingestion as a staple diet is implicated as a causative factor due to derivatives of cyanide which require sulfur-containing amino acids for detoxification. These amino acids are not present in lower socioeconomic or malnourished individuals. <strong>Alcohol consumption</strong> is <strong>not</strong> one of the <strong>etiologies</strong> of tropical chronic pancreatitis.</p>\n<p>The pancreas appears firm and nodular macroscopically. The ducts are <strong>dilated.</strong> There is extensive periductal fibrosis associated with <strong>intraductal calcium carbonate stones</strong> of different sizes and shapes. These stones may resemble a staghorn. Microscopically, intralobular, interlobular, and periductal fibrosis are the predominant feature. </p>\n<p>There is a high incidence of <strong>pancreatic cancer</strong> in these patients. The patient usually has <strong>type 1 diabetes mellites</strong> (fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes). </p>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<p>Medical management is the mainstay of treatment. It involves exocrine pancreatic enzyme supplementation, insulin for diabetes mellitus, and the management of malnutrition. Surgery is indicated in intractable pain and in dilated ducts with stones. The procedure of choice is the removal of stones, with a <strong>side-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy</strong> to a Roux loop.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Clinical Features of Chronic Pancreatitis</h3><p><strong>Abdominal pain</strong>: <strong>most common symptom</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Site:\n<ul>\n<li>If infectious foci are in the <strong>head of the pancreas</strong>, then <strong>epigastric and right subcostal pain</strong> is common;</li>\n<li>If the infection is limited to the <strong>left side of the pancreas, left subcostal and back pain</strong> are seen.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Precipitated by food intake, thus <strong>weight loss </strong>is also seen.</li>\n<li>Associated with nausea, vomiting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Exocrine insufficiency:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Precedes endocrine insufficiency</strong></li>\n<li>Correlates with morphological changes</li>\n<li>Manifests with <strong>malabsorption symptoms</strong>: steatorrhea, diarrhea.</li>\n<li>Manifests with signs and symptoms of <strong>fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, </strong>such as <strong>bleeding, osteopenia, and osteoporosis: </strong>Severe cases</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Endocrine insufficiency: Diabetes mellitus</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency: TIGAR-O classification system</h3><p><strong>Toxic-metabolic</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alcoholic</li>\n<li>Tobacco smoking</li>\n<li>Hypercalcemia</li>\n<li>Hyperlipidemia</li>\n<li>Chronic renal failure</li>\n<li>Medications&mdash;phenacetin abuse</li>\n<li>Toxins&mdash;organotin compounds (e.g., dibutyltin dichloride, DBTC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Idiopathic</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early onset</li>\n<li>Late onset</li>\n<li>Tropical</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Genetic</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cationic trypsinogen (<em><strong>PRSS1</strong></em>)</li>\n<li>Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (<em><strong>CFTR</strong></em>)</li>\n<li>Calcium-sensing receptor (<em><strong>CASR</strong></em>)</li>\n<li>Chymotrypsin C gene (<em><strong>CTRC</strong></em>)</li>\n<li>Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor gene (<em><strong>SPINK1</strong></em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Autoimmune</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type 1 autoimmune chronic pancreatitis</li>\n<li>IgG4 systemic</li>\n<li>Type 2 autoimmune chronic pancreatitis</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Recurrent and severe acute pancreatitis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Postnecrotic (severe acute pancreatitis)</li>\n<li>Recurrent acute pancreatitis</li>\n<li>Vascular diseases/ischemia</li>\n<li>Radiation-induced</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Obstructive</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pancreas divisum</li>\n<li>Duct obstruction (e.g., tumor)</li>\n<li>Periampullary duodenal wall cysts</li>\n<li>Posttraumatic pancreatic duct scars</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Pancreas - Most Commons</h3><p>M/C cause of <strong>acute</strong> pancreatitis: Gallstones</p>\n<p>M/C cause of <strong>chronic </strong>pancreatitis: Alcohol</p>\n<p>M/C cause of <strong>chronic</strong> pancreatitis <strong>in children</strong>: Cystic fibrosis</p>\n<p>M/C cause of <strong>pancreatic calcification</strong>: Alcohol</p>\n<p>M/C <strong>congenital</strong> variant: Pancreas divisum</p>\n<p>M/C site of <strong>thrombosis</strong> in <strong>chronic</strong> pancreatitis: Splenic vein&nbsp;</p>\n<p>M/C site of <strong>pseudoaneurysm</strong> in <strong>chronic</strong> pancreatitis: Splenic artery&nbsp;</p>",
