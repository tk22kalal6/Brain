Body temperature may rise but <strong>does not exceed 40.5°C (105°F)</strong>. Heat exhaustion is distinct from heat stroke as the body <strong>maintains thermoregulation</strong> and <strong>no CNS dysfunction </strong>occurs.

Patients with <strong>Parkinsonism</strong> can complain of <strong>dizziness</strong> which is better specified as <strong>dysequilibrium</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Dysequilibrium</strong> can result from anomalies in the <strong>brain, cerebellum, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves</strong>. It is the feeling of <strong>falling or imbalance</strong> accompanied by <strong>difficulty in standing or walking</strong>. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus, <strong>Parkinson's disease</strong>, cerebellar degeneration or cerebellar stroke, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, tabes dorsalis, and diabetes mellitus are common causes.</p>\n<p>Patients who claim to be dizzy are actually experiencing <strong>vertigo, presyncope, or dysequilibrium</strong>, which are different symptoms. <strong>Finding the specific symptom</strong> helps to <strong>focus the evaluation</strong> and reduce the range of possible diagnoses.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td>Vertigo</td>\n<td>Near syncope</td>\n<td>Dysequilibrium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>Sensation of <strong>spinning or motion</strong> (when <strong>none is occurring</strong>)</td>\n<td>Sensation of <strong>impending loss of consciousness</strong> or <strong>fainting</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Instability</strong> or sensation of <strong>falling</strong> while <strong>seated, standing, or walking</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Differential diagnoses</td>\n<td>BPPV, vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular disease </td>\n<td>Cardiac arrhythmias, aortic stenosis, vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, hypoglycemia</td>\n<td><strong>Parkinson's disease</strong>, cerebellar degeneration, cerebellar stroke, vitamin B12 deficiency, Tabes dorsalis, normal pressure hydrocephalus</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><br />Other options :</p>\n<p>Option C: Patients are said to have <strong>ill-defined light-headedness</strong> if they are <strong>unable to articulate their complaints of dizziness</strong>.
