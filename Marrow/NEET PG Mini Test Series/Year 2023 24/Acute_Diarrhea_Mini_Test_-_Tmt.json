Clinically, it is differentiated from osmotic diarrhoea by the<strong> persistence of diarrhoea even after fasting</strong> and<strong> lack of stool osmotic gap</strong>. Secretory diarrhoea is typically watery, with large volume, and commonly occurs due to infective pathology, such as seen in cholera.</p>\n<p>Although there may be some overlap in the mechanism, diarrhoea is also categorised as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inflammatory </strong>(Option B) - characterized by pain, fever and bleeding along with diarrhoea. eg - inflammatory bowel disease</li>\n<li><strong>Steatorrheal</strong> - loose stools which are foul-smelling, greasy and difficult to flush, occurring to various causes of fat malabsorption. eg -  pancreatitis, abetalipoproteinemia</li>\n<li><strong>Iatrogenic</strong> - following surgery such as vagotomy, bariatric surgery, or terminal ileal resection.</li>\n<li><strong>Factitious </strong>(Option D)  - in the case of eating disorders or psychiatric illness where the patient abuses laxatives or intentional contamination of stool with water</li>\n<li><strong>Motility disorders</strong> - such as autonomic neuropathy in diabetic adults</li>\n</ul>",

In the context of individuals adhering to a standard Western diet, a stool weight above 200 g per day can generally indicate diarrhoea. Typically, healthcare professionals define diarrhoea as a condition characterized by an elevated number of bowel movements (exceeding three per day) or the presence of loose or watery stool consistency. Diarrhoea can be classified into <strong>three</strong> categories <strong>based</strong> <strong>on</strong> its <strong>duration</strong>: <strong>acute</strong>, <strong>persistent</strong>, and <strong>chronic</strong>. <strong>Acute</strong> diarrhoea refers to cases lasting<strong> less than two weeks</strong>, while <strong>persistent</strong> diarrhoea lasts between<strong> two and four weeks</strong>. <strong>Chronic</strong> diarrhoea is characterised by a duration <strong>beyond four weeks</strong>.</p>\n<p>Two prevalent illnesses are often characterized by the excretion of <strong>less than 200 grams </strong>of stool per day. </p>\n<p><strong>Pseudodiarrhea</strong>, characterised by the frequent excretion of small amounts of faeces, is commonly observed in conjunction with symptoms such as rectal urgency, tenesmus, and a sensation of incomplete bowel movement. This condition is commonly observed in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or proctitis. <strong>Faecal incontinence</strong> refers to the involuntary expulsion of rectal contents and is primarily attributed to neuromuscular disorders or structural anorectal abnormalities.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Composition of reduced osmolarity Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)</h3><p>The composition of reduced-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Reduced- osmolarity ORS</strong></td>\n<td><strong>mmol/L</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sodium&nbsp;</td>\n<td>75&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chloride</td>\n<td>65</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Glucose (anhydrous)</td>\n<td>75</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Potassium</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Citrate</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total Osmolarity</td>\n<td><strong>245</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "<p>The above clinical scenario is suggestive of <strong>acute food poisoning </strong>most likely caused by <em><strong>Staphylococcus aureus.</strong></em>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Food poisoning</strong> by <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>is caused due to ingestion of <strong>preformed enterotoxin.</strong> The preformed<strong> enterotoxin</strong> is <strong>heat-stable. </strong>Eight antigenic types of enterotoxin are currently known, of which,&nbsp;<strong>Type A&nbsp;</strong>toxin is responsible for most cases. It contaminates food products such as meat, fish, milk products, mayonnaise, cream <strong>pastries,</strong> etc. when left at room temperature for a long time. </p>\n<p>Enterotoxin acts directly on the autonomic nervous system to cause food poisoning, rather than on the gastrointestinal mucosa. It stimulates the <strong>vagus nerve</strong> and <strong>vomiting center</strong> of the brain and also stimulates intestinal peristaltic activity.</p>\n<p>Staphylococcal food poisoning has a very short incubation period of about <strong>1 - 8 hours</strong>. Patients usually present with <strong>nausea, vomiting</strong>, and <strong>diarrhea</strong> <strong>2-6 hrs</strong> after the consumption of contaminated food.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<em> <strong>Vibrio cholera</strong></em>&nbsp;leads to dysentery that presents with acute, profuse, watery stools (<strong>rice water stools</strong>) and vomiting which may lead to severe dehydration, hypokalemia, and shock. The incubation period is usually around <strong>1-5 days</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B:<em> <strong>Salmonella typhi</strong>&nbsp;</em>can present with diarrheal disease along with typical step-ladder patterns of fever, relative bradycardia, malaise, and abdominal discomfort. The incubation period is usually around <strong>7-14 days</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: Infection with <strong><em>Bacillus cereus</em></strong> causes food poisoning with a longer incubation period of 8-16 hours. But patients usually have a history of consumption of <strong>fried rice.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Food Poisoning</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Organism</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Symptoms</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Common food source</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>1&ndash;6 hrs incubation&nbsp;period</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></td>\n<td>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</td>\n<td>Ham, poultry, potato, cream pastries, mayonnaise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Bacillus cereus</em></td>\n<td>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</td>\n<td>Fried rice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>8&ndash;16 hrs incubation&nbsp;period</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Clostridium perfringes</em></td>\n<td>Abdominal cramps, diarrhea</td>\n<td>Beef, poultry, legume, gravies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Bacillus cereus</em></td>\n<td>Abdominal cramps, diarrhea</td>\n<td>Meat, vegetables, dried beans, cereals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>&gt;16 hrs incubation period</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Vibrio cholerae</em></td>\n<td>Watery diarrhea</td>\n<td>Shellfish, water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Salmonella</em> species</td>\n<td>Inflammatory diarrhea</td>\n<td>Beef, poultry, eggs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em></td>\n<td>Watery diarrhea</td>\n<td>Salads, cheese, meats</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em></td>\n<td>Bloody diarrhea</td>\n<td>Raw milk, raw vegetables, apple juice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Campylobacter jejuni</em></td>\n<td>Inflammatory diarrhea</td>\n<td>Poultry, raw milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Shigella</em> species</td>\n<td>Dysentery</td>\n<td>Potato, egg salad, lettuce</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</em></td>\n<td>Dysentery</td>\n<td>Molluscs, crustaceans</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
