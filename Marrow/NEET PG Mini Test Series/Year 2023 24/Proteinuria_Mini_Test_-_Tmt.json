One of the most prevalent types of glomerulonephritis in the globe is IgA nephropathy. <strong>Recurrent episodes</strong> of <strong>macroscopic hematuria</strong> during or right after an upper respiratory infection, frequently accompanied by proteinuria, and <strong>persistent asymptomatic microscopic hematuria</strong> is the two most typical manifestations of IgA nephropathy. </p>\n<p>Option C: Membranous nephropathy peaks <strong>between the ages of 30 and 50</strong>, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. It is the most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in the elderly and<strong> is rare in children</strong>. MGN is linked to malignancy, infection, rheumatic disorders such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, IgG4 diseases, or drug exposure. A worse prognosis is linked to the male gender, advanced age, hypertension, and the continuation of nephrotic-range proteinuria.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Interstitial nephritis</strong> is indicated by the presence of <strong>white blood cell</strong>s and <strong>white blood cell casts </strong>a<strong>l</strong>ong with low-grade hematuria and proteinuria. Some children with drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis may have <strong>eosinophils</strong> in their urine.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Glomerular Pathology in Renal Diseases</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Light microscopy</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Fluorescence microscopy</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Electron microscopy</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">\n<p>Nephritic syndrome:</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Postinfectious glomerulo-nephritis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 915\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Diffuse endocapillary proliferation;
