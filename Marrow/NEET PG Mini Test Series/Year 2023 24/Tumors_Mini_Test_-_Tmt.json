Initially, there will be diffuse erythema, scaling, and freckle lesions. As time passes these lesions become permanent. As the age progresses a characterized lesion called poikiloderma occurs. It consists of skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and mottled hyper and hypopigmented areas.&nbsp;By the age of 4 -5 years, they present with multiple malignancies including&nbsp;<strong>squamous cell carcinoma</strong>, malignant melanoma,&nbsp;<strong>basal cell carcinoma</strong>, and fibrosarcoma.</p>\n<p>Most of the cases with XP have ocular manifestations. Initially, it appears as photophobia, conjunctivitis, ectropion, and symblepharon with ulceration.&nbsp;<strong>Accumulation of pyrimidine dimer</strong>&nbsp;causes corneal opacification and neovascularization. Ocular malignancies are common in the lids, conjunctiva, and cornea as they are exposed to as much as facial skin. Since deeper structures like eyelids, cornea, and lens are shielded, are lesser affected.</p>\n<p>XP is <strong>ultimately fatal.&nbsp;</strong>Early detection of skin lesions and their management (prevention of exposure to UV rays) prolongs life.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Human Diseases of DNA Damage Repair</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>DNA damage repair type</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Diseases</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective Nonhomologous End Joining Repair (NHEJ)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID)</p>\n<p>Radiation sensitive severe combined immunodeficiency disease(RS-SCID)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective Homologous Repair (HR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AT-like disorder (ATLD)</p>\n<p>Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)</p>\n<p>Bloom syndrome (BS)</p>\n<p>Werner syndrome (WS)</p>\n<p>Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS)</p>\n<p>Breast cancer suspectibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1, BRCA2)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)</p>\n<p>Cockayne syndrome (CS)</p>\n<p>Trichothiodystrophy (TTD)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Base Excision Repair (BER)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
