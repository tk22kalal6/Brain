      "solution": "<p>In this scenario, the&nbsp;effective renal plasma flow (RPF) is <strong>490mL/min.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Clearance&nbsp;</strong>is defined as the volume of plasma from which a particular substance is completely removed by the kidney in a given amount of time (usually minutes). Para aminohippuric acid (PAH) is filtered by the glomeruli and secreted by the tubular cells. Therefore, the amount of the PAH that enters the kidney is almost completely removed. It means that the entire renal plasma is cleared from PAH in a given time. Because of this reason, PAH clearance measures the renal plasma flow.</p>\n<p>The formula used to calculate PAH clearance (C<span>PAH</span>) is:</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;U<sub>PAH</sub>&nbsp;&times; V &frasl; P<sub>PAH</sub></strong><sub><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</sub>where,</p>\n<p>U<sub>PAH&nbsp;</sub>- Concentration of PAH in urine- 14mg/mL</p>\n<p>P<sub>PAH&nbsp;</sub>- Concentration of PAH in plasma- 0.02mg/mL</p>\n<p>V - Urine flow- 0.7 mL/min</p>\n<p>Substituting the values given in the question, we get:</p>\n<p>PAH clearance =&nbsp;&nbsp;U<sub>PAH</sub>&nbsp;&times; V &frasl; P<sub>PAH ,</sub></p>\n<p>= (14 x 0.7)/0.02</p>\n<p>= 9.8 / 0.02</p>\n<p><strong>= 490 mL/min.</strong></p>\n<p>In an actual scenario, about 90% of the PAH is removed by the kidney. Therefore this is called <strong>effective renal plasma flow. </strong>Actual renal plasma flow is calculated by dividing the PAH clearance with an extraction ratio. The extraction ratio is&nbsp;arterial concentration minus renal venous concentration divided by arterial concentration. Normally the extraction ratio is<strong> 0.9.</strong></p>\n<p>If we consider the extraction ratio to be 0.9 in this scenario, the <strong>actual renal plasma flow</strong> will be</p>\n<p>= 490/0.9</p>\n<p>= <strong>~544 mL/min</strong></p>\n<p>Similarly, inulin and creatine clearance is used in the measurement of the <strong>glomerular filtration rate.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Formulae in renal physiology</h3><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 355\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<table><colgroup><col /><col /><col /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Term</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Equation</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Clearance rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>U<sub>s</sub> &times;V / P<sub>s</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Glomerular filtration rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>U<sub>inulin</sub> &times; V / P<sub>inulin</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Clearance ratio</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>C<sub>s</sub>/C<sub>inulin</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Effective renal plasma flow</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>E<sub>RPF</sub>=C<sub>PAH</sub>=U<sub>PAH</sub> &times;V / P<sub>PAH</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Renal blood flow</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>RPF / (1&minus; Hematocrit)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Excretion rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>U<sub>s</sub> &times;V</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Reabsorption rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>=Filtered load &minus;Excretion rate</p>\n<p>=(GFR&times;P<sub>s</sub>)&minus;(U<sub>s</sub> &times;V)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Secretion rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Excretion rate&minus;Filtered load</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Cs - clearance rate of substance &ldquo;s&rdquo;</p>\n<p>EPAH&nbsp; - PAH extraction ratio</p>\n<p>ERPF - effective renal plasma flow</p>\n<p>GFR - glomerular filtration rate</p>\n<p>P - plasma concentration</p>\n<p>PAH - para-aminohippuric acid</p>\n<p>PPAH - renal arterial PAH concentration</p>\n<p>RBF - renal blood flow</p>\n<p>RPF - renal plasma flow</p>\n<p>S - a substance</p>\n<p>U - urine concentration</p>\n<p>V - urine flow rate</p>\n<p>VPAH - renal venous PAH concentration</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
