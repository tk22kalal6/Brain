It can be for <strong>short</strong> <strong>or long-term use</strong>. It is a useful measure in low-medium income countries and is easy to use and clean. It has a <strong>risk of aspiration </strong>and is a slower method of feeding. The oro-motor movements are different as compared to that of breastfeeding. It is<strong> not indicated</strong> for <strong>very preterm infants.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Feeding tubes</strong> i.e. orogastric or nasogastric tubes are an efficient way of measuring intake. It is optimally used in <strong>very preterm infants (28-31 weeks)</strong> with <strong>no suck-swallow-breathe coordination</strong> for long-term use. It is an expensive measure as it requires frequent replacement.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottle and teat feeding,</strong> though not recommended is an efficient way to feed. Slow-flow teats mimic breastfeeding and are preferred to rapid-flow teats.
