As development continues, the sclerotome portion of each somite also undergoes a process called resegmentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Resegmentation</strong> occurs when the caudal half of each sclerotome grows into and fuses with the cephalic half of each subjacent sclerotome.</li>\n<li>Thus, each vertebra is formed from the combination of the caudal half of one somite and the cranial half of its neighbor.</li>\n<li><strong>Mesenchymal cells</strong> between cephalic and caudal parts of the original sclerotome segment do not proliferate but fill the space between two pre cartilaginous vertebral bodies. In this way, they contribute to formation of the <strong>intervertebral disc.</strong></li>\n<li>Although the <strong>notochord</strong> regresses entirely in the region of vertebral bodies, it persists and enlarges in the region of intervertebral disks, leading to the formation of <strong>nucleus pulposus</strong>.</li>\n</ol>",
