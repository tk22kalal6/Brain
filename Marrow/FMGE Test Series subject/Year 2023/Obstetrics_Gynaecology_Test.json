Safer contraceptive choices for such patients include combined oral pills, injectable DMPA(depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate), progestin implant, barrier methods, and sterilization.</p>\n<p><strong>Contraception</strong> has to be adopted by all patients who underwent suction curettage&nbsp;until HCG levels become undetectable and remain the same for a period of 6 months. This serves to avoid pregnancy and confusion regarding the source of HCG if there is a subsequent rise. After beta HCG levels have become normal,&nbsp;subsequent<strong> conception</strong> must be <strong>avoided</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>one year</strong>(preferably 2 years).&nbsp;Pregnancy should also be avoided for 1 year after the stoppage of chemotherapy because of the teratogenic effect of drugs.</p>\n<p>All patients should be followed-up for<strong> 2 years</strong> because choriocarcinoma if it occurs, develops within this period of the evacuation of the mole. Commonly, the circulating levels of&nbsp;&beta;hCG decrease or becomes negative within <strong>4&nbsp;to 8 weeks&nbsp;</strong>post evacuation. Once negative,&nbsp;the patient is usually followed up <strong>monthly</strong> for <strong>6 months</strong>, then 3 monthly in the first year, and 6 monthly in the second year.</p>\n<p>During follow-up visits, history should be taken about&nbsp;symptoms like&nbsp;<strong>irregular bleeding </strong>(<strong>choriocarcinoma</strong>),&nbsp;presence of nodules,<strong> cough, breathlessness,</strong> and hemoptysis <strong>(metastasis)</strong>.
