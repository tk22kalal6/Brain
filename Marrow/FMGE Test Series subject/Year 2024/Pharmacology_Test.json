The <strong>secretion</strong> of<strong> protons</strong> by an activated <strong>H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase</strong> (proton pump) in the <strong>parietal cells</strong> into the gastric lumen is the <strong>final step</strong> involved in the production of<strong> gastric acid</strong>&nbsp;and inhibition of this enzyme prevents acid secretion into the stomach.</p>\n<p>Once PPIs irreversibly inactivate the H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, acid secretion resumes only after new pump molecules are synthesized and inserted into the luminal membrane. This leads to <strong>prolonged suppression of acid secretion</strong> for up to 24-48 hours, despite having a shorter plasma half-life of only 30 minutes to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>In most individuals, once-daily dosing is enough to achieve effective acid inhibition. If necessary, a second dose can be given before an evening meal.</p>\n<p>The number of H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump molecules increases after fasting and food decreases the oral bioavailability of the drug. Hence, PPIs are given around 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.</p>\n<p>PPIs <strong>cannot inhibit</strong> all gastric acid pumps with oral dosing because <strong>not all pumps are active</strong> during the short half-life of the PPI in the blood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PPIs cause maximum suppression of gastric acid. They reduce the daily production of <strong>both basal</strong> and <strong>stimulated acid secretion</strong> by 85&ndash;90%.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are available in the form of <strong>delayed-release</strong> tablets, capsules, and oral suspension packets and for immediate acid suppression, there are <strong>intravenous formulations</strong> for PPIs like lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole. Therefore, the <strong>release of the drug</strong> depends upon the drug <strong>formulation.</strong></p><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/79f8d7a356254942ac77ef98dbd915b6x912x630.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
