The cytotoxic drug causes lysis of tumor cells, leading to <strong>hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperuricemia.</strong> The uric acid crystals and calcium phosphate precipitate in the tubules and cause damage to the epithelium, subsequently causing<strong> renal failure. </strong></p>\n<p>Patients with impaired renal function, high tumor burden, and <strong>elevated lactate dehydrogenase </strong>(LDH) level are more likely to develop <strong>tumor lysis syndrome. </strong></p>\n<p>Management is by <strong>a</strong><strong>ggressive hydration</strong> and administration of <strong>allopurinol</strong> at the same time as <strong>fludarabine </strong>are used to reduce the incidence of tumor lysis syndrome. <strong>Febuxostat</strong>, a non-selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, can be used to treat<strong> hyperuricemia</strong>. It does not require dose calculations and can be used in patients with mildly decreased renal function. <strong>Rasburicase</strong>, a recombinant urate oxidase, may also be used in patients with renal failure. <strong>Hemodialysis</strong> can be done in <strong>severe</strong> cases not responding to treatment. </p>\n<p>Other options: <br /><br />Option B - <strong>Chronic kidney disease</strong> would have a long-term history of impaired kidney function. This patient’s kidney dysfunction is of recent onset. In addition, his laboratory values are more suggestive of tumor lysis syndrome. </p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Urate arthropathy</strong> (gouty arthritis) is not likely in this patient as he has no joint involvement. </p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Nephrotoxic nephropathy</strong> is unlikely in this patient.
