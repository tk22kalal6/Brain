      "solution": "<p>The likely diagnosis is a <strong>septal hematoma</strong>. </p>\n<p>Septal hematoma occurs when there is an <strong>accumulation of blood</strong> beneath the periosteum or perichondrium of the nasal septum. The most common cause of hematoma is <strong>nasal surgery</strong> or <strong>trauma</strong>. However, it is also seen in individuals with bleeding disorders. </p>\n<p>Patients present with <strong>bilateral nasal obstruction</strong>, frontal headache, and <strong>pressure sensation</strong> over the bridge. </p>\n<p>Examination, as seen in this patient, will show <strong>bilateral smooth rounded swellings</strong> of the nasal septum.

The incision can be made parallel to the nasal floor. Removing a small piece of nasal mucosa will aid in drainage. After drainage, the nose has to be <strong>packed</strong> bilaterally to avoid reaccumulation. </p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Septal abscess</strong> occurs usually when there is a secondary infection of a septal hematoma. It is characterized by <strong>fever, chills,</strong> and frontal headaches. </p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Septal perforation</strong> can occur after nasal surgery. Features depend on the size of the perforation. Smaller perforations can present with whistling while the larger perforations will present with epistaxis and crust formation.

Cottle test to relieve nasal obstruction has no role here. <strong>Trotter's method</strong> is used as a first aid to arrest bleeding from the little's area.</p>\n<p><strong>Atrophic rhinitis&nbsp;</strong>refers to chronic inflammation of the nose with <strong>atrophy</strong> of nasal mucosa. The patients may present with nasal obstruction due to the <strong>crusting</strong> filling the roomy nasal cavity.<strong> Removal</strong> of the crust may relieve the obstruction but has the risk of <strong>bleeding.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>nasal polyp</strong> occurs due to<strong> edematous nasal mucosa.</strong> It can be an <strong>antrochoanal</strong> polyp arising from the mucosa of the maxillary antrum or an <strong>ethmoida</strong>l polyp arising from the middle meatus in the lateral wall of the nose. These polyps appear as <strong>globular mass</strong> and can be differentiated from turbinate hypertrophy by a <strong>probe test</strong>. Nasal obstruction resulting from polyps get resolved by conservative or surgical management.</p>",

This can result either from increased production of&nbsp;endolymph or its faulty absorption or both. Normally, endolymph secreted by <strong>stria</strong> <strong>vascularis</strong>, fills the membranous&nbsp;labyrinth, and is absorbed through the endolymphatic sac.</p>\n<p>Meniere's disease is a chronic condition of the inner ear that affects balance and hearing. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo, which are brief and intense episodes of spinning dizziness. Patients may also experience a sense of pressure or fullness in the affected ear, along with fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in the ear). The tinnitus associated with Meniere's disease is typically low-tone roaring in nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Other options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo</strong> (BPPV) is another common cause of vertigo, but it is characterized by brief episodes of vertigo triggered by specific head movements, such as rolling over in bed or looking up. BPPV does not typically cause ear pressure, hearing loss, or low-tone roaring tinnitus.</li>\n<li><strong>Labyrinthitis</strong> is an inflammation of the inner ear, usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. It can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus, but it is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as ear pain, fever, and a general feeling of illness.</li>\n<li><strong>Syncope</strong> refers to a temporary loss of consciousness and muscle tone, often caused by a decrease in blood flow to the brain. It is not associated with the symptoms described in the scenario, such as vertigo, ear pressure, hearing loss, or tinnitus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
