They also exhibit difficulty in fine motor skills like assembling jigsaw pieces, using scissors, drawing, or tracing. This results in poor performance in sports and even in academic achievement because of poor writing skills. Yet, they <strong>excel at verbal skills.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Three general areas of deficits contribute to the disorder:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor predictive control of motor movements</li>\n<li>Deficits in rhythmic coordination and timing</li>\n<li>Deficits in executive functions, including working memory, inhibition, and attention.</li>\n</ul>",
