This is a <strong>slimy </strong>and<strong> gelatinous layer</strong> that contains algae, diatoms and plankton. The <strong>formation</strong> of such a layer is the <strong>ripening</strong> of the filter and this layer is the <strong>heart of a slow sand filter</strong>. It removes organic matter, prevents bacteria from flowing through and oxidizes ammoniacal nitrogen into nitrates, thus rendering the water<strong> bacteria-free</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Under-drainage system:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>A system of <strong>porous and perforated pipes</strong>, at the bottom of the filter bed, is part of the under-drainage system.</li>\n<li>They provide an <strong>outlet </strong>for the<strong> filtered water</strong> and a support to the filter medium above.</li>\n<li>The <strong>under-drainage system</strong> along with the <strong>supernatant water</strong> and sand <strong>bed</strong> is kept in a<strong> filter box</strong>, which is usually <strong>2.5 to 4 metres</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Filter control:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>outlet-pipe system</strong> is provided with <strong>valves </strong>and other devices which maintain a constant rate of filtration.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Venturi meter</strong> measures the <strong>bed resistance</strong> or the <strong>loss of head</strong>.</li>\n<li>When the resistance builds up, the operator opens the <strong>regulatory valve</strong> to maintain a steady-state of filtration.</li>\n<li>When the loss of head <strong>exceeds 1.5 metres </strong>(4 feet), it is <strong>uneconomical</strong> to run the filter.</li>\n<li>If the regulatory <strong>valve has to be kept fully open</strong> as the <strong>bed resistance is very high</strong>, the <strong>filter needs to be cleaned</strong>.</li>\n<li>This is done by <strong>scraping</strong> the <strong>sand bed</strong>, which doesn&rsquo;t need to be done by skilled labor. After several years of operation (say 20 to 30 scrappings) the sand bed can be changed as it would have diminished in size.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Advantages</strong> of slow sand filters:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simple </strong>to construct and operate.</li>\n<li>Cost of construction is<strong> cheap</strong> compared to rapid sand filters.</li>\n<li>Physical, chemical and bacteriological <strong>quality</strong> of the water is <strong>very high</strong> which is partially owed to the <strong>long duration</strong> taken for filtration.</li>\n<li>Bacteria are cleared <strong>more effectively</strong> than rapid filters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
