For example, a study determining the mean blood pressure of patients visiting a PHC on a single day.</p>\n<p><strong>Analytical statistics </strong>are&nbsp;the second major category of epidemiological studies, after descriptive statistics. The objective of an analytical study is to <strong>test </strong>the<strong> hypothesis</strong>.</p>\n<p>An<strong> observational study</strong>&nbsp;is an empiric investigation in which the objective is to <strong>establish</strong> a relationship between&nbsp;<strong>cause and effect</strong>. It falls under the category of analytical statistics.</p>\n<p>It is performed when&nbsp;controlled experimentation cannot be feasibly used to determine a hypothesis. For example, in the case of cigarette smoking causing lung cancer, it would be unethical and not feasible to conduct a controlled experiment. So, an observational study is preferred.</p>\n<p><strong>Inferential statistics</strong>&nbsp;involve inductive reasoning i.e.,<strong> generalizing observations&nbsp;</strong>to a population after having observed only a sample. An example of such a study would be a study determining the expected success rate of vasectomy&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Theoretical statistics</strong> is a <strong>mathematical</strong> <strong>approach</strong> to describe something, predict events, or analyze the relationship between things. Some of the concepts of theoretical statistics are mean, median, mode, standard deviation and correlation.</p>",
