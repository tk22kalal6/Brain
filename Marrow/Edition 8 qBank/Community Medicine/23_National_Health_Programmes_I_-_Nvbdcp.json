Antigenemia refers to the presence of adult filaria worms in the human body.</p>\n<p>According to the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (<strong>ELF</strong>) Programme, there are <strong>two criteria</strong> to consider elimination of lymphatic filariasis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Children born after the initiation of the elimination programme are free from circulating antigenemia.</li>\n<li>The number of <strong>microfilaria carriers is &lt;1%</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following the failure to achieve ELF by 2015, the target set to eliminate lymphatic filariasis by WHO was 2020. To achieve the same WHO recommended the use of <strong>triple therapy </strong>for lymphatic filariasis. It incorporated <strong>ivermectin</strong> along with <strong>diethylcarbamazine</strong> (DEC) and <strong>albendazole</strong> instead of the traditional DEC and albendazole therapy, for the elimination of transmission of lymphatic filariasis.</p>\n<p>In <strong>2021</strong>, WHO released the '<strong>Road Map for Neglected Tropical Diseases (2021–2030)</strong>'. Under this, lymphatic filariasis is targeted for <strong>elimination</strong> as a public health problem by <strong>2030</strong>.</p>\n<p>In February <strong>2023</strong>, the <strong>Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare</strong> in India launched a nationwide Sarva Dawa Sevan or <strong>Mass Drug Administration</strong> (MDA) campaign to <strong>eliminate LF</strong> by <strong>2027</strong>, aiming to achieve this goal three years ahead of the global target.</p>",
