The cases are interviewed one week after the coronary attack. If smoker patients with AMI die more frequently, the living cases will show a lower frequency of smoking, undervaluing the association between smoking and AMI. It has been shown that the bias occurs only if the risk factor influences mortality from the disease being studied.</p>\n<p><strong>Ecological fallacy</strong> results when characteristics of the group are assigned inappropriately to individuals.</p>",
