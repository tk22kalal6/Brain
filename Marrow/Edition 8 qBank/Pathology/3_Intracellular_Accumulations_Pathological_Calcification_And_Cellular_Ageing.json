      "solution": "<p>The given clinical features are suggestive of&nbsp;<strong>Werner syndrome</strong>, a&nbsp;<strong>premature aging</strong>&nbsp;disorder. The mutated gene encodes a<strong>&nbsp;DNA helicase.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Werner syndrome is an&nbsp;<strong>autosomal recessive</strong>&nbsp;disease&nbsp;caused by mutations in the&nbsp;<strong>WRN gene</strong>. This gene encodes a protein with multiple DNA-dependent enzymatic functions including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ATPase</li>\n<li>Helicase</li>\n<li>Exonuclease</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DNA helicase is involved in DNA replication and repair. A defect in this enzyme causes rapid&nbsp;<strong>accumulation</strong>&nbsp;of<strong>&nbsp;damaged chromosomes</strong>&nbsp;that may&nbsp;<strong>mimic</strong>&nbsp;the injury that normally accumulates&nbsp;during&nbsp;<strong>cellular aging</strong>. Affected persons show various manifestations of premature aging including: &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Atherosclerosis</li>\n<li>Senile cataract</li>\n<li>Skin atrophy</li>\n<li>Alopecia</li>\n<li>Osteoporosis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They are also at risk for the development of a variety of cancers. Patients typically die in the 5th decade from either&nbsp;<strong>cancer</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>cardiovascular disease</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Human Diseases of DNA Damage Repair</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>DNA damage repair type</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Diseases</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective Nonhomologous End Joining Repair (NHEJ)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID)</p>\n<p>Radiation sensitive severe combined immunodeficiency disease(RS-SCID)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective Homologous Repair (HR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AT-like disorder (ATLD)</p>\n<p>Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)</p>\n<p>Bloom syndrome (BS)</p>\n<p>Werner syndrome (WS)</p>\n<p>Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS)</p>\n<p>Breast cancer suspectibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1, BRCA2)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)</p>\n<p>Cockayne syndrome (CS)</p>\n<p>Trichothiodystrophy (TTD)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Base Excision Repair (BER)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
