It can occur even after artificial reproductive therapy. Hence, after embryo transfer, intercourse must be avoided. Heteropaternal superfecundation is used to refer to instances of two different males fathering fraternal twins. This leads to the possibility of twins also being half-siblings. This may give rise to the doubt of adultery and infidelity. </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Superfetation</strong> is the fertilization of 2 different ova released in <strong>different menstrual cycles</strong> (i.e ovulation and fertilization <strong>during</strong> <strong>pregnancy)</strong>. This can occur <strong>within 12 weeks</strong> of pregnancy after which the decidual space is obliterated and a detailed evaluation will reveal disparities in gestational ages.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Supposititious child </strong>is also known as a fictitious child. In such cases, a woman pretends to be pregnant and generally substitutes a male child for a female child born of her, or after an abortion.
