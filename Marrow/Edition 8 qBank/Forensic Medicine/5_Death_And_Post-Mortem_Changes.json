      "solution": "<p>Victims of <strong>smoke inhalation</strong> are affected by<strong> carbon monoxide poisoning.</strong> In carbon monoxide poisoning, the cause of death is <strong>anemic hypoxia. </strong></p>\n<p>Carbon monoxide has a <strong>higher affinity</strong> to <strong>hemoglobin</strong> compared to oxygen and hence the amount of hemoglobin available for oxygen transport is markedly reduced. It <strong>displaces oxygen</strong> from its combination with hemoglobin and forms a relatively stable compound known as <strong>carboxyhemoglobin</strong>. It thus <strong>reduces</strong> the <strong>oxygen content</strong> of the blood, and hence, that of the tissues. It acts as a chemical asphyxiant and produces death due to <strong>anemic anoxia</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that in the case of <strong>anemic hypoxia, O<sub>2</sub> content is low </strong>but <strong>dissolved O<sub>2</sub> </strong>is within<strong> normal </strong>limits so it does not stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors.</p>\n<p>Note: Carbon monoxide poisoning causes <strong>both</strong> anemic (due to CO-Hb) and histotoxic (due to inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase) hypoxia. But the main cause of death is due to <strong>anemic hypoxia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Histotoxic hypoxia</strong>- The most common example is cyanide poisoning. Cyanide inhibits important enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation process, which is essential to the survival of our cells. Additional oxygen supplementation will not be able to overcome this inhibition, so it will have limited benefit. Hyperbaric oxygen may be helpful to some extent.</p>\n<p>Option B - Stagnant hypoxia refers to ischemic hypoxia that results from inadequate circulation due to conditions such as heart failure and hypoxia in the setting of shock. In such conditions, administering intravenous fluids can improve the patient's condition because it is the circulation that is affected. If the shock is prolonged it can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be treated with positive pressure ventilation and not simply by increasing oxygen administration.</p>",
