It damages motor and autonomic nerves;&nbsp;<strong>sensory</strong> nerves are&nbsp;<strong>not involved</strong>.<br /> <br />Poliovirus<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a non-enveloped,&nbsp;<strong>positive-stranded RNA virus&nbsp;</strong>belonging to the Picornaviridae family. Three antigenically distinct serotypes (types 1, 2, and 3) are known. Ages 6 months to 5 years are most commonly affected. The virus is transmitted via the <strong>fecal-oral route</strong> and has an incubation period of 8-12 days.&nbsp;<strong>Humans</strong> are the <strong>only</strong> known <strong>reservoir</strong> for the polioviruses.</p>\n<p>The virus colonizes and replicates in the GI mucosa (<strong>M cells</strong>), followed by entry into the blood via regional lymph nodes. In blood, it causes viremia and gets access to the CNS via the peripheral nerves, finally reaching the&nbsp;<strong>anterior horn cells</strong>&nbsp;in the spinal cord.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most cases are subclinical. Some have minor illnesses like fever, sore throat, headache, and malaise. It can present as <strong>non-paralytic polio</strong> (aseptic meningitis) or <strong>paralytic</strong> <strong>polio</strong> (flaccid paralysis with absent deep tendon reflexes).&nbsp;Most frequently, the completely affected muscle is the&nbsp;<strong>tibialis anterior. </strong>It is <strong>asymmetric</strong> <strong>paralysis</strong> which is more severe if strenuous physical exercise occurred during the onset of paralysis.
