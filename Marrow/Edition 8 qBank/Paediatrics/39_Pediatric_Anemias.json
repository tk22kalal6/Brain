Depending on the chain affected, it is classified into <strong>&alpha;-thalassemia</strong> and <strong>&beta;-thalassemia</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\">&beta;-thalassemia is caused by <strong>point mutations</strong> of the &beta;-thalassemia gene on chromosome 11, which diminish the synthesis of &beta;-globin chains.<strong> Splicing mutations</strong> are the <strong>most common</strong> cause of (&beta;+) thalassemia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\">There is a deficit in the synthesis of HbA with an <strong>elevation of HbA2</strong> and<strong> HbF</strong> levels in &beta;-thalassemia.
