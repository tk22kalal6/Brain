The most common cause&nbsp;is<strong> scar dehiscence</strong> due to a<strong> previous cesarean section</strong>. This can occur due to trial of labour after C-section, or due to spontaneous labor in a patient with previous C-section. Other causes of uterine rupture are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prolonged induction</strong> or augmentation of labor</li>\n<li><strong>Obstructed labor</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Blunt abdominal trauma</strong> during pregnancy</li>\n<li>Rupture of hematometra</li>\n<li>Rupture of pyometra&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;Uterine rupture is managed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immediate cesarean section</li>\n<li>Depending upon the extent of rupture:\n<ul>\n<li>Subtotal hysterectomy</li>\n<li>Hysterectomy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
