It occurs due to <strong>deficiency of folic acid</strong> in the mother.</p>\n<p>The <strong>calendar</strong> method or the <strong>rhythm</strong> method is one of the <strong>natural</strong> methods of contraception by <strong>fertility awareness</strong>. The couple is advised avoidance of sexual intercourse around ovulation. Thus, it is very cost-effective but it can only be used by educated couples.</p>\n<p>According to this method, <strong>safe period</strong> in a normal 28-day cycle is from the <strong>1st</strong> day of menstrual period to the <strong>10th</strong> day and from the <strong>18th</strong>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<strong>28th</strong> day. An alternate method is by calculating the risk period i.e.,&nbsp;3 days before and 3 days after ovulation. <strong>Ovulation</strong> can also be estimated by <strong>changes</strong> in <strong>cervical mucus</strong> and <strong>basal body temperature</strong>.</p>\n<p>Another method of calculating the safe period is the <strong>Knaus&ndash;Ogino method</strong>. The fertile&nbsp;period is determined by subtracting 18 days from the shortest cycle and 10 days from the longest cycle. This&nbsp;gives the&nbsp;first and the last day of the fertile period, respectively.&nbsp;</p>",
