      "solution": "<p>In the clinal scenario of a <strong>55-year-old</strong> woman with <strong>third-degree uterine prolapse</strong>, the ideal management is <strong>vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Uterine prolapse is the descent of the uterus from its normal position which usually occurs due to laxity of ligaments that offer support, seen often due to childbirth, aging, or trauma. The uterine descent is clinically categorized into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First</strong> degree:&nbsp; the <strong>external</strong> <strong>os</strong> remains <strong>above</strong> the vaginal <strong>introitus</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Second</strong> degree: The <strong>external</strong> <strong>os</strong> protrudes <strong>below</strong> the vaginal <strong>introitus</strong> but the uterine body remains inside the vagina&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Third degree (Syn: <strong>Complete</strong> <strong>prolapse</strong>): The <strong>uterine,</strong> <strong>cervix,</strong> <strong>body,</strong> and <strong>fundus</strong> descend to lie <strong>outside</strong> the <strong>introitus</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Procidentia</strong> involves prolapse of the uterus with the <strong>entire</strong> <strong>vagina everted</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The patient usually presents with a sense of heaviness in the pelvic region with lower back discomfort. Based on the structures involved the patient can additionally have urinary symptoms (like incontinence and urgency), bowel disturbances (constipation and tenesmus), or sexual discomfort during intercourse.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptomatic</strong> uterine prolapse is managed <strong>surgically</strong> with different procedures based on the profile of the patient. <strong>Conservative</strong> management is done for <strong>old asymptomatic</strong> <strong>women</strong> with <strong>mild</strong> <strong>degree</strong> <strong>prolapse</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A <strong>vaginal</strong> <strong>hysterectomy</strong> is recommended for patients who satisfy the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&gt;40</strong> years of age&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Have <strong>completed</strong> their <strong>families</strong></li>\n<li>Do <strong>not</strong> wish to <strong>preserve</strong> menstrual and <strong>child-bearing</strong> function</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Fothergill</strong> <strong>repair</strong> or <strong>Manchester</strong> <strong>operation</strong> is a procedure done to <strong>preserve</strong> the <strong>reproductive</strong> <strong>function</strong> and vaginal prolapse with supravaginal cervix elongation. It initially involves preliminary curettage with low amputation of the cervix. After Mackenrodt's ligament is plicated,&nbsp; anterior colporrhaphy and colpoperineorrhaphy are performed.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Sling</strong> <strong>operation</strong> (Purandare's operation) is indicated in <strong>congenital</strong> or <strong>nulliparous</strong> <strong>prolapse</strong> without cystocele. The procedure involves the extraperitoneal passage of rectus sheath strips joined to the anterior surface of the cervix by silk sutures.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Shirodkar</strong> <strong>procedure</strong> is a type of <strong>abdominal</strong> <strong>sling</strong> <strong>surgery</strong> done in young women to <strong>retain</strong> <strong>menstrual</strong> and <strong>reproductive</strong> function. It involves using a sling to <strong>fix</strong> the <strong>cervix</strong> to the <strong>lumbosacral</strong> <strong>fascia</strong>.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Management of Uterine prolapse</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Treatment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nulliparous or congenital prolapse&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Abdominal sling operations:</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 374\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>Abdominal wall cervicopexy</li>\n<li>Shirodkar&rsquo;s abdominal sling operation</li>\n<li>Khanna&rsquo;s abdominal sling operation</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pregnancy and postnatal period</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ring pessary (up to 16 weeks period of gestation)</li>\n<li>Pelvic floor exercises</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&lt;40 years&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Fothergill's repair (Manchester operation)</li>\n<li>Shirodkar's procedure</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&gt;40 years - with completed family&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Vaginal hysterectomy and pelvic floor repair&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&gt;60 years - unfit for surgery&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Le Fort's repair</li>\n<li>Colpocleisis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are done if the patient doesn't want to retain sexual function&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
