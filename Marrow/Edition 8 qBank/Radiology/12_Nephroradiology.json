It is thought to be caused due to ureteric orifice atresia. They are similar to ectopic ureters, which typically drain the upper pole of the kidney and are associated with dysplastic or non-functional renal tissue.</p>\n<p>If they present clinically, ureteroceles often manifest with <strong>urinary tract infections</strong> (UTIs) in <strong>children</strong>, while in <strong>adults,</strong> they are more likely to present with <strong>stones</strong> in the lower ureter. Ureterocoeles can enlarge and obstruct the bladder neck or the contralateral ureteric orifice.</p>\n<p>The classic sign of a ureterocele on intravenous urography is a ‘cobra head’, ‘adder head’, or 'spring onion sign'.  On ultrasonography, it can be seen as a <strong>fluid-filled cystic mass</strong> in the bladder.</p>\n<p>The treatment of simple ureteroceles is <strong>surgical excision with re-implantation</strong> of the ureter.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: IVU signs and associated conditions</h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Medullary sponge kidney</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bouquet of flowers/ paintbrush appearance</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">It refers to the cystic dilatation of the distal collecting tubules</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8f2786a330a940aaa19ecbbf32156f4dx510x542.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Duplex kidney</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Drooping lily sign</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It refers to the inferolateral displacement of the lower pole due to an obstructed upper pole in a duplicated collecting system</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/05ef8241719949f8a3949f3fdd38676ax510x514.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Horseshoe kidney</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Handshake sign - due to the position of the lower poles closer to the spine, and the lower calyces closer to each other</li>\n<li>Flower vase sign - due to medially rotated calyces</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c72498faeb6a49d19adfabbc4b79e00bx510x615.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Retroperitoneal fibrosis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Maiden waist deformity&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It refers to the medially drawn ureters caused by fibrosis at the lumbosacral junction</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/12454083a31f4e26b5ef692f0ea8de70x1280x827.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Retrocaval ureter&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Fish hook / Reverse J deformity&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Right ureter hooks behind the IVC as it passes posterior to it</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f9fbf9d4e5544ea9a2ce4ebddc1adfeax510x610.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Ureterocele</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Cobra/ Adder head appearance</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It refers to the dilation of the distal ureter</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/903af92cf55f4e3aa983cf7e7e256e3ax1280x827.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Goblet sign</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It is due to the focal dilation of the ureter by an intraluminal mass</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0f65ba8b0a8943e2ade74d16de10d077x510x542.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",
