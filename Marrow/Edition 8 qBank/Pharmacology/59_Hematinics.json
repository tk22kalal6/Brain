      "solution": "<p>The scenario in the question depicts a case of<strong> chronic immune thrombocytopenia </strong>which can be treated with a<strong> tyrosine kinase inhibitor </strong>called<strong>&nbsp;fostamatinib.</strong></p>\n<p>Fostamatinib has activity against <strong>spleen tyrosine kinase</strong> (SYK). The major metabolite of fostamatinib, R406, inhibits signal transduction of Fc-activating receptors and B-cell receptors. The fostamatinib metabolite R406 reduces antibody-mediated destruction of platelets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;<strong>Romiplostim</strong> is a <strong>TPO receptor agonist</strong> indicated in&nbsp;<strong>chronic immune thrombocytopenia.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Bosutinib</strong> is a <strong>BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor</strong> indicated in <strong>CML</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Oprelvekin</strong>&nbsp;is a recombinant IL-11 that is used in the&nbsp;prophylaxis of <strong>thrombocytopenia </strong>during<strong> cancer chemotherapy.&nbsp;</strong></p>",
