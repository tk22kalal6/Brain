Development of this drug resistance is almost invariably the<strong> result of monotherapy, </strong>i.e., the failure of the health care provider to prescribe at least 2 drugs to which the tubercle bacilli are susceptible. Hence, multi-drug therapy is recommended for the treatment of tuberculosis. </p>",

This drug enters bacilli by <strong>passive diffusion</strong>. It then gets activated to its toxic form by the enzyme <strong>catalase-peroxidase</strong>(the enzyme encoded by the <strong>Kat gene</strong>).</p>\n<p>Normally, InhA and KasA are involved in the synthesis of mycolic acid. Upon activation, the reactive metabolite of isoniazid forms complexes with <strong>NAD</strong> that inhibit <strong>InhA</strong> and <strong>KasA</strong>. Hence, isoniazid inhibits the production of <strong>mycolic acid</strong>.</p>\n<p>The reactive isoniazid metabolite also forms complexes with <strong>NADP</strong>. This complex inhibits mycobacterial dihydrofolate reductase which results in the interruption of <strong>DNA synthesis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Side effects of isoniazid include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Peripheral neuritis</strong> due to interference with the production of active coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate from pyridoxine. Therefore, <strong>pyridoxine 10mg/day (vitamin B6)</strong> is given prophylactically along with isoniazid to prevent neurotoxicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Hepatitis</strong> - isoniazid must be stopped at the first sign of hepatotoxicity.</li>\n<li>Rashes</li>\n<li>Anaemia</li>\n<li>Arthralgia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Toxicity of isoniazid results in <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>seizures, and coma.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;Rifampin acts by binding to <strong>DNA-dependent RNA polymerase</strong> to form a stable drug-enzyme complex. This complex suppresses RNA synthesis. Side effects of rifampin are hepatitis,<strong>&nbsp;flu-like illness, orange-red colored urine</strong>, and body secretions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Option C: Pyrazinamide is a prodrug, it is converted into an active metabolite<strong> pyrazinoic acid </strong>which makes the intracellular environment <strong>acidic</strong> and collapses the transmembrane proton motive force, thereby killing the bacteria. Side effects include&nbsp;<strong>hyperuricemia</strong> and hepatotoxicity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D: Ethambutol<strong> inhibits arabinose transferase III, </strong>thereby decreasing arabinogalactan biosynthesis<strong>. </strong>This results in&nbsp;disruption in&nbsp;mycobacterial cell wall synthesis.&nbsp;<strong>Optic neuritis</strong> is an important side effect of<strong> ethambutol</strong>.
