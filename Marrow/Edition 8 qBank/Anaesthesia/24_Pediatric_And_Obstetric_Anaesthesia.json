It is water-soluble and hence painless on injection. It&nbsp;is usually administered to children <strong>10 to 12 months or older</strong>&nbsp;because of separation anxiety from parents.</p>\n<p>Other sedative premedications that are sometimes used include dexmedetomidine, clonidine, temazepam and ketamine.</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Barbiturates </strong>are not commonly used for premedication in children since the availability of short-acting benzodiazepines. A major disadvantage is hyperalgesia, which can induce agitation in children with pain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Diazepam</strong>&nbsp;has a longer elimination half-life (18 hours) and immature liver function that would prolong its action in young children.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Propofol&nbsp;</strong>is the most useful sedative-hypnotic drug but is not approved for this use in pediatric patients.</p>\n<p>Note<strong>- Ketamine </strong>is effective as a sedative, but it can increase oral secretion and can cause hallucinations during recovery. Hence oral ketamine is usually avoided, and when used, is administered along&nbsp;with antisialogogue (atropine/glycopyrrolate) and a benzodiazepine (such as midazolam).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
