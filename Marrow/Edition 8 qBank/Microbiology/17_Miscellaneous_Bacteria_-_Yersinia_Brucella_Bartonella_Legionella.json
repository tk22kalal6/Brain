They can be identified in lymph node biopsy with Warthin-Starry Silver stain. In addition to cat scratch disease, in immunocompromised individuals, it can also cause <strong>bacillary angiomatosis</strong> and <strong>peliosis hepatis</strong>. </p>\n<p>In immunocompetent hosts, cat scratch disease is a self limiting illness. However in patients with severe disease, azithromycin can be used to treat the infection. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/79d9f951c90043738ab30c2f9e0f4784x600x890.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
