It is characterized by a sudden release of <strong>histamines</strong> and other chemicals from the immune system in response to an allergen, such as certain <strong>foods,</strong> medications, insect stings, or latex. The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to a few hours after exposure to the allergen.The primary mediators are <strong>histamine</strong> and <strong>serotonin.</strong> The secondary mediators are prostaglandins and leukotrienes. </p>\n<p>Clinically, anaphylaxis can present with a combination of symptoms that typically include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Respiratory</strong> Symptoms: Patients often experience wheezing and respiratory distress due to bronchoconstriction. Other signs may include shortness of breath, coughing, and a feeling of tightness in the chest.</li>\n<li><strong>Skin</strong> Symptoms: Urticaria (hives) and angioedema (swelling of the skin and mucous membranes) are common. These skin reactions usually develop rapidly, often within minutes to two hours of exposure to the allergen.</li>\n<li><strong>Cardiovascular</strong> Symptoms: Hypotension (low blood pressure) is a key indicator of anaphylaxis. Patients may also experience tachycardia (increased heart rate) and, in severe cases, shock.</li>\n<li><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> Symptoms: Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps can occur, particularly if the anaphylaxis is triggered by food allergens.</li>\n<li><strong>Neurological</strong> Symptoms: Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness can occur due to the sudden drop in blood pressure and reduced oxygen supply to the brain.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/34b854b6d6c24f5abdbaf78af5720d06x1280x2567.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Mechanisms of Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Type</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Immune Mechanisms</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Histopathological lesions</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Immediate </strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;hypersensitivity<br />(type I)<br /></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anaphylaxis</li>\n<li>Allergies</li>\n<li>Bronchial asthma</li>\n<li>Atopic dermatitis</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Production of IgE antibody &rarr;immediate release of vasoactive amines from mast cells</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vascular dilatation, edema, smooth muscle contraction, mucus production, tissue injury, inflammation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Antibody-mediated hypersensitivity<br />(type II)<br /></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autoimmune hemolytic anemia</li>\n<li>Goodpasture syndrome</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Production of IgG, IgM &rarr; binds to antigen on target cell or tissue &rarr; phagocytosis or lysis of target cell by activated complement or Fc receptors; recruitment of leukocytes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Phagocytosis and lysis of cells; inflammation;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity<br /> (type III)<br /></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>SLE</li>\n<li>Serum sickness</li>\n<li>Arthus reaction</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Deposition of antigen-antibody complexes &rarr; complement activation &rarr;recruitment of leukocytes by complement products and Fc receptors &rarr; release of enzymes and other toxic molecules</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Inflammation, necrotizing vasculitis (fibrinoid necrosis)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Cell-mediated hypersensitivity<br />(type IV)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact dermatitis</li>\n<li>Multiple sclerosis</li>\n<li>Type 1 diabetes</li>\n<li>Tuberculosis</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Activated T lymphocytes &rarr;</p>\n<p>1.
