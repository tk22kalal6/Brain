It is due to mutations of the <strong>ABCA12 gene</strong>. The gene plays a role in lamellar body formation in the stratum granulosum and desquamation of the stratum corneum. </p>\n<p>It presents in the neonatal period with <strong>armor‐like skin</strong> (truncal plates with fissuring). It can impair body movement and breathing. <strong>Bilateral ectropion</strong> and <strong>eclabium</strong> are present. <strong>Respiratory problems</strong> are the major cause of death due to alveolar collapse in neonates. They are also prone to skin and lung infections.</p>\n<p><strong>Defective lamellar bodies</strong> in the <strong>stratum granulosum</strong> seen in <strong>electron microscopy</strong> are pathognomic of Harlequin ichthyosis. In early life, constant <strong>supportive care</strong> is required. Treatment includes <strong>moisturizing cream</strong>, <strong>antibiotics</strong>, <strong>etretinate</strong>, or <strong>retinoids</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options - </p>\n<p>Option A) <strong>Ichthyosis vulgaris</strong> - The <strong>most common</strong> type of ichthyosis, involving mutations in <strong>filaggrin protein</strong>. Filaggrin is an<strong> epidermal protein</strong> that helps <strong>retain moisture</strong> in the <strong>stratum corneum</strong>. Ichthyosis is <strong>not present at birth</strong> but develops during the first months of life. The<strong> scaling</strong> usually involves the <strong>extensor surfaces</strong> of the extremities with <strong>flexural sparing</strong>. They are <strong>strongly correlated</strong> with<strong> atopic dermatitis</strong> and other forms of atopy such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, etc.</p>\n<p>Option B) <strong>Bathing suit ichthyosis </strong>is a type of congenital ichthyosis caused by mutations in the TGM1 gene. It presents as a <strong>collodion baby</strong> at birth where the neonate is encased in a <strong>shiny parchment‐like membrane. </strong>Shedding of the collodion membrane is followed by the development of <strong>large dark grey/brownish scales</strong> affecting the<strong> trunk </strong>and the <strong>scalp</strong>, but sparing the face and extremities resembling a <strong>bathing suit</strong>. The disease tends to become worse in the summer months and improves in winter.</p>\n<p>Option D) <strong>Lamellar ichthyosis</strong> is also a congenital ichthyosis, involving mutations in the <strong>TGM1 gene</strong>. It is characterized by large plate‐like <strong>dark‐brown hyperkeratoses</strong> covering the <strong>entire body</strong> with <strong>mild palmoplantar </strong>involvement. The extreme spectrum of lamellar ichthyosis is <strong>congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE)</strong> which is similar to erythroderma seen in psoriasis. </p>",
