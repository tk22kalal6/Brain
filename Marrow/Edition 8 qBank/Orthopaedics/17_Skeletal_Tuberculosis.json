      "solution": "<p><strong>Spina ventosa</strong> is a feature of <strong>tuberculous dactylitis</strong>. This refers to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>tuberculosis of short tubular bones</strong> i.e. metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges.</p>\n<p>The infection is lodged in the marrow cavity leading to spindle-shaped expansion/ <strong>ballooned-out appearance</strong> of the bone known as spina ventosa. Periosteal reaction, abscess, and sinus formation are seen.</p>\n<p><strong>TB sicca </strong>or<strong> caries sicca</strong> is the tuberculosis of the <strong>shoulder joint</strong>. It usually does not have any effusion of joint, hence it is known as sicca which is a Latin word for 'dry'.</p>\n<p>The image below shows tuberculous dactylitis. Note the swelling in the affected phalanx.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/224f97a5aebc4d82885e080005cb776ax590x599.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
