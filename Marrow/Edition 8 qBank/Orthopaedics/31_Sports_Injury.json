      "solution": "<p>The above clinical scenario and positive Thompson's test point to a diagnosis of&nbsp;<strong>Achilles tendon rupture</strong>.</p>\n<p>Achilles tendon rupture is usually seen in those playing sports like squash, badminton, and football. The pain is <strong>acute</strong> and the patient can feel a <strong>ripping</strong> or<strong> popping sensation</strong> at the back of the heel.&nbsp;The patient would be&nbsp;<strong>unable to plantarflex</strong> the affected foot.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In <strong>Thompson's test</strong>, the patient lies prone with his foot over the end of the examination table. The examiner <strong>squeezes</strong> the <strong>calf</strong> muscles, specifically the gastrocnemius-soleus complex, with his hand. This should normally cause contraction of the Achilles tendon, resulting in plantar flexion. If the Achilles <strong>tendon</strong> is completely <strong>ruptured</strong>, <strong>plantar flexion</strong> would be <strong>absent</strong>.</p>\n<p>Achilles <strong>tendinitis</strong> is usually seen in athletes, joggers, and hikers. It is caused due to the <strong>local irritation</strong> of the tendon sheath. Patients present with gradually progressive pain over the Achilles tendon. On examination, there may be thickening of the tendon with inflammation over the affected area.</p>\n<p><strong>Ultrasound</strong> may be needed to <strong>exclude</strong> tendon&nbsp;<strong>tear or rupture</strong>. It is usually treated by physiotherapy.</p>",
