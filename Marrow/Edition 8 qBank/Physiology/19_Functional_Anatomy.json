However, the contribution by the smallest airways is very little to the overall total resistance. This is because, the airway branches in each generation exist in <strong>parallel</strong> rather than in series. As the parallel branching increases, the resistance decreases. (<strong>Total</strong> cross-sectional diameter of small airways put together is high). Thus the overall resistance of the small airways is very small. Also,&nbsp;airflow velocity decreases substantially as the effective cross-sectional area increases (i.e., the flow becomes laminar).</p>\n<p>Other factors affecting airway resistance :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lung volume</strong>, as lung volume increases the resistance decreases and vice versa. Lung volume increases the transairway pressure thus increasing the caliber of the airway.</li>\n<li><strong>Airway mucus, edema</strong>, and <strong>contraction</strong> of bronchial smooth muscle increase the airway resistance. Its clinical application is seen in asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema</li>\n<li>The <strong>density </strong>and <strong>viscosity</strong> of inspired gas also contribute to airway resistance.
