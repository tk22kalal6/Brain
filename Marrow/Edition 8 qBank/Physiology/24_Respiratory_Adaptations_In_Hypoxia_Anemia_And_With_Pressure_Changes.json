Hence, lungs tend to collapse. To prevent this and to keep lung expanded, gas is delivered at high pressure to the lungs.</li>\n<li>According to Dalton&rsquo;s law, nitrogen contributes the maximum to barometric pressure and hence the amount of nitrogen entering alveoli increases.</li>\n<li>Henry&rsquo;s law: As the partial pressure of nitrogen in alveoli increases, its concentration in blood also increases (dissolved form). Nitrogen is 5 times more soluble in fat compared to water.</li>\n<li>As a result, nitrogen dissolves in the fatty substances in neuronal membranes, and because of its physical effect on altering ionic conductance through the membranes, it reduces neuronal excitability and produces the narcotic effect.</li>\n</ul><p>This was a recent AIIMS question.
