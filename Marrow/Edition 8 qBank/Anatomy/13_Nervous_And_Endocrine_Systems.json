      "solution": "<p>The <strong>neurites </strong>of the neurons constitute the<strong> dendrites </strong>and the<strong> axon.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Neurites</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>neuronal processes</strong> refer to any projection arising from the cell body (soma) of a neuron. They are of two types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Axon&nbsp;</strong>- a single, long projection arising from the cell body that carries the impulse away from the cell body. The axon ends by dividing into several branches called <strong>axon</strong>&nbsp;<strong>terminals,</strong>&nbsp;which synapses with the dendrites of another neuron. An axon may also end in relation to an effector organ such as muscle or a gland. It is free of Nissl granules.</li>\n<li><strong>Dendrites </strong>- multiple short projections arising from the cell body, that carry the nerve impulse towards the neuron. Nissl granules are present here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>neuronal cytoskeleton</strong> consists of <strong>neurofilaments</strong> and <strong>microtubules.</strong> These are abundantly seen in the cell body, dendrites and the axon. The neurofilaments are heteropolymers of proteins that give tensile strength to the axon. Bundles of neurofilaments constitute a <strong>neurofibril. Microtubules</strong> assist in <strong>axonal transport.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c03f4054313044d28652c72a7580842fx1280x999.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

During the formation of the myelin sheath, the axon invaginates the Schwann cell. The plasma membrane of the Schwann cell fuses with itself and continues to wrap around the axon to form multiple layers of the plasma membrane called the myelin sheath. The cytoplasm and nucleus of the Schwann cell are pushed to the periphery. The&nbsp;thin layer of the cytoplasm of the Schwann&nbsp;cell surrounding the myelin sheath is called <strong>neurilemma</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: Each Schwann cell myelinates only a short segment of the axon. Hence, along the&nbsp;length&nbsp;of the axon, there are several Schwann cells myelinating it. The&nbsp;<strong>unmyelinated</strong>&nbsp;<strong>portions</strong> of the<strong> axon</strong>&nbsp;present in between&nbsp;myelinated segments are known as<strong>&nbsp;nodes of Ranvier.</strong></p>",
