This is because 2-4 months is the critical period for visual maturation and development of the fixation reflex in children. A<strong> unilateral cataract </strong>is more<strong> dangerous</strong> than a bilateral cataract because the risk of<strong> amblyopia </strong>is greater. <strong>Under-correction</strong> of intraocular lens (IOL) power is needed in children.</p>\n<p>In children <strong>&lt; 2 years </strong>of age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In unilateral cases, primary implantation is indicated as soon as the patient is fit for anesthesia, ideally between<strong> 2</strong> and<strong> 3 months </strong>of age.

Anterior chamber IOLs lie entirely in front of the iris and are supported in the angle of the anterior chamber. These are associated with a higher incidence of <strong>bullous keratopathy</strong>. Thus, they are currently used only for correction of aphakia in cases where posterior chamber IOLs cannot be used (eg: rupture of posterior capsule). </p>",
