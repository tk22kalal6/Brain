      "solution": "<p>The prodromal symptoms of flashing lights, floaters followed by loss of monocular vision (curtain over the eye) and the B-scan suggest a diagnosis of<strong> rhegmatogenous retinal detachment</strong>. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the result of the accumulation of <strong>fluid </strong>between <strong>NSR </strong>and<strong> RPE</strong> due to a<strong> retinal tear</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Retinal detachment</strong> is the separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the most common type of retinal detachment. It occurs due to fluid accumulation after a retinal break (tear). High myopia, trauma, <strong>pseudophakia</strong>, aphakia are predisposing factors. Patients present with photopsia (flashes of light due to vitreoretinal traction at the site of the break), floaters and visual field defect (black curtain/veil in front of the eye). </p>\n<p>Signs include<strong> hypotony</strong>, as the liquefied vitreous in the subretinal space is absorbed through the RPE and <strong>Shafers sign </strong>or<strong> tobacco dusting </strong>(pigments in the anterior vitreous). The detached retina is convex in configuration. The surface is corrugated with undulations. The most dangerous type of retinal break is <strong>horseshoe tear </strong>and the most dangerous location of retinal break is the <strong>supero-temporal retina. </strong></p>\n<p>Treatment is by prophylactic laser barrage, scleral buckling, pneumatic retinopexy and pars plana vitrectomy. </p>\n<p>Other types of retinal detachment are<strong> tractional </strong>and <strong>exudative</strong> type:</p>\n<p><strong>Tractional retinal detachment </strong>occurs when<strong> f</strong><strong>ibro-vascular membranes</strong> in the <strong>vitreous</strong> due to long-standing <strong>retinal neovascularization</strong> exert traction on the retina.
