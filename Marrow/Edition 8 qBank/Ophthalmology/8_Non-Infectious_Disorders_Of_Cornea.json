It is defined as an <strong>idiopathic</strong> condition without associated systemic or rheumatological conditions and hence is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathophysiology is thought to be due to autoimmune.</p>\n<p>Clinical features include redness, tearing, and photophobia, but <strong>pain</strong> is typically the outstanding feature. The pain often is incapacitating and may well be out of proportion to the inflammation. There may also be a complaint of decreased visual acuity, which may be secondary to associated iritis or central corneal involvement. </p>\n<p>Initially, the ulcerative process<strong> spreads circumferentially. </strong>Later, it moves<strong> centrally</strong> to involve the entire cornea. In contrast to other forms of PUK, the <strong>limbus </strong>is involved. The end-stage result is typically a <strong>scarred, vascularized cornea </strong>that may be<strong> thinned</strong> to less than half of its original thickness. </p>\n<p>Treatment involves corticosteroids and excision of a strip of adjacent conjunctiva, which eliminates the conjunctival sources of collagenase and proteoglycanase.  </p>\n<p>The image shows a perforated Mooren's ulcer.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/82d2bac6ec7a4e308fe82b412d80e266x455x438.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
