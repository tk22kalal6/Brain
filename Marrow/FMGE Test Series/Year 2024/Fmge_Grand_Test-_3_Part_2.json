Depending on the chain affected, it is classified into α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia.</p>\n<p><strong>β-Thalassemia</strong> arises due to the deficient synthesis of β-chains. Normal adult RBCs have HbA, along with HbA2 and fetal haemoglobin (HbF) in small amounts.

It can also present as an α-thalassemia trait, with trivial hematologic abnormalities.
