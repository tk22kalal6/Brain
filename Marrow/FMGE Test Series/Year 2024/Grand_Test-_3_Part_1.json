This reduction in the heart rate <strong>decreases the myocardial oxygen demand.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The oxygen requirement of the heart mainly depends on the work done by the heart. This work mainly depends on cardiac output and peripheral resistance. An increase in these parameters will increase the oxygen requirement of the heart.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Important determinants of cardiac output are:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Stroke volume</strong>- It is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat. This stroke volume increases whenever, there is <strong>increased venous</strong> return to the heart, increased end-diastolic volume (<strong>preload</strong>), and increased contractility. Contractility further depends on the <strong>initial length</strong> of the cardiac muscle fiber and the <strong>autonomic innervation.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Heart rate</strong>- Increased heart rate increases the cardiac output which in turn increases the oxygen requirement. Heart rate is controlled primarily by the autonomic nerves, with sympathetic stimulation increasing the rate and parasympathetic stimulation decreasing the rate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Afterload-</strong> The tension at which the load is lifted is called afterload. As the afterload increases, the heart has to work more in order to pump blood to the organs. This in turn results in increased oxygen requirement. It is dependent on the <strong>peripheral resistance. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Drugs used in the management of angina either decrease the work done by the heart or increases the blood flow to the heart.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Nitrates</strong>- They increase the cGMP and cause venodilation. It mainly results in an increase in venous capacitance and a decrease in the ventricular preload. They might also increase coronary flow in some areas and in variant anginas.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong>- Blocking the calcium channels leads to the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles and decreased impulses in the conduction system. This leads to decreased peripheral resistance, decreased blood pressure, decreased contractility, decreased heart rate, and decreased oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Beta-blockers</strong>- They decrease the oxygen requirement by decreasing the heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility. Some drugs like carvedilol and nebivolol also cause vasodilation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Newer antianginal drugs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Ranolazine- </strong>It inhibits the late sodium current and reduces the intracellular calcium concentration. It reduces diastolic tension, cardiac contractility, and work.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Trimetazidine</strong>- inhibits the fatty acid oxidation in the myocardium. It decreases the oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Ivabradine- </strong>decreases the heart rate and decreases oxygen requirement.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Fasudil- </strong>It is a Rho kinase inhibitor. It is useful in coronary vasospasm.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Anti-anginal drugs</h3><p>Anti-anginal drugs can be divided into the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nitrates</strong> - Dilates veins &gt; arteries.

This condition arises due to<strong> thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency</strong>, which impairs the function of the <strong>pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme</strong>. The current standard of <strong>treatment</strong> for patients with symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy is to give <strong>thiamine 100 mg intravenously before administering glucose-containing IV fluids</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Thiamine</strong> is an essential cofactor for the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, a key component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. This conversion is critical for linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, thereby facilitating energy production in the body.</p>\n<p>Without sufficient thiamine, the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is severely impaired, leading to an accumulation of pyruvate and lactate in the blood, causing lactic acidosis. This biochemical disturbance contributes to the neurological symptoms observed. Immediate administration of thiamine is crucial in treating Wernicke's encephalopathy. If left untreated, the condition can progress to<strong> Korsakoff syndrome</strong>, a chronic and debilitating memory disorder. Thus, recognizing the signs and symptoms early and providing thiamine supplementation can lead to rapid improvement and prevent long-term complications.</p>\n<p><strong>Thiamine deficiency</strong> leads to the following:</p>\n<p><strong>    1.

So, a mature quadrinucleate cyst is the <strong>infective form</strong>. The <strong>ameboid trophozoite </strong>is the only form present in tissues. The cytoplasm may contain <strong>red blood cells</strong> which is a pathognomonic feature.</p>\n<p>It can manifest as <strong>acute intestinal amebiasis </strong>with symptoms of dysentery, lower abdominal discomfort, and flatulence. Low-grade symptoms such as occasional diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue are present in <strong>chronic amebiasis</strong>.</p>\n<p>The amebic ulcer which is <strong>flask-shaped </strong>is the typical lesion seen in intestinal amebiasis. The ulcers are multiple and are confined to the colon. Sometimes, in secondary intestinal lesions, the ulcers are numerous in the cecum, followed by the<strong> sigmoid-rectal region</strong>. A granulomatous lesion called an <strong>ameboma </strong>may form in the cecal or rectosigmoid areas of the colon which can resemble an adenocarcinoma of the colon.</p>\n<p>The most common <strong>extraintestinal </strong>manifestation is <strong>amebic hepatitis</strong> or <strong>liver abscess</strong>. The contents are necrotic and bacteriologically sterile, with active amebae confined to the walls. A characteristic <strong>anchovy paste</strong> is produced in the abscess and seen on surgical drainage</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Trophozoite</strong> is the active, feeding, and motile stage of E. histolytica that lives in the intestine. However, trophozoites are not the infective form as they cannot survive outside the host’s body due to their sensitivity to environmental conditions.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Binucleate cyst </strong>is an immature cyst, which contains only two nuclei. It is not fully developed and therefore not infective.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Metacystic trophozoites</strong> are the trophozoites that emerge from the cyst after excystation in the host’s intestine. They are not infective outside the body, as they represent a post-infection stage.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Infective form and diagnostic forms - Protozoans</h3><table dir=\"ltr\"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Parasite&quot;}\"><strong>Parasite</strong></td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Infective form&quot;}\"><strong>Infective form</strong></td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Diagnostic form&quot;}\"><strong>Diagnostic form</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;}\">Entamoeba histolytica</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Mature quadrinucleate cyst&quot;}\">Mature quadrinucleate cyst</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trophozoites, quadrinucleate cyst&quot;}\">Trophozoites, quadrinucleate cyst</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Giardia lamblia&quot;}\">Giardia lamblia</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Quadrinucleate cyst&quot;}\">Quadrinucleate cyst</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trophozoites, cyst&quot;}\">Trophozoites, cyst</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;}\">Trichomonas vaginalis</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trophozoites&quot;}\">Trophozoites</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trophozoites&quot;}\">Trophozoites</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;}\">Naegleria fowleri</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trophozoite&quot;}\">Trophozoite</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trophozoite in CSF&quot;}\">Trophozoite in CSF</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Acanthamoeba&quot;}\">Acanthamoeba</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trophozoites and cysts&quot;}\">Trophozoites and cysts</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trophozoite in CSF&quot;}\">Trophozoite in CSF</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Leishmania donovani &quot;}\">Leishmania donovani</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Promastigote&quot;}\">Promastigote</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;amastigotes in macrophage&quot;}\">amastigotes in macrophage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;}\">Trypanosoma cruzi</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Metacyclic Trypomastigote&quot;}\">Metacyclic Trypomastigote</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trypomastigote&quot;}\">Trypomastigote</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;}\">Trypanosoma brucei</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Metacyclic Trypomastigote&quot;}\">Metacyclic Trypomastigote</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trypomastigote&quot;}\">Trypomastigote</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Balantidium coli&quot;}\">Balantidium coli</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Cysts&quot;}\">Cysts</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Cysts&quot;}\">Cysts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Plasmodium&quot;}\">Plasmodium</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Sporozoites&quot;}\">Sporozoites</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Schizont, immature trophozoite, mature trophozoite, gametocyte&quot;}\">Schizont, immature trophozoite, mature trophozoite, gametocyte</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Babesia&quot;}\">Babesia</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Sporozoites&quot;}\">Sporozoites</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Maltese cross form&quot;}\">Maltese cross form</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;}\">Toxoplasma gondii</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;All 3 morphological forms -

The body responds to this change by using certain measures in <strong>stage</strong> <strong>A</strong> such as<strong> shivering.</strong></p>\n<p>In<strong> stage A</strong> the body activates various<strong> heat gain mechanisms </strong>to match the hypothalamic temperature setpoint. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shivering</strong>- the shivering center is located in the <strong>posterior hypothalamus</strong>. It is <strong>normally inhibited</strong> by signals from the<strong> heat center</strong> in the <strong>anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area</strong> but is <strong>excited</strong> by <strong>cold signals </strong>from the <strong>skin</strong> and <strong>spinal cord</strong>. A sudden increase in heat setpoint results in the activation of this center. It then transmits non-rhythmic signals through bilateral tracts through the lateral columns of the spinal cord, and finally to the anterior motor neurons. They increase the tone of the skeletal muscles throughout the body. As the tone rises above a certain critical level, shivering begins. During <strong>maximum shivering</strong>, body<strong> heat production</strong> can <strong>rise</strong> to <strong>four to five times</strong> normal.</li>\n<li><strong>Vasoconstriction </strong>(decreased blood flow to skin) is mediated by increased sympathetic drive by the activation of the posterior hypothalamic sympathetic center.</li>\n<li>An <strong>increase</strong> in<strong> chemical thermogenesis</strong> in which heat production takes place in the<strong> brown fat</strong> by the mechanism of<strong> uncoupling</strong> of oxidative phosphorylation. This is the predominant mechanism seen in<strong> neonates</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In<strong> stage B,</strong> the <strong>hypothalamic temperature setpoint</strong> is<strong> lower</strong> than the normal body temperature. Hence body activates various <strong>heat loss</strong> mechanisms to match the hypothalamic temperature setpoint. It includes<strong> vasodilatation</strong> of the skin blood vessel, <strong>sweating</strong>, and <strong>decreased thermogenesis</strong>.</p>\n<p>The temperature of the body is regulated <strong>majorly</strong> by a nervous feedback mechanism that operates through <strong>temperature-regulating centers</strong> located in the<strong> hypothalamus. Minor</strong> regulation is done by the <strong>thermal receptors</strong> in the <strong>skin</strong> and the <strong>deep</strong> thermal <strong>receptors</strong> present in the <strong>spinal cord</strong> and <strong>abdominal viscera.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/9d461617ac8b4abb8226d738333a1066x1280x1463.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

A copper transporter <strong>CTR1</strong> is involved in the entry of platinum complexes into these cells. It is however a <strong>highly emetic drug</strong> and antiemetics are routinely administered before infusing it. Other adverse effects include <strong>dose-dependent nephrotoxicity </strong>which can be prevented by the agent<strong> amifostine</strong> and by hydration with normal saline before drug infusion. It is an<strong> ototoxic drug</strong> that can cause tinnitus and hearing loss. It is also known to cause <strong>peripheral neuropathy and hyperuricemia.</strong> </p>\n<p>Option b : <strong>Vincristine </strong>prevents the polymerization of microtubular protein tubulin, causing <strong>metaphase arrest</strong>. It is very useful for inducing remission in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Prominent adverse effects are peripheral neuropathy and alopecia. It also causes ataxia, nerve palsies, autonomic dysfunction and seizures.</p>\n<p>Option d : <strong>Mitomycin-C</strong> is derived from the Streptomyces caespitosus bacteria. It can modify wound healing at a molecular level by<strong> inhibiting DNA synthesis </strong>by cross-linking DNA, acting like an <strong>alkylating agent (cell cycle non-specific)</strong>. It has been used to <strong>inhibit post-surgical scar formation</strong> and as a chemotherapeutic agent for solid tumors.</p>",

It is caused by<strong> CAG</strong> trinucleotide repeat (&gt;40) expansion mutation in the <strong>huntingtin gene</strong> on <strong>chromosome 4p</strong>. The disease shows genetic anticipation and has an early-onset (second to the third decade) if inherited from the father. Cognitive impairment is an early feature. Pathologically, <strong>atrophy of caudate and putamen</strong> with ex vacuo ventriculomegaly is seen. <strong> Decreased acetylcholine</strong> leads to <strong>dementia </strong>and decreased GABA and increased dopamine lead to <strong>chorea</strong>.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Myotonic dystrophy</strong> is an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> disease caused due to triplet repeat expansion of DNA in the <strong>DMPK gene</strong>. The polynucleotide sequence involved in the expansion is the <strong>CTG</strong> sequence. This leads to an abnormal expression of<strong> myotonin protein kinase</strong>. In the childhood form of DM,intellectual disability and behavioural problems are often the predominant features. Other key findings of classic DM include, Myotonia or delay in muscle relaxation, weakness and atrophy of facial and distal limb musculature, cardiac abnormalities including cardiomyopathy and conduction disturbances, frontal hair loss, cataracts, insulin resistance.</p>\n<p>3.  <strong>Friedreich ataxia</strong> is the most common inherited ataxia.

A patient who consumes <strong>non-iodized salt</strong> and has weight gain, constipation, hair loss, and fatigue has hypothyroidism due to <strong>iodine deficiency</strong>. The reason for the presence of goiter in this condition is<strong> elevated </strong>plasma<strong> TSH levels</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Goitre</strong> is the <strong>diffuse enlargement</strong> of the thyroid gland. It may be seen in hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and euthyroidism as well. It is caused by the action of<strong> excess TSH </strong>or substances similar to TSH on the thyroid gland. This is due to the <strong>trophic action</strong> of <strong>TSH </strong>on the thyroid gland i.e. it causes<strong> hypertrophy</strong> and <strong>hyperplasia</strong> of the <strong>follicular cells.</strong></p>\n<p>In patients with <strong>iodine deficiency</strong>, the production of thyroid hormones is impaired and features of <strong>hypothyroidism</strong> develop. <strong>Decreased</strong> levels of the <strong>thyroid hormones</strong> result in <strong>increased TSH </strong>secretion from the anterior pituitary via negative feedback. TSH stimulates hypertrophy and hyperplasia of follicular cells and the secretion of large amounts of thyroglobulin. Thus, the thyroid gland enlarges. This condition is known as <strong>endemic goiter.</strong></p>\n<p>Other causes of <strong>hypothyroidism</strong> resulting in goiter are <strong>autoimmune thyroiditis, deiodinase deficiency</strong>, and disorders of iodide trapping, peroxidase, or coupling systems. Consumption of food containing <strong>goitrogenic</strong> <strong>substances</strong> (eg: turnips, cabbages) also results in goiter.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Wolff-Chaikoff effect </strong>is the transient inhibition of the organification of iodide when<strong> large doses</strong> of<strong> iodide</strong> are consumed. This results in a decrease in thyroid hormone synthesis.  This effect will not be seen in this patient who consumes non-iodized salt.</p>\n<p>Option C: In <strong>Grave’s disease</strong>,<strong> TSH-receptor antibodies</strong> are present. They act similar to TSH and stimulate excessive secretion of thyroid hormones. Patients with Grave’s disease present with goiter, weight loss, exophthalmos, tremors, and tachycardia.  </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Mucopolysaccharide</strong> deposition is the mechanism of <strong>myxedema</strong> formation in <strong>hypothyroid </strong>patients. The deposition results in fluid filtration out of the capillaries and the formation of <strong>non-pitting edema.</strong></p>",

After death, the body loses heat mainly by <strong>conduction</strong> and <strong>convection</strong>. Up to the first hour, a<strong> temperature plateau </strong>may be seen due to the heat generated by residual metabolic activities of dying tissues. This is followed by a <strong>linear</strong> rate of <strong>cooling</strong> over the next<strong> 12 to 16 hours</strong>. The temperature rarely reaches the ambient temperature, most likely due to bacterial action with decomposition setting in. The curve is <strong>sigmoid</strong> or<strong> inverted S-shaped</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Rigor mortis/cadaveric rigidity/death stiffening</strong> refers to the stiffening and shortening of muscles following death. It begins <strong>1 to 2 hours</strong> after death and lasts for <strong>24 to 48</strong> hours in total. It starts <strong>disappearing</strong> after <strong>12 hours</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Postmortem lividity/livor mortis</strong> develops in the dependent portions of the body due to engorged vessels showing through the skin. It develops shortly after death and may not be visible for up to 1 hour. It deepens in intensity between 1 to 4 hours and reaches a maximum by <strong>6 to 12 hours</strong>. Lividity persists<strong> until putrefaction</strong> sets in.</p>\n<p><strong>Decomposition</strong> or <strong>putrefaction </strong>refers to the disintegration of the body tissues after death. Multiplication of the bacteria begins within 4 hours after death and by <strong>18 to 36 hours</strong> gases collect in the body causing bloating and distortion. The body then undergoes putrefaction and liquefaction of the tissues 5 to 10 days after death.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The rationale behind the once-daily dosing is that the drug <strong>irreversibly inactivates</strong> the pump molecule.</p>\n<p><strong>Proton-pump inhibitors </strong>(PPIs) are <strong>prodrugs</strong> that are activated only after undergoing an acid-catalyzed cleavage in the canaliculi of the parietal cells of the stomach.</p>\n<p>On administration, they are absorbed in the proximal small bowel and eventually, block the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase enzyme, the \"proton pump\" in the parietal cells of the stomach. The <strong>secretion</strong> of<strong> protons</strong> by an activated <strong>H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase</strong> (proton pump) in the <strong>parietal cells</strong> into the gastric lumen is the <strong>final step</strong> involved in the production of<strong> gastric acid</strong> and inhibition of this enzyme prevents acid secretion into the stomach.</p>\n<p>Once PPIs irreversibly inactivate the H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, acid secretion resumes only after new pump molecules are synthesized and inserted into the luminal membrane. This leads to <strong>prolonged suppression of acid secretion</strong> for up to 24-48 hours, despite having a shorter plasma half-life of only 30 minutes to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>In most individuals, once-daily dosing is enough to achieve effective acid inhibition. If necessary, a second dose can be given before an evening meal.</p>\n<p>The number of H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump molecules increases after fasting and food decreases the oral bioavailability of the drug. Hence, PPIs are given around 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.</p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option a : PPIs <strong>cannot inhibit</strong> all gastric acid pumps with oral dosing because <strong>not all pumps are active</strong> during the short half-life of the PPI in the blood. </p>\n<p>Option c : There are available in the form of delayed-release tablets, capsules, and oral suspension packets and for immediate acid suppression, there are intravenous formulations for PPIs like lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole. Therefore, the <strong>release of the drug depends upon the drug formulation.</strong></p>\n<p>Option d : PPIs cause maximum suppression of gastric acid.

In counter-transport, sodium ions diffuse to the interior of the cell because of the large concentration gradient. Here, the sodium ions bind to the carrier protein on the exterior, and the substance to be counter-transported (calcium in this case) binds to the interior of the carrier protein. Once both are bound, a conformational change occurs, and energy released by the action of the sodium ion moving to the interior causes the other sub- stance to move to the exterior. <span>The examples include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Na+ Ca+ exchanger</li>\n<li>Na+ H+ exchanger</li>\n<li>H+ K+ exchanger</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/913f294547c749589c484afa29b0f6f8x1280x1030.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Primary active transport</strong> - It is a form of cellular transport requiring <strong>energy</strong> in the form of hydrolysis of <strong>ATP</strong> to ship and transfer molecules against gradient differences.

One of the examples is SGLT (sodium-glucose co-transporter). <strong>Sodium-glucose cotransporter</strong> (SGLT)-1 transports molecules via secondary active transport where two or more molecules are transported together across the membrane with the help of a carrier molecule. As sodium diffuses down its electrochemical gradient, the energy released is used to drive glucose against the gradient.

Molecules move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. No energy input is required when carrier proteins move substances in the direction of their gradients. Glucose(<strong>GLUT</strong>) transport by the glucose transporter is an example, which moves glucose down its concentration gradient from the ECF to the cytoplasm of the cell.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Characteristics of different types of transport</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Simple diffusion</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Facilitated diffusion</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Primary active transport</strong></td>\n<td>Secondary active transport <strong>Cotransport</strong></td>\n<td>Secondary active transport <strong>Countertransport</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Electrochemical gradient</td>\n<td>Downhill</td>\n<td>Downhill</td>\n<td>Uphill</td>\n<td>Uphill</td>\n<td>Uphill</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carrier mediated</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metabolic energy</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Indirect</td>\n<td>Indirect</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Na<sup>+</sup> gradient</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>--</td>\n<td>Yes (same direction)</td>\n<td>Yes (opposite direction)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump</p>\n&nbsp;</td>\n<td>--</td>\n<td>--</td>\n<td>Inhibits</td>\n<td>Inhibits</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Inhibits</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Glucose Transporters</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Function</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Major sites of expression</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Secondary active transport</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(Na </strong><strong><sup>+</sup></strong> <strong>-glucose cotransport)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>SGLT 1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absorption of glucose</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Small intestine, renal tubules</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>SGLT 2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absorption of glucose</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Renal tubules</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Facilitated diffusion</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Basal glucose uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Placenta, blood-brain barrier, brain, red cells, kidneys, colon, many other organs</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&beta;-cell glucose sensor; transport out of intestinal and renal epithelial cells</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&beta; cells of islets, liver, epithelial cells of small intestine, kidneys</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 3</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Basal glucose uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Brain, placenta, kidneys, many other organs</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 4</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Skeletal and cardiac muscle, adipose tissue, other tissues</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 5</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fructose transport</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Jejunum, sperm</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
