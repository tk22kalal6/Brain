The loops of the bowel are <strong>not covered by amnion</strong> as they herniate through the abdominal wall directly into the amniotic cavity. The affected bowel loops can be damaged by exposure to amniotic fluid.</p>\n<p><strong> Risk factors</strong> include teenage pregnancy, recreational drug use, smoking, and genitourinary infection during pregnancy. After birth, careful management is required to prevent twisting or kinking of the blood supply to the intestines. The abdomen is <strong>wrapped</strong> with <strong>transparent plastic wrap</strong>, a nasogastric tube is inserted, and fluid resuscitation is initiated.</p>\n<p>Management:<strong> Immediate surgical intervention</strong> is required after birth to prevent <strong>complications</strong> such as infection, dehydration, and damage to the exposed abdominal organs. <strong>Surgical repair</strong> typically involves gently placing the <strong>protruding</strong> <strong>abdominal contents back</strong> into the abdominal cavity and <strong>closing</strong> the <strong>abdominal</strong> <strong>wall</strong> <strong>defect</strong> surgically.

It is most commonly present in the <strong>posterior triangle of the neck</strong>. The mass may be apparent at birth or may appear in early childhood due to the increased accumulation of lymph. Since the sac is filled with lymph, it is soft, fluctuating, and <strong>brilliantly transilluminant.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lymphangiomas are treated by<strong> surgical excision</strong> and<strong> image-guided sclerotherapy.</strong></li>\n<li>Initially, surgical excision is done to safely remove the lymphatic malformation without causing any damage to the adjacent vital tissues such as blood vessels, nerves, or muscles.</li>\n<li>For large tumors and the tumors that extend to the base of the tongue or floor of the mouth, <strong>combined sclerotherapy</strong> and <strong>surgical resection</strong> are done.</li>\n<li>If there is any residual lymphatic malformation after the treatment, then a conservative excision or unroofing of the cyst is done. It may be combined with sclerosing therapy or repeated partial excisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: The terms lymphangioma and cystic hygromas are older terms. They are now called lymphatic malformations.</p>\n<p>Option B: A <strong>thyroglossal duct cyst</strong> is a congenital <strong>midline</strong> neck swelling that typically presents during childhood often noticed after an upper respiratory infection. Classically the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and on tongue protrusion. This indicates attachment to the hyoid bone and the swelling is smooth, soft, fluctuant (cystic), non-tender, mobile, and shows transillumination.</p>\n<p>Option C : <strong>Ranula</strong> is a transilluminant mucocele. It is also known as \"frog's belly\", as it resembles the vocal sacs of a frog. It occurs due to an obstruction in the sublingual salivary gland. A ranula usually presents as a large, tense, bluish swelling on the floor of the mouth to one side on the midline. If the obstruction happens in the ducts of minor salivary glands such as labial or buccal, it is termed mucocele.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Cervical lymphadenopathy</strong> is seen in children with infections of the parotid and upper respiratory tract infections. On palpation, they are firm and non-fluctuant.</p>",

It <strong>relies</strong> on the <strong>patient's</strong> <strong>ability</strong> to initiate and maintain breathing efforts while receiving pressure support from the device. An <strong>unconscious patient,</strong> by definition, <strong>lacks</strong> the <strong>ability</strong> to consciously control their breathing and cannot actively participate in the breathing process. Therefore, <strong>BiPAP</strong> <strong>therapy</strong> is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in <strong>unconscious</strong> <strong>patients</strong> as they cannot tolerate the interface and settings required for this type of ventilation.</p>\n<p>In such cases,<strong> invasive mechanical ventilation,</strong> which provides full ventilatory support, is typically necessary to maintain adequate gas exchange and support respiratory function.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(a) Low pO2 levels: </strong>BiPAP therapy is often utilized to improve oxygenation in patients with hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels). By delivering positive airway pressure, BiPAP helps to recruit collapsed alveoli, improve lung ventilation-perfusion matching, and enhance oxygen diffusion into the bloodstream. Therefore, low pO2 levels are not a contraindication for BiPAP therapy; instead, they may indicate the need for BiPAP to support oxygenation.</p>\n<p><strong>(c) High CO2 levels: </strong>BiPAP therapy can also be beneficial for patients with hypercapnia (elevated blood carbon dioxide levels), such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or obesity hypoventilation syndrome. By providing inspiratory pressure support and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), BiPAP assists ventilation, enhances alveolar ventilation, and helps to eliminate excess carbon dioxide from the body. Therefore, high CO2 levels alone do not contraindicate the use of BiPAP therapy; rather, BiPAP may be indicated to improve ventilation and reduce CO2 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>(d) Obstructive sleep apnea: </strong>BiPAP therapy is commonly employed as a non-invasive treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of upper airway collapse during sleep. By delivering two levels of pressure – higher pressure during inspiration (IPAP) and lower pressure during expiration (EPAP) – BiPAP helps to keep the upper airway open, prevent apnea events, and improve sleep quality. Therefore, obstructive sleep apnea is not a contraindication for BiPAP therapy; rather, BiPAP is a recommended treatment modality for managing this condition.</p>",
