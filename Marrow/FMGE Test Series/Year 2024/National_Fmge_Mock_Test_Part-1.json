It is associated with steatorrhea and it gets relived on fasting.</li>\n<li><strong>Exudative diarrhea</strong> is due to inflammatory diseases which has pus and blood on them, it continues during fasting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>Lactase deficiency </strong>is due to the <strong>absence</strong> of lactase in the villous epithelial cells. Lactose remains in the intestinal lumen and exerts an osmotic force causing <strong>osmotic diarrhea</strong>.

When light strikes the photoreceptors, <strong>retinal</strong> is chemically <strong>transformed</strong> in a process called <strong>photoisomerization,</strong> which begins the transduction process.</p>\n<p>Visual pigments are a type of <strong>G</strong>-<strong>protein</strong>-<strong>coupled</strong> <strong>receptors</strong>. The receptor protein, known as <strong>opsin</strong>, is locked in its inactive state by <strong>11</strong>-<strong>cis</strong> <strong>retinal.</strong> <strong>Isomerization</strong> and <strong>photo</strong>-<strong>excitation</strong> result in the activation of G-protein and the production of <strong>cyclic</strong> <strong>GMP</strong>. <strong>Transducin</strong> serves as the <strong>G</strong>-<strong>protein</strong> specifically within the retina. The nerve impulse that is produced in the retina is then conveyed to the <strong>visual</strong> <strong>centres</strong> in the brain. The signal is ended through the process of <strong>phosphorylation</strong>, specifically targeting a <strong>serine</strong> <strong>residue</strong> on the <strong>activated</strong> <strong>rhodopsin</strong>. This <strong>phosphorylation</strong> is carried out by an enzyme called <strong>rhodopsin</strong> <strong>kinase</strong>. The purpose of this phosphorylation is to allow the <strong>inhibitory</strong> <strong>protein</strong> <strong>beta</strong>-<strong>arrestin</strong> to <strong>connect</strong> to the <strong>rhodopsin</strong> and <strong>deactivate</strong> it.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2af7ed5d414149fb8a564120c482a583x635x600.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>The <strong>phos­phorylation</strong> of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol (PI) produces polyphosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2).</p>\n<p>The degradation of PIP2 by <strong>phospholipase</strong> <strong>C</strong> occurs in response to the binding of a variety of neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors to receptors on the cell membrane.

      "solution": "<p>In this case, a diabetic patient with <strong>cardiac and renal failure</strong> is started on a suitable medication. The drug is likely an <strong>sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor.</strong></p>\n<p>SGLT-2 inhibitors include canafliflozen,dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. They act by inhibiting the SGLT-2 transporter which is present on the <strong>proximal</strong> <strong>segment</strong> of the renal tubule. It is responsible for the <strong>reabsorption</strong> of 80-90% of <strong>filtered glucose</strong>. It inhibits glucose reabsorption resulting in<strong> glycosuria</strong> and a change in the renal threshold.</p>\n<p>SGLT2 inhibitors can cause <strong>mild weight loss</strong> and reduction in blood pressure. Drugs like <strong>empagliflozin </strong>and <strong>canagliflozin</strong> are found to <strong>reduce</strong> major <strong>cardiovascular events</strong>. SGLT2 inhibitors also exhibit a known nephro-protective effect.</p>\n<p>The common <strong>side effects</strong> include <strong>urinary tract infections</strong> and<strong> genital mycotic infections</strong> due to the high glucose content of the urine. There is a risk of the development of <strong>diabetic ketoacidosis</strong>. It increases the<strong> </strong>risk of<strong> fractures</strong> and <strong>lower limb amputations</strong> due to the creation of an imbalance with the minerals and circulating <strong>parathormone</strong> and <strong>vitamin D</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option A:  <strong>Acarbose</strong> is an <strong>alpha-glucosidase inhibitor</strong>. It reduces the intestinal absorption of glucose by inhibiting the intestinal brush border enzyme,<strong> alpha-glucosidase.</strong> These drugs also increase <strong>GLP-1 </strong>levels in circulation. They reduce <strong>post-prandial glucose levels.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Linagliptin</strong> is a <strong>dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor</strong>. It is used in <strong>type 2 diabetes</strong> as monotherapy or in combination therapy when <strong>metformin</strong> is not tolerated or contraindicated. It binds extensively to plasma proteins and is cleared primarily by the hepatobiliary system. Hence, <strong>no dosage adjustment</strong> is needed in <strong>renal failure</strong>. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors enhance the release of <strong>insulin postprandially</strong>, decrease glucagon, and thereby lower mealtime as well as fasting glucose. They are <strong>weight-neutral.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Liraglutide</strong> is also a<strong> GLP-1 receptor agonist </strong>and is given only in the<strong> subcutaneous</strong> injectable form. It was recently approved for the treatment of<strong> obesity.</strong></p>",

      "solution": "<p>In a fasting state, the <strong>Cahill cycle</strong> also known as <strong>glucose-alanine cycle </strong>provides the major source of glucose for the body from muscle breakdown of amino acids.</p>\n<p>In the fasting state, there is a significant output of alanine from muscle as it is the major substrate for gluconeogenesis. Alanine is derived from the <strong>transamination of pyruvate</strong> obtained from glycolysis. Alanine is then exported to the liver where it undergoes transamination again back to pyruvate and enters gluconeogenesis.</p>\n<p>Muscle glycogen cannot be utilized directly from the muscle as muscle lacks <strong>glucose-6-phosphatase</strong> essential for the breakdown of glucose-6-phosphate into glucose.</p><p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option A: The process of reconversion of <strong>lactate</strong> formed in the muscles back to glucose inside the liver is called <strong>Cori's cycle / glucose-lactate cycle.</strong> Lactic acid is a metabolic byproduct formed after anaerobic glycolysis in tissues such as the skeletal muscles and erythrocytes. The lactate so formed is transported into the liver and kidney. Here, it gets reconverted back into pyruvate which can be converted to glucose. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Krebs cycle</strong> is the final common pathway for the <strong>oxidation</strong> of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins because glucose, fatty acids, and most amino acids are metabolized to acetyl-CoA or intermediates of the cycle.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Rapoport-lumbering cycle </strong>takes place in the red blood cells (RBC). Here<strong> 1, 3- Bisphosphoglycerate kinase is bypassed</strong>, no ATPs are produced in that step. Only 2 ATPs are generated by the pyruvate kinase step and 2 ATPs are utilized in the steps catalyzed by hexokinase and Phosphofructokinase - 1. So this pathway yields <strong>no net generation</strong> of ATP from glycolysis.</p>",

It is a <strong>rapid</strong> immunologic reaction that is triggered by the binding of an <strong>antigen</strong> to an <strong>IgE antibody</strong> on the <strong>surface of mast cells</strong>. It occurs in a <strong>previously sensitized</strong> individual. These reactions are induced by environmental antigens (allergens) that stimulate strong <strong>TH2 responses</strong> and IgE production in genetically susceptible individuals. </p>\n<p>Activation of TH2 cells is mediated by IL-4 and in turn, TH2 cells produce<strong> IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.</strong> These cytokines act on B cells to stimulate IgE and activation of eosinophils. I<strong>gE coats mast cells</strong> by binding to the <strong>FcεRI receptor.</strong> Re-exposure to the allergen leads to cross-linking of the IgE and FcεRI which in turn causes activation of mast cells releasing powerful mediators. The principal mediators are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Histamine</strong></li>\n<li>Proteases</li>\n<li>Prostaglandins</li>\n<li>Leukotrienes</li>\n<li>Cytokines like TNF, IL-1, and chemokines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The clinical manifestations may be local or systemic and range from mildly annoying rhinitis to fatal anaphylaxis.
