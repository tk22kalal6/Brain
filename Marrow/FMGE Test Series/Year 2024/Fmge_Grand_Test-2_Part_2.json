The fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin are elevated in inflammatory conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, but not in irritable bowel syndrome. Hence, they are often assessed to distinguish the two conditions. These tests are also done to check if the disease is active and to detect postoperative recurrence. Other features of IBD include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), hypoalbuminemia, anaemia, and leukocytosis.</p>\n<p><strong>IBS</strong> is a <strong>functional bowel disorder</strong>. It is characterized by <strong>abdominal pain</strong> or discomfort and <strong>altered bowel habits</strong> in the absence of detectable structural abnormalities. Since there is no specific diagnostic marker for IBS, the diagnosis is based on<strong> Rome IV criteria</strong> which include the clinical manifestations of the disease. Abdominal pain is an anchor feature of IBS. It should be associated (improvement or worsening) with defecation, or with a change in the frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhoea or constipation does not fulfil the criteria to be diagnosed as IBS. The onset of symptoms during a period of stress or emotional upset is a feature that supports a diagnosis of IBS.</p>\n<p>The extent of the <strong>diagnostic evaluation</strong> of a patient suspected to have IBS depends on the possibility of an organic disorder in that patient. A complete blood count and a sigmoidoscopy should be done for most patients. In addition, stool samples should be examined for ova and parasites in patients who have diarrhoea-predominant IBS.</p>\n<p>The mainstay of treatment for IBS is a diet <strong>low in fermentable oligosaccharides</strong>, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (<strong>FODMAP</strong>s).</p>\n<p>Pharmacotherapy consists of Alosetron (5-HT3 antagonist) or Loperamide for<strong> diarrhoea-predominant IBS. </strong>The antibiotic that is specifically approved for diarrhoea-predominant IBS is <strong>rifaximin.</strong> It is an RNA synthesis inhibitor.  It may provide benefits by altering the gastrointestinal flora favourably.</p>\n<p>Psyllium husk, lactulose, Lubiprostone, and Prucalopride (5-HT4 agonist) for <strong>constipation-predominant IBS</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>In a patient diagnosed with TB and HIV who was started on ATT and ART, the deterioration in health <strong>after treatment initiation</strong> point to a diagnosis of <strong>immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) due to immunological changes in the body.</strong></p>\n<p>Following the initiation of effective anti-retroviral therapy, a <strong>paradoxical</strong> <strong>worsening</strong> <strong>of preexisting or untreated opportunistic infections</strong> may be seen in people living with HIV (PLHIV). This is known as <strong>immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)</strong>. IRIS is seen in up to <strong>30% of the patients</strong> who are started on ART, and is particularly common in patients with <strong>untreated mycobacterial or fungal infections</strong>, or with <strong>CD4+ T-cell counts &lt;50 cells/μL</strong>.

IRIS related to a <strong>known</strong> pre-existing <strong>infection</strong> is called <strong>paradoxical</strong> <strong>IRIS</strong>; IRIS associated with a <strong>previously undiagnosed condition</strong> is referred to as <strong>unmasking IRIS</strong>. Signs and symptoms can appear <strong>within two weeks to two years</strong> of starting ART and can include <strong>lymphadenitis, prolonged fever, pulmonary infiltrates</strong>, hepatitis and increased intracranial pressure.</p>\n<p>IRIS is <strong>generally self-limiting</strong> and interruption of ART is rarely indicated. In most cases, <strong>recognition and management of ongoing infection</strong> with antimicrobial therapy is sufficient. Short-term therapy with <strong>corticosteroids</strong> or <strong>NSAIDs</strong> can be given to reduce the inflammation. Temporary cessation of ART is to be considered for potentially life-threatening forms of IRIS.
