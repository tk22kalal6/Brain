However, the contribution by the smallest airways is very little to the overall total resistance. This is because, the airway branches in each generation exist in&nbsp;<strong>parallel</strong>&nbsp;rather than in series. As the parallel branching increases, the resistance decreases. (Total cross-sectional diameter of small airways put together is high). Thus the overall resistance of the small airways is very small. Also,&nbsp;airflow velocity decreases substantially as the effective cross-sectional area increases (i.e., the flow becomes laminar).</p>\n<p>Other factors affecting airway resistance :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lung volume</strong>, as lung volume increases the resistance decreases and vice versa. Lung volume increases the transairway pressure thus increasing the caliber of the airway.</li>\n<li><strong>Airway mucus, edema</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>contraction</strong>&nbsp;of bronchial smooth muscle increase the airway resistance. Its clinical application is seen in asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema</li>\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>density&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>viscosity</strong>&nbsp;of inspired gas also contribute to airway resistance. A gas with more density imparts more resistance.</li>\n</ul>",

The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is negligent</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<strong>Last clear chance doctrine: </strong>It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>gave proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (<strong>There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

This results in the loss of sodium, chloride, and water contributing to the diuretic effect. The diuretic effect of thiazide leads to decreased osmotic pressure due to the loss of Na+, Cl-, and water leading to compensatory reabsorption of uric acid thus resulting in hyperuricemia. The intracytoplasmic Na+ concentration also decreases due to the blockade of the co-transporter. To compensate, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger pumps sodium from the systemic circulation into the epithelial cells in exchange for calcium. The declining calcium levels inside the cell will draw more calcium from the lumen into the systemic circulation. This results in hypercalcemia. There is also increased loss of Mg2+, K+, and H+.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanisms of antihypertensive action:</strong> Decreases plasma and ECF volume by diuresis thereby decreasing cardiac output. Even when the compensatory mechanisms restore the Na+ levels and plasma volume, a low BP is maintained by a reduction in total peripheral resistance.

It is due to the autoantibody-mediated destruction of the <strong>acetylcholine receptors</strong> (AChRs) at the <strong>post-synaptic</strong> membrane. This consequentially leads to a <strong>decreased transmission </strong>at the<strong> neuromuscular</strong> <strong>junction</strong>. <strong>Failure of transmission</strong> results in muscle weakness. Hence the goal is to increase the duration of action of acetylcholine by <strong>inhibiting acetylcholinesterase</strong>. The most commonly used <strong>anticholinesterase</strong> drug is <strong>pyridostigmine</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Females</strong> are more commonly affected than males and the disease tends to occur in <strong>middle age.</strong></p>\n<p>Clinical features of myasthenia gravis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Muscle weakness and fatiguability </strong>increase with repeated use or late in the day and may improve following rest or sleep. Limb weakness is proximal and asymmetrical</li>\n<li>Cranial muscles particularly the lids and extraocular muscles are <strong>involved early</strong> in the course - <strong>diplopia, ptosis </strong></li>\n<li>Facial weakness - snarling expression on smiling</li>\n<li>Weakness in chewing</li>\n<li>Speech with nasal timbre due to the weakness of the palate and tongue</li>\n<li>Difficulty in swallowing</li>\n<li>Deep tendon reflexes are intact</li>\n<li><strong>Myasthenic crisis - </strong>acute exacerbation of muscle weakness especially intercostal and diaphragmatic muscles resulting in ventilatory failure.

Edrophonium is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. This increases the amount of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft and improves transmission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Symptomatic treatment:</strong> Anticholinesterase agents – Pyridostigmine is the <strong>initial therapy</strong> of choice.</li>\n<li><strong>Chronic immunomodulating therapy</strong>: Glucocorticoids (prednisone) and immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine) implemented <strong>in patients significantly symptomatic on pyridostigmine</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Rapid immunomodulating treatment:</strong> IVIG and therapeutic plasma exchange—Used to tide over severe illness (myasthenic crisis) and as 'bridge' therapy before surgery, or starting chronic immunomodulating treatment.</li>\n<li><strong>Surgical approach</strong>: Thymectomy</li>\n</ul>",

There is no hemolysis or underlying liver disease.

The disease is caused due to mutation in multidrug resistance protein 2<strong> (MRP-2)</strong> in hepatocytes, which is required for the transport of non-bile salt organic anions at the canalicular membranes. Liver biopsy shows characteristic deposition of <strong>black-colored</strong> pigment.</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Crigler-Najjar syndrome</strong> is of two types with type 1 having <strong>absent/trace</strong> UDP-Glucoronyltransferase production and type 2 having &lt;10% of the normal enzyme activity.

Type 2 may also lead to kernicterus occasionally. <strong>Unconjugated bilirubin is elevated</strong>. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a 20-year-old male is less likely to be due to Criggler Najar type 1 syndrome.
