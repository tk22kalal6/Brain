      "solution": "<p>The history of<strong> failure </strong>to<strong> pass meconium</strong> and a <strong>markedly distended abdomen</strong> along with a biopsy showing <strong>aganglionosis</strong> suggests a likely diagnosis of <strong>Hirschsprung disease</strong>/<strong>congenital aganglionic megacolon</strong>.</p>\n<p>Hirschsprung disease is a developmental disorder of the enteric nervous system. Normally, the enteric neuronal plexus develops by neural crest cells migrating to the colon wall. When there is a <strong>mutation</strong> in tyrosine kinase receptor RET, it results in <strong>premature arrest</strong> of this regular <strong>migration</strong> from the cecum to the rectum. This results in the lack of Auerbach and Meissner submucosal plexus in the distal intestinal segment (<strong>aganglionosis</strong>) causing<strong> hypertonicity </strong>of the<strong> bowel wall</strong>. Thus, there is a <strong>functional obstruction</strong> in the<strong> distal segment</strong> that also results in massive <strong>dilatation </strong>of the<strong> proximal segment </strong>(<strong>megacolon</strong>). </p>\n<p>      Based on the segments affected, they are classified into -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Short-segment Hirschsprung disease - Disease limited to the rectosigmoid segment</li>\n<li>Long-segment Hirschsprung disease - Disease having proximal extension beyond the rectosigmoid segment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The onset of <strong>constipation</strong> can be seen <strong>at birth</strong>. Patients present with intermittent attacks of fever and <strong>pain</strong> due to intestinal obstruction from the retained feces. Complications include <strong>enterocolitis</strong> and <strong>bowel perforation</strong>. </p>\n<p>A <strong>rectal suction biopsy</strong> is the<strong> gold standard</strong> for diagnosis and shows increased <strong>acetylcholinesterase staining</strong> and <strong>aganglionosis</strong>. Other investigations include <strong>anorectal manometry</strong> and <strong>barium contrast enema</strong>. </p>\n<p>Surgical intervention is the only definitive treatment available.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis</strong> generally presents as new-onset <strong>regurgitation</strong> and <strong>projectile non-bilious vomiting</strong> after feeding. A firm <strong>abdominal mass</strong> and <strong>abnormal left-to-right hyperperistalsis</strong> can be seen. Diagnosis is made by ultrasonography. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Wilkie syndrome</strong>, otherwise known as <strong>superior mesenteric artery syndrome</strong>, occurs due to the <strong>compression </strong>of the<strong> third duodenal segment</strong> against the aorta by this artery. Diagnosis is by radiological demonstration of duodenal cutoff along with proximal duodenal dilatation. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Functional constipation</strong>, otherwise known as fecal withholding, is the <strong>intentional</strong> or subconscious <strong>withholding of stool</strong>. It usually starts <strong>after </strong>the<strong> neonatal period</strong>. Here <strong>daytime encopresis</strong> (passage of stools at inappropriate places after 4 years of age) is common.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Radiological findings in various GI disorders</h3><p><strong>Duodenal atresia:&nbsp;</strong>Double bubble sign</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a8e78c140797481eb09e4bcef9106cd8x720x910.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Jejunal and ileal atresia:&nbsp;</strong>Multiple air-fluid levels (plain erect X-ray abdomen) presenting as&nbsp;<strong>triple bubble sign.&nbsp;</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/9513fa34bce3499088a9a4601ae434c4x834x1186.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: </strong>Single enlarged gastric gas bubble&nbsp;- <strong>single bubble</strong> sign</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/20dd99dfcb3e4ffa8728b296b69b5556x284x383.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Sigmoid volvulus:&nbsp;</strong>Coffee bean sign&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f08f0c4d40bc42f4b3c59027c146efb7x720x882.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Achalasia cardia:&nbsp;</strong>Bird-beak sign</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/fdcc40d8b70549d4b0c489b623ab32c8x720x1526.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical history and positive dihydrorhodamine test (<strong>DHR</strong>) most likely suggests <strong>c</strong><strong>hronic granulomatous disease</strong>.</p>\n<p>Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an <strong>X-linked recessive disorder </strong>due to the <strong>d</strong><strong>eficiency in NADPH oxidase</strong> which is important in respiratory or oxidative bursts. In CGD, there is an increased risk of <strong>catalase-positive species</strong> (<em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Escherichia </em>coli, <em>Aspergillus s</em>pp, etc.) leading to granulomas. The condition usually manifests in the first year of life with recurrent pyogenic infections with catalase-positive organisms.  </p>\n<p>Patients have <strong>recurrent</strong> bacterial and fungal infections. The symptoms begin within the first two years of life, affecting the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, and lymphatic drainage of these organs.</p>\n<p><strong>Nitroblue tetrazolium</strong> is used as a diagnostic test. The yellow-coloured Nitroblue tetrazolium dye is converted to a purple insoluble substance (positive) in the presence of oxidative burst by the free oxygen radicals so formed. A <strong>negative</strong> test (<strong>yellow</strong> color remains) is seen in <strong>CGD</strong>.</p>\n<p>Individuals with CGD will exhibit <strong>diminished</strong> or <strong>absent</strong> fluorescence in the <strong>DHR test</strong>, indicating impaired ROS production by phagocytes. This result confirms the diagnosis of CGD and aids in distinguishing it from other conditions with similar symptoms. It can also assess the effectiveness of treatments like bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy in restoring normal phagocyte function.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Chediak-Higashi syndrome</strong> is a primary immunodeficiency due to a disorder of the phagolysosome function of leukocytes, leading to delayed microbial clearance. In addition, there is a disorder of melanin (<strong>albinism</strong>), nerve defects, and bleeding disorders.</p>\n<p><strong>Severe combined immunodeficiency</strong> is a primary immunodeficiency with a disorder of both cellular and humoral immunity. Persons with SCID are susceptible to recurrent severe infections caused by a wide variety of pathogens and usually do not survive beyond the first year of life without a stem cell transplant.</p>\n<p><strong>Tuberculosis</strong> is a bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is characterized by the formation of granulomas as an immune response to contain the infection. Tuberculosis presents with cavitary lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. Histopathology reveals caseous necrosis with multinucleated giant cells. Common manifestations include fever, night sweats, anorexia, weakness, and weight loss. Blood investigations may reveal anemia with leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, leukemoid reactions, and polycythemia.</p>",

This results in the loss of sodium, chloride, and water contributing to the diuretic effect. The diuretic effect of thiazide leads to decreased osmotic pressure due to the loss of Na+, Cl-, and water leading to compensatory reabsorption of uric acid thus resulting in hyperuricemia. The intracytoplasmic Na+ concentration also decreases due to the blockade of the co-transporter. To compensate, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger pumps sodium from the systemic circulation into the epithelial cells in exchange for calcium. The declining calcium levels inside the cell will draw more calcium from the lumen into the systemic circulation. This results in hypercalcemia. There is also increased loss of Mg2+, K+, and H+.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanisms of antihypertensive action:</strong> Decreases plasma and ECF volume by diuresis thereby decreasing cardiac output. Even when the compensatory mechanisms restore the Na+ levels and plasma volume, a low BP is maintained by a reduction in total peripheral resistance.

      "solution": "<p>An <strong>apoptotic body</strong> is formed during the late stages of apoptosis when a cell undergoes controlled self-destruction. Apoptotic bodies contain <strong>all the cellular components</strong> such as organelles and fragmented DNA and are typically smaller than the cell undergoing apoptosis. </p>\n<p>Apoptosis, also known as <strong>programmed cell death</strong>, plays a vital role in the normal development and renewal of tissues. It can be initiated by external triggers like cytotoxic T cells or inflammatory molecules, as well as internal factors such as DNA damage or cellular stress.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitochondria</strong> play a key role in processing signals that determine whether a cell will undergo apoptosis or not. If there's a predominance of signals favoring cell death, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) occurs, releasing cytochrome C and other proteins into the cytoplasm. These proteins then activate internal pathways leading to programmed cell death. </p>\n<p>Apoptosis has <strong>two</strong> pathways:</p>\n<p>A. Mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cell injury results in the release of cytochrome C and other pro-apoptotic proteins from mitochondria.</li>\n<li>These then activate <strong>caspase 9</strong> which causes nuclear fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>B.

This results in the loss of sodium, chloride, and water contributing to the diuretic effect. The diuretic effect of thiazide leads to decreased osmotic pressure due to the loss of Na+, Cl-, and water leading to compensatory reabsorption of uric acid thus resulting in hyperuricemia. The intracytoplasmic Na+ concentration also decreases due to the blockade of the co-transporter. To compensate, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger pumps sodium from the systemic circulation into the epithelial cells in exchange for calcium. The declining calcium levels inside the cell will draw more calcium from the lumen into the systemic circulation. This results in hypercalcemia. There is also increased loss of Mg2+, K+, and H+.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanisms of antihypertensive action:</strong> Decreases plasma and ECF volume by diuresis thereby decreasing cardiac output. Even when the compensatory mechanisms restore the Na+ levels and plasma volume, a low BP is maintained by a reduction in total peripheral resistance. This reduction in total peripheral resistance is due to the persistence of a small sodium and volume deficit even after compensation. The decreased intracellular sodium is responsible for increased compliance of the vessel wall and a reduced response to constrictor stimulus.</p>\n<p>Thiazides are the diuretic of choice for uncomplicated hypertension.</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages of thiazide as an antihypertensive are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can be given as once a day dose and has a flat dose-response curve</li>\n<li>Decreased incidence of postural hypotension and relative freedom from CNS side effects</li>\n<li>No tolerance</li>\n<li>No fluid retention</li>\n<li>Decreased risk of osteoporotic fractures due to its hypocalciuric action</li>\n<li>Low cost</li>\n<li>Effectiveness in isolated systolic hypertension</li>\n<li>Thiazides are ineffective both as antihypertensive and diuretic in patients with chronic renal failure.</li>\n</ul>",
