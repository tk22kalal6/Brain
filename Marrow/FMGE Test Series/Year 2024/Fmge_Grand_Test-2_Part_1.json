It is weakly bactericidal and can cause mild hemolysis, and rarely anaemia or psychosis.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Nitazoxanide</strong> is an oral, synthetic, broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent. The FDA has approved its usage for the treatment of <strong>cryptosporidiosis</strong> and <strong>giardiasis</strong> in adults and immunocompetent children.</p>\n<p>Option C: Vancomycin is a glycopeptide and inhibits the synthesis of the cell wall.

The sensor for this response is the macula densa. The amount of sodium and chloride entering the<strong> macula densa cells </strong>is a proxy for the amount of fluid delivered to the distal tubule. Increased sodium delivery causes an increase in the activity o<strong>f Na+, K+ ATPase</strong> and resulting ATP hydrolysis leads to the formation of more <strong>adenosine</strong>. This adenosine acts on adenosine<strong> A1 </strong>receptors on the macula densa cells to cause calcium release, which causes <strong>afferent arteriolar constriction. </strong>Increased sodium delivery to the distal tubule will also decrease the release of renin and consequently the formation of angiotensin II. This will finally result in <strong>mesangial cell relaxation. </strong></p>\n<p>The GFR is proportional to the<strong> Kf</strong> (glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient), which depends on capillary permeability and the effective filtration surface area. The filtration surface area can be altered by the contraction or relaxation of the mesangial cells. Angiotensin II is an important factor causing <strong>mesangial cell contraction. </strong>This decreases the available <strong>surface area </strong>and the<strong> GFR. </strong>This causes less sodium to be filtered and more of it to be retained in the body, thus bringing the body fluid volume towards normal. </p>\n<p>Another mechanism that is responsible for the regulation of <strong>renal blood flow</strong> and <strong>GFR</strong> is the <strong>myogenic</strong> mechanism. When there is an excessive stretch of the renal vessel wall due to an increased amount of fluid, there is vascular smooth muscle contraction due to calcium entry. This prevents undue increases in renal blood flow and GFR when the arterial pressure is high.</p>",

It is the leading cause of unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy.</p>\n<p>It is caused by mutations in genes that encode sarcomeric proteins, including <strong>myosin-binding protein C</strong> (MYBP-C) and <strong>β-MHC</strong> (MYH7). It can also rarely occur due to mutations in genes coding for cardiac TnI, TnT, and α-tropomyosin. </p>\n<p>In HCM, myocardial hypertrophy occurs without ventricular dilation. Furthermore, there is <strong>asymmetric septal hypertrophy</strong>, where the ventricular septum is disproportionately thickened compared to the left ventricular free wall. The enlarged septum bulges into the ventricular cavity, giving it a <strong>banana-like</strong> <strong>shape</strong>. Hypertrophy is most marked in the <strong>subaortic region</strong> of the septum.</p>\n<p>The most important histologic features of HCM are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Massive <strong>myocyte hypertrophy</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Myofiber disarray</strong> including that of myocyte bundles, individual myocytes, and contractile elements</li>\n<li>Fibrotic narrowing of small intramural arteries</li>\n<li>Interstitial and <strong>replacement fibrosis</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The images below show normal cardiac myocytes and myofibril disarray in HCM, respectively:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3e40d24585743078c615e6a25771290x500x376.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6d014a345ab943949f186f3ff6597c8ex500x372.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>Exertional dyspnea</strong> due to reduced cardiac output is seen, and a <strong>harsh systolic ejection murmur</strong> caused due to LVOT obstruction can be heard. Further, atrial fibrillation, stroke due to mural thrombus formation, and ventricular arrhythmias are common complications of HCM. </p>\n<p><strong>β-adrenergic blockers</strong> can be used to decrease heart rate and contractility, and <strong>implantable cardioverter defibrillators</strong> are used for patients with ventricular arrhythmias.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Dilated cardiomyopathy</strong> (DCM) occurs due to truncating mutations in the <strong>titin gene</strong>. The heart in DCM is flabby and hypo-contracting, in contrast with the thick-walled, heavy, and hyper-contracting heart in HCM. Histology reveals hypertrophied myocytes with hyperchromatic distorted nuclei with a <strong>ninja star-like appearance</strong>, as shown in the image below. Variable degrees of interstitial and endocardial fibrosis is also present.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7d455df5c2084130a611ba0ca2c61ae8x1280x1356.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C: <strong>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy </strong>(ARVC) is an autosomal dominant disorder that occurs due to mutations of genes encoding <strong>desmosomal junctional proteins</strong>. It typically manifests as <strong>right-sided heart failure</strong> and can cause sudden cardiac death. Histology shows loss of myocytes, fatty infiltration, and focal fibrosis.</p>\n<p>Option D: In <strong>restrictive cardiomyopathy</strong>, patients will have stiffened myocardial walls with diastolic dysfunction. It is <strong>associated</strong> <strong>with cardiac amyloidosis</strong> and on histological examination, <strong>hyaline, amorphous eosinophilic deposits</strong> are seen. Transthyretin is the major component of cardiac amyloid deposits.

The <strong>affinity</strong> of <strong>Hb</strong> for <strong>Oxygen</strong> will <strong>decrease</strong>.</p>\n<p>When a person ascends to a <strong>high altitude</strong> and stays there for <strong>longer periods</strong> usually, he/she gets <strong>adapted</strong> to the new environment. This process is called <strong>acclimatization</strong>. The mechanisms behind acclimatization are an<strong> increase</strong> in <strong>pulmonary ventilation</strong>; <strong>increased</strong> numbers of <strong>RBCs</strong>; increased <strong>diffusing capacity</strong> of the lungs; increased<strong> vascularity</strong> of the peripheral tissues; and increased ability of the tissue cells to use O2, despite a low Po2.</p>\n<p>RBCs <strong>lack mitochondria</strong> and enzymes like cytochrome oxidase, hence <strong>anaerobic glycolysis</strong> is the source of energy. At high altitudes, concentration of <strong>2-3 BPG</strong> (an intermediate of glycolysis)<strong> increases</strong> in RBCs and it tends to <strong>decrease</strong> the O2 <strong>affinity </strong>of <strong>hemoglobin</strong>. The net effect is a small <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>P50.</strong> The decrease in O2 affinity facilitates the <strong>unloading</strong> of <strong>oxygen</strong> from RBCs thus making more <strong>O2 available</strong> to the <strong>tissues</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other physiological changes that occur during acclimatization include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased<strong> erythropoietin</strong> secretion, leads to an increase in the number of circulating RBCs,<strong> hematocrit</strong>, hemoglobin concentration, and <strong>blood</strong> <strong>volume</strong>.</li>\n<li>Increased number of<strong> mitochondria</strong> in tissues like <strong>skeletal muscles</strong>.
