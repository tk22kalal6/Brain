Therefore, the X-ray beams used in CT imaging <strong>are often filtered</strong> to <strong>enhance image contras</strong>t and <strong>reduce radiation</strong> dose to the patient.</p>\n<p>Option C: The investigation of choice for gallstones is an <strong>Abdominal ultrasound</strong> and not a CT Abdomen. An ultrasound can <strong>assess for complications</strong> of gallstones, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) or obstruction of the bile ducts. In cases where ultrasound findings are inconclusive or further characterisation is needed, other imaging modalities such as CT scan or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be used. </p>\n<p>Option D: The mSv (millisievert) value for a non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan of the head typically ranges from around<strong> 1 to 2 mSv</strong>. This radiation dose can vary depending on factors such as the specific CT scanner used, the scanning protocol, and the individual patient characteristics. However, in general, NCCT head scans are associated with relatively<strong> low radiation </strong>doses compared to other medical imaging procedures.</p>",

Other structures like<strong> teeth, bone,</strong> cartilage, thyroid tissue, and mucous membranes can also be found.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most patients are <strong>asymptomatic</strong>. Some patients may have symptoms because of the mass size of the teratoma. In other patients, ovarian teratomas can result in <strong>torsion</strong> of the <strong>ovary</strong>.

They are solid and generally produce <strong>estrogen</strong>. They can cause <strong>precocious puberty</strong> in children, hyperestrogenism in adults, and post-menopausal bleeding.&nbsp;They vary in appearance and range from microscopic to large, solid and cystic, encapsulated masses.
