Mutations occur in the V<sub>2</sub> receptor or the aquaporin channels and ADH cannot act on them. Therefore, in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, even if the ADH levels are normal, it cannot act on the receptors, and the <strong>urine osmolality </strong>does<strong> not increase</strong> after fluid restriction. A simpler way to differentiate between central DI and nephrogenic DI is to measure <strong>basal ADH levels</strong> and <strong>urine osmolality</strong> under unrestricted fluid intake conditions. A low urine osmolality with a concurrent elevated ADH level (<strong>&gt;1 ng/mL</strong>) indicates nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. A low ADH level is suggestive of central DI or primary polydipsia, which can be differentiated on MRI brain.</p>\n<p> </p>",

      "solution": "<p>The probable diagnosis in the given scenario of a 16-year-old girl with <strong>intense food cravings</strong> followed by <strong>self-induced vomiting</strong> is <strong>bulimia nervosa.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong> is an eating disorder, often seen in young women. It is characterized by <strong>binge-eating episodes</strong>, followed by inappropriate, compensatory measures to stop weight gain, like <strong>self-induced vomiting</strong>, laxative abuse, diuretics, enema, and emetic abuse. These binge-eating episodes occur at least once a week and are present for at least 3 months. The patient fears gaining weight and has a relentless drive to be thin. </p>\n<p>The <strong>weight</strong> is <strong>normal</strong> in most patients with bulimia nervosa. However, few patients may either be overweight or underweight. There is a risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. </p>\n<p>Treatment modalities are cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, and antidepressants such as fluoxetine.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Anorexia nervosa </strong>is an eating disorder that is often seen between the ages of 10 and 30. Typical features are self-induced <strong>starvation</strong>, voluntary and <strong>unhealthy reduction in weight</strong>, intense drive for thinness, and fear of becoming obese. These symptoms are usually present for at least a period of 3 months. Associated features can include depression, anxiety, amenorrhea in females, hypothermia, and bradycardia. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Atypical depression</strong> is a type of depression characterized by <strong>mood reactivity,</strong> which is brightening of the mood in response to positive events; <strong>significant weight gain</strong> or increase in appetite; <strong>hypersomnia;</strong> <strong>leaden paralysis;</strong> and/or interpersonal rejection sensitivity, resulting in sig­nificant social or occupational impairment. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Binge-eating disorder</strong> is the most common eating disorder. It is characterized by <strong>rapid intake of abnormally large quantities of food</strong> over a short period of time, even when not hungry. There are feelings of guilt about the eating episodes, but these patients <strong>do not compensate</strong> in any way following the episodes of binge.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Eating Disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Anorexia nervosa</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Binge-eating disorder</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Avoidance of food</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>(calorie deficit)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Binge eating</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+/-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Compensation</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>(purge/vomit)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>&nbsp;+/-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>BMI</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>LOW*</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>NORMAL</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>HIGH</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;*In <strong>atypical anorexia nervosa</strong>, all the features of anorexia nervosa will be present, but the patient will have normal BMI.</p>",

Therefore, the next step in management is <strong>compression stockings.</strong></p>\n<p>In addition, she has <strong>no venous complications</strong> like pigmentation, eczema, or venous ulcers. Thus, she can be initially managed with compression stockings. </p>\n<p>Compression stockings provide <strong>external pressure</strong> to the limb which compresses the veins and <strong>improves venous return</strong>. There are two lengths available - knee or thigh length.

If the varicose veins become symptomatic or become visually distressing then non-conservative approaches described below can be considered. </p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Radiofrequency ablation</strong> uses <strong>electromagnetic currents</strong> to destroy the vein without damaging the other structures. It can only treat junctional and truncal incompetence and not varicosities. </p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Saphenopopliteal ligation</strong> is a surgical procedure where the saphenopopliteal junction is dissected with flush ligation. Alternatively, the small saphenous vein can also be ligated as proximally as possible. Sural nerve neuropraxia and common peroneal nerve injury are possible complications. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Saphenofemoral ligation</strong> is a surgical procedure made where the <strong>great saphenous vein is ligated and stripped</strong>.

It results in hypercalcemia, alkalosis, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of Hypercalcemia</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Raised [PTH]</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Decreased [PTH]</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hyperparathyroidism</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary (adenoma &gt; hyperplasia)</li>\n<li>Secondary</li>\n<li>Tertiary</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypercalcemia of malignancy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vitamin D toxicity</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Immobilization</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Thiazide diuretics</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sarcoidosis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: WHO Classification of Plasma Cell Neoplasms</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Plasma cell neoplasms and variants</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Plasma cell myeloma</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Non secretory: No secretion of Ig, No M component.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Smoldering: M protein in serum ≥ 3g/dL and/or ≥10% clonal plasma cells in bone marrow, and no related organ or tissue impairment.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Plasma-cell leukemia: &gt;20% plasma cells in the peripheral blood or Absolute plasma cell count of &gt;2 X 10<sup>9</sup>/L.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Plasmacytoma</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Solitary plasmacytoma: Localized tumour of monoclonal plasma cells with no clinical features of plasma cell myeloma.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Extramedullary(extraosseous) plasmacytoma: Localized plasma cell neoplasms that arise in tissues other than bone.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary amyloidosis: Tumor secreting light chains that are deposited as beta-pleated sheet structure (amyloid light chain).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Systemic light and heavy chain diseases: Secrete abnormal light or heavy chain or both, which do not form beta pleated sheet, stain Congo Red or contain amyloid P component.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 239\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Plasma cell neoplasms with associated paraneoplastic syndrome</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>POEMS syndrome- Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal gammopathy, Skin changes.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 239\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>TEMPI syndrome </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
