      "solution": "<p>According to WHO guidelines, the quality of drinking water is considered to be <strong>satisfactory</strong> if the <strong>presumptive coliform count</strong> is <strong>0</strong><strong>/100 mL</strong>.</p>\n<p>Drinking water should not contain any <strong>pathogenic organisms</strong> or bacteria indicative of <strong>faecal contamination</strong>. The <strong>primary bacterial indicator</strong> used to assess this is the <strong>coliform group</strong> of organisms. This is because they are present abundantly in the human intestine and can be <strong>easily detected</strong> by culture methods. </p>\n<p>The <strong>presumptive coliform test</strong> can be done by the <strong>multiple tube method</strong> or <strong>membrane filtration</strong> <strong>techniques</strong>. In the multiple-tube method, the water to be tested is <strong>inoculated </strong>into tubes containing a suitable liquid medium. These tubes are then incubated for 48 hours and examined. The test is called <strong>presumptive</strong> because the reaction observed in the tube may occasionally be due to other organisms. The presumption that the reaction is due to coliform organisms has to be confirmed. <strong>McConkey's lactose bile salt broth</strong> with<strong> bromocresol purple 25</strong> as an indicator is used as the media. <em>Escherichia coli</em> or thermotolerant coliform bacteria should not be detected in any 100 ml sample. </p>\n<p>In samples of chlorinated water, confirmation of the presumptive test is necessary. This is done by <strong>subculturing</strong> the positive tubes in two tubes of brilliant green bile broth. It is based on the fact that <em>E.Coli</em> is the only coliform that can produce<strong> gas</strong> from lactose at 44°C.</p>\n<p>Supplementary indicator organisms include <strong>fecal streptococci</strong> and sulfite-reducing <strong>clostridia</strong>. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, 2017</h3><p><strong>WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, 2017</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I)&nbsp;Physical parameters</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Guideline values</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Comments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Turbidity</strong></td>\n<td>Ideally, there should be no visible turbidity but permissible standard is <strong>&lt; 1.0 NTU</strong> for household drinking water.&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Expressed in <strong>nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)</strong>.

They are synthesized in the intestine by <strong>assembling apo B-48 </strong>with lipids (mainly triacylglycerols). <strong>Apo C-II</strong> activates <strong>lipoprotein lipase</strong> present on the endothelium. Lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes the <strong>triacylglycerols </strong>into<strong> fatty acids </strong>and<strong> glycerol </strong>which are either used for storage or energy. Therefore, patients who are <strong>deficient in lipoprotein lipase</strong> or <strong>apo C-II</strong> (<strong>type I hyperlipoproteinemia</strong>) show <strong>increased </strong>levels of <strong>chylomicrons</strong> in the plasma after a <strong>fatty meal.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option B:  <strong>Low-density lipoprotein</strong> (LDL) is a fat that circulates in the blood, moving <strong>cholesterol</strong> around the body to where it is needed for cell repair and depositing it inside of artery walls. <strong>LDL receptor</strong> function is needed for the<strong> uptake of LDL</strong> from the blood into hepatocytes. <strong>Defects</strong> in LDL receptor function can cause hypercholesterolemia, known as <strong>familial hypercholesterolemia.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>High-density lipoprotein</strong> (HDL) plays a crucial role in <strong>reverse cholesterol transport.</strong> It transports cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver. HDL carries<strong> LDL </strong>(bad) cholesterol away from the arteries and <strong>back to the liver</strong>, where the LDL is broken down and passed from the body.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1) </strong>activates <strong>lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase</strong> (LCAT). LCAT is the enzyme present in <strong>HDL</strong>, which is activated by apo A1. LCAT converts <strong>free cholesterol</strong> (amphipathic) in HDL to <strong>cholesterol ester</strong>(hydrophobic). The initial discoidal shape now becomes spherical. This facilitates<strong> reverse cholesterol transport.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Familial Dyslipidemias</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type</td>\n<td>Increased levels&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Manifestation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.

      "solution": "<p>From the clinical history of <strong>progressive breathlessness</strong> and the HRCT chest showing <strong>pleural thickening, plaques, </strong>and<strong> fibrosis</strong>, the patient is most likely working in the <strong>asbestos</strong> industry.</p>\n<p><strong>Asbestosis</strong> occurs due to the inhalation of crystalline hydrated silicates (asbestos). It is characterized by diffuse <strong>parenchymal interstitial fibrosis</strong>. It predominantly affects the<strong> lower lobes </strong>of the lung, in contrast to other forms of pneumoconiosis, which affect the upper lobes and may present with dyspnoea and cough, usually after 20-30 years of exposure. Other asbestos-related diseases include <strong>pleural plaques, recurrent pleural effusions, lung carcinoma, </strong>and<strong> mesothelioma.</strong></p>\n<p>Workers in the <strong>cement, shipping, and textile</strong> industries are at a higher risk of developing asbestosis. Asbestos tends to involve the pleura first. The earliest manifestation is benign asbestosis-related<strong> pleural effusion.</strong> With time, the plaques are calcified resulting in the formation of <strong>thick pleural plaques.</strong> The pleural thickenings can be seen on the X-ray/ CT scan. This is the “<strong>holly leaf sign</strong>”.</p>\n<p>Histopathological findings:<strong> Asbestos bodies</strong> are a hallmark finding. They appear as <strong>golden brown, fusiform, or beaded rods</strong>. These are formed when the asbestos fibers are phagocytosed by the macrophages and are coated by iron-containing proteinaceous material derived from phagocyte ferritin.

It is a part of <strong>Garrod's tetrad</strong> which includes, pentosuria, albinism, cystinuria and alkaptonuria.</p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option A: The<strong> tricarboxylic acid cycle</strong> (TCA cycle), also called the <strong>citric acid cycle</strong> or the<strong> Krebs cycle</strong> is the final pathway where the <strong>oxidative</strong> catabolism of <strong>carbohydrates</strong>, <strong>amino acids</strong>, and<strong> fatty acids</strong> occurs with their carbon skeletons being converted to carbon dioxide (CO2). This oxidation provides energy for the production of the majority of <strong>ATP. </strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Glycolysis</strong> is the main pathway through which cells <strong>metabolize glucose</strong> and other carbohydrates. It occurs in the <strong>cytosol </strong>of cells and can function either <strong>aerobically</strong> or <strong>anaerobically</strong> depending on the availability of oxygen and the activity of the electron transport chain (and hence of the presence of mitochondria). <strong>Erythrocytes</strong>, which lack mitochondria, are completely reliant on <strong>glucose</strong> as their metabolic fuel and metabolize it by <strong>anaerobic glycolysis. </strong></p>\n<p>Option D: The pentose phosphate pathway or <strong>HMP shunt</strong> is an alternative route for the metabolism of glucose. It does not lead to the formation of ATP, but it has two major functions of, formation of<strong> NADPH </strong>and synthesis of<strong> ribose-5-phosphate.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Essential Pentosuria</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7a9eca80934a439086df5ad78dc4e7afx1280x1752.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

So, the <strong>highest percentage of oxygen</strong> in fetal circulation is in the <strong>umbilical vein,</strong> followed by the <strong>inferior vena cava. </strong></p>\n<p>The blood then enters the heart via the right atrium.
