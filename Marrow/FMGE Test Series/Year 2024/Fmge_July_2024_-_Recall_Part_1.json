Metoclopramide is useful in this condition because it <strong>increases LES tone,</strong> preventing acid reflux, and enhances gastric emptying by promoting gastrointestinal motility. Additionally, it reduces nausea and vomiting by <strong>blocking dopamine D2 receptors</strong> in the central nervous system. These combined effects help alleviate the symptoms and discomfort associated with GERD.</p>\n<p>Metoclopramide works in GERD by enhancing gastrointestinal motility through its <strong>antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors</strong>. In GIT, <strong>acetylcholine increases gastrointestinal motility </strong>and <strong>increases the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone.</strong> Therefore, <strong>D2 receptor inhibition</strong> augments <strong>ACh release </strong>and <strong>enhances GI motility</strong> and <strong>LES tone</strong>. Additionally, it exerts antiemetic effects by blocking D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the central nervous system. The combined actions help alleviate symptoms associated with GERD.</p>\n<p>Metoclopramide is a <strong>prokinetic</strong> and <strong>antiemetic</strong>. It has the following pharmacological actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dopamine receptor antagonist </li>\n<li>Serotonin (5HT4) receptor agonist </li>\n<li>Serotonin (5HT3) antagonist</li>\n<li>Sensitization of muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle. This results in increased lower esophageal sphincter tone and stimulates gastric antral contractions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Adverse effects</strong> of metoclopramide are mainly <strong>extrapyramidal effects</strong>, and these include <strong>acute dystonia, Parkinson-like symptoms (tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity), tardive dyskinesia, galactorrhea due to hyperprolactinemia, and methemoglobinemia in neonates.</strong></p>\n<p>Extrapyramidal symptoms can be treated by discontinuing metoclopramide and administering anticholinergics or antihistaminics.</p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Ondansetron</strong> is a <strong>5 HT3 receptor antagonist</strong>. It blocks impulses at the peripheral origin in GIT and does not suppress vomiting caused by motion sickness. It is most commonly indicated for the treatment of <strong>postoperative and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Loperamide </strong>has <strong>μ opioid receptor activity </strong>and is an <strong>orally active antidiarrheal agent</strong>. The drug is more potent than morphine as an antidiarrheal agent and penetrates the CNS poorly. It is effective in patients with <strong>5-fluorouracil-induced diarrhea</strong> and can be regarded as the <strong>treatment of choice</strong>. Loperamide is effective against <strong>traveler’s diarrhea</strong> and can be used alone or in combination. If clinical improvement in acute diarrhea does not occur within 48 hours, loperamide should be discontinued.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Diphenoxylate</strong> is an <strong>opioid agonist</strong> that is structurally similar to meperidine. It is used in the treatment of <strong>acute, chronic, and traveller's diarrhea</strong>. Upon administration, it undergoes de-esterification to difenoxin, which is its active metabolite. Its side effects include constipation, toxic megacolon, paralytic ileus and can give rise to CNS depression in children.</p>",

However, few patients may either be overweight or underweight. There is a risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. </p>\n<p>Treatment modalities are cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, and antidepressants such as fluoxetine.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Anorexia nervosa </strong>is an eating disorder that is often seen between the ages of 10 and 30. Typical features are self-induced <strong>starvation</strong>, voluntary and <strong>unhealthy reduction in weight</strong>, intense drive for thinness, and fear of becoming obese. These symptoms are usually present for at least a period of 3 months. Associated features can include depression, anxiety, amenorrhea in females, hypothermia, and bradycardia. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</strong> is a condition where scrupulous individuals are <strong>overly concerned</strong> that something they thought or did might be a sin or a violation of religious or moral doctrine. The treatment of choice for OCD is <strong>cognitive behavioral therapy.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Binge-eating disorder</strong> is the most common eating disorder. It is characterized by <strong>rapid intake of abnormally large quantities of food</strong> over a short period of time, even when not hungry. There are feelings of guilt about the eating episodes, but these patients <strong>do not compensate</strong> in any way following the episodes of binge.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Eating Disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Anorexia nervosa</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Binge-eating disorder</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Avoidance of food</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>(calorie deficit)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Binge eating</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+/-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Compensation</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>(purge/vomit)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>&nbsp;+/-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>BMI</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>LOW*</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>NORMAL</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>HIGH</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;*In <strong>atypical anorexia nervosa</strong>, all the features of anorexia nervosa will be present, but the patient will have normal BMI.</p>",

This discoloration is due to <strong>carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning</strong>, which can occur from smoke in an enclosed space.</p>\n<p>The colour of postmortem staining in <strong>CO poisoning </strong>is <strong>cherry red</strong>. Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of <strong>incomplete combustion </strong>of organic materials, such as <strong>wood.</strong> When inhaled, CO binds to hemoglobin in the blood with an affinity approximately <strong>240 times </strong>greater than that of oxygen, forming <strong>carboxyhemoglobin </strong>(COHb). This reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, leading to tissue hypoxia.</p>\n<p>The cherry red discolouration is a hallmark of CO poisoning.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Coarctation of the aorta </strong>will be the diagnosis for a newborn with<strong> weak lower-limb pulses </strong>and <strong>strong upper-limb pulses.</strong></p>\n<p>Coarctation refers to a constriction or narrowing in the aorta, which can be proximal or distal to the ductus arteriosus. CoA usually presents either in <strong>infancy</strong> or in <strong>later childhood</strong> as<strong> incidental upper limb hypertension</strong> and <strong>disparity of pulses in the upper  and lower limbs as radio-femoral delay.</strong></p>\n<p>When the ductus arteriosus is <strong>open</strong> in an infant with severe coarctation, the left-to-right shunt established during birth across the ductus arteriosus during birth is reversed to <strong>a right-to-left</strong> shunt as there is coarctation above the ductus in the aorta. This leads to deoxygenated blood flow to the lower limbs and no change in pulse in the lower limbs. As the ductus arteriosus <strong>closes</strong>, there is a pooling of blood in the heart, leading to congestive heart failure, further<strong> </strong>leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance as well as lack of blood flow to lower limbs <strong>(presenting as weak pulses in the lower extremities).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Figure of 3 sign is </strong>pathognomonic of coarctation of the aorta and occurs due to indentation of the aorta at the site of coarctation and pre and post-stenotic dilatation along the left paramediastinum.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/3a93e28716f64f16b97f844cdf7c744ax510x688.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Treatment includes re-establishing patency of the ductus arteriosus by <strong>prostaglandin E1 </strong>infusion and heart failure medical management followed by definitive surgical management such as <strong>coarctectomy, end-to-end anastomosis, or patch aortoplasty.</strong> Restenosis of CoA areas later in childhood are common and are treated by balloon angioplasty.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Tetralogy of Fallot</strong> is the most common <strong>cyanotic heart disease</strong> encountered beyond the age of 1 year.

Survival in the immediate neonatal period is due to the mixture of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood provided by the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus. About half of the patients also have a <strong>ventricular septal defect (VSD).</strong> Clinical manifestations become apparent soon after birth, with infants presenting with cyanosis and tachypnea. It is associated with moderate-to-severe hypoxemia.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Ebstein anomaly</strong> is characterized by the downward displacement of the <strong>tricuspid valve</strong> into the right ventricle, which results in a thin-walled, low-pressure, “<strong>atrialized</strong>” segment of the right ventricle due to the anomalous attachment of the tricuspid leaflets. A box-shaped heart is seen in Ebstein's anomaly. There is severe right-sided cardiomegaly due to an elongated and enlarged right atrium, which leads to an elevated apex. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Important radiological signs in cardiology</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Sign</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Condition</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Flask</strong> shaped/ Pear shaped/ <strong>Leather bottle </strong>shaped/ <strong>Money-bag</strong> shaped heart</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Pericardial effusion</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Boot shaped heart/ <strong>Coeur-en-sabot</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Fallot&rsquo;s tetralogy</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Gooseneck sign</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Endocardial cushion defects</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Box-shaped heart</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Ebstein's anomaly</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Jug handle appearance</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Primary pulmonary artery hypertension</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>&ldquo;3&rdquo; like appearance of the aorta</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Coarctation of aorta</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Egg on string appearance</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Transposition of great vessels</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Egg in cup appearance, Pericardial calcification</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Constrictive pericarditis</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Snowman&rsquo;s heart, Cottage loaf appearance, Figure of Eight appearance</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Scimitar</strong> sign</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Calcification in the heart wall</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Carcinoid syndrome</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Calcification of ascending aorta</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Atherosclerosis, Syphilis</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Hilar dance on fluoroscopy</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Atrial septal defect</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Batwing appearance</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Pulmonary edema</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div>Pruned tree appearance of the pulmonary vasculature</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Pulmonary artery hypertension</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>",
