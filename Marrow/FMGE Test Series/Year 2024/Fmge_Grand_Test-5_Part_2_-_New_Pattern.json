This is seen in PID, IUCD users, varicosities of pelvic veins, pelvic endometriosis, and fibroids. </li>\n<li><strong>Membranous dysmenorrhea </strong>is rare and is characterized by crampy pain that occurs with the passage of the endometrium as a cast at the time of menstruation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Primary dysmenorrhea can be managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), combined oral contraceptive pills, and progestin-only pills. GnRH agonists and androgens are also useful. Surgical management includes hysterectomy and is indicated if not responding to medical management. In secondary dysmenorrhea, treating the cause is needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Fibromyalgia</strong> is a disorder with diffuse musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood issues. It is <strong>associated with</strong> irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, and depression. There is <strong>no cure</strong> for fibromyalgia as of now, although the symptoms can be controlled by medications. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals.</p>",

This increases the peripheral distribution of the lipid-soluble agents thus resulting in increased recovery time. There is an increase in the cardiac output in obese individuals that increases the early distribution of the drugs. Hence <strong>fat-soluble drugs</strong> should be administered based on the <strong>total body weight.</strong> Water-soluble agents like neuromuscular blockers have a smaller peripheral distribution that is minimally increased by body fat. Therefore, <strong>water-soluble agents</strong> are dosed based on the <strong>ideal body weight</strong>.</p>\n<p>Among the commonly used inhalational anesthetics, <strong>desflurane</strong> is the <strong>least fat-soluble</strong> which leads to a faster recovery. <strong>Desflurane</strong> is also <strong>minimally metabolized</strong> by the liver, thereby reducing hepatotoxicity. </p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Inhalational agent</td>\n<td>Blood-gas partition coefficient</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Halothane</td>\n<td>2.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Isoflurane</td>\n<td>1.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sevoflurane</td>\n<td>0.65</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Desflurane</td>\n<td>0.45</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><strong>Blood-gas partition co-efficient</strong> determines the <strong>solubility</strong> of the anesthetic agent in the blood.

The higher the uptake of the anesthetic agent, the higher the difference between the inspired and alveolar concentrations, which leads to a <strong>slower rate of induction</strong> and <strong>recovery.</strong> Desflurane has a very low blood:gas partition coefficient (0.42).

The occurrence of infections are largely based on the environmental conditions that the child is exposed to.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural influences</strong>: Poor diets as a result of cultural and regional influences also play a role in malnutrition. They are as follows with an example for each:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Food habits, traditions, customs, beliefs and attitudes</strong>: Rice and wheat are largely staple in India. Papaya is avoided as it is thought to cause abortion.</li>\n<li>Religion: Hindus do not eat beef and Muslims do not eat pork.</li>\n<li>Food fads: Personal likes and dislikes to a certain group of foods.</li>\n<li>Cooking practices: Prolonged boiling of cereals in open pans which leads to a loss of nutritive value</li>\n<li><strong>Child-rearing practices:</strong> Premature curtailment of breastfeeding</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Socio-economic factors:</strong> Poverty plays a huge role in causing malnutrition.
