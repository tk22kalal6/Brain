This reduced form of vitamin K needs to be constantly recycled back from its oxidized form for the reaction to continue. This recycling is done by the enzyme <strong>vitamin K epoxide reductase, </strong>which is <strong>competitively</strong> <strong>inhibited by warfarin</strong>. Hence, there will be a reduction in the activation of coagulation factors.</p>\n<p>The image below shows warfarin's mechanism of action.</p>\n</div>\n</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2bc835721e6e4ef99b01e279efaeada3x1279x1234.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><div class=\"ng-star-inserted\">\n<div class=\"table-responsive font-weight-light answer-scroll ng-star-inserted\">\n<p>The half-life of <strong>proteins C</strong> and <strong>S</strong> are 8 and 24 hours, respectively, which is relatively <strong>shorter </strong>than the half-lives of other clotting factors, particularly factor II. Therefore, the full antithrombotic effect of warfarin is not achieved for <strong>4 to 5 days</strong>. For this reason, warfarin must be bridged with a rapidly acting parenteral anticoagulant, such as <strong>heparin</strong>, low-molecular-weight heparin (<strong>LMWH</strong>), or fondaparinux, in patients with thrombosis or at high risk for thrombosis.</p>\n<p>Uses of warfarin are acute deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and <strong>p</strong><strong>reventing stroke </strong>or <strong>systemic embolization</strong> in patients with a <strong>mechanical heart valve</strong>. </p>\n<p>Adverse effects of warfarin are bleeding, skin necrosis, <strong>p</strong><strong>urple toe syndrome</strong> (due to <strong>cholesterol microemboli</strong> released from atheromatous plaques, which cause <strong>arteriolar occlusion</strong>), and <strong>f</strong><strong>etal warfarin syndrome</strong> (hypoplasia of the nose, eye socket, hand bones, and growth retardation).</p>\n<div class=\"ng-star-inserted\">\n<div class=\"table-responsive font-weight-light answer-scroll ng-star-inserted\">\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Warfarin</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> is mainly </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">metabolized </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">by the</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> CYP2C9</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> enzyme.

The common sources of infection are foods that are not cooked after handling. These include <strong>sliced meats</strong>, puddings, <strong>pastries</strong>, and sandwiches. Patients present with nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhea. </p>\n<p><strong>Gastroenteritis</strong> is caused by<strong> enterotoxin</strong> produced by <em>S. aureus</em>. It is a <strong>preformed toxin</strong> that is relatively <strong>heat stable </strong>while most of the other exotoxins are heat-labile. It stimulates the <strong>vagus nerve</strong> and <strong>vomiting center</strong> of the brain and also stimulates intestinal peristaltic activity. Eight antigenic types of enterotoxin are currently known of which <strong>Type  A </strong>toxin is responsible for most cases.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The cholera enterotoxin of <strong><em>Vibrio cholerae </em></strong>binds to the <strong>GM1 ganglioside receptors</strong> on the surface of jejunal epithelial cells. It then causes the accumulation of cAMP. A clinical vignette of sudden onset colorless rice watery, stools having an inoffensive sweetish odor is indicative of <strong>cholera</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B: The enterotoxin of <em><strong>Bacillus cereus</strong></em> involves stimulation of the cAMP system. It may also cause food poisoning independent of the cAMP system. Food poisoning after consumption of <strong>fried rice </strong>or<strong> Chinese street food</strong> is suggestive of <em>B. cereus</em>. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Shiga toxin</strong> acts by <strong>inactivating the 60s ribosomal</strong> subunit thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. <em><strong>Shigella dysenteriae </strong></em>causes acute onset of symptoms(fever, abdominal cramps) with dysentery and tenesmus.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Elderly diabetic with <strong>severe otalgia</strong>, otorrhoea, <strong>granulation </strong>tissue in the external auditory canal and <strong>facial nerve palsy</strong> indicates <strong>malignant otitis externa.</strong> The most common causative agent remains <strong>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa </strong>is associated with <em>Pseudomonas</em> infection in <strong>elderly diabetics</strong> and those on <strong>immunosuppressive drugs</strong>. It is termed malignant, though being an infection due to the high mortality rate and poor response to treatment.</p>\n<p>Patients present with excruciating pain, profuse discharge &amp; <strong>granulations</strong> on the floor of EAC. Necrosis of bone aids in the spread of infection. <strong>Facial paralysis</strong> is common.  Infection may spread to the skull base and jugular foramen causing <strong>multiple cranial nerve palsies</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Gallium-67</strong> is more useful in the <strong>diagnosis</strong> and <strong>follow-up </strong>of the patient. <strong>Technetium 99</strong> bone scan reveals bone infection, but the test remains positive for a year or so and cannot be used to monitor the disease. </p>\n<p>Treatment includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diabetic control</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Ear toileting</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Antibiotic</strong><span> treatment against the causative organism (P. aeruginosa) for </span><strong>6–8 weeks</strong><span> or more.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div>Antibiotics found effective are:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div><strong>Gentamicin</strong> combined with <strong>ticarcillin </strong>(intravenous).</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>Third-generation cephalosporins</strong> combined with an<strong> aminoglycoside </strong>(intr<em>avenous).</em></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><strong>Quinolones</strong> combined with<strong> rifampin </strong>(oral). </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>If the patient is not responsive, culture and sensitivity of ear discharge should be done.
