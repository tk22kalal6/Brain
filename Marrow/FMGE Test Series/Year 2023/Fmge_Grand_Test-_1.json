It acts by stimulating the prostanoid receptors on the ciliary muscles<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>This leads to the release of matrix metalloproteinases, which increases the uveoscleral outflow.</p>\n<p><strong>Topical prostaglandins</strong>&nbsp;like latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, and tafluprost are now used as&nbsp;<strong>first-line agents</strong>&nbsp;to lower IOP. The major mechanism of action is by&nbsp;enhancing the&nbsp;<strong>uveoscleral outflow&nbsp;</strong>though they also increase&nbsp;<strong>trabecular outflow</strong>.</p>\n<p>The most common ocular side effects are conjunctival hyperemia, eyelash thickening,&nbsp;<strong>iris hyperpigmentation</strong>, and loss of periorbital fat. These drugs are administered&nbsp;<strong>once every day</strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>bedtime</strong>&nbsp;and are used with caution in inflamed eyes.</p>\n<p>The systemic side effects are uncommon and include occasional headaches, malaise, myalgia, skin rash, and mild upper respiratory infections.&nbsp;<strong>Latanoprost</strong>&nbsp;is preferred as the first-line due to&nbsp;<strong>fewer</strong>&nbsp;ocular&nbsp;<strong>side effects</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;<strong>Dorzolamide</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>carbonic anhydrase inhibitor</strong>. It reduces IOP by&nbsp;<strong>decreasing aqueous production</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Mannitol</strong>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;<strong>osmotic agent</strong>, which lowers IOP by creating an osmotic gradient so that water is pulled from the vitreous into the blood vessels. It is used as a&nbsp;<strong>short-term treatment</strong>&nbsp;to reduce IOP in&nbsp;<strong>acute</strong>&nbsp;angle-closure glaucoma or prior to intraocular surgery.</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Pilocarpine</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>miotic</strong>&nbsp;that acts as a&nbsp;<strong>cholinergic agonist</strong>. In&nbsp;<strong>angle-closure glaucoma</strong>, cholinergic agents open the angle by contraction of the sphincter pupillae, pulling the iris away from the trabecula.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Antiglaucoma drugs: Mechanism of lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) at a glance</h3><p><strong>Drugs that increase trabecular outflow</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Miotics (e.g., pilocarpine)</li>\n<li>Epinephrine, dipivefrine</li>\n<li>Bimatoprost</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Drugs that increase uveoscleral outflow</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prostaglandins (latanoprost)</li>\n<li>Epinephrine, dipivefrine</li>\n<li>Brimonidine</li>\n<li>Apraclonidine</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Drugs that decrease aqueous production</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide, dorzolamide)</li>\n<li>Alpha receptor stimulators in ciliary process (e.g., epinephrine, dipivefrine, clonidine, brimonidine, apraclonidine)</li>\n<li>Beta-blockers</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hyperosmotic agents</strong> - (e.g., glycerol, mannitol, urea)</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e4eb360267954a48a38f41849f9d2c65x1280x1251.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",
