Patients complain of a sensation of heaviness, burning, and aching over the affected area or whole limb, that increases throughout the day or on prolonged standing. Compression and elevation relieve the symptoms.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis is mainly using <strong>duplex ultrasound</strong>.

Thus, infection at the potential LP site is a contraindication to performing a lumbar puncture at that area.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the more worrisome contraindication to lumbar puncture is the suspicion of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to a cerebral mass lesion. In the presence of a potential brain tumor, cerebral hemorrhage, cavernous sinus thrombosis, brain abscesses, epidural or subdural hematomas , patients are at increased risk of deteriorating neurologically with LP. As the space-occupying lesion grows, ICP rises. When lumbar puncture is performed in these patients, a low-pressure shunt is formed at the site of LP where CSF can escape.</p>\n<p>As the CSF pressure drops in the spinal column, CSF and brain mass may then shift towards the low-pressure outlet (the LP site). This may lead to either trans-tentorial or uncal herniation and acute neurological deterioration.</p>\n<p>Patients with increased ICP from mass lesions often display decreased levels of consciousness, focal neurological signs or papilledema on physical exam.

Paraplegic patients, elderly patients, and severely ill patients are at a higher risk of developing pressure sores.</p>\n<p>They are staged as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 1</strong> - Erythema with no blanching and no breach in the epidermis.</li>\n<li><strong>Stage 2</strong>- Partial-thickness skin loss with epidermal and dermal involvement.</li>\n<li><strong>Stage 3</strong>- Full-thickness skin loss with intact fascia but the involvement of the subcutaneous tissue.</li>\n<li><strong>Stage 4</strong>- <strong>Full-thickness skin loss</strong> extending to the fascia with <strong>massive tissue destruction</strong> and<strong> involvement </strong>of <strong>muscle</strong>, bone, tendon, or joint.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Management is primarily proper skin care with pressure dispersion cushions, air-fluidized beds, and urinary or fecal diversion if required. Patients who are bed-bound should be turned once in 2 hours. Those in a wheelchair should lift themselves off the seat for 10 seconds every 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Surgery</strong> is the last resort and is done after a proper initial <strong>debridement</strong> and <strong>vacuum-assisted closure. </strong>Vacuum-assisted closure is a wound closure technique<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in which negative pressure is applied to the wound which leads to a decrease in edema. This hastens the debridement and formation of granulation tissue. Skin flaps with a muscle are also used for closure.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Staging of Pressure Sores</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 50\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Description</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Non-blanchable erythema without a breach in the epidermis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>\n<p>Partial thickness skin loss involving the epidermis and dermis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>\n<p>Full thickness skin loss extending into the subcutaneous tissue but not through underlying fascia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Full thickness skin loss through fascia with extensive tissue destruction, maybe involving muscle, bone, tendon or joint</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5101f11adf164ca39aa80464ba864044x1280x4990.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

Management is easy in the case of a small fetus and a large maternal pelvis. However, in the case of a large fetus, delivery by cesarean section is usually indicated.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Face</strong> presentation occurs when the neck is <strong>hyper-extended</strong> and the <strong>chin</strong> is the <strong>presenting part</strong>. The facial features may be palpable on per-vaginal examination.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Vertex</strong> presentation occurs when the neck is <strong>well flexed</strong>. A quadrangular area of the fetal skull bound by the bregma, parietal eminence, and lambdoid sutures is palpable on per-vaginal examination.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong>&nbsp;Shoulder</strong> presentation can occur when the fetus is in the <strong>transverse lie</strong>. On per vaginal examination during labor, the shoulder is identified by palpating the following parts&mdash;the acromion process, the scapula, the clavicle, and the axilla. The characteristic landmarks are<br />the feeling of the ribs and intercostal spaces (gridiron feel). On occasion, the arm is found prolapsed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/29d67545252146a8949df0d44d5f79aax1200x1907.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

The girth of the affected arm &gt;2 centimeters than the normal limb,&nbsp;a 200-mL or more increase in limb volume, or a 5% or greater limb volume change are other diagnostic criteria.</p>\n<p>Management:</p>\n<p><strong>Limb elevation</strong>, <strong>elastic arm stockings</strong>, and<strong> pneumatic compression devices</strong> can help reduce swelling.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Dry skin</strong> can be seen due to fluid accumulation, which can lead to <strong>cellulitis/skin infections.</strong> Using a <strong>low pH water-based moisturizer</strong> is helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Manual lymphatic drainage</strong> (MLD) by a therapist followed by <strong>simple lymphatic drainage</strong> (SLD) by the patient daily aids interstitial fluid evacuation.</p>\n<p><strong>Benzpyrones</strong> and <strong>flavonoids</strong> are some naturally occurring substances that may be of use to treat lymphedema.</p>\n<p>Surgical options are <strong>lymphaticovenular anastomosis</strong>, liposuction, and debulking.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Stewart-Treves syndrome</strong>&nbsp;refers to <strong>lymphangiosarcoma</strong> seen in chronic <strong>long-standing</strong> lymphedema following mastectomy (more than 10 years).

The subclavian vein is compressed at the thoracic outlet.&nbsp;<strong>Painful</strong> swelling of the arm is observed.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Cellulitis</strong> usually presents with an ulcer and the skin is erythematous, swollen, and <strong>painful</strong>.
