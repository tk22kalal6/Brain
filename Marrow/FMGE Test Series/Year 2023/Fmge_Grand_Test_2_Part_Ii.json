It is characterized by <strong>binge-eating episodes</strong>, followed by inappropriate, compensatory measures to stop weight gain, like <strong>self-induced vomiting</strong>, laxative abuse, diuretics, enema, and emetic abuse. These binge-eating episodes occur at least once a week and are present for at least 3 months.

There is a risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. </p>\n<p>Treatment modalities are cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, and antidepressants such as fluoxetine.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Anorexia nervosa </strong>is an eating disorder that is often seen between the ages of 10 and 30. Typical features are self-induced <strong>starvation</strong>, voluntary and <strong>unhealthy reduction in weight</strong>, intense drive for thinness, and fear of becoming obese. These symptoms are usually present for at least a period of 3 months. Associated features can include depression, anxiety, amenorrhea in females, hypothermia, and bradycardia. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Atypical depression</strong> is a type of depression characterized by <strong>mood reactivity,</strong> which is brightening of the mood in response to positive events; <strong>significant weight gain</strong> or increase in appetite; <strong>hypersomnia;</strong> <strong>leaden paralysis;</strong> and/or interpersonal rejection sensitivity, resulting in sig­nificant social or occupational impairment. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Binge-eating disorder</strong> is the most common eating disorder. It is characterized by <strong>rapid intake of abnormally large quantities of food</strong> over a short period of time, even when not hungry.

Clinically this appears as a foot that's twisted and turned inwards.</p>\n<p>In patients with CTEV, the skin and soft tissues of the calf and the medial side of the foot are underdeveloped. If CTEV is not managed appropriately then these changes become permanent.</p>\n<p>The first line of conservative management in a child with CTEV is <strong>Ponsetti's method</strong>. In this method, the three main deformities of CTEV are collected in the following order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cavus - The first metatarsal is elevated to create a flat longitudinal medial border of the foot.</li>\n<li>Adduction- The forefoot is abducted in the plane of the metatarsals which rotates and everts the hindfoot and corrects the forefoot out of supination</li>\n<li>Equinus is corrected by dorsiflexing the foot at the ankle joint. </li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Age wise management of CTEV</h3><p>Initial treatment starts with Ponseti's POP cast as early as possible, but within 1 year of age.</p>\n<p>If deformity gets corrected:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dennis Brown splint is used till 1 year of age</li>\n<li>After 1 year upto 5 years CTEV shoes are used in day, and Dennis Brown splint is used at night</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If deformity is not corrected or untreated previously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1-3 years: Posteromedial soft tissue release (PMSTR)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>3-5 years: Dillwyn Evans procedure</li>\n<li>5-8 years: Dwyer osteotomy</li>\n<li>8-10 years: Wedge tarsectomy</li>\n<li>&gt;10 years: Triple arthrodesis, external fixators</li>\n</ul>",
