Infection control measures like <strong>immunization, hand washing, personal hygiene</strong> and public health measures such as sanitation serve as a holistic primary prevention strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary prevention </strong>is defined as an action taken prior to the onset of a disease, whose aim is to prevent the disease from occurring. Its target population is <strong>healthy individuals</strong>. It commonly institutes activities that <strong>limit risk exposure</strong> or increase the immunity of individuals at risk to prevent a disease from progressing in a susceptible individual. The approaches can be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Population (mass) strategy where the target group is the whole population</li>\n<li>A high-risk strategy is where the target group is limited to the people who are most at risk of developing a particular disease.</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Levels of Prevention</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Level</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Primordial</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Primary</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Secondary</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Tertiary</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Phase of disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Underlying socio-economic &amp; environmental conditions leading to causation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Specific causal or risk factors</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Early stage of disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Late stage of disease</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Aim</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Establish and maintain conditions that minimize hazards to health</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Reduce the incidence of disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Reduce prevalence by shortening duration</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Reduce number and impact of complications</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Inhibition of emergence of socio-economic, environmental and behavioural conditions</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Protection of personal and community health by eliminating risks</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Early detection and intervention to minimize disability</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Soften the impact of long-term disease and disability, minimize suffering</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Modes of Intervention</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Health education</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Health promotion and specific protection</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Diagnosis and treatment</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Disability limitation and rehabilitation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Targets</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Total population or select groups</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Total population or high risk individuals/groups</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Individuals/ Patients</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Patients</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Glomus jugulare arises from the dome of the jugular bulb and invades the hypotympanum. Glomus tympanicum arises from the promontory of the middle ear.</p>\n<p>Clinical features include conductive <strong>hearing loss</strong> and <strong>pulsatile tinnitus</strong>- earliest symptoms. Otoscopy examination shows a <strong>red reflex</strong> through an intact tympanic membrane as a&nbsp;<strong>\"rising sun\"</strong>&nbsp;appearance since the tumor arises from the floor of the middle ear.&nbsp;Paralysis of the 9th to 12th cranial nerves can also occur. An <strong>audible bruit</strong> over the mastoid is heard on auscultation in all the stages of the tumor.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Acute otitis media</strong> presents with <strong>throbbing earache</strong> and a red and <strong>bulging tympanic membrane</strong> with loss of landmarks on examination. Tuning fork tests reveal a <strong>conductive</strong> type of hearing loss.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Chronic otitis media</strong> presents with mucoid or mucopurulent <strong>ear discharge</strong>, the conductive type of hearing loss, and <strong>central perforation</strong> of the tympanic membrane. <strong>Middle ear mucosa</strong> can be seen through the perforation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D: Serous otitis media&nbsp;presents with&nbsp;<strong>hearing loss, delayed and defective speech,</strong>&nbsp;and mild earaches associated with&nbsp;upper respiratory tract infections. Otoscopy reveals a&nbsp;<strong>dull</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>opaque, and retracted tympanic membrane</strong>&nbsp;with loss of light reflex, a thin leash of vessels along the handle of the malleus, fluid levels, and&nbsp;<strong>air bubbles</strong>&nbsp;behind the tympanic membrane.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Signs in Glomus Tumors</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Sign</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Seen on</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>What is seen</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Rising sun</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Otoscopy</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Tumor arising from floor</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Brown sign</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Otoscopy</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>On increasing the ear canal pressure, tumor pulsates and then blanches</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Phelp sign</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>CT</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Loss of carotico-jugular crest</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
