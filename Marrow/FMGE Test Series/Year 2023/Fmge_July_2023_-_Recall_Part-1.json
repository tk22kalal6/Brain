Physical examination reveals a <strong>smooth enlarged</strong> and <strong>non-tender</strong> <strong>prostate</strong>. Lab investigations reveal a <strong>normal PSA </strong>(prostate-specific antigen). Diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation and a lack of lab findings suggestive of malignancy (elevated PSA). A biopsy is rarely indicated.</p>\n<p><strong>Conservative treatment </strong>is recommended for men with<strong> mild symptoms, flow rate &gt;10ml/s, </strong>and<strong> good bladder emptying</strong> with residual urine &lt;100ml. </p>\n<p><strong>Medical management</strong> includes <strong>alpha-adrenergic blocking</strong> agents that inhibit the contraction of smooth muscle that is found in the prostate.

It has a single <strong>polar flagellum</strong>. It causes <strong>cholera</strong>, an acute diarrheal disease. It is marked by painless, profuse, watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus (<strong>rice water stools</strong>) associated with effortless <strong>vomiting</strong>. <strong>Pulmonary edema</strong> and arrhythmias are some of the complications. </p>\n<p>Infection is acquired by ingestion of <strong>contaminated</strong> food and water. The organisms produce an <strong>enterotoxin</strong> known as <strong>cholera toxin</strong> (CT). It has 1 A and 5 B subunits. The <strong>B subunit</strong> (binding units) fixes to the<strong> GM1</strong> ganglioside receptors on<strong> jejunal epithelial cells</strong>. The A subunit dissociates into the A2 fragment, which attaches the A1 fragment to the B subunit. This results in prolonged<strong> accumulation</strong> of <strong>cAMP</strong>, which causes an outpouring of large amounts of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen. Ultimately, it results in <strong>profuse watery diarrhea</strong>. </p>\n<p>In addition to the <strong>cholera toxin</strong>, additional toxins such as<strong> zona occludens toxin</strong> and accessory cholera toxin are also produced. The former alters intestinal permeability by its action on intestinal epithelial cells.</p>\n<p>The characteristic <strong>darting mobility</strong> and its hindrance by antiserum can be used for rapid microscopic diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Fluid resuscitation by <strong>rice-based ORS</strong> is recommended. Medical management includes <strong>erythromycin</strong> or azithromycin.</p>\n<p><strong>Other options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GM2 gangliosides</strong> are involved in the metabolism of gangliosides, and abnormalities in their metabolism can lead to diseases like Tay-Sachs disease.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Gi protein-coupled receptor </strong>is a type of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a role in signal transduction.

Plasticity is the ability of an object to deform its shape without breaking.</p>\n<p><strong>Cystometrogram </strong>is a plot of <strong>intravesical pressure</strong> against the <strong>volume</strong> of <strong>fluid</strong> in the <strong>bladder.</strong> The curve shows three segments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ia</strong>-<strong> initial slight rise</strong> in pressure when the first increments in the volume are produced</li>\n<li><strong>Ib</strong>- <strong>long</strong>, nearly <strong>flat segment</strong> as further increments are produced</li>\n<li><strong>II-</strong> <strong>sudden, sharp rise</strong> in pressure as the<strong> micturition reflex</strong> is<strong> triggered</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>dotted line-</strong> pressure-volume relation if the<strong> micturition</strong> had<strong> not occurred</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The<strong> flatness</strong> of segment Ib is a demonstration of the<strong> law of Laplace</strong>. The law of Laplace states that the pressure (P) in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension (T) divided by the radius (R). This is expressed as <strong>P= 2T/R. </strong>In the blad­der, the<strong> tension increases</strong> as the bladder get filled.
