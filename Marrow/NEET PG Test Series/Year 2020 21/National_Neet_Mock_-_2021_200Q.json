It occurs <strong>due to an injury in</strong> the dorsal perisylvian <strong>region, which connects Broca&rsquo;s area with Wernicke&rsquo;s area</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Wernicke's area</strong> lies in the posterior end of the <strong>superior temporal gyrus.</strong> It is an important area for word and sentence <strong>comprehension</strong>. Damage to this area or blockade of the <strong>inferior</strong> division of the middle cerebral artery causes <strong>Wernicke's aphasia</strong>. It is a type of <strong>fluent aphasia&nbsp;</strong>in which <strong>comprehension</strong> is <strong>impaired </strong>to the spoken and written words or sentences. The <strong>speech</strong> is <strong>fluent</strong>, but contains <strong>jargon</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>neologisms</strong>. Therefore, the examiner cannot understand what the patient is speaking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C: Anomic aphasia is a very mild dysfunction of the language network. <strong>Comprehension</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>repetition</strong> are<strong> intact</strong>, but&nbsp;<strong>naming</strong>, word finding, and spelling are <strong>impaired.</strong>&nbsp;It is due to a lesion within the <strong>left hemisphere</strong>, including the middle and inferior temporal gyri. It can occur due to&nbsp;head trauma, metabolic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>\n<p>Option D: In<strong> Broca's aphasia</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the&nbsp;speech is <strong>non-fluent</strong>, with <strong>impaired repetition</strong> and <strong>naming.</strong> However, <strong>comprehension</strong> is <strong>preserved.</strong>&nbsp;Broca's area lies in the <strong>inferior frontal gyrus</strong>.

Usually, a mechanical type of flocculator is used which has paddles that rotate at 2 to 4 RPM (rotations per minute) with the help of a motor. This results in a <strong>thick, copious flocculate of aluminum hydroxide</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Sedimentation</strong> – The coagulated water is moved into <strong>sedimentation tanks</strong> where detaining it for 2 – 6 hours will result in the <strong>settling down </strong>of the flocculant along with impurities and bacteria. This is to be removed before the filtration takes place. </li>\n<li><strong>Filtration</strong> – The partly purified water is then subjected to rapid sand filtration.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Filter beds</strong>: Each unit of the filter bed has a surface of about 80 to 90 m<sup>2</sup>. The effective size of the sand particles/grains is about 0.4 to 0.7 mm. The depth of the sand bed is about 1 meter and has graded gravel below it.</li>\n<li>As the filtration is done, the alum-floc which has not precipitated is held back by the sand bed. This forms a layer that adsorbs bacteria and other impurities.

A high vagal injury would mean that both the SLN and RLN functions are affected, therefore that can also be ruled out.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Nerves of Larynx</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/01db8c67ccfd4505ae52b2b0312f0ecdx1280x2954.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Muscles of larynx</h3><p><span>Remember 2 exceptions:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>All muscles are<strong> adductors</strong>,<strong> except PCA </strong>(an abductor)</span></li>\n<li><span>All muscles are supplied by the<strong> recurrent laryngeal nerve</strong>,<strong> except cricothyroid </strong>(superior laryngeal nerve)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"t1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Action</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Muscle</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Opening</strong> of the inlet of larynx</span></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Thyroepiglotticus</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Closing</strong> of the inlet of larynx</span></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Aryepiglotticus, Interarytenoids</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Abductor</strong> of vocal cords</span></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Posterior cricoarytenoid</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Adductor</strong> of vocal cords</span></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Lateral cricoarytenoid</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Tensor</strong> of vocal cords</span></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Cricothyroid</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Relaxer</strong> of vocal cord</span></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Thyroarytenoid</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Modulator</strong> of larynx</span></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"td1\" valign=\"top\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Vocalis</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Safety muscle</strong> of larynx: <strong>Posterior cricoarytenoid</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span>Safety muscle of tongue: Genioglossus</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span>The muscle of <strong>whispering</strong>: <strong>Lateral cricoarytenoid</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Vocalis</strong> is known as the modulator of larynx because, the <strong>anterior part</strong> of the vocalis muscle can <strong>tense</strong> the vocal cord, and its <strong>posterior part</strong> can <strong>relax</strong> the vocal cord.</span></p>",

The hepatic metabolism of <strong>prilocaine</strong> generates <strong>O-toluidine</strong>, which oxidizes <strong>hemoglobin to methemoglobin. </strong>Methemoglobinemia risk is directly associated with the total dose administered, usually appearing when doses exceed 8 mg/kg.</p>\n<p>Pulse oximetry is used as an important assessment of oxygenation. It uses plethysmography and light absorbance measurements at two wavelengths to estimate oxygen saturation. It is<strong> inaccurate when more than two types of hemoglobin are present</strong>. This is because abnormal hemoglobin (<strong>methemoglobin) is not picked up by pulse oximetry</strong>. Pulse oximetry data (SpO2) should therefore be used with caution in patients with methemoglobinemia.

REM sleep is characterized by a high level of brain activity.&nbsp;REM sleep refers to rapid, roving eye movements that occur during this stage of sleep and are recorded as an electrooculogram (EOG). The EEG in REM sleep shows rapid, low-voltage activity with <strong>sawtooth waves</strong> and a <strong>pontogeniculo-occipital spike</strong>, which refers to large phasic potentials originating in the cholinergic neurons of the pons and passing rapidly to the lateral geniculate body and then to the occipital cortex.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During<strong> REM sleep</strong>, except for eye movement, there is almost a <strong>complete loss of skeletal muscle ton</strong>e. The threshold for arousal from sleep by sensory stimuli is increased during this time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NREM sleep is composed of stages 1 through 4. About 90 minutes after sleep onset, NREM yields to the first REM episode of the night. Non-REM sleep is divided into four stages:</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong>: The transition from wakefulness to sleep. EEG shows a low-voltage, <strong>mixed frequency</strong> pattern. A <strong>theta rhythm</strong> (4&ndash;7 Hz) is seen during this stage with <strong>vertex sharp waves</strong>. There are slow eye movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong>: Presence of sinusoidal waves called <strong>sleep spindles</strong> (7&ndash;15 Hz) and <strong>K complexes</strong> which are negative sharp waves followed by a positive slow wave. There are no eye movements, muscle tone is reduced. (image 2)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong>: Presence of a <strong>high-amplitude delta rhythm</strong> (0.5&ndash;4 Hz). There is a further reduction in muscle tone and arousal, no eye movements. (image 3)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong>: A characteristic pattern of <strong>rhythmic slow waves</strong>, sometimes referred to as slow-wave sleep.

This results in anomalous drainage of pulmonary venous blood flow into the systemic venous circulation. It is a cyanotic heart disease with features of congestive heart failure. The patients are irritable and have failure to thrive. </p>\n<p>The following types are seen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Supracardiac</strong> <strong>(most common)</strong>: Common pulmonary vein drains into the superior vena cava or the left innominate vein.</li>\n<li><strong>Cardiac:</strong> Pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium or coronary sinus.</li>\n<li><strong>Infracardiac </strong>(always obstructive and most dangerous): Pulmonary veins drain into the portal vein or inferior vena cava.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Snowman appearance is classically seen in<strong> supracardiac variant</strong> of TAPVC.

      "solution": "<p>The appearance of the above clinical features after the initiation of<strong> fruit juice</strong> (rich in fructose) suggests a<strong> disorder of fructose metabolism</strong>. <strong>Seliwanoff's reagent</strong> gives a positive reaction in this condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI)</strong> is due to a <strong>deficiency </strong>of the enzyme<strong> aldolase</strong> <strong>B</strong>. It is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> inborn error of metabolism. Defective aldolase B causes the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. This will inhibit glycogen phosphorylase and cause glycogen accumulation in the liver and associated hypoglycemia.</p>\n<p>Symptoms occur when sucrose (fructose+glucose) is introduced into the diet of infants, usually around 6 months of age. Patients will present with vomiting, loss of appetite, and failure to thrive. Hepatomegaly and <strong>jaundice</strong> may occur. If liver damage progresses, death will occur. </p>\n<p>Fructose is also excreted in the urine. This gives a positive reducing sugar test (<strong>Benedict's test</strong>), a positive test for <strong>furfural derivatives</strong>, and specifically a positive <strong>Seliwanoff's test </strong>(for fructose).<strong> </strong>Withdrawal of fructose from the diet will immediately relieve the symptoms</p>\n<p><strong>Seliwanoff's test</strong> will <strong>distinguish glucose</strong> and <strong>fructose</strong>. The reagent is resorcinol in HCl. 3 ml of the reagent and 0.5 ml of urine are heated for 30 seconds up to a boiling point. A red color indicates the presence of fructose.</p>\n<p><strong>Benedict's test </strong>detects the excretion of<strong> reducing substances </strong>in the urine. About 0.5 ml of urine is boiled with 5 ml of Benedict's reagent for 2 minutes. The formation of a precipitate is observed on cooling. The test is semi-quantitative and the color of the precipitate roughly parallels the concentration of reducing sugar. The blue color indicates the absence of sugar in the urine. The green precipitate means 0.5%, yellow (1%), orange (1.5%) and red indicates 2% or more sugar (1% means 1 g per 100 ml). </p>\n<p><strong>Furfural test: Monosaccharides</strong> when treated with concentrated sulphuric acid undergo dehydration with the removal of 3 molecules of water. Hexoses give hydroxymethylfurfural and pentoses give furfural. The furfural derivative can condense with phenolic compounds to give colored products. This forms the basis of the <strong>Molisch test</strong>.

In displacement, the conflict or emotions are <strong>displaced</strong> from the actual cause to a less threatening, irrel­evant <strong>object or situation</strong>. </p>\n<p>The primary source of the conflict may have a <strong>direct associative connec­tion</strong> with the phobic object or situation that <strong>symbolizes</strong> it. This object is something the <strong>person can avoid</strong> and this protects the person from the anxiety attached to the original object or idea, which is the defense mechanism of <strong>symbolization</strong>.</p>\n<p>The phobic situation or the object is usually something that the person can <strong>avoid</strong>. With the defense mechanism of avoidance, the person can escape the anxiety associated with it. </p>\n<p><strong>Behavioral therapy</strong> is the most effective treatment for phobias. Insight-oriented therapy, virtual therapy, and exposure therapy are also used for the treatment of phobic disorders and specific phobias. <strong>β-receptor blockers</strong> can be used for the treatment of specific phobias, particularly if it is associated with panic attacks. <strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> can also be used but the chronic nature of the disease limits its effect. <strong>Paroxetine</strong> and <strong>sertraline</strong> can be used to manage <strong>social anxiety</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Dissociation</strong> is the<strong> splitting</strong> of mental contents in clusters from conscious awareness. This allows the individual to support two contradictory truths while not being aware of them. An extreme manifestation of this mechanism is seen in dissociative identity disorder. </p>\n<p><strong>Reaction formation</strong> is an unconscious defense mechanism in which the person develops a wish or impulse that is a <strong>direct antithesis</strong> to the ones that are harbored consciously or unconsciously. It develops against impulses that are unacceptable to the ego.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Defense mechanisms that operate in various diseases</h3><ul>\n<li><strong>OCD</strong> - reaction formation,

When patients' chances of PE are high, the patient should be assessed for D-dimer levels. Normal levels of D-dimer rule out the possibility of PE. <strong>If </strong>the <strong>D-dimer</strong> levels are <strong>elevated,</strong> then the <strong>chances of pulmonary embolism </strong>are very <strong>high </strong>and the <strong>patient should undergo imaging</strong> to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>CT of the chest</strong> with <strong>intravenous contrast</strong> is the <strong>principal imaging test</strong> for the diagnosis of PE. It can provide exquisite detail, with &le;1 mm of resolution during a short breath-hold. It also helps to visualize the chambers of the heart. In patients who do not have a pulmonary embolism, it can also help in identifying alternative diagnoses like emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary mass, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Because of the invasive nature of pulmonary angiography (option B) and availability of chest CT scans, it is not commonly used in the diagnosis of PE. It is reserved for patients with technically unsatisfactory chest CTs and for those for whom an interventional procedure such as catheter-directed thrombolysis is planned.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lung scanning</strong> has become a <strong>second-line</strong> diagnostic test for PE, in patients who cannot tolerate intravenous contrast. Small particulate aggregates of albumin labeled with a gamma-emitting radionuclide are injected intravenously and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed. The perfusion scan defect indicates absent or decreased blood flow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>MR pulmonary angiography</strong> is a reliable test to identify deep vein thrombosis. It may detect large proximal PE, but is not reliable for smaller segmental and subsegmental PE.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most patients with PE have a normal echocardiogram (option D).
