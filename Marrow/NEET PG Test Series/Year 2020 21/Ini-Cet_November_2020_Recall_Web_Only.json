The adding together of individual twitch contractions to increase the intensity of overall muscle contraction is <strong>Summation. </strong>Summation occurs in two ways:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">by increasing the number of motor units contracting simultaneously, which is <strong>multiple ﬁber summations.</strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\">by increasing the frequency of contraction, which is called frequency<strong> summation and can lead to tetanization.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">When the frequency of a contraction reaches a critical level, the successive contractions eventually fuse together, and the whole muscle contraction appears to be completely smooth and continuous, this is called<strong> tetanization. </strong>Beyond this point, a further increase in the frequency, will not result in increased force of contraction.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tetanization </strong>occurs in two ways:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Complete tetanus </strong>occurs when no relaxation occurs between stimuli.</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Incomplete tetanus </strong>when periods of incomplete relaxation take place between the summated stimuli.</li>\n</ul>",

Rabies virus is a bullet-shaped rhabdovirus containing ssRNA. It spreads to humans by bites or contact with the saliva of rabid animals (bats, dogs, cats). Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually <strong>100</strong>% <strong>fatal. </strong>The disease can be divided into 3 phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prodromal </strong>phase: It lasts 2-10 days. Patients present with malaise, headache, photophobia, vomiting, and fever.  They may also have parasthesias, pain or pruritus near the site of exposure. </li>\n<li><strong>Acute neurologic </strong>phase: It lasts 2-7 days. In the more common <strong>encephalitic</strong> rabies, <strong>Hydrophobia </strong>(fear of water) or aerophobia (fear of breeze) can be seen. Swallowing liquids precipitates<strong> painful spasms </strong>of the <strong>throat muscles</strong>. Patients may also have nervousness, hallucinations, excessive lacrimation, salivation, perspiration and pupillary dilation. Convulsive seizures may occur</li>\n<li><strong>Coma </strong>and <strong>death </strong>(due to cardiorespiratory arrest)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In about 20% of patients, <strong>paralytic rabies</strong> is seen. Flaccid muscle weakness is seen, which progresses to quadriparesis and facial palsy.  </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In rabid animals, the virus depicts two modes of spread:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Centripetal</strong> spread: The virus enters the <strong>peripheral</strong> neurons. It moves via <strong>retrograde fast axonal transport</strong> towards the spinal cord or brainstem a.k.a the central nervous system <strong>(CNS) </strong>at a speed of up to 250 mm/day. Once<strong> </strong>within the CNS, it spreads quickly to other regions in the CNS through <strong>fast axonal transport</strong>. It infects neurons primarily, but may rarely infect astrocytes.</li>\n<li><strong>Centrifugal</strong> spread: After <strong>CNS</strong><span> infection is established, it spreads along the </span><strong>sensory</strong><span> and </span><strong>autonomic nerves</strong><span> to salivary glands, adrenal glands, skin </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rabies virus <strong>replicates</strong> in <strong>acinar cells</strong> of the <strong>salivary glands</strong> and is secreted in the saliva of rabid animals that serve as <strong>vectors.</strong></p>",

The pain is typically in the&nbsp;<strong>central abdomen</strong>&nbsp;and out of proportion to the physical findings.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Associated clinical features include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, peritonitis, and the passage of bloody stools.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>gold standard</strong>&nbsp;for the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia is&nbsp;<strong>angiography</strong>, and management is&nbsp;<strong>laparotomy</strong>.&nbsp;The goal of operative exploration is to&nbsp;<strong>resect the compromised bowel</strong>&nbsp;and restore blood supply via&nbsp;<strong>embolectomy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: A <strong>pulsatile abdominal mass</strong> is seen in the case of an <strong>abdominal aortic aneurysm</strong>.&nbsp;Acute pain and hypotension occur with rupture of the aneurysm, which requires an emergency operation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Options A and D: Acute severe <strong>pancreatitis</strong> and <strong>peptic ulcer perforation</strong> have no association with atrial fibrillation. They usually present with pain over the upper abdomen associated with <strong>guarding</strong> and <strong>rigidity</strong> on examination.</p>",

Most scanners now have color coding, which allows detailed visualization of blood flow in a vessel. Different colors indicate changes in the direction and velocity of flow, with areas of high flow usually indicating stenotic lesions.</p>\n<p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A: CT<strong>&nbsp;Angiography</strong>&nbsp;(CTA) is more useful in the evaluation of visceral arterial disease (eg. mesenteric ischemia). It can be beneficial in peripheral artery diseases where a duplex scan shows <strong>poor images</strong> (<strong>aortoiliac segment involvement</strong>). CTA is not routinely recommended in peripheral artery disease because of concomitant renal dysfunction in these patients which can lead to <strong>contrast-induced nephropathy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B: MR<strong> Angiography&nbsp;</strong>is time-consuming and expensive, hence not done as the next investigation. It is contraindicated in patients with claustrophobia and metallic implants.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C: Digital<strong> subtraction angiography (DSA)</strong> is an invasive and expensive procedure&nbsp;compared to other investigations. The benefits of DSA are that it provides dynamic arterial flow information and can be combined with a definitive endovascular intervention when indicated. DSA is indicated only when there is a discrepancy in diagnosis or intervention is planned. Complications associated with DSA include bleeding, hematoma, false aneurysm formation, thrombosis, arterial dissection, distal embolisation, renal dysfunction, and allergic reaction.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b9eeaaa4201840cc8835d1ba1bddd443x512x480.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
