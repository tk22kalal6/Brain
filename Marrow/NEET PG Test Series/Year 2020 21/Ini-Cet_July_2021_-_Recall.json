      "solution": "<p><strong>Downregulation of CYP2C19</strong> is responsible for the failure of clopidogrel in this patient.</p>\n<p>Clopidogrel is a <strong>prodrug</strong> and its metabolic activation occurs in the liver. It is <strong>bioactivated by the CYP2C19</strong> enzyme. If there is downregulation of this enzyme it will cause a decrease in the efficacy of clopidogrel and can lead to thrombotic events like stroke. Drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 can also decrease the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. <strong>Proton-pump inhibitors</strong> may cause <strong>inhibition of CYP2C19</strong> and when they are given in combination there would be a decrease in the efficacy of clopidogrel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Therapeutic uses</strong>: Clopidogrel is used to reduce the rate of stroke and myocardial infarction. It also decreases the rate of deaths in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke. Other uses are acute coronary syndrome and peripheral arterial disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Adverse effects</strong>: Increased <strong>risk of bleeding</strong> especially when given with an anticoagulant or aspirin. Rarely thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can occur.</p>\n<p><strong>CYP2C19</strong>: Common drugs that are metabolized include omeprazole, phenytoin, diazepam, and propanolol. Inducers of the CYP2C subfamily are rifampicin and carbamazepine. Omeprazole is an inhibitor.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>CYP2D6</strong>: Drugs metabolized include SSRIs,&nbsp; tricyclic antidepressants, antiarrhythmic drugs, beta-blockers, and opiates. It is <strong>inhibited by quinidine</strong> and it will prevent the formation of morphine from codeine. Hence quinidine decreases the analgesic effect of codeine.</p>\n<p><strong>CYP1A1/2</strong>: It metabolizes few drugs like theophylline, paracetamol, caffeine and carbamazepine. It plays an important role in the <strong>activation of procarcinogens.</strong> Inducers are rifampicin, carbamazepine, polycyclic hydrocarbons, charbroiled meat, and cigarette smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>CYP2E1</strong>: It is involved in the oxidation of alcohol, halothane, and minor metabolism of other drugs. It is important to note that it is involved in the formation of hepatotoxic<strong>&nbsp;N-acetyl benzoquinone imine</strong> from <strong>paracetamol.</strong> Chronic alcoholism is responsible for the induction of this enzyme.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification of anti-platelet drugs</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Class</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Drugs</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Cyclooxygenase- I inhibitors</span></td>\n<td><span>Aspirin</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Irreversible P2Y<sub>12&nbsp;</sub>inhibitors</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Ticlopidine, Clopidogrel, Prasugrel</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Reversible P2Y<sub>12&nbsp;</sub>inhibitors</span></td>\n<td><span>Ticagrelor, Cangrelor</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors</span></td>\n<td><span>Abciximab, Eptifibatide, Tirofiban</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Thrombin (PAR-1) receptor antagonist</span></td>\n<td><span>Vorapaxar&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Phosphodiesterase inhibitors</span></td>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span>Dipyridamole</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Therefore, in a population with a <strong>high</strong> prevalence of the disease, a positive result with a highly sensitive test means true positive.

It is believed that <em><strong>in vivo</strong>, </em><strong>factor VIIa/tissue factor complex</strong> is the most important activator of <strong>factor IX</strong> and that <strong>factor IXa/factor VIIIa complex</strong> is the most important activator of <strong>factor X.</strong> </p>\n<p>Tissue factor is expressed on the surfaces of the subendothelial cellular components of the vessel wall, such as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. This tissue factor is exposed to blood when there is a vascular damage.

<strong>VIIa</strong></li>\n<li>This complex then activates factor <strong>IX</strong> to factor <strong>IXa</strong></li>\n<li>Factor <strong>IXa</strong> then activates factor <strong>X</strong> to

factor <strong>IXa</strong> (with factor VIIIa as cofactor)</li>\n<li>Factor <strong>Xa</strong> then converts <strong>prothrombin to thrombin</strong>, which is the pivotal protease of the

This pain responds poorly to analgesics.&nbsp;<strong>Anticonvulsants</strong>&nbsp;such as carbamazepine or gabapentin or&nbsp;<strong>tricyclic antidepressants</strong>&nbsp;may be beneficial.</p>\n<p>Other markings:</p>\n<p>A: Caudate nucleus</p>\n<p>C: Substantia nigra</p>\n<p>D: Pons</p>\n<p>The image below shows the coronal section of the brain with different parts of the basal ganglia:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8e0699fb45d84bdbb1b76f69e1165c1ax1280x1156.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/95bc3bab79dc4bff83c7593a6838bf51x600x577.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Thalamus and its connections</h3><div>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Nuclei</td>\n<td>Input</td>\n<td>Output</td>\n<td>Function</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anterior&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Mamillothalamic tract, cingulate gyrus, hypothalamus</p>\n</td>\n<td>Cingulate gyrus, hypothalamus</td>\n<td>Regulation of alertness and attention, acquisition of memory</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dorsomedial</td>\n<td>\n<p>Prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, other thalamic nuclei</p>\n</td>\n<td>Prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, other thalamic nuclei</td>\n<td>Integration of somatic, visceral, and olfactory information and relation to emotional feelings and subjective states</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lateral dorsal, lateral posterior and pulvinar</td>\n<td>Cerebral cortex and other thalamic nuclei&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Cerebral cortex and other thalamic nuclei</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Unknown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ventral postero lateral</td>\n<td>\n<p>Medial lemniscus</p>\n<p>spinothlamic pathway</p>\n</td>\n<td>Primary somatosensory area cortex</td>\n<td>Relays common sensations to consciousness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ventral posteromedial</td>\n<td>\n<p>Gustatory</p>\n<p>Trigeminal</p>\n</td>\n<td>Primary somatosensory area cortex</td>\n<td>Relays common sensations to consciousness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ventral anterior</td>\n<td>Reticular formation, substantia nigra, corpus striatum, premotor cortex, other thalamic nuclei</td>\n<td>Reticular formation, substantia nigra, corpus striatum, premotor cortex, other thalamic nuclei</td>\n<td>Influences activity of motor cortex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ventral lateral</td>\n<td>Cerebellum, reticular formation, substantia nigra, corpus striatum, premotor cortex, other thalamic nuclei</td>\n<td>Cerebellum, reticular formation, substantia nigra, corpus striatum, premotor cortex, other thalamic nuclei</td>\n<td>Influences activity of motor cortex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intralaminar</td>\n<td>Reticular formation, spinothalamic and trigeminothalamic tracts</td>\n<td>To cerebral cortex via other thalamic nuclei and corpus striatum</td>\n<td>Influences level of consciousness and alertness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Midline</td>\n<td>Reticular formation</td>\n<td>Unknown</td>\n<td>Unknown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reticular</td>\n<td>Cerebral cortex, reticular formation</td>\n<td>Other thalamic nuclei</td>\n<td>Cerebral cortex regulating thalamus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medial geniculate body</td>\n<td>Inferior colliculus, lateral lemniscus from the predominantly opposite ear</td>\n<td>Auditory radiation to superior temporal gyrus</td>\n<td>Hearing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lateral geniculate body</td>\n<td>Optic tract</td>\n<td>Optic radiation to the visual cortex of occipital lobe</td>\n<td>Visual information from the opposite field of vision</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n&nbsp;</div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Divisions of thalamus</h3><p><strong>Three major divisions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anterior nuclear group</li>\n<li>Medial nuclear group</li>\n<li>Lateral nuclear group</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2425864f3b5246a29517d34dcb964bb4x1280x2636.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

Then, a small incision is made in the umbilicus, and insufflation is performed using a Veress needle. When introducing the Veress needle, two distinct pops can be felt as the needle pierces the abdominal wall fascia first and then the peritoneum. The umbilicus is the preferred location for introducing a Veress needle because the abdominal wall is thinner at this site.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d3c2de52d3514c9bb9ea0d35ef266a69x572x362.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Laparoscopic surgeries can be performed under general anesthesia or local anesthesia; although, general anesthesia is preferred. Carbon dioxide gas is usually used for insufflation, and the maximum pressure is typically in the range of 14-15 mm Hg. However, if the procedure is done under local anesthesia, nitrous oxide is used. Insufflation with nitrous oxide is stopped at a pressure of 10 mmHg or when 2L of gas has been insufflated.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct peritoneal access technique</strong> <strong>(Hasson technique)</strong>: The surgeon makes a small umbilical incision and gains access to the peritoneal cavity under direct vision by dissecting through the abdominal fascia and peritoneum. It is preferred in patients who have undergone previous abdominal operations where the small bowel may be adherent to the undersurface of the abdominal wound.</p>",

The major families of proteins involved in adhesion and migration are <strong>selectins</strong> and <strong>integrins</strong> and their ligands.</li>\n<li><strong>Adhesions</strong>: The weak rolling interactions slow down the leucocytes and allow them to bind more firmly to the endothelium. <strong>Chemokines</strong> that were produced at the site of injury bind to the endothelial cell proteoglycans. These chemokines then bind to the rolling leucocytes and activate them. This, in turn, converts the ligands for β1 and β2 integrins, <strong>VLA-4,</strong> and <strong>LFA-1 </strong>present on the leucocytes to a <strong>high-affinity state</strong>.</li>\n<li>This combination of cytokine-induced expression of integrin ligands on the endothelium and increased integrin affinity on the leucocytes leads to firm <strong>adhesion</strong> of leucocytes to the endothelium at the site of inflammation.</li>\n<li>Leucocyte<strong> migration</strong>: This is the movement of leucocytes through the intact endothelium, called transmigration or diapedesis. This occurs in postcapillary venules. This migration occurs through the inter-endothelial gap towards the chemical concentration gradient created by the chemokines at the site of injury. This occurs with the help of adhesion molecules present in the intercellular junctions such as <strong>platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule</strong> (<strong>PECAM-1</strong>) or <strong>CD31</strong>. </li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/13f6cf1070f84ca2831df8bddc1eb8ecx1280x1743.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Principal Mediators of Inflammation and Their Source</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mediator</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Source</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Histamine</td>\n<td>Mast&ensp;cells,&ensp;basophils,&ensp;platelets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prostaglandins</td>\n<td>Mast&ensp;cells,&ensp;leukocytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leukotrienes</td>\n<td>Mast&ensp;cells,&ensp;leukocytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cytokines&ensp;(TNF,&ensp;IL-1,&ensp;IL-6)</td>\n<td>Macrophages,&ensp;endothelial&ensp;cells, mast&ensp;cells</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chemokines</td>\n<td>Leukocytes,&ensp;activated&ensp;macrophages</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platelet-activating&ensp;factor</td>\n<td>Leukocytes,&ensp;mast&ensp;cells</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complement</td>\n<td>Plasma&ensp;(produced&ensp;in&ensp;liver)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kinins</td>\n<td>Plasma&ensp;(produced&ensp;in&ensp;liver)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Various actions of Principal Mediators of Inflammation</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Histamine</td>\n<td>Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, endothelial activation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prostaglandins</td>\n<td>Vasodilation, pain, fever</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leukotrienes</td>\n<td>Increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis, leukocyte adhesion, and activation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cytokines (TNF, IL-1, IL-6)</td>\n<td>\n<p>Local: endothelial activation (expression of adhesion molecules).</p>\n<p>Systemic: fever, metabolic abnormalities, hypotension (shock)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chemokines</td>\n<td>Chemotaxis, leukocyte activation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platelet-activating factor</td>\n<td>Vasoconstriction, Vasodilation (at low concentration), increased vascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion, chemotaxis, degranulation, oxidative burst</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complement</td>\n<td>Leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, direct target killing (membrane attack complex), vasodilation (mast cell stimulation)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kinins</td>\n<td>Increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, vasodilation, pain</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>Note: Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is a prostaglandin, which is a potent <strong>vasoconstrictor</strong></p>",

Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) with XY karyotype may have mostly female external sexual characteristics.

(Uterus and cervix present)</li>\n<li>Female external genitalia</li>\n<li>Presence of dysgenetic testes that cannot produce AMH or sex hormones.

It is characterized by rapid progression of pain and swelling in an extremity, commonly precipitated by <strong>traumatic injury</strong>. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the <strong>5 P's</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pain:</strong> Pain is the <strong>first symptom</strong> of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle groups have an increased sensitivity to touch. On <strong>passive stretching</strong> of the muscles, <strong>severe pain</strong> can be elicited. </li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paresthesia: </strong>Paresthesia and hypoesthesia are the <strong>first signs</strong> of ischemia and may be noted due to compression of nerves traversing the affected compartment.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pallor: </strong>Pallor of the skin may not always be seen as ischemia occurs at the capillary level <strong>(late sign).</strong></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paralysis:</strong> Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment <strong>(late sign</strong>).</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pulselessness: </strong>The absence of distal pulses<strong> (extremely late sign).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prompt decompression of the affected compartment is done.</li>\n<li>All the dressings, bandages, and cast on the affected limb are removed and the limb is nursed flat.</li>\n<li><strong>Fasciotomy</strong> is done if the differential pressure is less than 30 mm Hg</li>\n<li>Fasciotomy wounds are left open and after 2 days if there is necrosis debridement is done.

The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (ΔP). If the <strong>differential pressure (ΔP)</strong> is <strong>less than 30 mm Hg</strong> (4.00 kilopascals), <strong>immediate compartment decompression </strong>is indicated.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Acute Compartment and Crush Syndromes</h3><p><strong>1. Acute Compartment Syndrome</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Acute compartment syndrome is an elevation of the intracompartmental pressure (ICP) which increases the risk for tissue ischemia and necrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Fractures (70%) and severe soft tissue injuries (30%). Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. </p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. </p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Crush Syndrome </strong></p>\n<p>Crush syndrome is the systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis. It is commonly caused due to prolonged external compression of an extremity. </p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Crush injuries sustained during motor vehicle accidents, earthquakes, mining and other occupational accidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Underperfusion of muscle causes myonecrosis. When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",

The larger peptide diffuses to terminals of neurons and migrates by the <strong>retrograde axonal transport</strong> system to the spinal cord and brainstem. It diffuses to the <strong>glycinergic</strong> interneurons and <strong>GABA</strong> secreting neurons there.

Muscle spasms usually involve the area of injury first and then the muscles of the jaw causing <strong>trismus</strong> or lockjaw.

      "solution": "<p>Vancomycin acts on <strong>step 4</strong>&nbsp;in the given image.</p>\n<p>Mechanism of action of vancomycin: It is a <strong>cell wall synthesis inhibitor</strong>. It binds to the <strong>D-Ala-D-Ala terminus</strong> of the newly formed peptidoglycan pentapeptide and <strong>inhibits the&nbsp;transglycosylase</strong> enzyme. This would <strong>prevent further elongation</strong> of <strong>the peptidoglycan</strong> and its cross-linking.</p>\n<p>Vancomycin is a bactericidal agent for <strong>gram-positive</strong> organisms. It is also active against many gram-positive anaerobes like <strong>Clostridium difficile</strong>.&nbsp;Resistance against vancomycin in enterococci is due to the alternation in its binding site where D-Ala is replaced by D-Lactate.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical uses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parenteral vancomycin is given for bloodstream infections and <strong>endocarditis caused by MRSA</strong>.</li>\n<li>Vancomycin plus gentamicin is given as an alternative regimen for enterococcal endocarditis with penicillin allergy.</li>\n<li>In combination with other agents for suspected meningitis or <strong>meningitis due to penicillin-resistant pneumococcus</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Oral vancomycin</strong> is given for <strong>Clostridium difficile colitis.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adverse effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Injection site phlebitis</li>\n<li>Nephrotoxicity</li>\n<li><strong>\"Redman\" syndrome</strong> due to histamine release following infusion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Fosfomycin</strong> inhibits <strong>step 1</strong> in the image. It acts at a very early stage in cell wall synthesis and inhibits the cytoplasmic enzyme<strong>&nbsp;enol pyruvate transferase</strong>. This would block the&nbsp;addition of phosphoenolpyruvate to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. This <strong>prevents the formation of&nbsp;UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid</strong> which is the precursor&nbsp;N-acetylmuramic acid. N-acetylmuramic acid is a component of the bacterial cell wall and hence cell wall synthesis is inhibited.</p>\n<p><strong>Cycloserine</strong> inhibits <strong>step 2</strong> in the image. It is a structural analog of D-alanine and inhibits the enzymes <strong>alanine racemase</strong> that&nbsp;converts L-alanine to D-alanine and <strong>d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase</strong>. This would thereby inhibit the incorporation of D-alanine into the peptidoglycan pentapeptide. It is mainly used in the management of tuberculosis where there is resistance to the first-line agents.</p>\n<p><strong>Bacitracin</strong> inhibits <strong>step 3</strong> in the image. It is a cell wall synthesis inhibitor that interferes with&nbsp;<strong>dephosphorylation</strong> in the cycling of the <strong>lipid carrier</strong> which transfers&nbsp;peptidoglycan subunits to the growing cell wall. It is only given for topical application because of its severe nephrotoxicity when given systemically.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p><strong>Beta-lactam</strong> antibiotics prevent cross-linking by inhibiting the<strong> transpeptidases</strong>.

The primary function of miRNA is to modulate the translation of target mRNAs into their corresponding proteins. After the target RNA is transcribed from its gene (post-transcriptional), the miRNA may either induce mRNA cleavage or repress its translation. This is referred to as post-transcriptional&nbsp;<strong>gene silencing or RNA interference.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RNA interference(RNAi)</strong> is a biological process in which <strong>miRNA or siRNA</strong> molecules inhibit gene expression by neutralizing targeted mRNAs.The&nbsp;microRNA&nbsp;(miRNA) belongs to a group of&nbsp;non-coding genes.&nbsp;The miRNA genes are transcribed but not translated into proteins. They play a role in the regulation of the expression of the target gene by&nbsp;post-transcriptional&nbsp;silencing.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>&nbsp;<strong>gene</strong>&nbsp;present in the nucleus is transcribed to&nbsp;<strong>primary</strong>&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>, which is further converted to&nbsp;<strong>pre-miRNA</strong>&nbsp;by an enzyme<strong>&nbsp;DROSHA&nbsp;</strong>intranuclearly and exported to the cytoplasm by an export protein called <strong>Exportin 5</strong>.</li>\n<li>The pre-miRNA undergoes trimming, by an enzyme called&nbsp;<strong>DICER</strong>, into&nbsp;<strong>mature</strong>&nbsp;<strong>single-stranded</strong>&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>.</li>\n<li>The mature miRNA is associated with a multiprotein aggregate called&nbsp;<strong>RNA-induced silencing complex</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>RISC</strong>).</li>\n<li>The target mRNAs contain seed sequences in their&nbsp;<strong>3&prime; untranslated region (UTR)&nbsp;</strong>that determines the specificity of miRNA binding and gene silencing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the base pairing between the miRNA strand and its target mRNA, the RISC causes gene silencing either by&nbsp;<strong>mRNA</strong>&nbsp;<strong>cleavage&nbsp;</strong>(degradation or deadenylation)&nbsp;or by&nbsp;<strong>repressing its translation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>siRNA </strong>is<strong> similar </strong>in function to miRNA and is used in <strong>RNA interference.</strong></p>\n<p>miRNA expression has been found to be dysregulated in many cancers. Such misregulation is thought to have a causal role in the pathogenesis of such cancers. Some types of miRNAs are oncogenic (referred to as oncomiRs) and are overexpressed in cancerous tissue. On the other hand, tumor-suppressive miRNAs that counteract oncogenic characteristics are found to be underexpressed in cancers.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/55bd04b204964e28a346d5edb9dda58ex1280x1391.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

In larger outbreaks, other viruses such as enterovirus 71, coxsackie A viruses 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and coxsackie B viruses 2 and 5 can also cause the disease.</p>\n<p>HFMD typically presents as a mild illness with <strong>vesicular lesions</strong> on the <strong>tongue,</strong> posterior pharynx, <strong>buccal mucosa, palate,</strong> and <strong>lips.</strong> Lesions may also appear on the <strong>hands,</strong> fingers, buttocks, and <strong>groin,</strong> with a higher prevalence on the hands. These vesicles usually resolve within a week.</p>\n<p>Infections with <strong>enterovirus 71</strong> can be more <strong>severe</strong> with <strong>neurological</strong> and <strong>cardiopulmonary</strong> manifestations. Coxsackievirus A16 infections occasionally lead to complications such as encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, pericarditis, and shock. Coxsackievirus A6 can cause a severe and atypical form of HFMD.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosing</strong> HFMD typically relies on <strong>clinical</strong> examination of the characteristic lesions. <strong>Confirmatory</strong> testing can involve <strong>viral culture</strong> using samples such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, and mucosal swabs. However, <strong>RT-PCR</strong> testing is more <strong>sensitive</strong> and <strong>specific</strong> for detecting the viral genome even when cultures are negative.</p>\n<p>Treating HFMD involves mainly <strong>supportive</strong> care as there is no specific proven antiviral agent for enteroviruses. In cases of <strong>enterovirus 71</strong>-related cardiopulmonary disease, <strong>milrinone</strong> is suggested as an effective treatment. Immunoglobulins have been utilized to manage severe cases, although outcomes vary.</p>\n<p>Apart from HFMD, coxsackie A viruses can cause <strong>herpangina</strong>&nbsp;characterized by<strong> febrile vesicular pharyngitis</strong> with ulcerating small vesicles on the oral fauces, palate, uvula, and posterior pharyngeal wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>coxsackie B</strong> viruses can cause <strong>pleurodynia</strong> or <strong>Bornholm</strong> disease, myocarditis, and pericarditis in newborns, as well as orchitis and juvenile diabetes.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Herpes simplex virus</strong> <strong>(HSV)</strong> presents similarly with vesicular lesions but lacks typical herpetic signs.

It is associated with familial breast and ovarian carcinoma. BRCA1-associated breast cancers are commonly poorly differentiated.</p>\n<p>All breast cancers are separated into 3 major groups based on the expression of two proteins, ER and HER2 (also known as <strong>ERBB2</strong>).

Patients with <strong>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</strong> have an increased risk of <strong>sudden cardiac death</strong> from <strong>ventricular tachyarrhythmias</strong>. In fact, <strong>arrhythmias</strong> are the most important/<strong>most common cause of death</strong> in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p>\n<p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the most common causes of <strong>sudden,</strong> otherwise unexplained <strong>death</strong> in <strong>young athletes</strong>. HCM is characterized by reduced stroke volume due to impaired diastolic filling, which is a consequence of the massively hypertrophic left ventricle. There is a dynamic obstruction to the left ventricular outflow as the anterior mitral leaflet moves towards the ventricular septum during systole. This compromised cardiac output in combination with a secondary increase in pulmonary venous pressure is the reason for exertional dyspnea at times of increased oxygen demand.</p>\n<p>Major clinical problems in <strong>HCM</strong> are <strong>atrial fibrillation</strong>, <strong>stroke</strong>, intractable cardiac failure,&nbsp;<strong>ventricular arrhythmias</strong> and also <strong>sudden death</strong>. There is a harsh systolic ejection murmur caused by the ventricular outflow obstruction.&nbsp;Mutations causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are most commonly seen in the genes encoding <strong>&beta;-myosin heavy chain </strong>(MHC/MYH7)&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>myosin-binding protein C</strong> (MYBP-C).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>HCM is mostly an <strong>autosomal dominant disorder</strong>.

The remaining sutures are inserted in a continuous manner until the far end of the wound is reached.

An Aberdeen knot is used to secure the end of the suture.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4b94a68f08d746ba84a6a6797d990e7dx1280x1143.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Mattress sutures</strong> -&nbsp;They can be vertical or horizontal and are used to create either an eversion or inversion of the wound edges. The initial suture is inserted in the same way as an interrupted suture, but then, the needle either moves horizontally or vertically and traverses both edges of the wound once again, as seen in the image below. The main advantage of the mattress suture is that it produces an accurate approximation of wound edges, especially in settings where the edges are not easily approximated.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c64dc6b67f0448feb8760ebdd82f185ex1280x1238.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Subcuticular sutures:</strong> It is used for a better cosmetic appearance. It is also employed in situations where the edges of the wound are easily approximated. In this technique, small bites of the subcuticular tissues are taken on alternate sites of the wound, and then, they are gently pulled together. This causes an approximation of the wound edges without the risk of the cross-hatched markings of interrupted sutures.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/431e9713865d480bb365d5044894c535x1200x1196.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
