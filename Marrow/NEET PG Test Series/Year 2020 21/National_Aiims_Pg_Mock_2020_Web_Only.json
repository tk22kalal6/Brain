It accounts for both the mass and the shape of the protein. </span>Proteins with large and small stokes radii are applied to the top of a <strong>gel filtration column</strong>. On entering the column, the <strong>small proteins</strong> enter pores in the stationary phase matrix (included proteins). During the mobile phase flowing down the column, the <strong>large</strong> molecules <strong>lag</strong> behind, which get excluded (<strong>excluded proteins</strong>). Proteins thus emerge from a gel filtration column in <strong>descending order </strong>of their <strong>stokes radii</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Ion exchange chromatography </strong>separates proteins in inverse order of the strength of their interactions with the stationary phase and is based on <strong>charge-charge interactions</strong>. Proteins with a net positive charge at a given pH will tightly adhere to negatively charged beads called cation exchangers. Proteins with a net negative charge will adhere to positively charged beads called anion exchangers. Nonadherent proteins flow through the matrix and are washed away. <strong>HbA1c </strong>(Glycated hemoglobin) is <strong>best measured</strong> using <strong>ion exchange chromatography</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Affinity chromatography</strong> is based on the <strong>high selectivity</strong> displayed by most proteins for their <strong>ligands</strong>. The high selectivity of affinity chromatography is caused by allowing the <strong>desired molecule </strong>to<strong> interact</strong> with the <strong>stationary phase </strong>and <strong>remain bound </strong>within the column in order to facilitate its separation from the undesired material, which will not interact and elute first.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hydrophobic interaction Chromatography</strong> separates proteins based on their tendency to associate with a stationary phase matrix coated with hydrophobic groups. Proteins with exposed hydrophobic surfaces adhere to the matrix via hydrophobic bonds that are enhanced by employing a mobile phase of high ionic strength.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5207db85e6c84159ae8694c4c13b13fax1280x3443.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types of Chromatography</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Chromatography types</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Property used for separation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paper chromatography</td>\n<td>Based on <strong>polarity</strong>, <strong>Least polar</strong> moves <strong>faster</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thin layer chromatography</td>\n<td>Based on <strong>polarity</strong>, <strong>Least polar</strong> moves <strong>faster</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ion exchange chromatography</td>\n<td>Based on <strong>charge &ndash; charge</strong> interaction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Size exclusion chromatography</td>\n<td>Based on <strong>descending order</strong> of <strong>Stokes radius</strong> which is a function of <strong>molecular mass and shape</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Affinity chromatography</td>\n<td>Based on <strong>specific ligand binding</strong> behaviour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hydrophobic interaction chromatography</td>\n<td>Based on <strong>hydrophobic </strong>interaction</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Isolation is an important method to prevent the further spread of chickenpox as the <strong>secondary attack rates</strong> in household contacts are <strong>very high (up to 90%). </strong>The individual remains <strong>infective </strong>from approximately <strong>48 hours</strong> <strong>before</strong> the appearance of the <strong>rash</strong>, during the time of vesicle formation (4-5 days), and<strong> till</strong> the point where <strong>all the lesions have crusted over</strong>. </p>\n<p>Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the <strong>varicella-zoster virus (VZV)</strong>. It spreads via <strong>droplet infection</strong> during <strong>personal contact</strong> and enters through the respiratory system or the conjunctiva. The course of chickenpox can be divided into<strong> 2 stages</strong>-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pre-eruptive</strong> The pre-eruptive stage includes the fever and viral prodrome, which lasts for 2-3 days until the rash begins to appear</li>\n<li><strong>The eruptive stage </strong>begins with the appearance of the <strong>rash.</strong> It usually <strong>appears first </strong>on the <strong>trunk,</strong> followed by the limbs and face. The rash quickly goes through the <strong>various stages</strong> (<strong>pleomorphism)</strong>-<strong>macule, papule, vesicle</strong>, and finally <strong>scab</strong>. The <strong>vesicle stage</strong> has classically been said to have a <strong>\"dew-drop\" appearance.</strong> <strong>Complications</strong> such as cerebellar ataxia, pneumonia, and encephalitis are <strong>uncommon</strong> but can be seen in some adults and immunocompromised patients. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The usual <strong>control</strong> methods include <strong>notifying</strong> regarding a new case, <strong>isolation,</strong> and <strong>disinfection. </strong>Antiviral therapy like acyclovir can prevent systemic disease, especially in immunosuppressed patients.<strong> Exposed</strong> patients who are<strong> immunocompromised</strong> may receive the varicella-zoster immunoglobulin <strong>(VZIG), </strong>within<strong> 72 hours </strong>of<strong> exposure</strong> to a chickenpox patient. The immunoglobulin must be administered immediately as it has no effect once the disease is established. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Fever and malaise may subside during the eruptive (vesicle formation) stage, but the patient remains contagious at this point.</p>\n<p>Option B: It is unnecessary to isolate until all the lesions have disappeared because the patient is not at risk of transmitting the virus once the lesions have crusted.</p>\n<p>Option C: Acyclovir is recommended in adults and children if started within 24 hours of disease onset. However, in some patients with mild illness, conservative management is sufficient.  Regardless of the treatment taken, patients are recommended to follow the same isolation guidelines.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Periods of Isolation for Selected Diseases</h3><p><strong class=\"ng-binding\"> Periods of Isolation for Selected Diseases</strong></p>\n<div class=\"panel-body ng-scope\">\n<p class=\"ng-binding ng-scope\"> </p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Duration of Isolation</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Chickenpox</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Until all lesions are crusted – usually about 6 days after onset of rash.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Measles</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>From the onset of symptoms (catarrhal stage) to 5 days after the appearance of the rash</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Cholera</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Until 3 days of tetracycline therapy.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Diphtheria </p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Until 48 hours of antibiotics.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Shigellosis and salmonellosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Until 3 consecutive negative stool cultures.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hepatitis A</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>3 weeks.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Influenza</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>3 days after onset.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Polio</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2 weeks in adult; 6 weeks in children.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tuberculosis (sputum +)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Until 3 weeks of effective chemotherapy.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Herpes zoster</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>6 days after onset of rash.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Mumps</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Until the swelling subsides.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Pertussis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>4 weeks or until paroxysms cease. </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Meningococcal meningitis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Until the first 24 hours of effective antibiotic therapy.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Streptococcal pharyngitis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Until the first 6 hours of effective antibiotic therapy.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p> </p>\n</div>",
