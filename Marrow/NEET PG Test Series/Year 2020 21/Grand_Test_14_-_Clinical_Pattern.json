Secondary peristalsis </strong>occurs if the <strong>primary peristaltic wave failed</strong> to empty the food from the esophagus into the stomach. Secondary peristalsis is initiated by the <strong>distension</strong> of the esophageal wall by the retained food. Waves continue until all the food is emptied into the stomach. Secondary peristaltic waves are initiated partly by<strong> intrinsic neural circuits</strong> in the <strong>myenteric nervous</strong> system <strong>and</strong> partly by<strong> reflexes that begin in the pharynx. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Control of peristaltic waves: </strong>The musculature of the pharyngeal wall and <strong>upper third of the esophagus</strong> is <strong>striated muscle.</strong> These regions are controlled by skeletal nerve impulses from the <strong>glossopharyngeal</strong> and <strong>vagus</strong> nerves.</p>\n<p>The musculature of the <strong>lower two-thirds</strong> of the esophagus is <strong>smooth muscle.</strong> This region is strongly controlled by the <strong>vagus</strong> nerves, which act through connections with the esophagal myenteric nervous system.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect of obliteration of vagal input to the esophagus</strong>: When the vagal nerves are cut, or the vagal input is obliterated by any other cause such as stroke, the <strong>primary peristalsis,</strong> solely dependent on the vagal innervation, is <strong>eliminated. </strong></p>\n<p>However, the <strong>intrinsic</strong> <strong>myenteric nerve plexus</strong> of the esophagus becomes excitable within days, causes strong <strong>secondary peristaltic waves</strong>. Therefore, even after paralysis of the brain stem swallowing reflex, food fed by a tube into the esophagus passes into the stomach due to the secondary peristaltic movements.</p>",

However, in severe cases, the lens may also dislocate into the anterior chamber or the vitreous. </p>\n<p>Other causes of ectopia lentis are as follows: </p>\n<p>Acquired: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trauma</li>\n<li>Pseudoexfoliation</li>\n<li>Inflammation</li>\n<li>Hypermature cataract</li>\n<li>Large eye due to myopia or buphthalmos</li>\n<li>Anterior uveal tumors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without systemic associations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familial ectopia lentis</li>\n<li>Ectopia lentis et pupillae</li>\n<li>Aniridia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With systemic associations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marfan syndrome</strong></li>\n<li>Homocystinuria - inferonasal</li>\n<li>Weill-Marchesani syndrome - inferior subluxation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other ocular manifestations of Marfan syndrome are glaucoma due to angle anomaly, lattice retinal degeneration and detachment, hypoplasia of the dilator pupillae. </p>\n<p>The most characteristic<strong> </strong>cardiac abnormality is <strong>aortic root dilation</strong>, which leads to regurgitation, aneurysmal dilation, and dissection, which is a cause of mortality. <strong>Mitral valve prolapse</strong> can also occur. There is also excessive linear growth of long bones leading to long extremities in proportion to the trunk.

Therefore, they do not react with anti-A, anti-B, and anti-AB antiserums, and get recognized as O blood group on cell typing.</p>\n<p>However, the O blood group has an H antigen. Thus if a patient with the Bombay blood group is transfused with the O blood group blood, the anti-H antibodies in the Bombay blood group patient react with the H antigen present in the O blood group.

This usually occurs as a result of vascular damage to <strong>Broca's motor speech area </strong>in the <strong>inferior frontal gyrus </strong>due to occlusion of the <strong>superior </strong>division of the<strong> middle cerebral artery (MCA).</strong></p>\n<p>A lesion in this region leads to motor/Broca's aphasia. Speech is <strong>non-fluent</strong> and interrupted by many word-finding pauses.

It occurs either secondary to brain injury or degeneration and involves the left cerebral hemisphere to a greater extent. Both written and spoken communication are affected. Audio-visual understanding is also deranged.</p>\n<p>There is difficulty in finding words, leading to poorly understood content for the listener. These patients also find it difficult to repeat sentences and name things properly. Aphasia is diagnosed in patients with deficits in the formal aspects of language, such as word-finding, word choice, comprehension, spelling, or grammar.</p>\n<p>Many specific aphasic syndromes have been reported. The most common are <strong>Broca, Wernicke, conduction</strong>, and <strong>global</strong> aphasias. Other are non-peri-sylvian aphasias that include anomic, transcortical motor, transcortical sensory, and mixed transcortical, sometimes called the isolation of the speech area

It is characterized by paralysis of neck flexors, muscles innervated by cranial nerves, proximal limb muscles, and respiratory muscles.</li>\n<li>Chronic&nbsp;toxicity -&nbsp;It is seen primarily in agricultural workers with daily exposure. It manifests as symmetrical sensorimotor axonopathy.</li>\n<li>Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy - Characterized by cognitive dysfunction, extrapyramidal symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy.

The fulminant type is characterized by death due to shock and peripheral vascular failure. The <strong>gastrointestinal</strong> type is a <strong>common</strong> form and is similar to food poisoning, akin to <strong>cholera</strong>. The narcotic form is characterized by giddiness, muscle tenderness, coma, and death.</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Strychnine</strong>(spinal poison)&nbsp;consumption is responsible for&nbsp;<strong>opisthotonus</strong>, <strong>emprosthotonus</strong>, and <strong>pleurosthotonus</strong>. These symptoms occur due to convulsions and muscle rigidity caused by action on the spinal reflex centres. <strong>Risus sardonicus</strong>, where the jaws and facial muscles are contracted and drawn back, may also occur.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Aconite</strong>(cardiac poison), if swallowed, causes tingling and numbness of the mouth, tongue, and pharynx. Salivation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea then follow, and subsequently, the patient would develop dry mouth, thirst, and dysphagia. Paresthesia, ataxia, slurred speech, and muscle twitching.

The best method of replacing the uterus has been described by <strong>O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>O&rsquo;Sullivan's method:</strong>&nbsp; Here the patient is anesthetized and a&nbsp;gallon of warm sterile water is used for irrigation into the vagina, using an irrigating can raised 3 to 4 feet&nbsp;above the level of the patient. After gently pushing the inverted uterine fundus back into the vagina, the nozzle of the irrigating cannula is inserted into the vagina, and the vaginal orifice is closed by the hands of the operator and an assistant. Around 3-5L of fluid may be required, and the inversion will be slowly corrected by the hydrostatic pressure. If this method fails, manual repositioning may be attempted under deep anesthesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Reposition of the uterus may be done by abdominal operation after trying manual and hydrostatic methods.</p><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Schultze method</td>\n<td>Duncan's method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Separation begins from the <strong>center of the placenta</strong> to the periphery.</td>\n<td>Separation <strong>begins from the periphery</strong> to the center.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blood does not escape externally, as the blood pours into the membrane sac.</td>\n<td>Blood escapes from the vagina as blood collects between the membranes and the uterine wall.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ffc20e2bcc9a4f38a9d1a120f41c6b24x1280x1593.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><span class=\"hvr\"><strong>Brandt Andrew's method</strong>&nbsp;is a maneuver of expressing the placenta from the uterus in the third stage of labor.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"hvr\">Here, the palmar surface of the left hand&nbsp;is placed on the mother's abdomen approximately at the junction of the upper and lower uterine segment (above the symphysis pubis) and the umbilical cord is grasped with other hand.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"hvr\">While the hand on the abdomen is pressed backward and slightly upward, the other applies gentle traction on the cord in a downward and backward direction holding the clamp until the placenta comes outside the introitus.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"hvr\">The procedure is used only when the&nbsp;<strong>uterus is hard and contracted</strong>.</span></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/10df8b0d425744f4bb6cba212363c922x1279x1597.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
