Success in day surgery requires each component of the pathway to be safe and efficient and to be performed in sequence. Unplanned overnight admissions are minimized by ensuring that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The patient is informed and fit for the procedure</li>\n<li>The procedure itself is achievable as a day case</li>\n<li>The procedure is scheduled early on the operating list to allow safe recovery and discharge</li>\n<li>The home environment can support a postoperative ambulatory patient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anesthetic considerations:</p>\n<p>The <strong>IV anesthetic</strong> of choice for daycare surgery is <strong>propofol</strong> due to its <strong>smooth induction</strong> and <strong>rapid recovery</strong>. The antiemetic action is also beneficial. <strong>Thiopental</strong> results in <strong>prolonged postoperative sedation</strong> and is not preferred in ambulatory anesthesia Benzodiazepines and ketamine are avoided for similar reasons.</p>\n<p>The <strong>inhalational anesthetic</strong> of choice for daycare surgery is <strong>sevoflurane</strong>. The low blood-gas partition coefficient, blood-brain coefficient, and minimal airway irritation of sevoflurane promote rapid induction and rapid recovery. Desflurane is also associated with faster recovery but its irritant effect on the upper airway with risk of laryngospasm prevents its use as an induction agent.</p>\n<p><strong>Rocuronium</strong> is an intermediate-acting muscle relaxant with a <strong>rapid onset</strong> which is used in <strong>daycare</strong> anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and provide surgical relaxation. Its actions can be terminated by the reversal agent<strong> sugammadex</strong> which produces a rapid and complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade.</p>\n<p><strong>Succinylcholine</strong> is the shortest-acting muscle relaxant but it has a high incidence of <strong>postoperative myalgia</strong>. So its use in daycare anesthesia is discouraged.</p>\n<p><strong>Analgesics: Paracetamol </strong>and other <strong>NSAIDs </strong>are preferred to manage pain in daycare procedures since opioids increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). However, short-acting opioids like <strong>remifentanil</strong> can be used if adequate pain control is not achieved with NSAIDs. <strong>Morphine</strong> is a long-acting opioid and therefore it should be avoided in daycare surgery to reduce the incidence of <strong>PONV</strong>.</p>",

After 1-6 days, signs of encephalitis set in with nuchal rigidity, convulsions, altered sensorium, and coma. The fever is <strong>high and continuous</strong>. Infection in <strong>pregnant</strong> women during first and second trimester can lead to fetal death.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Arthropod- borne diseases</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Arthropod</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Disease transmitted</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anopheles mosquito</td>\n<td>Malaria, Filariasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Culex mosquito</td>\n<td>Bancroftian filariasis, Japenese encephalitis, West nile fever, Viral arthritis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aedes mosquito</td>\n<td>Yellow fever, Dengue, Chikungunya, filariasis, zika</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mansoni Mosquito</td>\n<td>Filariasis, Chikungunya</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Housefly</td>\n<td>Typhoid and paratyphoid fever, diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, gastroenteritis, amoebiasis, helminthic infestations, poliomyelitis, conjunctivitis, trachoma, anthrax, yaws, etc.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sandfly (Phlebotomus)</td>\n<td>Kala-azar(Visceral Leishmaniasis), oriental sore, Oroya fever, Sandfly fever</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tsetse fly</td>\n<td>Sleeping sickness(African Trypanosomiasis)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Louse</td>\n<td>Epidemic typhus, relapsing fever, trench fever, pediculosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rat flea</td>\n<td>Bubonic plague, endemic typhus(Murine Typhus), hymenolepis diminuta</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black fly(Simulium)</td>\n<td>Onchocerciasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reduviid bug(Kissing bug/triatominae)</td>\n<td>Chagas disease(American Trypanosomiasis)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hard tick (Ixodes species)</td>\n<td>Tick typhus, viral encephalitis, viral fevers, viral hemorrhagic fever,(e.g. Kyasanur forest disease), tularemia, tick paralysis, human babesiosis, lyme disease</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Soft Tick (Argas species)</td>\n<td>Q fever, relapsing fever, Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) (can be casued by hard tick as well)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trombiculid mite</td>\n<td>Scrub typhus, Rickettsial pox</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Itch mites</td>\n<td>Scabies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cyclops</td>\n<td>Guinea-worm disease, fish tapeworm (D. latum)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cockroaches</td>\n<td>Enteric pathogens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sand flea (Tunga penetrance, Jiggar, Chigoe flea)</td>\n<td> Tungiasis, Ulcer in the feetnails</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Taxonomy of Arboviruses</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>FAMILY</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>GENUS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT SPECIES</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Togaviridae</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Alphavirus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Chikungunya, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Flaviviridae</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Flavivirus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Kayasanur forest disease virus, Murray valley encephalitis virus, Yellow fever virus, Zika virus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"3\">\n<p>Bunyaviridae</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Bunyavirus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>California encephalitis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Phlebovirus</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rift valley fever virus, Sandfly fever virus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Nairovirus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ganjam virus, Nairobi sheep disease virus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Reoviridae</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Orbivirus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>African horse sickness, Blue-tongue viruses</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hantaviridae</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Orthohantavirus&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Prospect hill virus, Hantaan orthohantavirus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

This may lead to an initial worsening of symptoms which can be relieved using<strong> intranasal corticosteroids.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Rhinoscleroma</strong> is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by the gram-negative bacillus Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It usually affects young adults in the third to fourth decade of life and risk factors include malnutrition, poor hygiene, and overcrowding. Medical management is the mainstay treatment for rhinoscleroma. <strong>Streptomycin</strong> (1 g/day) and <strong>tetracycline</strong> (2 g/day) are given for a minimum of 4-6 weeks and continued till 2 consecutive biopsies are negative.

The affected leg is then passively and slowly raised by the ankle with the knee fully extended. The examiner stops further leg elevation when pain is elicited. Normally it should be possible to raise the limb to 80–90 degrees. The SLRT test is positive if the patient develops pain when the leg is between 30 and 60/70 degrees from horizontal. The pain should be radicular type and radiating to the back of the thigh or to the calf.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/21c521e2b1604f82adf915631ce0d66cx1279x1414.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2.

The stretching and pain become less. At this angle, the <strong>ankle is passively dorsiflexed</strong>. If the pain at the back of the thigh or in the calf is felt again, the test is positive. This is also called reinforcement positive or Bragard’s sign positive</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2620078ca3e04edc864dd89596ac463dx1280x1375.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>3. Crossed SLRT (</strong>or<strong> well-leg raising test </strong>or<strong> Fajersztajn sign)</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When SLRT is performed on the unaffected side, the patient may feel pain on the affected side. This is termed a contralateral positive SLRT or crossed SLRT positive. It is a very specific sign of root compression. It becomes positive usually when there is severe compression due to a centrally located prolapse.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4. Bowstring sign</strong> (or <strong>popliteal compression test</strong>)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The ‘bowstring sign’ is even more specific for disc prolapse than SLRT.

Buttock pain is immediately relieved.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>The examiner then presses the popliteal fossa to stretch the lateral popliteal nerve behind the lateral tibial condyle.
