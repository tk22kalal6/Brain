The symptoms are persistent for&nbsp;<strong>over 6 months.&nbsp;</strong>It equally affects men and women and is commonly seen in the&nbsp;<strong>third decade</strong>&nbsp;of life.

Irrespective of their histological or genetic characterization, medulloblastomas correspond histologically to <strong>WHO grade IV tumors.</strong></p>\n<p>Radiological findings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CT &amp; MRI</strong>: CT shows a <strong>hyperdense midline vermian mass</strong> adjoining the <strong>roof </strong>of the 4th<strong> ventricle</strong> and causing <strong>hydrocephalus</strong>. MRI shows T2 <strong>hypointensity</strong> or isointensity compared to the grey matter.

These tumors are usually slow-growing and benign. The majority of neoplasms are located in the <strong>cerebellum.</strong> However, they can also appear around the third ventricle, optic nerves, spinal cord, and occasionally in the cerebral hemispheres. <span><strong>Mural nodule</strong>, a contrast medium enhancing nodule within the wall of a <strong>cystic mass</strong>, is seen on MRI. </span></p>\n<p><span>Option C: <strong>Ependymomas</strong> are tumours that arise from the ependyma-lined ventricular system, typically on the floor of the fourth ventricle. In adults, the spinal cord is their most common location; tumors in this site are particularly frequent in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 2. They are <strong>well-demarcated lobulated mass</strong> lesions that show <strong>calcifications</strong> on CT in over 50% and are of mixed signal intensity on MRI. </span></p>\n<p><span>Option D:<strong> </strong></span><strong>Craniopharyngiomas</strong> are tumors that arise from the remnants of <strong>Rathke’s pouch</strong>. It is an intracranial space-occupying lesion. It has a bimodal age of presentation. These tumors are usually large and heterogeneous, displaying both <strong>solid </strong>and<strong> cystic components</strong>, and occur within the<strong> suprasellar area</strong>. The cysts contain a cholesterol-rich, thick brownish-yellow fluid and are compared to <strong>machine oil</strong>. They also show radiologically demonstrable calcification.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Histological Features of CNS Tumors</h3><p><strong>Pilocytic Astrocytomas:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biphasic architecture - loose microcystic component and dense fibrillary areas</li>\n<li>Bipolar cells (tumor cells): thin, long hairlike processes that are <strong>GFAP - positive</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Rosenthal fibers:&nbsp;</strong>eosinophilic corkscrew - shaped inclusions</li>\n<li>Eosinophilic granular bodies: mulberry - like inclusions&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/bc359017eb704f43b484326ad42d8425x510x497.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Medulloblastoma:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very densely cellular, with sheets of small primitive appearing <strong>small blue cells</strong></li>\n<li>Individual tumor cells have scant&nbsp;cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei that are frequently elongated&nbsp;or crescent-shaped</li>\n<li>Tumor cells form <strong>Homer - Wright&nbsp;rosettes&nbsp;</strong>(pseudorosettes) with a central <strong>neuropil</strong></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/87aa6870c5d24984abea60df064d335ex510x525.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ependymoma:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ependymal rosettes:</strong>&nbsp;gland - like round or elongated structures that resemble the embryologic ependymal canal, with long, delicate processes extending into the lumen&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Perivascular pseudorosettes:</strong>&nbsp;perivascular nuclear - free zone consisting of thin ependymal processes radiating toward the central blood&nbsp;vessel</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/853ce0f481a746afb1f174bfc80f840fx510x497.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Oligodendroglioma:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fried - egg appearance:</strong>&nbsp;sheets of regular cells with spherical nuclei containing finely granular&nbsp;chromatin (similar to normal oligodendrocytes) surrounded by&nbsp;a clear halo of vacuolated cytoplasm.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Chicken - wire capillaries:&nbsp;</strong>a delicate network of anastomosing capillaries</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/9c3dea0295f741f0aadb9e4bbdd51726x510x525.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Retinoblastoma:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Composed of collections of <strong>small, round cells</strong> with hyperchromatic nuclei</li>\n<li><strong>Flexner - Wintersteiner&nbsp;rosettes:&nbsp;</strong>arrangements of a single layer of tumor cells around an apparent lumen</li>\n<li><strong>Homer - Wright rosettes:</strong>&nbsp;a ring of cells with an eosinophilic fibrillary center</li>\n<li><strong>Fleurettes:</strong>&nbsp;retinoblastoma cells that have undergone greater photoreceptor differentiation and group together as a bouquet.
