This infiltration explains why the disease spreads rapidly.<br><br>On pathological examination, the histological hallmark is tumour emboli seen inside the dermal lymphatics.

Driving a car (Option A), riding a bike, and swimming are all examples. The striatum, cerebellum, and the motor cortex are the sites of processing such skills.<br><br>* Priming is dependent on the neocortex.

Lesions in the neocortex affect a person’s ability to recall words when prompted (Option C)<br><br>* Non-associative learning includes habituation and sensitization and is dependent on different reflex pathways. Habituation involves multiple neutral stimuli that, on repetition over time, evoke diminished responses. For example, sleeping at home when it rains outside. Sensitization, on the other hand, is associated with linking the habituated response to a noxious stimulus. For example, a person who is startled by a loud noise suddenly may be more responsive to softer sounds from then on.<br><br>* Associative learning depends on the amygdala for its emotional responses and the cerebellum for motor responses.

These agents decrease the glomerular filtration rate in a stenotic kidney owing to efferent renal arteriolar dilation, particularly in bilateral renal artery stenosis. Approximately 50% of patients with renovascular hypertension have an abdominal or flank bruit, due to the stenosed renal arteries.<br><br>If renal artery stenosis is suspected imaging studies should be the next step in the evaluation. Doppler ultrasound of the renal arteries produces reliable estimates of renal blood flow and offers the opportunity to track a lesion over time. Contrast arteriography remains the gold standard for the evaluation and identification of renal artery lesions.       <br><br>Medical therapy should include the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, attainment of goal BPs, cessation of tobacco, statins, and aspirin. Follow-up requires surveillance for progressive occlusion manifest by worsening renal function and/or loss of BP control. Renal revascularization is now often reserved for patients failing medical therapy or developing additional complications. <br><br>Other options :<br><br>Option A: Estimation of plasma-free metanephrines is done in cases of suspected phaeochromocytoma. Among the presenting manifestations, episodes of palpitation, headache, and profuse sweating are typical and constitute a classic triad. The presence of all three manifestations in association with episodic hypertension makes pheochromocytoma a likely diagnosis. <br><br>Option B: Plasma aldosterone: plasma renin activity is estimated in primary hyperaldosteronism, where it is elevated to > 30:1. Primary hyperaldosteronism can be familial or sporadic, caused by an aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. The age at the time of diagnosis is generally the third through fifth decade. In patients with primary aldosteronism, increased aldosterone production is independent of the renin-angiotensin system, and the consequences are sodium retention, hypertension and hypokalemia.<br><br>Option D: Estimation of 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion is used as a screening test for Cushing's syndrome, which is one of the causes of secondary hypertension. The mechanism of hypertension may be related to stimulation of mineralocorticoid receptors by cortisol and increased secretion of other adrenal steroids. However, there will be other features like truncal obesity, plethoric moon facies, purple striae, proximal muscle weakness, hypokalemic alkalosis, hyperandrogenism, and psychological disturbances.",

Midcollicular decerebration, which causes hyperextension of lower limbs, interrupts cortical inputs, which include those from the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts.<br><br>Option B: The vestibulospinal tract plays an important role in maintaining posture, balance, and head position. The medial vestibulospinal tract adjusts head position by controlling the neck and axial muscles. The lateral vestibulospinal tract ensures stable upright posture by projecting to the entire spinal cord by activating the limb and trunk extensor muscles.<br><br>Option C: The reticulospinal tract, part of the extrapyramidal system, controls posture, balance, locomotion, and autonomic functions. It has two parts: the medial (pontine) tract, which facilitates voluntary movement and increases muscle tone, and the lateral (medullary) tract, which inhibits voluntary movement and reduces muscle tone. This tract coordinates motor activities and maintains body stability and is implicated in the pathophysiology of decerebrate rigidity.",

During this stage, distension of the cervix and the lower uterine segments, along with isometric uterine contraction, is responsible for lower abdominal pain and discomfort via the sympathetic plexus (T10-L1). For pain relief in this stage, epidural analgesia is the most effective. A mixture of 10-15ml 0.1% bupivacaine with 2mcg/l fentanyl is used. Low-dose bupivacaine ensures that the motor function is preserved in addition to providing adequate analgesia.<br><br>In the second stage of labour, however, neuraxial blockade at T10-S4 is warranted. This is because pain in the second stage is caused by tissue damage in the perineum. Regional analgesia in the form of an epidural or spinal block can be given.

      "solution": "The best plan of open surgical management for a patient planned for elective incisional hernia with a 4 cm defect is Retrorectus mesh placement.<br><br>The retrorectus mesh placement / Stoppa technique involves placing a large mesh in the retromuscular space via an incision in the posterior rectus sheath. The space is dissected laterally, and the posterior sheath is closed to create an extraperitoneal pocket. The mesh overlaps the defect by 5–6 cm and may be secured with or without sutures, depending on the defect size. This approach avoids visceral contact and shows good long-term outcomes with a recurrence rate of ~14% for large hernias. Mesh should be used in a tension-free manner to augment primary fascial closure and not just to bridge the gap, as bridging the defect with mesh alone can cause bulging and mimic recurrence. However, if there is adequate overlap, a bridging repair can still be secure. Mesh is usually avoided in a contaminated field, such as with bowel perforation or strangulation.<br><br>The following principles are applied for the repair of an incisional hernia:<br><br>* The repair should extend across the entire previous incision site.<br><br>* Musculofascial layers must be brought together with minimum tension.<br><br>* Using a prosthetic mesh is recommended to lower the chance of hernia recurrence<br><br>Incisional hernias result from poor healing or excessive tension at a previous surgical site, frequently worsened by factors like infection, obesity, or increased intra-abdominal pressure. These hernias tend to enlarge over time, potentially leading to complications such as pain, bowel obstruction, or strangulation. Large defects may cause loss of abdominal domain, where organs shift outside the cavity, compromising muscle function and respiratory mechanics.

It may be used only when the defect size is < 2-3 cm or when the mesh is contraindicated, such as in cases of gross contamination.<br><br>Option B: Onlay mesh placement carries a risk of exposure and contamination, especially if wound infection or breakdown occurs. It also carries risks of infection, seroma, and skin ischemia due to flap elevation.<br><br>Option D: Intraperitoneal mesh placement is technically demanding, and its placement is difficult during open surgery. It is preferably performed using laparoscopic techniques rather than open surgery. Following this procedure, due to the direct contact of the mesh with abdominal organs, complications such as adhesions, erosion, or fistula formation may occur.",

The most probable reason for asphyxia in a deep well is due to carbon dioxide, which tends to accumulate at the bottom of enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces like old wells, damp cellars, and mines because it is heavier than air. Carbon dioxide is a heavy, colourless, odorless gas and is present in the concentration of 0.04-0.05% in the atmosphere.  <br><br>The mechanism by which it causes asphyxia is by displacing oxygen from the ambient air. The lack of oxygen reduces the partial pressure available for respiration, leading to asphyxia.

The key step in management is to immediately remove the patient from the contaminated area and provide oxygen support.<br><br>Diagnosis is done by analysis of the air sample collected from the scene for CO2 content.

When these bullae rupture, they form crusts and erythematous erosions. The superinfection of a preexisting lesion with S. aureus is called impetiginization, which usually does not affect intact skin (Statement 2). <br><br>Non-bullous impetigo is caused by Staphylococcus aureus (most common) or Group A streptococcus (GAS) or both (Statement 3). It begins as erythematous papules, which become vesicles and pustules that rupture and lead to honey coloured crusted papules with an erythematous base. S. aureus is seen in the nares in carriers, and non-bullous impetigo is seen as a temporary papule or pustule around the nares with itching and soreness.<br><br>A positive Nikolsky sign refers to the sheet-like separation of the normal‐looking epidermis from the dermis on application of firm tangential shearing pressure, thereby producing erosion. It is seen in conditions that produce intraepidermal blisters. However, it is negative in bullous impetigo (Statement 4) because of a lack of acantholysis and a tough bulla.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0062a2d3f5b24a4c9f774618c3931d27x1280x1094.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM2455: Skin and soft tissue lesions caused by Staphylococcus<br><br>Staphylococcus causes a variety of skin and soft tissue infections.

However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the doctrine of comparative negligence, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.<br><br>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:<br><br>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:<br><br>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient<br><br>* Ex: Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (doctor is negligent) to the patient’s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (no proper instruction). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (patient is negligent). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.<br><br>2. Last clear chance doctrine: It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.<br><br>* Ex: Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (doctor is negligent) to the patient’s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (gave proper instruction). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (patient is negligent). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.<br><br>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:<br><br>1. Avoidable consequences rule: It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor’s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the doctor need not pay anything, and the patient will be held guilty.<br><br>* Ex: A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.<br><br>* Here, despite the doctor being negligent in the first instance, the patient is responsible for his injury as he performed an unnecessary, avoidable act, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.<br><br>2. Good Samaritan doctrine: A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.<br><br>* Ex: A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (serious danger), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car (assisted the victim and was not reckless). However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (victim’s injury was aggravated). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, will not be charged under contributory negligence.",

The primary concern is the imminent risk of airway obstruction, a potentially life-threatening complication. The swelling associated with the abscess can rapidly compromise the pharyngeal and laryngeal spaces. During the procedure, there is a significant danger of pus aspiration into the lungs, which can lead to severe pneumonia or even acute respiratory distress syndrome. Additionally, the manipulation of tissues during drainage can exacerbate swelling, leading to a sudden and complete airway collapse.<br><br>Tracheostomy provides a definitive and secure airway below the level of the obstruction and swelling, effectively bypassing the compromised upper airway. This ensures continuous ventilation and oxygenation throughout the drainage procedure and during the immediate post-operative period, allowing for controlled management of the infection and inflammation.<br><br>Other options<br><br>Option A: Oral intubation is generally difficult and dangerous. The trismus physically restricts mouth opening, making laryngoscopy and intubation challenging. Limited neck extension, laryngopharyngeal edema and mass effect from the abscess further make intubation difficult.<br><br>Option B: Fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation, while a valuable tool in difficult airway situations, is risky in the presence of acute swelling. The passage of the endoscope and tube through an already inflamed and compromised nasal and pharyngeal pathway could traumatise tissues, induce more swelling, or even lead to rupture of the abscess. <br><br>Option C: Cricothyrotomy is an emergency procedure, specifically reserved for scenarios where all other attempts at securing the airway have failed. It is a rapid, life-saving intervention, but is not intended for elective, controlled airway management in a stable patient where the impending airway compromise can be anticipated and proactively addressed with a planned procedure like a tracheostomy.

Hyponatremia is the metabolic abnormality causing these clinical features in the patient. <br><br>SIADH can be associated with several different tumors such as that of the lung, ovaries, pancreas, bladder, etc. In this condition, ectopic vasopressin is produced by the small cell lung cancer which is a neuroendocrine tumor. Ectopic vasopressin increases the anti-diuretic property of the kidney decreasing renal clearance and leading to SIADH. This causes increased free water retention, leading to hyponatremia. Initially, in response to SIADH, there is a decrease in thirst which prevents further progression of the hyponatremia. However, later with increased ectopic vasopressin secretion the osmostat controlling thirst and hypothalamic secretion of vasopressin gets altered causing more thirst in the patient. This mechanism worsens hyponatremia.<br><br>SIADH is a syndrome characterized by euvolemic hyponatremia due to a primary defect in osmoregulation. The causes of SIADH include neoplasms of the lung, duodenum, pancreas, ovary, head trauma, infections (tuberculosis, meningitis, pneumonia), and drug overdose (vasopressin, desmopressin).<br><br>Treatment involves administration of conivaptan or tolvaptan (vasopressin receptor V2 antagonist), demeclocycline, and fluid restriction to less than 500 ml (although this can be difficult).

The classical presentation of BPPV is recurrent, brief (<1 minute) episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position. Diagnosis is made by the Dix-hallpike maneuver. The therapeutic maneuver is the Epley maneuver which displaces the otolith out of the posterior canal. This ends the sensation of vertigo with positional changes relieving the symptoms. This is only a temporary cure and there is a high rate of recurrence.<br><br>Fitzgerald–Hallpike test/ bithermal caloric test procedure:<br><br>In this test, the patient lies supine with head tilted 30° forward so that the horizontal canal is vertical, which will be stimulated here.<br><br>* Ears are irrigated for 40 seconds alternatively with water at 30°C and at 44°C (i.e., 7° below and above normal body temperature) and eyes are observed for the appearance of nystagmus till its endpoint.<br><br>* Time taken from the start of irrigation to the endpoint of nystagmus is recorded and charted on a calorigram.<br><br>* If no nystagmus is elicited from any ear, the test is repeated with water at 20°C for 4 min before labeling the labyrinth dead.<br><br>* A gap of 5 min should be allowed between two ears.<br><br>Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome occurs due to the third window effect created by the thin/ dehiscent wall of the superior semicircular canal. This causes endolymph in the labyrinthine system to move with sound or pressure, causing an activation of the vestibular system. It is usually diagnosed in middle-aged individuals, and no racial or sexual predominance is seen. Patients present with noise or pressure-induced dizziness. Some may complain of chronic imbalance. As a result, the patient adopts avoidance of noisy environments.

Nitrosourea<br><br>Alkylating agents are chemotherapeutic drugs that work by alkylating high-electron-density groups in the DNA structure, such as phosphates, amines, hydroxyl groups, sulphydryl groups, and oxygen. This change in the DNA structure is responsible for their cytotoxic effects, which are useful in treating neoplasms. They are classified into 6 major types: nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimines, triazenes, methylhydrazines, nitrosoureas, and alkyl sulfonates. <br><br>Thiotepa is an ethyleneimine-type alkylating agent, made up of three ethyleneimine groups with a nucleophilic thiophosphoryl base for stability. It is used in high-dose chemotherapy regimens and causes myelosuppression, neurotoxic symptoms like seizures, coma, and sometimes mucositis.<br><br>Ifosfamide is an example of a nitrogen mustard and is analogous to cyclophosphamide. It is used in the treatment of pediatric and adult sarcomas and relapsed germ cell testicular tumours. Similar to cyclophosphamide, it can cause urothelial damage due to the accumulation of acrolein; thus, concomitant MESNA should be given to prevent bladder toxicity. Platelet suppression, neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity are other adverse effects seen.<br><br>Busulfan comes under the category of alkyl sulphonates and is used in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cases where BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors are not available or not tolerated. Adverse effects include thrombocytopenia, lung fibrosis (busulfan lung), impotence, sterility, and amenorrhea. Hepatotoxicity and veno-occlusive disease of the liver are seen when administered with CYP enzyme inhibitors.<br><br>Streptozocin is a nitrosourea due to the presence of the methylnitrosourea group in its structure. It is used in the treatment of pancreatic islet cell carcinoma due to its high affinity for islets of Langerhans and carcinoid tumours. Nausea is a common side effect along with mild nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity.<br><br>Alkylating agents are generally used in combination with other drugs due to the risk of causing drug resistance, which can be attributed to mechanisms such as reduced permeability of actively transported drugs, detoxification of electrophilic intermediates due to increased concentration of nucleophilic compounds, presence of different DNA repair pathways, active degradation, and inability to recognise reactive intermediates.<br><br>Pearl PM1353: Classification of antineoplastic drugs<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/fd047e306bdc4310be749978ffaf0c5dx1280x1780.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Non-cell-cycle specific drugs\nAlkylating agents\nNitrogen mustards<br><br>* Cyclophosphamide<br><br>* Ifosfamide<br><br>* Mechlorethamine<br><br>* Melphalan<br><br>* Chlorambucil<br><br>* Bendamustine<br><br>Nitrosoureas<br><br>* Carmustine<br><br>* Lomustine<br><br>* Semustine<br><br>* Streptozocin<br><br>Triazines (methylating agents)<br><br>* Procarbazine<br><br>* Dacarbazine<br><br>* Temozolomide<br><br>Ethyleneimines<br><br>* Altretamine<br><br>* Thio-TEPA<br><br>Alkyl sulfonates<br><br>* Busulfan\nPlatinum compounds\n* Cisplatin<br><br>* Carboplatin<br><br>* Oxaliplatin\nAnti-tumor antibiotics\nAnthracyclines<br><br>* Doxorubicin (adriamycin)<br><br>* Daunorubicin (rubidomycin)<br><br>* Epirubicin<br><br>* Valrubicin<br><br>* Mitoxantrone<br><br>Others<br><br>* Actinomycin-D (Dactinomycin)<br><br>* Mitomycin-C<br><br>* Bleomycin (also a G2-M phase inhibitor)<br><br>Cell-cycle specific drugs\nS-phase inhibitors\nAntimetabolites\nAntifolate<br><br>* Methotrexate<br><br>* Pemetrexed<br><br>* Pralatrexate<br><br>* Raltitrexed<br><br>Purine analogues<br><br>* 6-Mercaptopurine<br><br>* 6-Thioguanine<br><br>* Fludarabine<br><br>* Cladribine<br><br>* Pentostatin<br><br>Pyrimidine analogues<br><br>* 5-Fluorouracil<br><br>* Capecitabine<br><br>* Gemcitabine<br><br>* Cytarabine\nTopoisomerase inhibitors\nTopoisomerase-1 inhibitors (ca)<br><br>* Irinotecan<br><br>* Topotecan<br><br>Topoisomerase-2 inhibitors<br><br>* Etoposide<br><br>* Teniposide\nHistone deacetylase inhibitors\n* Vorinostat<br><br>* Belinostat\nOthers\n*  Hydroxyurea<br><br>M-phase inhibitors (antimitotics or microtubule damaging agents)\nVinca alkaloids\n* Vincristine(Oncovin)<br><br>* Vinblastine<br><br>* Vinorelbine\nTaxanes\n* Paclitaxel<br><br>* Docetaxel<br><br>* Cabazitaxel\nOthers\n* Epothilones<br><br>* Eribulin<br><br>* Estramustine\nG1-S phase inhibitor\n* Epipodophyllotoxin<br><br>Pearl PM0914: Cell cycle specific and non-specific cytotoxic agents<br><br>Cell cycle specific agents<br><br>* Antimetabolites: S phase<br><br>* Camptothecin analogs: S Phase<br><br>* Taxanes, Vinca alkaloids: M phase<br><br>* Epipodophyllotoxin: G1-S phase<br><br>* Bleomycin: G2-M phase<br><br>Cell cycle non-specific agents<br><br>* Alkylating agents<br><br>* Platinum analogs<br><br>* Anthracyclines<br><br>* Mitomycin, dactinomycin",

Administration of excess KCl can lead to local effects such as chemical phlebitis, irritation, and pain at the site.<br><br>Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality seen in diabetes mellitus due to poor glycemic control, causing polydipsia and polyuria. Moreover, insulin therapy causes the uptake of potassium in the cells, thus causing hypokalemia. It presents as fatigue, muscle weakness, and may show T-wave changes on the ECG. Chronic hypokalemia causes damage to the renal tubules and affects vasopressin action on the collecting ducts, leading to exacerbation of polydipsia and polyuria.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Polyuria can cause hypokalemia due to excess excretion of K+ in the urine.

Sudden weakness is unlikely.<br><br>Option D: Polydipsia has not been known to reduce potassium levels enough to show features of hypokalemia.

Para aminohippuric acid (PAH) is filtered by the glomeruli and secreted by the tubular cells. Therefore, the amount of the PAH that enters the kidney is almost completely removed. It means that the entire renal plasma is cleared from PAH in a given time. Because of this, PAH clearance measures the renal plasma flow.<br><br>The formula used to calculate PAH clearance (CPAH) is:<br><br>UPAH × V ⁄ PPAH  , where UPAH  is the concentration of PAH in urine (14mg/mL), PPAH  is the concentration of PAH in plasma (0.02mg/mL), and V is the urine flow (0.7 mL/min). Substituting the values given in the question, we get:<br><br>PAH clearance =  UPAH × V ⁄ PPAH  = (14 x 0.7)/0.02 = 9.8 / 0.02 = 490 mL/min.<br><br>In an actual scenario, about 90% of the PAH is removed by the kidney. Therefore, this is called effective renal plasma flow. Actual renal plasma flow is calculated by dividing the PAH clearance by an extraction ratio. The extraction ratio is arterial concentration minus renal venous concentration divided by arterial concentration. Normally, the extraction ratio is 0.9.<br><br>If we consider the extraction ratio to be 0.9 in this scenario, the actual renal plasma flow will be 490/0.9 = ~544 mL/min<br><br>Similarly, inulin and creatine clearance are used in the measurement of the glomerular filtration rate.<br><br>Pearl PM2330: Formulae in renal physiology<br><br>Term | Equation\nClearance rate | Us ×V / Ps\nGlomerular filtration rate | Uinulin × V / Pinulin\nClearance ratio | Cs/Cinulin\nEffective renal plasma flow | ERPF=CPAH=UPAH ×V / PPAH\nRenal blood flow | RPF / (1− Hematocrit)\nExcretion rate | Us ×V\nReabsorption rate | =Filtered load −Excretion rate<br><br>=(GFR×Ps)−(Us ×V)\nSecretion rate | Excretion rate−Filtered load<br><br>Cs - clearance rate of substance “s”<br><br>EPAH  - PAH extraction ratio<br><br>ERPF - effective renal plasma flow<br><br>GFR - glomerular filtration rate<br><br>P - plasma concentration<br><br>PAH - para-aminohippuric acid<br><br>PPAH - renal arterial PAH concentration<br><br>RBF - renal blood flow<br><br>RPF - renal plasma flow<br><br>S - a substance<br><br>U - urine concentration<br><br>V - urine flow rate<br><br>VPAH - renal venous PAH concentration",

Adenosine deaminase deficiency<br><br>Leukocyte adhesion defect is due to the absence of CD18 (an integrin), which is necessary for the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium. Thus, leukocytes can't migrate out of the blood vessels to the sites of inflammation.<br><br>Bruton's X-linked agammaglobulinemia is due to a defect in Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is required for the maturation of pre-B cells. Thus, the defect leads to the arrest of maturation of pre-B cells and a decrease in the number of mature B cells.<br><br>Hyper IgM syndrome is due to a deficiency of CD40L on T-cells. B-cells have CD40 on their surface, which interacts with CD40L on T-cells to undergo class switching from IgM to various other classes (IgG, IgA, IgE) depending on the type of antigen. Thus, failure of this class switching leads to an increase in IgM and a decrease in other classes of antibodies.<br><br>SCID is due to many defects, but the most common cause of an autosomal recessive form of SCID is the deficiency of the adenosine deaminase enzyme.

Alpha waves are seen in patients who are awake, with their eyes closed.<br><br>Alpha waves are seen in all healthy adults, mostly in the occipital region, followed by the frontal and parietal regions. They are in the frequency range of 8 to 13 cycles/min with a voltage of 50µV and are seen in an awake, quiet, and relaxed state. In times of increased concentration, alpha waves are replaced by beta waves. This phenomenon is called the alpha block, also known as the alerting or arousal response. Deep sleep is characterized by the disappearance of the alpha waves. Alpha wave variations on the EEG can be due to the following reasons:-<br><br>* Age - The occipital lead shows a slow rhythm in infants and speeds up with age. Other leads, however, show a beta-like rhythm in infants. Adult-like waves are seen in adolescence.<br><br>* Drugs - Barbiturates, antipsychotics, alcohol, amphetamines, and phenytoin are responsible for the reduction in frequency of alpha waves. An alpha-wave-like rhythm can be induced by propofol.<br><br>* Encephalopathies induced by toxins/metabolic abnormalities can reduce the frequency and magnitude of alpha waves.

      "solution": "The assertion is true, but the reason is false. <br><br>Chronic venous disease leads to venous ulceration, which is a true statement. At the microvascular level, chronic venous disease leads to changes in the dermal capillaries, including dilation and increased permeability. This allows proteins like fibrinogen to leak into surrounding tissues, where they convert into fibrin and form a cuff around blood vessels. These fibrin cuffs can hinder oxygen exchange and trap essential growth factors such as fibrinogen and α2-macroglobulin, ultimately delaying wound healing.<br><br>The reason stated in the question is a false statement because elevated venous pressure during standing, which normalises on ambulation, is a normal physiological phenomenon and does not impair oxygen exchange or delay wound healing. The correct reason for the assertion is that chronic venous disease leads to elevated venous pressure during standing, which does not fall during ambulation. This persistent high pressure impairs oxygen exchange, delays wound healing, and leads to venous ulceration.<br><br>Normally, during walking (ambulation), the calf muscle pump squeezes blood out of the deep veins, resulting in the fall of venous pressure at the ankle from 90 mmHg (standing) to 20-30 mmHg. In chronic venous insufficiency (valve incompetence or calf muscle pump failure), this pressure does not fall adequately during walking, leading to ambulatory venous hypertension and venous ulcers.<br><br>Another proposed mechanism involves neutrophils adhering to the capillary walls, leading to blockage and reduced blood flow in the skin. Prolonged venous pressure and capillary injury also cause red blood cells (RBCs) to leak out, with the breakdown of haemoglobin producing irritating substances. These lead to itching, skin damage, and a distinctive brown pigmentation. Along with the loss of subcutaneous fat, these changes result in a condition known as lipodermatosclerosis.",

It is seen in states of increased gamma motor neuron activity. When the muscle is stretched, muscle spindles send strong signals to the spinal cord, activating many motor neurons at once, causing the muscle to contract. It happens because muscle stretch reflexes are overactive due to upper motor neuron lesions. As the muscle contracts, the spindle stops firing — but since the stretch is still being applied, it starts firing again as soon as the muscle relaxes. This repeat cycle of stretch → contraction → relaxation causes the rhythmic movements seen in clonus. <br><br>When the clonus is sustained for 5 or more beats, it is considered abnormal. In spinal cord injury, loss of descending cortical input disrupts Renshaw cell function. Since Renshaw cells normally inhibit alpha motor neurons, their reduced activity leads to unchecked motor neuron firing. This causes hyperactive muscle spindles to trigger repetitive, rhythmic muscle contractions—resulting in clonus. Clonus can be observed in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, epilepsy, and metabolic disorders like liver or kidney failure and hepatic encephalopathy. Immunosuppressants (azathioprine and corticosteroids), anticonvulsants ( primidone and levetiracetam), and tranquillisers (clonazepam) can be used in treatment.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/db2b7a55d80c4653ad80e755980b52ccx720x576.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Activation of the Golgi tendon organ happens in an inverse stretch reflex.

Unlike a shunt, giving 100% oxygen does not fully normalize it.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Anatomical dead space is fixed and does not change in cases of pulmonary embolism.<br><br>Option C: An increase in physiological shunt is seen in cases of pneumonia, atelectasis, and ARDS. The shunt is the part of the lung that is perfused but not ventilated. Blood passes through without being oxygenated.<br><br>Option D: Total alveolar ventilation is normal in pulmonary embolism. The problem here is ventilation-perfusion mismatch, not overall reduced ventilation.",
