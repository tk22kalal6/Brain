      "solution": "The maneuver shown in the image is Lovset's maneuver, used for the delivery of extended arms in breech presentation.<br><br>The principle of this maneuver is based on the curved birth canal. The shoulder placement favorable for this maneuver is:<br><br>* anterior shoulder - above the symphysis pubis<br><br>* posterior shoulder - below the sacral promontory.<br><br>Rotating the trunk while keeping the back anterior and applying downward traction brings the posterior shoulder under the symphysis pubis.<br><br>The technique followed in Lovset's maneuver is <br><br>* The baby is grasped with both hands using a femoropelvic grip, keeping the thumbs parallel to the vertebral column. The maneuver should start only when the inferior angle of the anterior scapula is visible underneath the pubic arch.<br><br>* The baby is lifted slightly to cause lateral flexion. The trunk is rotated 180°, keeping the back anterior and maintaining downward traction.<br><br>* The trunk is then rotated in the reverse direction, keeping the back anterior, to deliver the former anterior shoulder under the symphysis pubis.<br><br>Lovset's maneuver can be employed in all types of arm displacement.

The Graafian follicle secretes 17-β-oestradiol, which produces proliferative changes in the endometrium. This oestrogen produces proliferative changes in the endometrium, secretes inhibin which inhibits further secretion of FSH, and stimulates LH receptors in the theca cells while also stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete LH.<br><br>* At ovulation (which occurs around day 14), the maximum peak of oestrogen secretion is seen about 48 hours before ovulation, whereas the LH surge occurs about 24–36 hours before ovulation. LH causes rupture of the follicle and formation of the corpus luteum.<br><br>* In the luteal phase (in this case), the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. As a result, progesterone levels rise markedly, while oestrogen is also moderately increased. These high levels exert negative feedback, so FSH and LH remain low.<br><br>* In the menstrual phase, in the absence of pregnancy, the corpus luteum regresses, leading to a decline in both oestrogen and progesterone levels.

According to Courvoisier's Law, in a patient with jaundice, with a palpable, enlarged, non-tender gallbladder, the cause is unlikely to be due to gallstones and is more likely to be due to a periampullary malignancy. This is because the common bile duct obstruction by gallstones would lead to chronic inflammation, which causes the gallbladder to shrink and become fibrotic. The gallbladder is enlarged in conditions causing a slow occlusion, as in tumours surrounding the distal common bile duct, which implicates possible cancer of the head of the pancreas.<br><br>With widespread disease, a left supraclavicular node (Virchow node) and a periumbilical lymph node (Sister Mary Joseph node) may be palpable. In cases of peritoneal dissemination, perirectal tumour involvement may be palpable through digital rectal examination, known as the Blumer shelf.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Choledocholithiasis is usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients with cholangitis have bouts of pain, jaundice and fever, known as Charcot’s triad. <br><br>Option C: Patients with carcinoma of the gall bladder may be asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, they are usually indistinguishable from those of benign gallbladder disease, such as biliary colic or cholecystitis, particularly in older patients. Jaundice, palpable mass and anorexia are late features.<br><br>Option D: Hepatocellular carcinoma is most commonly seen in men 50 to 60 years of age who complain of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, weight loss and have a palpable mass. Presentation at an advanced stage is often with vague right upper quadrant abdominal pain that sometimes radiates to the right shoulder. Other nonspecific symptoms that can be seen are anorexia, nausea, lethargy, and weight loss.",

The glycogen stores are sufficient for around 18 hours after a meal, following which they begin to deplete.<br><br>* The second stage of fasting: Even before the glycogen stores are depleted, gluconeogenesis is accelerated. The amino acids released from muscle are the major substrate for gluconeogenesis.<br><br>* The third stage of fasting:<br><br>* Lipolysis occurs in the adipose tissue due to the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase, stimulated by an increased glucagon: insulin ratio.<br><br>* Free fatty acids are the source of energy in this stage and not glucose. <br><br>* Beta oxidation of fatty acids takes place, which provides acetyl-CoA and subsequently ketone bodies.<br><br>* The brain starts utilising ketone bodies from the 3rd day of starvation<br><br>* The final stages of fasting: After several weeks of starvation, ketone body synthesis will not take place due to depleted triacylglycerol stores.

The drugs most commonly implicated in lichenoid drug eruptions include antimalarials, gold, NSAIDs, penicillamine, thiazide diuretics, mercury amalgam, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, lithium, methyldopa, and other sulfonylureas. Out of the given options, beta blockers are considered one of the most potent generators for the drug-induced forms of lichen planus, compared to lithium (Option B). <br><br>Lichen planus-like drug reactions usually develop months or even years after starting the medication. They manifest as shiny purple papules or plaques, sometimes with the characteristic Wickham’s striae (thin white lines on their surface), and can involve mucous membranes.

Features that suggest a drug-related cause include necrotic keratinocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils.<br><br>Treatment centers on discontinuing the offending drug, which is crucial for resolution. Most cases improve with topical corticosteroids, while oral corticosteroids may be necessary for extensive or severe eruptions.

The primary problem is reduced activation of vitamin D by the diseased kidneys, which leads to poor calcium absorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Supplementing with calcium directly corrects the hypocalcemia, while giving active forms of vitamin D (calcitriol/alfacalcidol) improves intestinal calcium absorption, suppresses parathyroid overactivity, and helps in bone mineralisation. Together, calcium and vitamin D address the core abnormalities driving the bone disease in CKD.<br><br>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) refers to kidney damage that persists for at least three months, involving structural or functional abnormalities of the kidneys, which may occur with or without a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Disturbances in calcium and phosphate metabolism, impaired renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, chronic acidosis, and secondary hyperparathyroidism can lead to bone complications, collectively known as CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Factors such as poor appetite, malnutrition, and skeletal abnormalities also contribute to impaired growth.<br><br>At the initial stage, management focuses on ensuring adequate nutrition and slowing the progression of kidney failure. Although the kidneys can regulate potassium levels until the later stages, their ability to quickly excrete a potassium load is diminished, so foods high in potassium should be limited. Calcium supplementation is typically provided as calcium carbonate or calcium acetate. Phosphate consumption is reduced by limiting the intake of dairy products. Phosphate binders are given if the patient is not responding to dietary restriction of phosphate (Options A and C). Supplementation with vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, pyridoxine, and B12, along with vitamin D, is also recommended.<br><br>As the disease advances, addressing complications becomes necessary, and kidney replacement therapy, including hemodialysis or transplantation, may then be required (Option D).",

      "solution": "The symptoms experienced by the patient can be explained by decreased pO₂, causing cerebral vasodilation, leading to fluid leakage from the intravascular space.<br><br>The patient's presentation is characteristic of acute mountain sickness (AMS), which is a neurological condition that appears 6-12 hours after going to a high altitude, resulting from reduced pO2. AMS is likely to be seen after an ascent to more than 2500 metres, but can also be seen at lower altitudes (1500-2500 m). It is mainly diagnosed based on symptoms such as headache, nausea, tiredness (discomfort), and dizziness, since there are usually very few physical signs. <br><br>The low pO₂ leads to hypoxic cerebral vasodilation, which increases cerebral blood flow and raises capillary hydrostatic pressure. This, in turn, increases capillary permeability and causes fluid to leak into the brain tissues, producing symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness, and discomfort. This is known as high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE).<br><br>AMS minaly results from rapid ascent to higher altitudes and is best prevented by gradual ascent with time for acclimatization.<br><br>Mild AMS is managed by halting ascent, acetazolamide, and descent if needed. Moderate AMS requires descent, oxygen, acetazolamide or dexamethasone, and possibly hyperbaric therapy. HACE is treated with urgent descent, oxygen, and dexamethasone, while high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) requires descent, oxygen, warmth, and nifedipine, with hyperbaric therapy if evacuation is delayed.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Following ascent to high altitude, there is hyperventilation leading to the washout of CO2, causing respiratory alkalosis. To compensate, the kidneys reduce the excretion of H+ ions and increase the excretion of HCO3-. So a decrease in HCO3- concentration is seen instead of an increase.<br><br>Option C: Initially, hypoxia-induced hyperventilation lowers pCO₂, producing respiratory alkalosis with reduced H⁺ in blood and CSF. Later, renal compensation increases HCO₃⁻ excretion, bringing CSF pH back toward normal with a relative rise in H⁺ compared to the initial state. However, this change in H⁺ is not the cause of cerebral vasodilation, which is primarily driven by decreased pO₂.<br><br>Option D: Decreased pO₂ (hypoxia) induces cerebral vasodilation and not vasoconstriction. Hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction is seen in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to an increased pulmonary capillary pressure and development of pulmonary edema, also known as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).<br><br>Pearl PM1009: Acclimatization to high altitude<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/07859b7f9cce4e0ab7654ab13244b120x1061x606.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

There is a radially indented peripheral layer of pseudoexfoliative material, separated by a clear zone maintained by pupillary abrasion. Pupillary dilation helps in visualising this peripheral capsular deposition.<br><br>The material can get collected in the anterior chamber angle and impede the aqueous humour drainage, thus developing secondary open-angle glaucoma.

Oral anticoagulants may be considered postpartum based upon planned duration of therapy, lactation and patient preference. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Although effective for long-term anticoagulation, warfarin is not started immediately after delivery due to the risk of initial hypercoagulability, delayed onset of action, and the need for close INR monitoring.<br><br>Option C and D: Clopidogrel and aspirin are antiplatelet drugs, not anticoagulants.

Since the information is collected from hospitals or health facilities without active searching, it falls under passive surveillance.<br><br>Surveillance is defined as continuous analysis, interpretation, and feedback of systematically collected data. It is continuous and ongoing, whereas monitoring is more intermittent or episodic. It can be of two types: <br><br>* Active surveillance is a system employing staff members to regularly contact health care providers or the population to seek information about health conditions (Option A). Active surveillance provides the most accurate and timely information, but it is also expensive. <br><br>* Passive surveillance is a system by which a health jurisdiction receives reports submitted from hospitals, clinics, public health units, or other sources. Passive surveillance is a relatively inexpensive strategy to cover large areas, and it provides critical information for monitoring a community's health. However, because passive surveillance depends on people in different institutions to provide data, data quality and timeliness are difficult to control.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option C: Sentinel surveillance is a method of identifying the missing cases that are not on the notified cases list. It is used for supplementing routine notifications. The sentinel data collected in this type of surveillance can estimate the disease prevalence (old and new cases) in the total population. This system provides more valuable and detailed information compared to what is obtained from traditional notification systems.<br><br>Option D: Syndromic surveillance focuses on the clinical pattern and broad category of presentation, which is determined by paramedical personnel and members of the community.

It is endemic in the USA, in the states bordering the Ohio River valley and the lower Mississippi River. In India, it is reported from the region of West Bengal, along the Ganga River. The fungus inhabits humid and acidic soil that contains a large amount of bird or bat droppings.<br><br>H. capsulatum is transmitted by inhalation of spores (i.e. microconidia) which usually circulate in the air after the contaminated soil is disturbed. After the spores enter the lungs, they are engulfed by the alveolar macrophages and then transform into yeast forms. <br><br>Clinically, the classical histoplasmosis ranges from asymptomatic infection (in immunocompetent people) to life-threatening illness seen in people with low CMI. The various clinical types include:<br><br>* Pulmonary histoplasmosis - Acute form presents with mild flu-like illness, pulmonary infiltrates in the chest X-ray, with hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Chronic cavitary histoplasmosis may be seen in smokers with underlying structural lung disease.<br><br>* Mucocutaneous histoplasmosis - Skin and oral mucosal lesions may develop secondary to pulmonary infection. Oral lesions are particularly seen in Indian patients.<br><br>* Disseminated histoplasmosis - It develops if CMI is very low (e.g. untreated HIV-infected people or following organ transplantation). The common sites affected are the bone marrow, spleen, liver, eyes, and adrenal glands. <br><br>Diagnosis is by direct microscopy. Histopathological staining of the specimens reveals tiny oval yeast cells (2–4 μm size) with narrow-based budding within the macrophages, with an underlying granulomatous response.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/28a1a4b1979844aa9633927f5f3905f2x544x430.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Culture is the gold standard method of diagnosis. Specimens should be inoculated onto media such as SDA, blood agar, and BHI agar in duplicate and incubated simultaneously at 25°C and 37°C. <br><br>* At 25°C, it forms a mycelial phase and produces white to buff brown colonies that consist of two types of conidia or spores - tuberculate macroconidia (with typical thick walls and finger-like projections, which is a characteristic feature) and microconidia( smaller, thinner, and smooth-walled).<br><br>* At 37°C, it gets converted into yeast form (creamy white colonies), which is best developed in special media like Kelley’s media.<br><br>Liposomal amphotericin B is the antifungal agent of choice in acute pulmonary and disseminated histoplasmosis. Itraconazole is recommended for chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis.<br><br>Other options : <br><br>Option A: Candidiasis is caused by Candida species, which are yeast-like fungi. They exist as yeast and pseudohyphae.<br><br>Option C: Blastomycosis causes North American Blastomycosis/ Chicago disease. Pulmonary involvement is the most common form followed by skin.

This type of bias is called lead-time bias. The lead time bias can overestimate the survival time by the early detection of a disease. <br><br>Lead time is the time gained by screening. It is the time between diagnosis by a screening test and diagnosis by other means.

Early diagnosis can lead to an overestimation of survival times because an early diagnosis through screening does not accurately represent delayed mortality. <br><br>For example, a CT scan of the chest identifies a malignant tumor of the lung earlier than a traditional chest x-ray. However, early treatment does not significantly enhance overall survival in patients with lung cancer. Therefore, any apparent improvement in the 5-year survival rates of patients diagnosed through a CT scan compared to those diagnosed with an X-ray is attributed to lead-time bias. <br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option A: Berksonian bias arises because of the different rates of admission to hospitals for people with different diseases.

At the time of delivery, her viral load was high at 1200 copies/mL, which is more than 1000 copies/mL, which increases the risk of vertical transmission. Hence, prophylaxis with Nevirapine with Zidovudine for 12 weeks with exclusive breastfeeding should be started immediately.<br><br>Immediate postnatal ART prophylaxis is crucial in reducing HIV transmission risk and improving long-term health outcomes in exposed infants. Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is the primary route of pediatric HIV infection, occurring during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. <br><br>For ART prophylaxis, a single drug or dual drug regimen is followed, depending on the risk of transmission, which can be low or high risk.<br><br>* Low-risk infants are those born to mothers with a low viral load (<1000 copies/mL) which is detected after 32 weeks of pregnancy till delivery. <br><br>* High-risk infants are those born to HIV-positive mothers, not on ART, with viral load not estimated beyond 32 weeks, maternal viral load

Intermittent insufflation (1 sec on, 4 sec off) provides oxygenation but inadequate CO2 clearance, so it is limited to 30-45 minutes.<br><br>* Surgical cricothyrotomy: A transverse incision is made over the cricothyroid membrane, and a tube is inserted.

The De facto concept is equivalent to taking a snapshot of the population at a reference time point. Since the enumeration is rounded off in a day, it is also called the date system or one-night enumeration system. The De facto method of census was carried out till 1931.<br><br>De jure Method - In this method, every individual in a particular area is personally counted, and the requisite information is obtained. The temporary residents are enumerated at their permanent place of residence. All persons who usually live in a country/territory at a particular reference time-point (usually taken as the middle of a year)  will be counted as the population of the country/territory. The enumeration work is prolonged for two to three weeks, which is known as the enumeration period. This method is also known as the period system, because census taking is confined to a particular period and not confined to a particular date.

The internal architecture is abnormal, and the bone is unusually brittle. Raised levels of plasma alkaline phosphatase are seen.

Empagliflozin, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, is the most suitable choice here, as it not only improves glycemic control but also provides significant cardiovascular and renal protection.<br><br>It acts in the proximal renal tubules by blocking SGLT-2, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion. This mechanism is independent of insulin and contributes to lower blood glucose levels. Promoting natriuresis and mild diuresis, it helps reduce intravascular volume and cardiac workload.<br><br>In addition, it is associated with modest weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and has been shown to reduce mortality from cardiovascular causes in diabetic patients with heart failure.<br><br>Adverse effects include dehydration, urinary tract and genital mycotic infections, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, and in some cases fractures or amputation risk (particularly with canagliflozin), as well as possible bladder cancer risk with dapagliflozin.<br><br>Other options : <br><br>Option B: Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that potentiates the action of GLP-1. It is orally absorbed, undergoes minimal metabolism, and is largely excreted unchanged in the urine. Dose adjustment is required in renal impairment, but not in liver disease. Sitagliptin is generally well tolerated. Nausea may occur, but it is not a prominent side effect.<br><br>Option C: Glibenclamide (Glyburide) is a sulfonylurea and stimulates insulin release by inhibiting the ATP-sensitive K+ channel in beta cells of the pancreas. They are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and therefore can be given orally.<br><br>Option D: Pioglitazone is an activator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which is involved in the regulation of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism. Its adverse effects include increased incidence of heart failure (hence, contraindicated in this patient), peripheral edema, weight gain, macular edema, and osteoporosis.",

Superficial dermoid cyst shows a well-circumscribed heterogeneous cystic lesion, while deep cyst shows a well-circumscribed lesion that may be associated with bony defects or may extend into the inferotemporal fossa or intracranially.<br><br>A dermoid cyst is treated by excision in toto. Care must be taken to prevent the leaking of keratin into the surrounding tissue because it can result in severe granulomatous inflammation.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Lacrimal gland mass presents as a smooth, firm, non-tender, painless, slowly progressive mass in the superolateral eyelid mass leading to proptosis with inferonasal dystopia. It is usually seen in older age groups.<br><br>Option B: Hemangioma that presents as a proptosis is located deeper, while the superficial ones present as a red-coloured cutaneous lesion.<br><br>Option C: Osteoma is a palpable bony nodule, but does not usually present in the eye.",

The digastric muscle has two bellies, anterior and posterior. The posterior belly arises from the mastoid notch on the temporal bone and slopes downward and forward. The anterior belly arises from the digastric fossa on the inner surface of the mandible, which slopes downward and backward. The two bellies connect at the intermediate tendon.

The excessive secretion of prolactin in such tumors has a direct inhibitory effect on the hypothalamus. Prolactin inhibits the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus. This inhibition, in turn, suppresses the formation of the pituitary gonadotropic hormones - luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. This pathophysiology is shown in the flowhcart below:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/29ad90c234bc464a92af3fca0b405565x1280x1259.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Prolactinoma usually presents with amenorrhea, infertility, and galactorrhea. If the tumour extends outside the sella, visual field defects or other mass effects may be seen. The diagnosis of prolactinoma is likely with a prolactin level >200 μg/L. An MRI is recommended in all patients who present with hyperprolactinemia.<br><br>Microadenomas can be managed with regular monitoring of prolactin levels and MRI scans, if fertility is not a requisite. Oral dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine and cabergoline are used for medical management. Resistance or intolerance to these drugs requires surgical debulking.

On Wood’s lamp examination, the lesion shows white accentuation. The lesion remains non-progressive and asymptomatic throughout life, which fits the case scenario. <br><br>Nevus depigmentosus is a stable, well-circumscribed hypopigmented patch that is present at birth and may become more noticeable during the first year as the surrounding skin pigmentation develops. There is usually a single oval or rectangular lesion, but the presence of three or more nevus depigmentosus or hypomelanotic patches in a newborn should raise suspicion for possible tuberous sclerosis complex. It is a congenital nonprogressive hypopigmented macule or patch that is stable in its relative size and distribution throughout life. <br><br>Nevus depigmentosus can be diagnosed using the following criteria:<br><br>* Leukoderma present at birth or of early onset<br><br>* No alteration in the distribution of leukoderma throughout life<br><br>* No alteration in texture or change in sensation in the affected area<br><br>* Absence of hyperpigmented border.<br><br>Diascopy test is negative in nevus depigmentosus but positive in nevus anemicus.

Stroking evokes an erythematous line and flare in normal surrounding skin, but the skin of a nevus anemicus does not redden.<br><br>They can also be diagnosed by diascopy, in which pressure of the skin with a glass slide will obscure the borders of a nevus anemicus.

On examination, the cervix was 8 cm dilated and the vertex at –1 station, meaning the fetal head is still 1 cm above the ischial spines and not yet engaged, making instrumental delivery unsafe. Hence, the next best step is an Emergency Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS) to prevent complete rupture and prevent further maternal and fetal complications.<br><br>Uterine rupture is defined as a disruption in the continuity of all the uterine layers (endometrium, myometrium, and serosa) after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

There are varying degrees of tenderness on uterine palpation. FHS may be irregular or absent. CTG tracings reveal variable or late deceleration (most consistent finding). If the fetal presenting part has already entered the pelvis with labour, loss of station may be detected by pelvic examination. <br><br>To prevent uterine rupture, undue delay in the progress of labor in a multipara with a previous uneventful delivery should be viewed with concern, and the cause should be sought for. Attempted forceps delivery or breech extraction through incompletely dilated cervix should be avoided. The only effective measure to save the fetus is by immediate delivery via emergency LSCS. Following complete rupture during TOLAC, hysterectomy may also be required.",
