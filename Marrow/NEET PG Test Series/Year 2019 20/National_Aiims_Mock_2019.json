      "solution": "<p>Case 1:<br /><br />This is a case of<strong> costochondritis.</strong> The recent change in the workout schedule and the physical examination point toward this diagnosis. Costochondritis is inflammation of &ge;1 costal cartilage. It commonly occurs in the 2nd to 5th costal cartilages. The examination finding of pain on palpation in costal cartilages is the clinching factor for the diagnosis of this condition. NSAID&rsquo;s are the first line of treatment.</p>\n<p>Case 2:</p>\n<p>This is a case of a<strong> panic attack</strong>. Panic disorder is characterized by recurring unexpected panic attacks over a 1-month period. The time duration, agoraphobia, hypochondriacal concerns, and high medical utilization point towards the diagnosis of panic attacks. The physical symptoms of panic attacks like tachycardia, chest pain, and perspirations can mimic myocardial infarction. SSRI, SNRI, MAO, Benzodiazepines can be used to treat panic attacks. Benzodiazepines have a more rapid onset of action compared to the other options.</p>\n<p>Case 3:</p>\n<p>This is a case of <strong>pulmonary embolism(PE)</strong>. Pulmonary embolism here is a consequence of thrombus formation within the lower extremities. The H/o recent immobilization, surgery, tachycardia and tachypnea are the points in favor of this diagnosis. Symptoms of PE include chest pain, cough, and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis. Suspected PE should be approached with clinical, pretest probability assessment, D-dimer testing, and definitive<br />diagnostic imaging.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>C. <strong>Boerhaave's syndrome</strong> is a spontaneous perforation of the esophagus that results from a sudden increase in intraesophageal pressure. It is most commonly seen during vomiting or straining. It is characterized by the sudden onset of excruciating chest pain and can progress to sepsis and shock in a few hours.</p>\n<p>D. <strong>Pneumothorax</strong> is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath.</p>\n<p>E. <strong>Pericarditis</strong> is inflammation of the pericardium. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp chest pain radiating to the shoulders, neck, or back. It is typically better sitting up and worse when lying down or breathing deeply. Other symptoms may include fever, weakness, palpitations, and shortness of breath.</p>\n<p>F. <strong>Stable angina:</strong> chest pain or discomfort that most often occurs with activity or emotional stress.</p>\n<p>H. <strong>Aortic dissection:</strong> Presents with abrupt onset severe chest or back pain, presence of pulse deficit and new-onset diastolic murmur (due to acute AR)</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Risk Factors for Venous Thromboembolism</h3><p>The risk factors for venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism and DVT) are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Major trauma</strong> like spinal cord injury or fracture of lower limb</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Surgery</strong> like hip or knee replacement</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Hospitalization</strong> for heart failure or atrial fibrillation/flutter within last 3 months</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Myocardial infarction</strong>&nbsp;within last 3 months</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Previous venous thromboembolism</strong></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Infections and inflammatory bowel disease</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Autoimmune diseases:\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Antiphospholipid antibody (APLA)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SLE</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Inherited thrombophilias:\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Factor V leiden mutation</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Deficiency of antithrombin III</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Deficiency of protein C or protein S</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hypercoagulable states:\n<ul>\n<li>Pregnancy and postpartum period</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">COPD</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Nephrotic syndrome</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Polycythemia vera</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Malignancies</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Iatrogenic:\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">OCPs</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Hormone replacement therapy</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Chemotherapeutic drugs</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Insertion of central venous lines</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Varicose veins</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Prolonged car or air travel.</li>\n</ul>",
