Recommended treatments include IV clindamycin followed by oral clindamycin or a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination like amoxicillin-clavulanate. Therapy continues until imaging confirms resolution. Metronidazole alone is ineffective since it does not cover microaerophilic streptococci.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary</strong> lung abscesses (caused by <strong>underlying conditions</strong> like malignancy, immunosuppression, or bronchial obstruction) are treated by targeting the <strong>identified pathogen</strong> and prolonging antibiotic courses based on the patient’s immune status. If no improvement is seen in 7 days, further evaluation is needed to rule out underlying causes.</p>\n<p>Large abscesses (&gt;6–8 cm) are less likely to resolve without additional interventions, such as drainage or surgery.
