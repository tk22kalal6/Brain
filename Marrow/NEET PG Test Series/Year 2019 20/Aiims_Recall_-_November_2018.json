The glucose moves out of&nbsp;the cell into the blood across the basolateral membrane by facilitated diffusion mediated via GLUT.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0f8e2cde667740aabed2825c4aae243ax1280x1133.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Glucose Transporters</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Function</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Major sites of expression</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Secondary active transport</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(Na </strong><strong><sup>+</sup></strong> <strong>-glucose cotransport)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>SGLT 1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absorption of glucose</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Small intestine, renal tubules</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>SGLT 2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absorption of glucose</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Renal tubules</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Facilitated diffusion</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Basal glucose uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Placenta, blood-brain barrier, brain, red cells, kidneys, colon, many other organs</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&beta;-cell glucose sensor; transport out of intestinal and renal epithelial cells</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&beta; cells of islets, liver, epithelial cells of small intestine, kidneys</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 3</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Basal glucose uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Brain, placenta, kidneys, many other organs</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 4</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Skeletal and cardiac muscle, adipose tissue, other tissues</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 5</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fructose transport</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Jejunum, sperm</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 6</p>\n</td>\n<td>Function not known</td>\n<td>Brain, spleen, leucocytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GLUT 7</td>\n<td>Glucose-6-phosphate transporter in the endoplasmic reticulum</td>\n<td>Liver</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "<p>Victims of <strong>smoke inhalation</strong> are affected by<strong> carbon monoxide poisoning.</strong> In carbon monoxide poisoning, the cause of death is <strong>anemic hypoxia. </strong></p>\n<p>Carbon monoxide has a <strong>higher affinity</strong> to <strong>hemoglobin</strong> compared to oxygen and hence the amount of hemoglobin available for oxygen transport is markedly reduced. It <strong>displaces oxygen</strong> from its combination with hemoglobin and forms a relatively stable compound known as <strong>carboxyhemoglobin</strong>. It thus <strong>reduces</strong> the <strong>oxygen content</strong> of the blood, and hence, that of the tissues. It acts as a chemical asphyxiant and produces death due to <strong>anemic anoxia</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that in the case of <strong>anemic hypoxia, O<sub>2</sub> content is low </strong>but <strong>dissolved O<sub>2</sub> </strong>is within<strong> normal </strong>limits so it does not stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors.</p>\n<p>Note: Carbon monoxide poisoning causes <strong>both</strong> anemic (due to CO-Hb) and histotoxic (due to inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase) hypoxia. But the main cause of death is due to <strong>anemic hypoxia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Histotoxic hypoxia</strong>- The most common example is cyanide poisoning. Cyanide inhibits important enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation process, which is essential to the survival of our cells. Additional oxygen supplementation will not be able to overcome this inhibition, so it will have limited benefit. Hyperbaric oxygen may be helpful to some extent.</p>\n<p>Option B - Stagnant hypoxia refers to ischemic hypoxia that results from inadequate circulation due to conditions such as heart failure and hypoxia in the setting of shock. In such conditions, administering intravenous fluids can improve the patient's condition because it is the circulation that is affected. If the shock is prolonged it can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be treated with positive pressure ventilation and not simply by increasing oxygen administration.</p>",

It has both a <strong>free-living</strong> and a <strong>parasitic</strong> life cycle. Its natural host is man. The <strong>infective form</strong> to man is the <strong>filariform larva. </strong>Infection occurs through penetration of the skin by larvae in the soil. Then, the larvae migrate to the small intestine. They molt twice and become adult female worms in the small intestine. The eggs laid in the mucosa of the intestine hatch immediately releasing the <strong>rhabditiform larva</strong> (L1 stage). Thus, it is <strong>ovoviviparous</strong>. These rhabditiform larvae in the bowel can develop directly into filariform larvae that penetrate the colonic wall or perianal skin and enter the circulation to repeat the migration. This establishes ongoing<strong> internal reinfection.</strong></p>\n<p>The rhabditiform larva can also be passed in the stool. It may directly metamorphose to the infective filariform larva in the soil, or develop into adult worms. The free-living adult worms then pass eggs, which hatch and mature to form infective filariform larvae. </p>\n<p> In <em>Ancylostoma duodenale</em> infestation, eggs containing <strong>segmented ova </strong>(not rhabditiform larvae) are passed in the stool.

      "solution": "<p>The <strong>earliest symptom</strong> of <strong>acute compartment syndrome</strong> is <strong>pain</strong>.</p>\n<p>Acute compartment syndrome is a<strong> surgical emergency</strong> caused by<strong> increased pressure</strong> within a <strong>fascial compartment</strong>, leading to<strong> tissue ischemia</strong>. It is characterized by rapid progression of pain and swelling in an extremity, commonly precipitated by <strong>traumatic injury</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the 5 P's:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Pain</strong> - It is the<strong> first symptom</strong> of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. On <strong>passive stretching</strong> of the muscles, <strong>severe pain</strong> can be elicited.&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Paresthesia</strong> - It is the<strong> first sign</strong> of nerve ischemia.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Pallor</strong> - It may not be seen always. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Paralysis</strong> - Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a <strong>late sign</strong>.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Pulselessness</strong> - Usually, the peripheral pulses and capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. <strong>If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the <strong>intra-compartmental pressure</strong> using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (&Delta;P). A <strong>differential pressure (&Delta;P)</strong> of<strong> less than 30 mm Hg</strong> (4.00 kilopascals) is an <strong>indication</strong> for immediate compartment decompression by performing a <strong>fasciotomy</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Acute Compartment and Crush Syndromes</h3><p><strong>1. Acute Compartment Syndrome</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Acute compartment syndrome is an elevation of the intracompartmental pressure (ICP) which increases the risk for tissue ischemia and necrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Fractures (70%) and severe soft tissue injuries (30%). Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. </p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. </p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Crush Syndrome </strong></p>\n<p>Crush syndrome is the systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis. It is commonly caused due to prolonged external compression of an extremity. </p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Crush injuries sustained during motor vehicle accidents, earthquakes, mining and other occupational accidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Underperfusion of muscle causes myonecrosis. When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",
