Therefore, methylation is an <strong>epigenetic modification </strong>that inactivates DNA, and hinders the formation of euchromatin (transcriptionally active chromatin). Epigenetic changes include alterations of chromatin structure by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides</li>\n<li>Modification of histones by acetylation or methylation</li>\n<li>Changes in higher-order chromosome structure</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sumoylation</strong> of<strong> histones</strong> (SUMO - Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier) is associated with transcription <strong>repression</strong>. Other possible roles of posttranslationally modified histones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acetylation </strong>of <strong>core histones</strong> is associated with<strong> chromosomal assembly</strong> during DNA replication.</li>\n<li><strong>Phosphorylation</strong> of histone <strong>H1</strong> is associated with the <strong>condensation </strong>of <strong>chromosomes</strong> during the replication cycle.</li>\n<li><strong>ADP-ribosylation</strong> of histones is associated with <strong>DNA repair. </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Methylation</strong> of histones is correlated with activation and repression of gene transcription.</li>\n<li><strong>Acetylation</strong> of histones <strong>H3 </strong>and<strong> H4</strong> is associated with the activation or inactivation of gene transcription.</li>\n<li><strong>Monoubiquitylation</strong> is associated with gene activation, repression, and heterochromatic gene silencing.</li>\n</ul>",

The aim is to <strong>eliminate compensatory lumbar lordosis</strong> and <strong>reveal the obvious flexion deformity</strong> for measurement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the test, the patient lies supine on a hard surface with legs straight. The patient may compensate for the flexion deformity by arching the lower back, creating excessive lumbar lordosis. The <strong>easy passage of the examiner's hand between the bed and the back of the patient </strong>is considered a <strong>positive test</strong> as normally this is not possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By gradually flexing the unaffected hip, the pelvis tilts and eliminates lumbar lordosis, causing the affected hip to assume the flexed position.

The diagnosis of acute HEV is typically based upon the detection of IgM antibodies to HEV. <strong>B</strong><strong>oth false positives </strong>and <strong>negatives </strong>are<strong> common</strong> with available assays and are thus, not very reliable. Thus, additional serologic testing or HEV RNA testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and not be useful as a screening test.
