So, the right eye becomes much more dilated than the left.</p>\n<p><strong>Denervation Supersensitivity:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the motor nerve to <strong>skeletal muscle</strong> is degenerated, the muscle gradually becomes extremely sensitive to acetylcholine. This is called denervation hypersensitivity or supersensitivity.</li>\n<li>Normally nicotinic receptors are located only in the vicinity of the motor endplate where the axon of the motor nerve terminates. When the motor nerve is severed, there is a <strong>marked proliferation of nicotinic receptors</strong> over a wide region of the neuromuscular junction.</li>\n<li>Denervation supersensitivity also occurs at <strong>autonomic junctions.</strong> Smooth muscle, unlike skeletal muscle, does not atrophy when denervated, but it becomes hyperresponsive to the chemical mediator that normally activates it.</li>\n<li>This hyperresponsiveness can be demonstrated by using pharmacologic tools rather than actual nerve section. Prolonged use of a drug such as reserpine can be used to deplete transmitter stores and prevent the target organ from being exposed to norepinephrine for an extended period. Once the drug usage is stopped, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle will be supersensitive to subsequent release of the neurotransmitter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option a</strong>) If the symapthetic nerve would have regenerated, both right and left eye would have been equally sensitive to the drug and so, would have dilated equally.</p>\n<p><strong>Option b</strong>) Parasympathetic nerves supply the spinchter pupillae muscle. So, if stimulated they would constrict the eye not dilate it. Also, the drug added was a sympathomimetic agent. So, parasympathetic nerves are not stimulated in the first place</p>\n<p><strong>Option d</strong>) If the left eye was damaged, it would also have denervation supersensitivity.
