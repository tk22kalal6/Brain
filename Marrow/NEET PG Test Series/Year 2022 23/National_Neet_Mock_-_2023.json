Most <strong>blood vessels lack parasympathetic innervations</strong> and their diameter is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. It is a decrease in sympathetic stimulation or tone that allows vasodilatation. The <strong>transplanted heart is devoid of parasympathetic innervation (vagal supply)</strong> that is involved in decreasing the heart rate following baroreceptor stimulation. Hence, there is no change in the heart rate. However, the blood vessels that are under sympathetic control <strong>undergo vasodilation following baroreceptor stimulation</strong> due to a decrease in sympathetic tone.</p>\n<p>Baroreceptors are stretch receptors&nbsp;located in the heart and blood vessels including the aortic arch and carotid sinus. The carotid&nbsp;sinus is supplied by a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve&nbsp;(IX CN) and the aortic arch by a branch of the vagus nerve&nbsp;(X CN).</p>\n<p>When the carotid sinus is <strong>stimulated</strong> by massage, it discharges at an increased rate and <strong>excites </strong>the <strong>nucleus tractus solitarius,</strong> further leading to <strong>increased vagal stimulation</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>The clinical vignette of a chronic smoker presenting with <strong>seizures, lethargy,</strong> and<strong> altered mental status</strong> in the setting of <strong>hyponatremia</strong> and the x-ray showing an <strong>irregular, poorly demarcated mass</strong> at the right hilum is suggestive of a<strong> Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion</strong> (SIADH) secondary to underlying small cell lung cancer. SIADH results in a <strong>high urine osmolality</strong> (concentrated urine) rather than a low osmolality.</p>\n<p>SIADH can be associated with several different tumors such as that of the lung, ovaries, pancreas, and bladder. In this condition, <strong>ectopic vasopressin</strong> is produced by <strong>small-cell lung cancer</strong>, which is a neuroendocrine tumor.</p>\n<p><strong>Ectopic vasopressin</strong> increases the anti-diuretic property of the kidney, <strong>decreasing renal clearance and leading to SIADH.</strong> This causes increased <strong>free water retention</strong>, leading to <strong>hyponatremia </strong>(low serum osmolality) and <strong>concentration of urine,</strong> resulting in elevated urine osmolality. Water retention reduces serum osmolality, causing a transient volume expansion. This stimulates a release of ANP and BNP and reduces levels of aldosterone. Together, these processes<strong> increase urinary sodium</strong> and water excretion, thereby causing<strong> euvolemic hyponatremia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> involves the administration of <strong>conivaptan</strong> or <strong>tolvaptan</strong> (vasopressin receptor V2 antagonist), <strong>demeclocycline,</strong> and <strong>fluid restriction</strong> to less than 500 mL (although this can be difficult).</p>\n<p>In <strong>severe cases</strong>, correction of hyponatremia is done by administering IV fluids with <strong>hypertonic normal saline</strong> along with diuretics such as furosemide (to increase free water clearance). In tumor-associated SAIDH, treatment of the underlying malignancy also helps in resolving hyponatremia.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of SIADH</h3><p><strong>Neoplasms</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Carcinomas</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lung</li>\n<li>Duodenum</li>\n<li>Pancreas</li>\n<li>Ovary</li>\n<li>Bladder, ureter</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other neoplasms</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thymoma</li>\n<li>Mesothelioma</li>\n<li>Bronchial adenoma</li>\n<li>Carcinoid</li>\n<li>Gangliocytoma</li>\n<li>Ewing&rsquo;s sarcoma</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Head trauma</strong> (closed and penetrating)</p>\n<p><strong>Infections</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pneumonia</li>\n<li>Abscess</li>\n<li>Cavitation (aspergillosis)</li>\n<li>Tuberculosis</li>\n<li>Meningitis, Encephalitis</li>\n<li>AIDS</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vascular</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cerebrovascular occlusions, haemorrhage</li>\n<li>Cavernous sinus thrombosis</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Neurologic</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guillain-Barre syndrome</li>\n<li>Multiple sclerosis</li>\n<li>Delirium tremens</li>\n<li>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</li>\n<li>Hydrocephalus</li>\n<li>Psychosis</li>\n<li>Peripheral neuropathy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Congenital malformations</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Metabolic</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acute intermittent porphyria</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Respiratory</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asthma</li>\n<li>Pneumothorax</li>\n<li>Positive-pressure respiration</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Drugs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vasopressin or desmopressin</li>\n<li>Serotonin reuptake inhibitors</li>\n<li>Oxytocin (high dose)</li>\n<li>Vincristine</li>\n<li>Carbamazepine</li>\n<li>Nicotine</li>\n<li>Phenothiazines</li>\n<li>Cyclophosphamide</li>\n<li>Tricyclic antidepressants</li>\n<li>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Paraneoplastic Syndromes and Underlying Cancers</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Clinical Syndromes/&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Endocrinopathies</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Major Forms of Underlying Cancer</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Causal Mechanism</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Cushing Syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Small-cell carcinoma of lung</p>\n<p>Pancreatic carcinoma</p>\n<p>Neural tumours</p>\n<p>Renal carcinoma</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>ACTH or ACTH- like substance</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Small-cell carcinoma of lung</p>\n<p>Intracranial neoplasms</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Antidiuretic hormone or atrial natriuretic hormones</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hypercalcemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Squamous cell carcinoma of lung</p>\n<p>Breast carcinoma</p>\n<p>Renal carcinoma</p>\n<p>Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Parathyroid hormone-related protein(PTHRP), TGF-a, TNF, IL-1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hypoglycaemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ovarian carcinoma</p>\n<p>Fibrosarcoma</p>\n<p>Other mesenchymal sarcomas</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Insulin or insulin-like substance</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Polycythemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Renal carcinoma</p>\n<p>Cerebellar haemangioma</p>\n<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Erythropoietin</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Osteomalacia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>FGF-23</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Disseminated intrvascular coagulation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Acute promyelocytic leukemia</p>\n<p>Prostatic carcinoma</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tumor products activate clotting</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>ACTH:&nbsp;Adrenocorticotropic hormone&nbsp;</p>",

Therefore,&nbsp;<strong>V<sub>max</sub></strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>unaltered</strong>&nbsp;in this type of inhibition.

Examples of pressure overload are <strong>hypertension</strong> and <strong>aortic stenosis</strong> leading to <strong>concentric</strong> hypertrophy. Volume overload can occur due to <strong>valvular</strong> <strong>regurgitation</strong> leading to <strong>ventricular</strong> <strong>dilation</strong>. </p>\n<p>Pathological cardiac conditions leading to increased cardiac workload result in compensatory mechanisms to maintain perfusion and arterial pressure. They include <strong>increasing</strong> <strong>contractility</strong> and <strong>stroke</strong> <strong>volume</strong> (Frank-Starling law), <strong>activation</strong> of <strong>neurohormonal</strong> systems like the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and release of hormones like norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide. Myocardial adaptations can also occur resulting in <strong>cellular</strong> <strong>hypertrophy</strong> of the myocytes. </p>\n<p>LVH occurs due to increased mechanical work. However, the increased muscle mass has <strong>increased</strong> <strong>metabolic</strong> <strong>demands</strong> as well leading to a further <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>oxygen</strong> <strong>demand</strong>. This makes patients with LVH susceptible to <strong>ischemia</strong> and <strong>heart</strong> <strong>failure</strong>. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B - Right ventricular hypertrophy is characterized by <strong>tall R waves</strong> in <strong>lead V1,</strong> where R is bigger than the S wave, right axis deviation.
