This everts the hindfoot and corrects the forefoot out of supination. Finally, the <strong>equinus</strong> is corrected by <strong>dorsiflexing</strong> the foot at the<strong> ankle joint</strong>.

Hence, it only leads to an increase in ECF volume without causing any change in osmolarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagram 2 </strong>- The addition of excess NaCl to ECF pulls the fluid from ICF into the ECF. This results in a decreased volume of ICF, increased volume of ECF, and increased osmolarity in both ECF and ICF.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagram 3 </strong>- SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone) is associated with euvolemic hyponatremia. This leads to a decrease in the osmolarity of the ECF. This causes a fluid shift from the ECF to the ICF until the osmolarity of both compartments becomes equal. The fluid influx also leads to a decrease in the ICF's osmolarity.&nbsp;Therefore, the net effect is an increase in extracellular volume, an increase in intracellular volume, and a fall in osmolarity in both compartments.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagram 4 </strong>- Adrenal insufficiency is associated with hypo-osmotic volume contraction.

It has a proximal end connected to a breathing circuit while a distal end is connected to an elliptical cuff which can be inflated through a pilot tube.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is inserted in a deflated manner following lubrication blindly into the hypopharynx. After inflation, it forms a low-pressure seal around the laryngeal entry.&nbsp;Ideally positioned cuff will have the base of the tongue superiorly and the upper esophageal sphincter inferiorly. Pyriform sinuses should be present laterally.</p>\n<p>It is <strong>indicated</strong> in cases with <strong>difficult</strong> <strong>airways</strong> where endotracheal intubation is not possible or not available. It can be used as an alternative to an endotracheal tube for ventilating and oxygenating the patient.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Indications </strong>are acute trauma, difficult intubation, and laparoscopic surgeries, to facilitate fibreoptic intubation.</p>\n<p>LMA is relatively <strong>contraindicated</strong> in</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conditions that are associated with an increased risk of aspiration such as&nbsp;<strong>hiatus</strong>&nbsp;<strong>hernia</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>pregnancy</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The presence of a <strong>pharyngeal</strong> <strong>pathology</strong> such as an abscess or tumor, or a <strong>pharyngeal obstruction.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Low pulmonary compliance.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Advantages of LMA&nbsp;</strong>are hands-free operation, better seal, and easy-to-maintain airway.

This includes no duty owed to the plaintiff/ patient, the doctor's duty has been discharged according to prevailing standards, a scenario of misadventure<strong> </strong>that may be therapeutic, diagnostic, and experimental, or an error of judgment.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Res judicata </strong>- <strong>BNSS Section 337</strong> <strong>(CrPC 300) </strong>states that if a question of negligence against a doctor has already been decided by a court in a dispute between the doctor and his patient, the patient will not be allowed to contest the same question.</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Limitation</strong> or <strong>Res indicata</strong> indicates that a suit for damages for negligence should be filed against the doctor <strong>within two years</strong> from the date of alleged negligence. A suit <strong>filed after two years</strong> will be<strong> dismissed</strong>. But, where a breach of duty to provide care as per a particular contract between a patient and a doctor is committed, legal action can be initiated <strong>up to three years</strong> from the date of alleged negligence.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Novus Actus Interveniens</strong> is a situation where the cause of disability or death passes from the doctor to a later negligent action of some other person.

The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

Other risk factors include <strong>obesity</strong>, family history, <strong>mandibular deformities</strong>, and hypothyroidism.

Five or more episodes of apnea/ hypopnea per hour of sleep determined by a <strong>sleep study </strong>such as an overnight polysomnogram&nbsp;is a requirement for diagnosis. Such sleep studies, usually measure breathing, oxygenation, the position of the body, and cardiac rhythm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A polysomnogram helps to quantify sleep latency, <strong>sleep efficiency</strong>, and the time spent in each sleep stage.
