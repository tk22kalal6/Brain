It may be caused either due to the automatic origin of impulses from the Purkinje cells, myocardial cells, or reentry of the impulses to the ventricles through the scarred tissues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Patients will present with&nbsp;palpitations because of increased heart rate. Ineffective contractions of ventricles lead to dizziness, exercise intolerance, episodes of lightheadedness, and syncope.</p>\n<p>ECG findings are characterized by the presence of atrioventricular dissociation, that is, atria and ventricles have different rates of contraction. This is because the <strong>ectopic impulses </strong>originating in the<strong> ventricles</strong> cause them to contract independent of the impulses transmitted from the atria. Ventricular impulses give rise to the <strong>broad QRS</strong> complexes (&gt;120 msec) as seen in the ECG given.</p>\n<p>In some instances, when a P wave is conducted down the AV node to the ventricles, it fuses with the impulse originating from the ventricle.

Multiple appeals cannot be made.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Limitation</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Res indicata</strong>)&nbsp;- A suit for damages for negligence must be filed within 2 years from the date of alleged negligence against the doctor. A suit&nbsp;filed <strong>after two years </strong>will be dismissed. But, where a breach of duty to provide care as per a contract between a patient and a doctor is committed, legal action may be undertaken for&nbsp;<strong>up to three years</strong> from the date of alleged negligence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>'<strong>Res ipsa loquitur</strong>' means '<strong>the thing or fact speaks for itself'</strong>. It is obvious evidence of the negligent act committed, such as swabs left in the abdominal cavity post laparotomy.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Contributory negligence</h3><p><strong>Contributory negligence</strong> occurs when a <strong>patient</strong> or his <strong>personal attendant</strong> shows unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care, which when combined with the negligence of the doctor, has contributed to the injury. In this case, the patient&rsquo;s or attendant&rsquo;s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.</p>\n<p>So, contributory negligence occurs when <strong>both the doctor and patient are negligent</strong>. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient&rsquo;s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the<strong> patient:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.</li>\n<li>Fails to follow the doctor&rsquo;s instructions</li>\n<li>Refuses to take the treatment</li>\n<li>Leaves the hospital against doctor&rsquo;s advice</li>\n<li>Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contributory negligence is a defence </strong>for doctor&rsquo;s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the <strong>doctrine of comparative negligence</strong>, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>no</strong> <strong>proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is negligent</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<strong>Last clear chance doctrine: </strong>It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>gave proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (<strong>There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>In this patient with <strong>diabetic ketoacidosis</strong>, who would have a <strong>low blood pH</strong>, the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve would show a<strong> right shift,</strong> as seen in <strong>graph 1.</strong></p>\n<p>Hemoglobin exists in <strong>2 forms</strong> in the blood. The <strong>deoxyhemoglobin</strong> form is called the <strong>taut or T form</strong>. This hemoglobin has a low affinity for oxygen. The oxyhemoglobin form is called the relaxed or R form. This hemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen. </p>\n<p>In deoxyhemoglobin, the globin units are tightly bound in a <strong>tense (T) configuration, </strong>which <strong>reduces the affinity of the molecule for O<sub>2</sub>. </strong>When O<sub>2</sub> is first bound, the bonds holding the globin units are released, producing a <strong>relaxed</strong> <strong>(R) configuration, </strong>which exposes more O<sub>2</sub>-binding sites. The net result is a 500-fold increase in O<sub>2</sub> affinity.<sub> </sub>This increasing affinity is called <strong>positive cooperativity</strong>. In other words, the combination of the first heme in the tetramer with O<sub>2</sub> increases the affinity of the second heme for O<sub>2</sub>, and oxygenation of the second increases the affinity of the third, thereby resulting in the characteristic sigmoid shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.</p>\n<p>If the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the right, it means that the affinity of Hb for O<sub>2</sub> has become less, which <strong>favors O<sub>2</sub> delivery.</strong> This means a higher P50, means higher PO<sub>2</sub> is required to maintain 50% saturation (<strong>R - right shift releases oxygen</strong>).</p>\n<p>If the curve is shifted to the left, it means that <strong>affinity has increased</strong> for O<sub>2</sub> (which favors O<sub>2</sub> binding) i.e. lower P50 value. (<strong>L-Left shift Leashes oxygen</strong>).</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/77ef1eeb18a146c3abec10ea00a0c446x600x647.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

It is more commonly seen in diabetic nephropathy-induced destruction of juxtaglomerular apparatus, drugs like <strong>ACEI/ARBs</strong>, potassium-sparing diuretics, calcineurin inhibitors, NSAIDs, and heparin.</p>\n<p>The clinical features seen in Type IV RTA are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hyperkalemia</strong>: Hypoaldosteronism results in an increase in potassium concentration.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Metabolic acidosis</strong>: The important buffers in urine are ammonia and phosphate. Hyperkalemia impairs ammonia production in the proximal tubule, which reduces the buffering of hydrogen ions. This results in decreased hydrogen ion excretion.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Urinary pH&lt;5.5</strong>: Due to the decreased production of ammonia in the proximal tubule, excess protons are excreted in the renal tubules, thus decreasing the urinary pH.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>RTA type I</strong> (distal RTA) is seen in autoimmune diseases like Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, medullary sponge kidney disease, cirrhosis, drugs like amphotericin B, lithium, etc. The patients develop <strong>hypokalemia</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>metabolic acidosis</strong> with alkaline urine (urinary pH &gt;5.5).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>RTA type II</strong> (proximal RTA) is seen in Fanconi syndrome, Wilson's disease, heavy metals ingestion, etc., The patients develop <strong>hypokalemia</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>metabolic acidosis</strong> with acidic urine (urinary pH &lt;5.5). There is also the excretion of glucose, urate, and amino acids.</p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>RTA type III</strong> (mixed RTA) is seen in inherited mutations of carbonic anhydrase II.

Point A is at the end of systole when the ventricular volume is about <strong>50 mL</strong>. This volume is called <strong>end-systolic volume.</strong> The pressure at this point is about 2 to 3 mmHg. The volume and pressure go on increasing as the blood from the atrium flows to the ventricle during diastole. At the <strong>end </strong>of<strong> diastole</strong>, marked by point <strong>B</strong>, the ventricle will have a volume of <strong>around 120 mL</strong>. This volume is called <strong>end-diastolic volume.</strong> The pressure is slightly raised to 5-7 mmHg.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase II</strong>- It is the phase of <strong>isovolumetric contraction</strong>, and extends between <strong>points B</strong> and<strong>&nbsp;C</strong>. At the end of diastole (point B), a slight increase in the ventricular pressure <strong>closes</strong> the <strong>mitral valve</strong>, and contraction starts. The ventricle contracts while both mitral and aortic valves are closed. Therefore, the pressure within the ventricle slowly rises without any changes in the volume.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase III</strong>- It is the phase of <strong>ejection</strong> and extends between <strong>point C</strong> and <strong>point D</strong>. Point <strong>C</strong> is the place where the <strong>aortic </strong>valve <strong>opens</strong>. The pressure within the left ventricle rises slowly during isovolumetric contraction until it is sufficient to open the aortic valve. Once the aortic valve opens, blood within the left ventricle is ejected into the aorta. This decreases the volume of the left ventricle, while increasing the pressure within the ventricle.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase IV</strong>- It is the period of <strong>isovolumetric relaxation</strong>. It extends between <strong>points D</strong> and <strong>A</strong>. At the end of the ejection (Point D), the aortic valve closes. However, the ventricular relaxation continues despite closed aortic and mitral valves. Therefore, the ventricular pressure continues to fall while the volume remains the same. The ventricle returns to its starting point, with about 50 mL of blood left in the ventricle and pressure of about 2 to 3 mmHg.</p>\n<p><strong>End-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ESPVR</strong> is the <strong>maximum pressure</strong> that can be developed by the ventricle at the <strong>end-systolic volume</strong>. It is determined by the line intersecting the upper left corners of the loops. This line can be extended down to the x-axis. The slope of this line is called as ESPVR slope.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/76202439afbd4b4f88576c49193b05c2x1280x1316.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

It is indicated in invasive mucormycosis, fungal endophthalmitis following pars plana vitrectomy, and induction therapy in cryptococcal meningitis. </p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Griseofulvin</strong> acts by <strong>inhibiting microtubule assembly</strong>, disrupting the fungal cell division. It is the drug of choice for tinea capitis in children. It is also effective in treating ringworm of glabrous skin, tinea cruris, tinea corprosis, tinea pedis, and tinea of the hands and beard. </p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>Terbinafine</strong> acts by <strong>inhibiting</strong> <strong>epoxidation of fungal squalene</strong> that<strong> </strong>reduces ergosterol biosynthesis.

Within a few days, the excitability of the myenteric plexus increases, resulting in strong secondary peristaltic waves.</p>\n<p>There are two types of esophageal peristaltic movements: primary and secondary.</p>\n<p><strong>A. Primary</strong> <strong>peristalsis </strong>occurs as a <strong>continuation of the peristaltic wave</strong> that begins in the <strong>pharynx</strong> and spreads into the esophagus during the pharyngeal stage of swallowing. It passes from the pharynx to the esophagus, within about <strong>8 to 10 seconds. </strong>However, due to the effect of <strong>gravity</strong> in an upright position, the food passes within <strong>5 to 8 seconds.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>B. Secondary peristalsis </strong>occurs if the <strong>primary peristaltic wave failed</strong> to empty the food from the esophagus into the stomach. Secondary peristalsis is initiated by the <strong>distension</strong> of the esophageal wall by the retained food. Waves continue until all the food is emptied into the stomach. Secondary peristaltic waves are initiated partly by<strong> intrinsic neural circuits</strong> in the <strong>myenteric nervous</strong> system <strong>and</strong> partly by<strong> reflexes that begin in the pharynx. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Control of peristaltic waves: </strong>The musculature of the pharyngeal wall and <strong>upper third of the esophagus</strong> is <strong>striated muscle.</strong> These regions are controlled by skeletal nerve impulses from the <strong>glossopharyngeal</strong> and <strong>vagus</strong> nerves.</p>\n<p>The musculature of the <strong>lower two-thirds</strong> of the esophagus is <strong>smooth muscle.</strong> This region is strongly controlled by the <strong>vagus</strong> nerves, which act through connections with the esophagal myenteric nervous system.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect of obliteration of vagal input to the esophagus</strong>: When the vagal nerves are cut, or the vagal input is obliterated by any other cause such as stroke, the <strong>primary peristalsis,</strong> solely dependent on the vagal innervation, is <strong>eliminated. </strong></p>\n<p>However, the <strong>intrinsic</strong> <strong>myenteric nerve plexus</strong> of the esophagus becomes excitable within days, causes strong <strong>secondary peristaltic waves</strong>. Therefore, even after paralysis of the brain stem swallowing reflex, food fed by a tube into the esophagus passes into the stomach due to the secondary peristaltic movements.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The correct sequence of cellular events that occurs during inflammation is as follows: <strong>Rolling, Cytokine-mediated integrin activation, Adhesion, Migration</strong>.</p>\n<p>The recruitment of leucocytes to the site of inflammation is a multi-step process that is mediated by adhesion molecules and cytokines called chemokines. This process can be divided into sequential phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the lumen: margination, <strong>rolling</strong> and <strong>adhesion</strong> to the endothelium occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Migration</strong> of the leucocytes across the endothelium and vessel wall</li>\n<li><strong>Migration</strong> in the tissues towards a chemotactic stimulus.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The process of leucocyte recruitment is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Margination: Because of the dilation of the inflamed postcapillary venues, there is stasis of blood flow, and hence, more leucocytes assume a peripheral position along the endothelial surface; this process of leucocyte redistribution is called margination.</li>\n<li><strong>Rolling</strong>: The slowed down leucocytes then sense the signals from the endothelium and start rolling on the vessel wall.</li>\n<li><strong>Cytokine-mediated integrin activation</strong>: The attachment of leucocytes to the endothelial cells requires adhesion molecules that are activated by cytokines. The major families of proteins involved in adhesion and migration are <strong>selectins</strong> and <strong>integrins</strong> and their ligands.</li>\n<li><strong>Adhesions</strong>: The weak rolling interactions slow down the leucocytes and allow them to bind more firmly to the endothelium. <strong>Chemokines</strong> that were produced at the site of injury bind to the endothelial cell proteoglycans. These chemokines then bind to the rolling leucocytes and activate them. This, in turn, converts the ligands for β1 and β2 integrins, <strong>VLA-4,</strong> and <strong>LFA-1 </strong>present on the leucocytes to a <strong>high-affinity state</strong>.</li>\n<li>This combination of cytokine-induced expression of integrin ligands on the endothelium and increased integrin affinity on the leucocytes leads to firm <strong>adhesion</strong> of leucocytes to the endothelium at the site of inflammation.</li>\n<li>Leucocyte<strong> migration</strong>: This is the movement of leucocytes through the intact endothelium, called transmigration or diapedesis. This occurs in postcapillary venules. This migration occurs through the inter-endothelial gap towards the chemical concentration gradient created by the chemokines at the site of injury. This occurs with the help of adhesion molecules present in the intercellular junctions such as <strong>platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule</strong> (<strong>PECAM-1</strong>) or <strong>CD31</strong>. </li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/13f6cf1070f84ca2831df8bddc1eb8ecx1280x1743.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Principal Mediators of Inflammation and Their Source</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mediator</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Source</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Histamine</td>\n<td>Mast&ensp;cells,&ensp;basophils,&ensp;platelets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prostaglandins</td>\n<td>Mast&ensp;cells,&ensp;leukocytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leukotrienes</td>\n<td>Mast&ensp;cells,&ensp;leukocytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cytokines&ensp;(TNF,&ensp;IL-1,&ensp;IL-6)</td>\n<td>Macrophages,&ensp;endothelial&ensp;cells, mast&ensp;cells</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chemokines</td>\n<td>Leukocytes,&ensp;activated&ensp;macrophages</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platelet-activating&ensp;factor</td>\n<td>Leukocytes,&ensp;mast&ensp;cells</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complement</td>\n<td>Plasma&ensp;(produced&ensp;in&ensp;liver)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kinins</td>\n<td>Plasma&ensp;(produced&ensp;in&ensp;liver)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Various actions of Principal Mediators of Inflammation</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Histamine</td>\n<td>Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, endothelial activation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prostaglandins</td>\n<td>Vasodilation, pain, fever</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leukotrienes</td>\n<td>Increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis, leukocyte adhesion, and activation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cytokines (TNF, IL-1, IL-6)</td>\n<td>\n<p>Local: endothelial activation (expression of adhesion molecules).</p>\n<p>Systemic: fever, metabolic abnormalities, hypotension (shock)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chemokines</td>\n<td>Chemotaxis, leukocyte activation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platelet-activating factor</td>\n<td>Vasoconstriction, Vasodilation (at low concentration), increased vascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion, chemotaxis, degranulation, oxidative burst</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complement</td>\n<td>Leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, direct target killing (membrane attack complex), vasodilation (mast cell stimulation)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kinins</td>\n<td>Increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, vasodilation, pain</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>Note: Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is a prostaglandin, which is a potent <strong>vasoconstrictor</strong></p>",
