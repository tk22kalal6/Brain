It codes for <strong>fibrocystin</strong>/<strong>polyductin</strong> (FPC), a membrane protein present in the cells of the cortical and medullary collecting ducts.</p>\n<p>Affected fetuses show greatly enlarged kidneys and reduced fetal urine production. This leads to <strong>oligohydramnios </strong>and pulmonary hypoplasia. About 30% of neonates die soon after birth due to <strong>respiratory</strong> <strong>insufficiency</strong>. Most <strong>deaths</strong> occur in the first month of life. Some patients are born with end-stage renal disease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some patients are diagnosed after the neonatal period. The complications in this age group include progressive renal failure, liver disease, and hypertension. The important features of ARPKD liver disease are congenital hepatic fibrosis and dilatation of intra-hepatic bile ducts.(Caroli disease)</p>\n<p>Investigations include CT, MRI, and ultrasonography. Molecular diagnosis is difficult due to the large and complex structure of the PKHD1 genome. However, presymptomatic screening of family members of affected individuals is a feasible option.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no specific treatment for ARPKD. Treatment involves neonatal intensive care, blood pressure control, dialysis, and kidney transplantation.

It is most commonly seen in the <strong>diaphysis</strong> of the <strong>proximal femur</strong>. They most often present with <strong>pain</strong> that is classically <strong>worse at night</strong> and relieved by <strong>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</strong>. Plain X-ray demonstrates an area of dense sclerosis with a small rounded area of osteolysis. The preferred treatment is <strong>CT-guided radiofrequency ablation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Chondrosarcoma</strong> is the second most common primary malignant bone tumor after osteosarcoma. It can present between the 3rd and 8th decades of life. They are <strong>slow-growing tumors</strong> that produce deep pain with an enlarging mass and arise in any bone derived from enchondral ossification. Radiographically, they appear as large, intraosseous, osteolytic tumors with irregular, granular calcifications, giving a <strong>honeycomb </strong>or <strong>popcorn </strong>appearance. CT and MRI are useful in the diagnosis. Chondrosarcoma is <strong>resistant</strong> to both <strong>chemotherapy and radiation</strong>. Surgical excision is the only treatment.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Ewing sarcoma</strong> is related to <strong>neuroectodermal tumors</strong> and arises from the mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow. The characteristic translocation involved is <strong><em>t(11:22). </em></strong>The tumor<strong> </strong>usually develops between 10 and 20 years of age and is usually located in the diaphysis of the long bones (<strong>femur-most common</strong>). Pain is followed by swelling and a low-grade fever. On radiography, a periosteal reaction with an '<strong>onion peel'</strong> appearance is seen.

This <strong>desensitizes the pituitary</strong> to the action of GnRH and a <strong>hypogonadotropic-hypogonadal</strong> state is induced.

In the case of a 70-year-old man undergoing long-term GnRH agonist therapy for prostate cancer, the expected outcome would be decreased levels of FSH, LH, and testosterone due to the prolonged suppression of GnRH signaling.</p>",

Within <strong>24-48 hours,</strong> <strong>epithelial cells</strong> from both edges of the wound begin to migrate and form a thin layer of epidermis over the wound. By <strong>day 3,</strong> macrophages replace neutrophils<strong>,</strong> and <strong>granulation tissue</strong> starts forming.

This action is inhibited by <strong>anti-apoptotic proteins (</strong>represented by the group<strong> \"X\" </strong>in the image).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Apoptosis</strong> is a <strong>pathway</strong> of <strong>cell death</strong> that is induced by a closely regulated suicide program in which cells destined to die&nbsp;<strong>activate</strong> <strong>intrinsic</strong> <strong>enzymes </strong>(<strong>caspases</strong>) that <strong>degrade</strong> the cell nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism of apoptosis:&nbsp;</strong>There are two distinct pathways that can lead to caspase activation and cause apoptosis of the cell.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway</li>\n<li>The death receptor or extrinsic pathway</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are several proteins in the mitochondria that can induce apoptosis. These include&nbsp;<strong>cytochrome c</strong>&nbsp;and some proteins that neutralize the endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis.</li>\n<li>The <strong>permeability</strong> of the mitochondria is controlled by the <strong>BCL-2</strong> family of proteins, which act as sensors.</li>\n<li>These sensors are activated when the cells are deprived of growth factors and other survival signals are exposed to agents that damage the DNA or accumulate a large number of misfolded proteins.</li>\n<li>These activated sensors,&nbsp;in turn, activate the&nbsp;<strong>proapoptotic molecules</strong>,&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>BAX</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>BAK</strong>, which form channels in the mitochondrial membrane, through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol and cause activation of&nbsp;<strong>caspase-9</strong>, which in turn leads to the activation of the caspase cascade and, eventually, apoptosis of the cell.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, if all the growth factors and other survival signals are present, then they produce more&nbsp;<strong>antiapoptotic</strong>&nbsp;<strong>members</strong>&nbsp;of the BH1-4 family like the&nbsp;<strong>BCL2, MCL 1,</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>BCL</strong>-<strong>XL</strong>. These proteins limit the escape of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The death-receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death receptors are surface molecules that are members of the<strong>&nbsp;tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family</strong>&nbsp;like the&nbsp;<strong>TNF 1</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Fas (CD 95).</strong></li>\n<li>These receptors are expressed on the surface of many cells and can trigger apoptosis. In the cytoplasmic region, these receptors have a death domain.</li>\n<li><strong>Fas ligand (FasL)</strong>&nbsp;is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T-lymphocytes. <strong>Fas-FasL</strong> interactions are required for thymic medullary negative selection. Defective interactions also cause <strong>autoimmune</strong> <strong>lymphoproliferative</strong> <strong>syndrome</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When these T-cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL, their cytoplasmic death domains form a binding site for an adaptor protein called&nbsp;Fas-associated death domain (<strong>FADD</strong>).</li>\n<li>These,&nbsp;in turn, recruit and activate&nbsp;<strong>caspase-8 and -10</strong>.</li>\n<li>In many cell types, caspase-8 and -10 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called&nbsp;<strong>Bid</strong>, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway.</li>\n<li>The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell.</li>\n<li>Cellular proteins, notably, a caspase antagonist called&nbsp;<strong>FLIP</strong>, block the activation of caspases downstream of the death receptors. Interestingly, some viruses produce homologs of FLIP, and it is suggested that this is a mechanism that viruses use to keep infected cells alive.</li>\n<li>The death receptor pathway is involved in the&nbsp;elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes and in the killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following image shows a diagrammatic representation of the mechanisms of apoptosis:&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/730eb17d957846f2a1b7f8d9082d02f8x1280x2420.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Apoptotic genes</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Group</td>\n<td>Members</td>\n<td>Details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anti-apoptotlc</td>\n<td>BCL2,<br />BCL-XL<br /><br />MCL1</td>\n<td>Present in outer mitochondrial&nbsp;membrane<br />Prevent leakage of cytochrome-c and<br />other death lnducing proteins into<br />cytosol.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pro-apoptotlc</td>\n<td>BAX,<br />BAK</td>\n<td>On activation, they increase&nbsp;mitochondrial membrane permeability.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stress Sensors</td>\n<td>BAD,<br />BIM,<br />BID,<br />Puma, Noxa</td>\n<td>Act as sensors of cellular stress and&nbsp;damage and regulate the balance<br />between the other two groups</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
