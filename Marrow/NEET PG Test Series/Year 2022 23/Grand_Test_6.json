It is not a management approach. The factors that are associated with increased risk of spontaneous expulsion of the IUCD are age &lt;20 years and nulliparity. Expulsion tends to occur at the time of menstruation and is associated with cramping, bleeding, and vaginal discharge.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here the IUCD has caused perforation of the uterus and is lodged outside the uterus, hence, <strong>spontaneous expulsion</strong> will <strong>not </strong>be <strong>possible. </strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification Of Contraceptives Based On Effectiveness</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Category</td>\n<td>Failure rate in first year</td>\n<td>Contraceptive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>First tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&lt; 2 %</td>\n<td>IUCD, Implants, Sterilization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Second tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;3-9 %</td>\n<td>Hormonal - oral, injected, transdermal patches, transvaginal rings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Third tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;10-20 %</td>\n<td>Barrier, Fertility awareness method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fourth tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;21-30 %</td>\n<td>Spermicidal preparations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Clinical features include <strong>episodic vertigo</strong>, <strong>fluctuating hearing loss</strong>, <strong>tinnitus</strong>, and <strong>aural fullness</strong>. It is generally a <strong>unilateral</strong> condition. The symptoms appear in <strong>clusters</strong> with remission periods lasting from weeks to years. <strong>Nystagmus</strong> may also be seen during acute attacks. <strong>Tumarkin's otolithic crisis</strong> is a variant where affected individuals experience sudden <strong>drop attacks</strong> without loss of consciousness.</p>\n<p>Rinne's test is positive and Weber's test shows lateralization to the better ear, suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss. Pure tone audiometry (PTA) also shows <strong>sensorineural hearing loss</strong>. Initially, the lower frequencies are affected resulting in a '<strong>rising</strong>' curve. As the disease progresses, higher frequencies are affected leading to a '<strong>flat</strong>' or '<strong>falling</strong>' curve. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4d04d206bf0349899f7f8b56a39900b5x720x738.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>General treatment measures include reassurance, smoking cessation, and <strong>dietary restriction of salt</strong>, coffee, tea, and alcohol. An excessive amount of water intake is also discouraged.</p>\n<p>Acute attacks can be treated with bed rest and <strong>vestibular sedatives</strong> like dimenhydrinate, promethazine theoclate, or prochlorperazine. Chronic cases are managed with <strong>vasodilators </strong>(betahistine) and <strong>diuretics</strong>. Repeated <strong>intratympanic injection</strong> of <strong>gentamicin</strong> can help 60-80% of patients. </p>\n<p><strong>Surgical procedures</strong> can be done if medical management fails. These include decompression of the endolymphatic sac, endolymphatic shunt operation, sacculotomy (<strong>Fick's operation</strong>), and intermittent low-pressure pulse therapy. <strong>Labyrinthectomy</strong> is done only when the cochlear function cannot be salvaged.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Vestibular neuronitis</strong> is characterized by <strong>sudden onset vertigo</strong> lasting from a few days to a few weeks.

It presents with nausea, vomiting, spontaneous nystagmus, and <strong>total hearing loss</strong>. Affected individuals also suffer from <strong>vertigo</strong> which resolves in a few weeks.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo</strong> (BPPV) is characterized by <strong>vertigo</strong> when the patient places their head in a <strong>critical position</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>The structure marked in the above image is the <strong>left recurrent laryngeal nerve. </strong>Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis will lead to <strong>initial hoarseness</strong> <strong>of voice,</strong> which may<strong> improve</strong> with time.</p>\n<p>Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis can be unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral palsy is more common on the <strong>left side</strong> because of the long course of the nerve. They are more commonly injured during <strong>thyroid surgeries</strong>, neck trauma, thyroid disease, and<strong> bronchogenic carcinoma.</strong></p>\n<p>The recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies all the muscles of the larynx except for the <strong>cricothyroid.</strong> Therefore, in unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, these muscles are paralysed. The affected vocal cord lies in the <strong>paramedian position </strong>(option B).</p>\n<p>Postoperatively, the injury can go <strong>unnoticed,</strong> or the patient may complain of <strong>mild hoarseness in the voice</strong>. This hoarseness is because the paralysed muscle cannot close the glottis during phonation.</p>\n<p>Hoarseness might <strong>improve</strong> over time because the unaffected muscle compensates and closes the glottis by hyperadduction of the cord. The patient will not have difficulty in breathing or stridor (option C).</p>\n<p>Generally, <strong>no treatmen</strong>t is required (option A). Laryngoplasty type I is needed if there is no compensation from the normal muscle.</p>\n<p>In <strong>bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, </strong>both the vocal cords are paralysed and assume the paramedian position. Because the vocal cords are close to the midline, the <strong>phonation</strong> can be<strong> normal</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>A patient developing skin necrosis a few days after starting a new drug is likely to be suffering from <strong>warfarin-induced skin necrosis.</strong></p>\n<p>Warfarin is an <strong>anti-coagulant</strong> which acts by <strong>competitive inhibition</strong> of the enzyme <strong>vitamin K epoxide reductase</strong> thereby preventing the activation of <strong>coagulation factors II, VII, IX,</strong> <strong>X</strong> and <strong>proteins C and S</strong>. Adverse effects of warfarin are bleeding, <strong>skin necrosis, p</strong><strong>urple toe syndrome,</strong> and <strong>f</strong><strong>etal warfarin syndrome</strong> (hypoplasia of the nose, eye socket, hand bones, and growth retardation). Skin necrosis<strong> </strong>is a rare, potentially life-threatening side-effect of <strong>warfarin</strong> use that usually begins <strong>2-5 days after initiation</strong> of therapy.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/57ffb4c6c8b44dfb91185f5d5252e871x1279x1234.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Individuals with <strong>Protein C &amp; S deficiency</strong> are, particularly at <strong>risk</strong> for developing warfarin-induced skin necrosis. This is because these proteins, which are <strong>anti-thrombotic</strong>, have a <strong>shorter half-life</strong> as compared to the clotting factors inhibited by warfarin. Initiation of warfarin caused a <strong>sudden drop</strong> in the levels of protein C and S before they inhibit the clotting factors, due to which there is <strong>hypercoagulability</strong> and consequent <strong>thrombosis of microvasculature</strong> which leads to necrosis. The toes, thighs, buttocks and breasts are commonly involved.</p>\n<p>This adverse effect can be <strong>prevented by co-administration</strong> of warfarin with a <strong>parenteral anticoagulant</strong> such as heparin in the <strong>initial few days</strong>, until the therapeutic INR range is achieved, before continuing with warfarin alone.</p>\n<p>Treatment of this condition is by immediately discontinuing warfarin. <strong>Vitamin K </strong>can be administered<strong> for reversal </strong>of the drug effect. Patients are started on an<strong> alternative anticoagulant</strong> such as heparin or LMWH.</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Aspirin acts by irreversibly inhibiting the enzymes <strong>cyclo-oxygenase </strong>and <strong>thromboxane</strong>. It is an <strong>antiplatelet </strong>drug and the most important side effects include bleeding tendencies. </p>\n<p>Option C: Atorvastatin is a statin drug which inhibits the enzyme <strong>HMG CoA reductase</strong>. Important side effects inclue myositis and hepatotoxicity.</p>\n<p>Option D: Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone which inhibits the enzyme <strong>DNA gyrase</strong>.

As a result, it induces the metabolism of <strong>OCPs</strong>, steroids, HIV protease inhibitors, and phenytoin which are metabolized by this microsomal enzyme.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Isoniazid</strong> is a first-line bactericidal drug that is used for the treatment of tuberculosis. This drug enters bacilli by <strong>passive diffusion</strong>. It then gets activated to its toxic form by the enzyme <strong>catalase-peroxidase</strong>(the enzyme encoded by the <strong>Kat gene</strong>).</p>\n<p>Normally, InhA and KasA are involved in the synthesis of mycolic acid. Upon activation, the reactive metabolite of isoniazid forms complexes with <strong>NAD</strong> that inhibit <strong>InhA</strong> and <strong>KasA</strong>. Hence, isoniazid inhibits the production of <strong>mycolic acid</strong>.</p>\n<p>The reactive isoniazid metabolite also forms complexes with <strong>NADP</strong>. This complex inhibits mycobacterial dihydrofolate reductase which results in the interruption of <strong>DNA synthesis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Pyrazinamide</strong> is a prodrug that is activated by the enzyme pyrazinamidase(encoded by the <strong>pncA gene</strong>). It is converted into an active metabolite pyrazinoic acid. This metabolite makes the intracellular environment acidic which collapses the <strong>transmembrane proton motive force, </strong>thereby killing the bacteria. Hepatotoxicity and hyperuricemia are the common side effects.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Ethambutol</strong> inhibits arabinose transferase III, thereby decreasing arabinogalactan biosynthesis. This results in, disruption in mycobacterial <strong>cell wall synthesis</strong>. The important side effect of ethambutol is <strong>optic neuritis</strong>, resulting in decreased visual acuity and <strong>loss of red-green discrimination.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Enzymes of Purine Synthesis Pathway and Their Regulators</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Enzymes</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Regulators</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>PRPP Glutamyl Amidotransferase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Inhibited by Amp &amp; GMP</p>\n<p>Activator &nbsp;PRPP</p>\n<p>Activated by Glutamine</p>\n<p>Diazanorleucine(inhibitor)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>PRPP synthetase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Activator pi</p>\n<p>Inhibitors &nbsp;purine ribonucleotides</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Formyltransferase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Methotrexate, Anti-folate drugs</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>VI Synthetase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Azaserine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Adenylosuccinase ,IMP Dehydrogenase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>6-mercaptopurine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>IMP Dehydrogenase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>mycophenolic acid</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: General properties of the first line drugs in TB</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>First-line drugs</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Isoniazid</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Rifampicin</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Pyrazinamide</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Ethambutol</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Mechanism</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Bactericidal</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Bactericidal</span></div>\n<div><span>(Maximum)</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Bactericidal</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Bacteriostatic</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Location of Mycobacteria</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Intracellular +&nbsp; Extracellular</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Intracellular +&nbsp; Extracellular</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Intracellular</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Extracellular</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Metabolism</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Liver</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Liver</span></div>\n<div><span>(Maximum)</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Liver</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Kidney</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Anemia responds well to the<strong> administration of uridine</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Gout</strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> is a metabolic disease associated with hyperuricemia. It is characterized by the deposition of&nbsp;<strong>monosodium urate&nbsp;crystals</strong>&nbsp;in joints and connective tissue. It usually presents as painful <strong>monoarthritis</strong> that mainly involves the metatarsophalangeal joints of the <strong>first toe</strong>.<br /></span></p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Severe combined immune deficiency </strong>(SCID) occurs due to a deficiency in <strong>adenosine deaminase</strong>, an enzyme of purine metabolism. This results in the accumulation of adenosine metabolites. This causes premature cell death of B, T and NK cells. Children with SCID present with <strong>recurrent oral candidiasis</strong>, failure to thrive, diarrhea and interstitial pneumonitis.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Copper deficiency </strong>is usually seen in a condition called <strong>Menkes kinky hair syndrome</strong>. Children usually present with intellectual disability, hypocupremia, and decreased circulating ceruloplasmin.</p>",
