It acts on ER receptors at the level of the hypothalamus and inhibits estrogenic negative feedback resulting in increased pulsatile GnRH secretion and subsequent release of FSH and LH. It has antiestrogenic action when endogenous estrogen levels are high (partial agonist).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Recombinant hCG has LH activity and is used in patients with hypogonadotropic amenorrhoea.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Metformin</strong> is an insulin sensitizer used in the treatment of Polycystic ovarian syndrome.
