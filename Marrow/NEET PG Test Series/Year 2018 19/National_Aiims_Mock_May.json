Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. </p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. </p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Crush Syndrome </strong></p>\n<p>Crush syndrome is the systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis.

When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",

Thallium single photon emission computed tomography is useful in differentiating cerebral toxoplasmosis from cerebral lymphoma. Primary CNS lymphoma is rarer than cerebral toxoplasmosis in HIV infection. Generally, patients with multiple ring-enhancing lesions on the CT scan with mass effect are treated empirically for toxoplasma infection for two weeks with a combination of pyrimethamine and sulphadiazine.

The type of bladder rupture depends on the location of the injury and its relationship with the peritoneal reflection as below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"half_rhythm\">\n<div>If the bladder rupture is above the peritoneal reflection (on the&nbsp;<strong>bladder dome),</strong>&nbsp;the urine&nbsp;extravasation will be&nbsp;<strong>intraperitoneal.</strong></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"half_rhythm\">\n<div>If the bladder rupture is&nbsp;<strong>below</strong>&nbsp;the peritoneal reflection and not on the dome, the urine extravasation will be&nbsp;<strong>extraperitoneal.</strong></div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Extraperitoneal</strong>&nbsp;bladder rupture is the&nbsp;<strong>most common</strong>.&nbsp;Extraperitoneal bladder rupture is caused by blunt trauma or surgical damage.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Intraperitoneal</strong>&nbsp;bladder rupture is caused by a blow or falls on the&nbsp;<strong>distended bladder</strong>. Intraperitoneal bladder rupture manifests as sudden severe pain in the hypogastrium and syncope. There will be an associated increase in BUN and creatinine due to systemic absorption of the extravasated urine and it may also lead to chemical peritonitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigations :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CT</strong> is the&nbsp;<strong>ideal investigation </strong>for diagnosing bladder rupture. A plain erect <strong>X-ray</strong>&nbsp;may show a <strong>ground-glass</strong> appearance. Intravenous urography (<strong>IVU</strong>) may confirm a <strong>leak</strong>. <strong>Retrograde cystography</strong> will <strong>confirm</strong> the diagnosis. It is important to image the patient after drainage of contrast as the full bladder may mask extravasation.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment :</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extravesical injury&ndash; catheter drainage for 10 days\u0003</li>\n<li>Intraperitoneal injury&ndash; laparotomy, repair, and bladder drainage (suprapubic and urethral catheter).

Hormones or ligands bind to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which is a transmembrane protein on the cell surface. The GPCR, once activated by the hormone, then interacts with the G protein to initiate signaling. </p>\n<p>Option B: In the resting state, the G protein exists as a trimer (alpha, beta, and gamma subunits bound together). However, for the G protein to act, it must dissociate into two parts: the alpha subunit and the beta-gamma dimer. This dissociation occurs when the G protein is activated (GTP replaces GDP on the alpha subunit). </p>\n<p>Option D: In the resting state, the G protein is bound to GDP (guanosine diphosphate), not GTP. When a ligand activates the GPCR, the receptor causes the G protein to exchange GDP for GTP. This exchange triggers the activation of the G protein, leading to the dissociation of the alpha subunit from the beta-gamma dimer. The G protein is considered active only when bound to GDP..</p>",
