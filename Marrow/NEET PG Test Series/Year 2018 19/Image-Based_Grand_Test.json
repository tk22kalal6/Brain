It is caused by the release of histamine due to degranulation of the mast cells.

However, when associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain and distension, it is referred to as <strong>Chilaiditi syndrome.</strong> </p>\n<p>An erect X-ray showing this sign may mislead clinicians into suspecting pneumoperitoneum, prompting unnecessary urgent surgical intervention, which is not required. To differentiate Chilaiditi syndrome from true pneumoperitoneum, a <strong>contrast-enhanced CT </strong>or a<strong> left lateral decubitus radiograph</strong> can be performed. In the left lateral decubitus view, distended colonic loops with <strong>haustral markings</strong> will be visible, showing that the air is within the bowel and not in the peritoneal cavity. </p>\n<p>Other conditions with the Chilaiditi sign are curvilinear pulmonary collapse, distended viscus, omental fat, and apposition of gas-distended bowel loops mimicking the double-wall sign.</p>\n<p>Below is the chest X-ray and CT showing the presence of herniated bowel loops under the diaphragm.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1eb94e5aa9794d82b391bb59ec3815c1x1100x900.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7b873798d05f4ec2a95d763aa06ffc48x629x596.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows free intraperitoneal gas which is suggestive of<strong> pneumoperitoneum</strong>.

The pressure from the collected gas displaces the two lobes of the thymic tissue upward and laterally from its normal position. This results in large, wedge-shaped opacities on radiograph resembling the spinnaker headsails of a boat.  Other signs of pneumomediastinum are<strong> </strong>the<strong> V sign of Naclerio</strong> and<strong> continuous diaphragm</strong> sign. </p>\n<p>Below is a chest X-ray showing spinnaker sign and CT showing the presence of pneumomediastinum.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/81476a2fb96645928ea52c43d1531f87x510x500.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5f5915a981de46109d2ad93a25b1c18ax442x301.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
