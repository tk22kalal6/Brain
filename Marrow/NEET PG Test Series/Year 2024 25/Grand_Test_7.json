In Marfan's syndrome, <strong>ectopia lentis</strong> is usually <strong>superotemporal.</strong></p>\n<p>Marfan syndrome is an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> condition. It involves a mutation in the <strong>fibrillin 1 gene</strong> (FBN1). It has classic cardiovascular, ocular, and musculoskeletal abnormalities. </p>\n<p>The most common ocular change in Marfan syndrome is <strong>bilateral ectopia lentis</strong>, seen in 80% of patients. <strong>Ectopia lentis</strong> is a hereditary or acquired <strong>displacement of the lens </strong>from its normal position. It may be partially or fully displaced. In Marfan syndrome, it is usually a superotemporal subluxation. The zonules are intact so accommodation is not affected. However, in severe cases, the lens may also dislocate into the anterior chamber or the vitreous. </p>\n<p>Other causes of ectopia lentis are as follows: </p>\n<p>Acquired: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trauma</li>\n<li>Pseudoexfoliation</li>\n<li>Inflammation</li>\n<li>Hypermature cataract</li>\n<li>Large eye due to myopia or buphthalmos</li>\n<li>Anterior uveal tumors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without systemic associations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familial ectopia lentis</li>\n<li>Ectopia lentis et pupillae</li>\n<li>Aniridia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With systemic associations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marfan syndrome</strong></li>\n<li>Homocystinuria - inferonasal</li>\n<li>Weill-Marchesani syndrome - inferior subluxation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other ocular manifestations of Marfan syndrome are glaucoma due to angle anomaly, lattice retinal degeneration and detachment, hypoplasia of the dilator pupillae. </p>\n<p>The most characteristic<strong> </strong>cardiac abnormality is <strong>aortic root dilation</strong>, which leads to regurgitation, aneurysmal dilation, and dissection, which is a cause of mortality. <strong>Mitral valve prolapse</strong> can also occur.

TB causes<strong> bony destruction</strong> of the roof of the Fallopius canal, which houses the facial nerve, resulting in <strong>facial palsy</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong> of TB otitis media is done by AFB<strong> </strong>of the ear discharge,<strong> </strong>histopathology of the granulation tissue, or more recently, <strong>TB-PCR</strong> and DNA probe<strong> </strong>assays, which yield faster results. Further clinical correlation with Chest X-ray, Sputum AFB, etc, is done to confirm the diagnosis and identify the primary focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Complications</strong> like <strong>facial palsy</strong>, mastoiditis, <strong>osteomyelitis</strong>, etc, necessitate further evaluation with imaging modalities like HRCT Temporal bone to visualize the extent of bony destruction before deciding on management. In case there is only soft tissue swelling around the facial nerve, corticosteroids are given to reduce inflammation. In more severe cases,<strong> </strong>decompression surgery may be done.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> of TB otitis media includes initiation of <strong>ATT </strong>(Anti-tubercular treatment).</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/008e76fe54d4430183d768414d343308x850x828.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Note:</p>\n<p>Statement 1: <strong>Antivirals</strong> have no role in TB otitis media. However, they are combined with corticosteroids and given to patients with a suspected <strong>viral etiology</strong> of facial palsy. In this patient, the cause of facial palsy is not viral infection but otitis media.</p>\n<p>Statement 2: <strong>Myringoplasty </strong>should never be performed in a <strong>wet ear</strong>(ear with active discharge). It is necessary to do an HRCT temporal bone to look for <strong>ossicular chain status</strong> as it may frequently undergo necrosis in TB otitis media. Again, myringoplasty cannot be done if the ossicular chain is not intact.</p>",

Indications for this procedure are horner syndrome and mild congenital ptosis.</p>\n<p>In this operation, the upper eyelid is everted and the <strong>upper tarsus</strong> is identified and<strong> excised</strong>.

Newer generations of synthetic opioids exert variable actions on these receptors, i.e., as agonists, partial agonists, or competitive antagonists. </p>\n<p>The overall pattern of an agent's effect depends on the relative affinity for these receptors.

It has an <strong>NMDA receptor antagonist</strong> activity and is used for <strong>maintenance therapy</strong> in rehab clinics.</p>\n<p><strong>Pentazocine</strong> is the first <strong>agonist-antagonist</strong> to be used as an analgesic. It is a <strong>partial agonist at mu</strong> receptor and has more <strong>marked K agonistic </strong>actions.<strong> </strong>Analgesia caused by pentazocine has a lower ceiling and is primarily

The next</strong> step in his management would be to perform<strong> a pericardiocentesis.</strong></p>\n<p>Cardiac tamponade is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space leading to <strong>impairment of diastolic relaxation</strong> of the cardiac chambers. This leads to a decline in cardiac output. The characteristic signs of cardiac tamponade are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tachycardia and<strong> hypotension</strong></li>\n<li>Pericardial rub</li>\n<li><strong>Pulsus paradoxus</strong> - paradoxical reduction in the systemic blood pressure <strong>(&gt;10 mm Hg)</strong> on inspiration.</li>\n<li><strong>Beck's triad</strong> - <strong>hypotension, muffled heart sounds,</strong> and <strong>elevated jugular venous pressure</strong> with prominent x descent and absent y descent. The sensitivity of jugular venous distention in detecting tamponade is 100%.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ECG shows reduced voltage and <strong>electrical alternans</strong>; an Echocardiogram shows a <strong>swinging heart sign</strong>.</p>\n<p>In a patient with clinical features suggestive of tamponade, the best course of action is performing <strong>pericardiocentesis</strong>, preferably carried out under echocardiographic guidance. Definitive management includes emergency thoracotomy or sternotomy </p>\n<p>Risk factors for aortic dissection:<br />1. <strong>Hypertension</strong> (most common risk factor)<br />2. Atherosclerosis (<strong>second most common</strong> risk factor)<br />3. Known/prior aortic aneurysm or dissection<br />5. Diabetes <br />6. Marfan syndrome<br />7. Cocaine use, particularly in younger patients.</p>\n<p>An aortic dissection is initiated by an <strong>intimal tear</strong>, which allows blood to penetrate the medial layer, producing a cleavage plane (false lumen) between the inner two-thirds and outer one-third of the media. The true lumen is separated from the false lumen by an intimomedial flap.</p>\n<p>Predisposing factors for aortic dissection are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li><strong>Hypertension</strong></li>\n<li>Marfan syndrome</li>\n<li>Pregnancy</li>\n<li>Other <strong>connective tissue disorders</strong>, for example, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\n<li>Coarctation of the aorta</li>\n<li><strong>Turner or Noonan</strong> syndromes</li>\n<li>Aortic cannulation site (iatrogenic)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clinical features:</p>\n<p>The most typical presentation of aortic dissection is a tearing interscapular pain.<br />The tracheal tug sign, also known as<strong> Oliver’s sign</strong>, is seen in the arch of the aorta aneurysm.<br /><br />The dissection can extend <strong>distally</strong> down the aorta to involve the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Renal arteries (renal pain and renal failure)</li>\n<li>Mesenteric arteries (abdominal pain and bowel ischemia)</li>\n<li>Spinal arteries (paraplegia)</li>\n<li>Iliac arteries (leg pain, pallor, loss or reduced pulses, and limb ischemia).</li>\n<li>The dissection may track proximally to involve the:Head and neck vessels (symptoms and signs of a stroke or transient ischaemic attack)</li>\n<li>Coronary vessels (MI)</li>\n<li>Aortic root (aortic regurgitation)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On examination, unequal pulses or blood pressure in the extremities may be seen due to changes of flow in the true and false lumens. There can be hypertension or hypotension, loss of pulses, findings of aortic regurgitation, and pulmonary edema. </p>\n<p>Imaging: </p>\n<p><strong>Transesophageal echocardiography</strong> (TEE) is the investigation of choice in a hemodynamically unstable patient. In hemodynamically stable patients, the diagnosis is established with a contrast-enhanced CT scan. </p>\n<p>Treatment options:</p>\n<p>Stanford type A (DeBakey types I and II) requires <strong>surgical</strong> intervention once the patient's blood pressure is stabilized.<br />Stanford type B (DeBakey type III) is best managed by <strong>antihypertensive</strong> drugs. Surgical intervention is indicated in complicated cases if the pain increases (signaling impending rupture) or when there is evidence of malperfusion of organs or neurological symptoms.</p>\n<p>Option A: Chest tube insertion would be appropriate for a <strong>pneumothorax</strong>, which is unlikely in this case. A tension pneumothorax may present with signs of hypotension and jugular venous distention, but there would be a tracheal deviation and hyper resonance to percussion.</p>\n<p>Option C: Nitroglycerin may be useful to further <strong>lowering blood pressure</strong>. It would not be helpful in this case, the dissection has extended to cause a tamponade and needs pericardiocentesis.</p>\n<p>Option D: Aortic dissection can extend to involve the coronary arteries and cause a <strong>myocardial infarction</strong>, which would <strong>warrant a coronary angiography</strong>, however, it is unlikely in this case, given the presence of Beck's triad and low voltage complexes. On EKG, ST changes would be expected.</p>",

The DHEA produced by the fetus is converted to <strong>androstenedione</strong> but cannot become estrogen in the absence of aromatase. This <strong>androgen excess</strong> causes <strong>virilization</strong> of the mother and fetus. The female fetus is born with<strong> ambiguous genitalia </strong>due to the action of androgens.</p>\n<p>Other effects of aromatase deficiency include low estrogen levels in pregnancy, resulting in post-term pregnancy due to a lack of sufficient estrogen for the uterus to become primed for parturition.</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: As previously mentioned, the placenta does not have 17 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme. Hence, it cannot convert progestogens into estrogen.</p>\n<p>Option C: The primary source of androgens for estrogen biosynthesis is from the <strong>fetal adrenal glands</strong>. The maternal adrenal gland acts as a secondary source of a small amount of DHEA.</p>\n<p>Option D: Qualitatively, the most specific estrogen in<strong> </strong>pregnancy is<strong> Estriol</strong>, not Estrone.

It is represented by the formula:</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance = ΔV/ΔP</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: If a lung remains<strong> </strong>unventilated for a longer period<strong>, </strong>then it collapses, which<strong> decreases compliance </strong>and increases surface tension.</p>\n<p>Option C: Compliance is slightly <strong>greater</strong> when measured during deflation as compared to<strong> </strong>inflation due to hysteresis. During inflation, higher pressure is needed to overcome initial alveolar surface tension.</p>\n<p>Option D: For a given lung size, the compliance becomes <strong>lesser </strong>at<strong> </strong>extremes<strong> </strong>of<strong> </strong>lung volumes due to an increase in the elastic forces and surface tension.    </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Lung Compliance</h3><p>Compliance is the change in lung volume per unit change in the surrounding pressure.</p>\n<p>It is represented by the formula:</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance = &Delta;V/&Delta;P</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Factors Affecting Compliance</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lung volume</strong>:<strong> smaller</strong> the lungs, <strong>smaller</strong> is the compliance</li>\n<li>For a given lung size, the compliance becomes less at extremes of lung volume</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance</strong> is slightly greater when measured during<strong> deflation</strong> than during in<strong>flation</strong></li>\n<li>If the surface tension is more, compliance is less</li>\n<li>Compliance measured with saline is more than compliance measured with air.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Compliance is decreased</strong>&nbsp;in conditions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pulmonary</strong>&nbsp;<strong>fibrosis</strong>: Due to increased fibrous tissue in the lung, making it less elastic, and thus less expandable.</li>\n<li><strong>Alveolar</strong>&nbsp;<strong>edema</strong>, which prevents the expansion of some alveoli.</li>\n<li>If lung remains&nbsp;<strong>unventilated</strong>&nbsp;for a long time, in a low volume lung, due to atelectasis (collapse) of lung units or increased surface tension.</li>\n<li>Increased pulmonary venous pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Compliance is increased&nbsp;</strong>in conditions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pulmonary emphysema</li>\n<li><strong>Normal</strong>&nbsp;<strong>aging</strong>&nbsp;lung</li>\n</ul>",

Recommended treatments include IV clindamycin followed by oral clindamycin or a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination like amoxicillin-clavulanate. Therapy continues until imaging confirms resolution. Metronidazole alone is ineffective since it does not cover microaerophilic streptococci.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary</strong> lung abscesses (caused by <strong>underlying conditions</strong> like malignancy, immunosuppression, or bronchial obstruction) are treated by targeting the <strong>identified pathogen</strong> and prolonging antibiotic courses based on the patient’s immune status. If no improvement is seen in 7 days, further evaluation is needed to rule out underlying causes.</p>\n<p>Large abscesses (&gt;6–8 cm) are less likely to resolve without additional interventions, such as drainage or surgery.

In pregnancy, unless valve prolapse is severe, it is not associated with adverse outcomes. An exception to this is prolapse due to <strong>myxomatous degeneration</strong> of the mitral valve.</p>\n<p>Mitral and aortic insufficiency may be associated with an improvement in ventricular function in pregnancy due to the fall in afterload due to<strong> reduced peripheral vascular resistance</strong> by the action of hormones in pregnancy.  Hypervolemia is also known to improve mitral valvular leaflet alignment in mitral valve prolapse on echocardiography.</p>\n<p>Based on the cardiac risk of various heart conditions, the <strong>WHO risk classification</strong> of heart diseases in pregnancy has four levels.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WHO 1:</strong> Morbidity and mortality risk no higher than the general population.

Pain and temperature sensations are relatively preserved. Pain in the neck, shoulder, back, buttocks, and thighs is a common complaint in the early phase of the disease. The pain is usually aching or throbbing in nature. <strong>Autonomic involvement</strong> is also frequent in patients with GBS and usually presents with loss of vasomotor control with wide fluctuations in blood pressure and postural hypotension.</p>\n<p>The patient is likely to have clinical worsening during the first four weeks following the onset of weakness.

Patients have clinical manifestations within a few months to years of exposure</li>\n<li><strong>Chronic silicosis </strong>occurs due to long-term exposure to silica, often 10 to 30 years</li>\n<li><strong>Progressive massive fibrosis</strong> can occur following both acute and chronic silicosis. The patients present with more severe cough and dyspnea than simple silicosis and might develop respiratory failure and cor pulmonale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since silicosis leads to macrophage dysfunction, it increases<strong> </strong>the risk of <strong>tuberculosis</strong> in patients. Silica also has immunoadjuvant properties and might lead to autoimmune diseases such as <strong>rheumatoid arthritis</strong>. Silica exposure is also considered to be a risk factor for lung cancer.</p>\n<p>Calcification of hilar lymph nodes producing a characteristic <strong>eggshell pattern</strong> is seen in many cases of silicosis. The fibrotic areas present in the lung parenchyma can be identified on the HRCT of the lung. Acute silicosis may show <strong>diffuse ground-glass opacities</strong> with thickening of the interlobular septae, which is termed as <strong>crazy pavement appearance</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Asbestosis</strong> is caused by <strong>asbestos exposure</strong> and typically shows <strong>asbestos bodies</strong>, fibrosis, and <strong>pleural plaques</strong>. The histopathological image given below shows asbestosis.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c60b4ddf73c2489faf87e87dcbc24929x720x480.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C: <strong>Anthracosis- </strong>It is a pulmonary lesion seen in <strong>coal miners</strong> and is also seen to some extent in <strong>urban dwellers </strong>and<strong> tobacco smokers</strong>. The inhaled carbon pigment, known as <strong>anthracotic pigment,</strong> is engulfed by alveolar or interstitial macrophages and accumulates in the connective tissue adjacent to the bronchi or in the lung hilus. The histopathological image given below shows anthracosis.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a2edd100b2404223b6a9845642e6849dx1280x859.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an <strong>immunologically mediated</strong>, predominantly interstitial lung disorder caused by intense and prolonged <strong>exposure</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>inhaled organic</strong> <strong>antigens</strong>. The affected individuals have an abnormal sensitivity or heightened reactivity to the causative antigen, which leads to pathologic changes that primarily involve the alveolar walls. Microscopic findings reveal <strong>interstitial pneumonitis</strong>, consisting primarily of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages (eosinophils are rare), as well as non-<strong>necrotizing granulomas</strong>, as shown in the image given below.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/13997e7bb8d34744bb99e0257b3c751bx1024x768.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation

      "solution": "<p> The given image shows a <strong>bacteriophage virus</strong>. Gene transfer by <strong>transformation</strong> is<strong> not a special feature</strong> of this group of organisms. The<strong> tox gene</strong> in <strong>Diphtheria</strong> is mediated by a bacteriophage virus(Beta phage). Bacteriophages are responsible for gene transfer in bacteria by <strong>transduction</strong>, not transformation. </p>\n<p>Bacteriophages are special viruses that <strong>infect bacteria</strong>. They are composed of a protein coat that usually encloses a<strong> </strong>linear DNA genome. Bacteriophages have a variety of shapes, including spheres, rods, and filaments. Bacteriophages have two phases in their life cycles, <strong>Lytic and Lysogenic</strong>.</p>\n<p>The lytic phase is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The five steps of the lytic phase are<strong> </strong>attachment, penetration, replication, assembly (or maturation), and release (or burst)</li>\n<li>Bacteriophages infect bacteria by attaching to the surface of the bacterial cell</li>\n<li>They then inject their DNA into the cell</li>\n<li>The phage genome then takes over the cell's machinery and forces it to produce new phages</li>\n<li>The new phages then <strong>burst out</strong> of the cell, destroying it in the process</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The lysogenic phase is different in that the bacteriophage DNA is incorporated into the cell’s DNA and <strong>replicates along with it</strong> for multiple cycles without destroying the cell. This is termed <strong>lysogenic conversion </strong>of the bacterium. Lysogenic conversion of bacteria can produce new characteristics in the bacterium. For example, the phage mediating toxicity in <strong>Diphtheria</strong> infects the bacterium and confers toxin-producing ability to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Transduction</strong> is a method of genetic transfer that occurs in bacteria infected by phage viruses. DNA copying and incorporation into the new phages produced in a lytic cycle is not a perfect process, and some of the bacterial genomes may be<strong> incorporated </strong>and<strong> </strong>transferred<strong> </strong>along with the phage. This is the basis of transduction. This transferred genome may be generalized or restricted to specific fragments. An image depicting gene transfer by transduction is shown below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ca395377d8f04c42bffbf48e58309eaex1280x750.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Phages are extensively used in recombinant DNA technology due to their ability to <strong>transfer genetic material</strong> and assimilate with other cells.  The specific DNA sequence to be cloned is inserted into the phage, and it is allowed to undergo a lytic cycle to produce multiple copies<strong> </strong>of chimeric DNA containing the target DNA.</p>\n<p>Option B: Cosmids are<strong> hybrid plasmids</strong> containing cos sites (DNA sequences from<strong> </strong>lambda phage) and used in recombinant DNA technology. Due to the removal of much of the unnecessary lambda DNA, they can package more chimeric DNA (35-50 kb long inserts) into the particle head. The below image shows the DNA of interest being transferred using a cosmid into bacterial cells for production of more copies.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2be324b3a8cd4318ac1bb5b96b5c44fex1280x1105.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D: Bacteriophages may also be used for<strong> phage typing</strong>, which is a special method for the identification of bacteria based on the specificity of phage-bacterium interactions.
