      "solution": "This patient has a short history of jaundice, which appeared only during a period of stress (viral fever). The lab reports show increased unconjugated bilirubin (normal 0.2-0.8 mg/dL) and normal AST and ALT levels. All this points toward a diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome.<br><br>Gilbert syndrome is a benign, familial disorder characterized by mild intermittent jaundice usually seen during stress, fatigue, or alcohol use. The condition is recognized to arise from a mutation in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene, which results in mildly decreased UDP-glucuronyltransferase production. This causes a reduction in the liver's ability to conjugate bilirubin, thus causing unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The total bilirubin value is usually < 3 mg/dL. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a benign disease that is characterized by chronic conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubinuria. Patients are asymptomatic and other laboratory tests are normal. Liver biopsy shows characteristic deposition of black-colored pigment in the lysosomes of the centrilobular hepatocytes.<br><br>Option B: Rotor syndrome is similar to Dubin-Johnson syndrome but has a milder presentation. Conjugated bilirubin levels are elevated. The liver biopsy does not show pigment deposition.<br><br>Option D: Crigler-Najjar syndrome is another syndrome that has unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It is of two types, with type 1 having absent/trace UDP-glucoronyltransferase production and type 2 having <10% of the normal enzyme activity. Type 1 is far more severe and leads to kernicterus and neurological damage in infancy.<br><br>Pearl PM1482: Hereditary Hyperbilirubinemias<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disorder</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Inheritance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Defects in bilirubin metabolism</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Clinical course</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fatal in the neonatal period</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Generally mild,</p>\n<p>occasional kernicterus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR (common)</p>\n<p>AD (occasional)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin-Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired biliary excretion of bilirubin glucuronides due to a mutation in canalicular multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous with black pigmentation of liver</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased hepatic uptake and storage</p>\n<p>Decreased biliary excretion</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Pearl PM1481: Hyperbilirubinemia- Causes<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> <strong>Predominantly Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Excess production of bilirubin</p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hemolytic anemias</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Biliary tract obstruction</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Resorption of blood from internal hemorrhage (e.g., alimentary tract bleeding, hematomas)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p> Biliary tract diseases like primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ineffective erythropoiesis (e.g., pernicious anemia, thalassemia)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Reduced hepatic uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Drug interference with membrane carrier systems</p>\n</td>\n<td>Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Some cases of Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired bilirubin conjugation</p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Physiologic jaundice of the newborn (decreased UGT1A1 activity, decreased excretion)</p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Breast milk jaundice (β-glucuronidases in milk)</p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Genetic deficiency of UGT1A1 activity (Crigler-Najjar syndrome types I and II)</p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Diffuse hepatocellular disease (e.g., viral or drug-induced hepatitis, cirrhosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Infection is acquired by inhalation. Most infections are asymptomatic but infection of the reticuloendothelial system manifests as lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, fever, and anemia and it is highly fatal. <br><br>Option C- Coccidiodes immitis is also a dimorphic fungus causing coccidiomycosis. Infection is acquired through inhalation of dust-containing spores of the fungus. Mostly they are asymptomatic and a self-limiting influenza-like fever termed valley fever or desert rheumatism develops in some individuals. The infection leads to lifetime immunity. <br><br>Option D- Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis is again a dimorphic fungus causing paracoccidioidomycosis also termed South American blastomycosis. Infection is initially acquired by the inhalation of spores causing primary pulmonary infection.

      "solution": "Glucokinase is located in pancreatic β cells and helps release insulin. It is also stimulated by insulin, leading to increased hepatic uptake of glucose and glycogen synthesis. Mutations in glucokinase can lead to maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY).<br><br>The enzyme responsible for glucose phosphorylation in liver and pancreatic β cells is glucokinase. It is located in the pancreatic beta cells and the liver (statement 1).  In the liver, its function is to remove glucose from the portal blood during the postprandial hyperglycemic state. This limits the amount of glucose available to the peripheral tissues, and enables glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis in the liver.<br><br>In pancreatic β cells, glucokinase detects the changes in blood glucose levels. If there is more glucose, more glucose-6-phosphate is produced by glucokinase, leading to increased glycolysis and ATP production. Increased ATP leads to the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels and insulin release. <br><br>Compared to hexokinase, glucokinase has:<br><br>* High Km — has a lower affinity (statement 2) for glucose, and requires a higher concentration of glucose for its action.<br><br>* High Vmax — has a higher capacity to convert substrate into product.<br><br>Glucokinase is inhibited indirectly by fructose-6-phosphate. It is not inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate directly (statement 4), even though it is the end product of the reaction catalyzed by glucokinase. In the presence of fructose-6-phosphate, glucokinase binds tightly to its regulatory protein and is translocated to the nucleus, rendering it inactive. Glucokinase is stimulated by insulin (statement 3).<br><br>Mutations in the gene encoding glucokinase lead to maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type 2, in which the patients have impaired insulin secretion and hyperglycemia.<br><br>The differences between hexokinase and glucokinase are summarized below:<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td><span

The treatment of choice for unilateral iliac vessel occlusion is an aortofemoral bypass.<br><br>Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of peripheral obstructive vascular diseases.<br><br>Diagnosis of peripheral obstructive vascular diseases includes:<br><br>* Clinical examination- weakened pulses below the level of obstruction<br><br>* Reduced Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) -<0.9 - intermittent claudication (occlusive arterial disease)<0.3 - critical limb ischemia.<br><br>* Color doppler- normal artery has a triphasic signal<br><br>* Biphasic waveform - mild-moderate stenosis<br><br>* Monophasic waveform - severe stenosis<br><br>* Duplex scanning - a non-invasive technique that uses a combination of B-mode ultrasound and Doppler study. <br><br>* Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is now the standard technique. The artery is better outlined because the photos are digitized by a computer, which removes extraneous tissues.<br><br>* CT angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA) - for extent and type of obstruction. These are not used routinely for the diagnosis but only if symptoms warrant surgical intervention.<br><br>Below is an angiography image showing the right common iliac artery obstruction.<br><br><img

follows:<br><br>* Carbohydrate and lipid-free diet<br><br>* Graduated exercise program in combination with smoking cessation improves walking efficiency<br><br>* Control of hypertension, diabetes, and

MRI is an example of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation. <br><br>Ionizing radiation is a type of radiation with enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from the orbit of an atom, causing the atom to be charged or ionized. They can be either directly ionizing or indirectly ionizing. Alpha rays and beta rays are directly ionizing radiation because they carry a charge and can directly interact with atomic electrons. Alpha and beta rays are also particulate radiation (composed of particles). <br><br>Gamma rays and x-rays are electromagnetic rays. They are indirectly ionizing radiation as they are electrically neutral and do not interact directly with electrons. <br><br>MRI is a technique that produces topographic images by means of magnetic fields and radiofrequency waves.

      "solution": "The most likely pathophysiology behind this reaction is pre-formed IgM antibodies against donor red cells that fix complement. The clinical scenario describes an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction as the patient has a rapid onset of fever with chills, flank pain, and hemoglobinuria. <br><br>Acute hemolytic reactions are caused due to pre-existing high-affinity IgM antibodies against the blood group antigens on the donor cells. This leads to complement activation and subsequent complement-mediated lysis, intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. The signs and symptoms are due to complement activation since osmotic lysis of red cells results in hemoglobinuria with the absence of other symptoms of a hemolytic reaction.<br><br>When it is suspected, the transfusion should be immediately stopped and the blood bank should be notified about the reaction. The blood bank should evaluate the patient's blood samples for hemolysis and the presence of antibodies. Antibodies can be tested for by direct antiglobulin test (DAT), sometimes called the direct Coombs test. The blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin, and serum haptoglobin should be assessed.<br><br> Non-immunologic reactions:<br><br>* Fluid overload<br><br>* Hypothermia<br><br>* Hypocalcemia due to increased chelation of calcium by citrate<br><br>* Hyperkalemia due to increased release of potassium from lysed cells<br><br>* Iron overload<br><br>* Transient hypotension<br><br>* Transfusion-mediated immunomodulation- Multiple sittings of transfusion of allogenic blood leads to immunosuppression<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Inflammatory mediators derived from donor leukocytes cause febrile non-hemolytic reactions. It can present as chills and is usually evident within 6 hours of transfusion of red cells or platelets. These reactions increase with the storage of donor blood and can be reduced by taking measures to minimize donor leukocyte contamination. Antipyretics can be used for management.<br><br>Option C: IgG antibodies against previously sensitized antigens cause delayed hemolytic reactions. These reactions are associated with a positive Coomb's test and other features of hemolysis like low haptoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Antigens like Rh, Kell, and Kidd can induce complement activation. But if there is no complement activation, it results in the opsonization of red cells, extravascular hemolysis, and spherocytosis.<br><br>Option D: Factors in the transfused blood trigger activation

      "solution": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and immediate orchidectomy at diagnosis is not a treatment option to manage this condition. Orchidectomy should preferably be performed after pubertal maturation in a patient with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. It is preferably done at 16-18 years.<br><br>Androgen insensitivity syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder in which the androgen receptors are absent, or scanty, or fail to respond to testosterone. As a result, resistance to androgens may be complete, and female external genitalia are found. The individual has a genetic makeup of 46XY but is phenotypically a female. The Wolffian duct fails to develop because of the absence of testosterone receptors. Testes produce Mullerian-inhibiting factors, so the Müllerian system fails to develop. However, the lower portion of the vagina derived from the sinovaginal bulb appears as a dimple of 1–2 cm in length.<br><br>AIS can be present in two forms:<br><br>* Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome<br><br>* Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome<br><br>In complete AIS, the individual is born as a phenotypically normal female but generally presents with primary amenorrhea. The external genitalia appears normal, with absent or scant pubic and axillary hair. The vagina is shortened and blind-ending with an absent uterus and ovaries. These patients may also present with a history of childhood inguinal hernias, due to the presence of undescended testis in the abdomen or in the inguinal canal. Due to the constant conversion of testosterone into estrogen, these individuals have normal breast development.<br><br>Investigations:<br><br>* Ultrasound reveals the absence of ovaries and the uterus.<br><br>* Testosterone > 200 ng/mL<br><br>* Leutinizing hormone level is raised, but follicle-stimulating hormone level is normal.<br><br>* Chromosome study reveals XY chromosomes.<br><br>Management:<br><br>* Identify the location of ectopic testis and perform orchidectomy after puberty to prevent malignant degeneration. Malignant transformation usually does not occur until after puberty.<br><br>* Estrogen therapy for the development of the breasts as well as to prevent osteoporosis<br><br>* Surgical vaginoplasty at the time of marriage<br><br>* Absent reproductive function, surrogacy is considered.<br><br>In partial AIS, a few receptors do respond to testosterone, whereby the clinical features are variable. Some patients present at birth with ambiguous genitalia, and chromosome study reveals XY chromosomes, while others present at puberty, with lack of virilization in a boy or signs of virilization in a girl with primary amenorrhoea.<br><br>The treatment is based on the sex in which the child is reared, psychological behavior, and the amount of virilization. If the child is reared as female, it is best to perform gonadectomy in childhood to avoid virilization. In a boy, testosterone will help.<br><br>Given below is an algorithm for the diagnosis of primary amenorrhea with secondary sexual characteristics:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4257f8966b544707afce47139f9873bbx1280x2558.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM2182: Disorders of Sexual Development<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Disorder</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Complete androgen insensitivity</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Mullerian agenesis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Turner syndrome</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Complete XY dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome)</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>X-linked mutation of androgen receptor</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypoplastic or absent Mullerian ductal system</p>\n<p><strong>Also called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Complete or partial absence of one X chromosome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>SRY gene mutation on the Y chromosome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Reproductive organs</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent uterus and upper vagina, cryptorchid testis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent or rudimentary uterus and upper vagina, normal ovaries</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Normal uterus and vagina, streak gonads</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Normal uterus and vagina, streak gonads</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Breast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Yes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Variable</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Axillary/</strong><strong>Pubic hair</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Minimal to absent</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Normal</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Normal</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Minimal to absent</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Karyotype</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>46 XY</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>46 XX</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>45 XO or </p>\n<p>45 X mosaicism</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>46 XY</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br> <br><br>Note: <br><br>Turner's syndrome have different chromosomal anomalies:<br><br>* 45 XO which is seen in 40-50% patients <br><br>* 45 X mosaicism (eg, 45,X/46,XX or 45,X/47,XXX, or 45,X mosaics with the X chromosome anomalies)",

They most commonly occur in the adrenal glands but can occur anywhere in the sympathetic nervous system like in the paraspinal ganglia and less frequently in the thorax, pelvis, and cervical areas, after having originated from neural crest progenitor cells.<br><br>In children younger than 2 years of age, neuroblastomas generally present as large abdominal masses with fever and weight loss. In older children, they can cause bone pain, respiratory symptoms or metastasize through the hematogenous and lymphatic systems to the liver, bones, and bone marrow. The periorbital region is a common metastatic site and as a result, proptosis and ecchymosis may occur. In neonates, disseminated neuroblastomas may present with multiple cutaneous metastases that cause deep blue discoloration of the skin (blueberry muffin baby).<br><br>About 90% of neuroblastomas produce catecholamines, which are an important diagnostic feature; this includes elevated blood levels of catecholamines and elevated urine levels of the metabolites vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA).<br><br>Histologic confirmation is required to establish a diagnosis of neuroblastoma.

It is usually acquired through sexual contact and co-exists with other sexually transmitted diseases. However, congenital syphilis is acquired as a transplacental infection. The stages of untreated syphilis in the order of their occurrence are:<br><br>* Primary syphilis presents as a papule on external genitalia that rapidly ulcerates to form a primary chancre. Inguinal lymphadenopathy usually accompanies the primary syphilitic lesion. The chancre in men is most commonly on the glans penis. They are primarily on the cervix and labia in women.<br><br>* Secondary syphilis is the stage when generalized manifestations of syphilis appear on the skin and mucous membranes. A rash is commonly seen and this stage may be preceded by constitutional symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and malaise. The rash, known as syphilides is coppery-red, non-itchy, and symmetrical. It is initially macular, then progresses to papular syphilides.<br><br>* <br><br>Latent syphilis is the stage when there are no clinical features of the active disease but serological testing for the disease is positive.  <br><br>* Late syphilis (tertiary syphilis) commonly presents as superficial or nodular punched out ulcers or gummas (granulomas appearing as cutaneous plaques or nodules with central ulceration) appears 3-10 years after infection. It may also present as red nodules (nodular syphilides), neurosyphilis, and cardiovascular syphilis. <br><br>Serological testing is done using standard non-treponemal antibody tests like VDRL and rapid plasma reagin (RPR). Specific treponemal antibody tests like TPHA (T. pallidum hemagglutination assay) and FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test) are further required. <br><br>Microscopically, Trepenoma palladium is identified with characteristic corkscrew morphology and motility on darkfield microscopy.<br><br>Parenteral penicillin G is the drug of choice for all stages of syphilis. If the patient has a history of drug allergies, it is advisable to keep the patient under observation for 15 to 20 mins after injection. An emergency kit for the management of anaphylaxis should always be available.<br><br>Treatment of recent sexual contacts is recommended.<br><br>Pearl PM2340: Stages of syphilis<br><br>Primary syphilis:<br><br>* Chancre - Painless, indurated, usually single. The chancre self heals in 1-4 months.<br><br>* Lymphadenopathy - Painless, unilateral or bilateral, shotty and rubbery inguinal nodes<br><br>* Dory flop sign - As the chancre is too hard to fold, it will flip over once the prepuce is retracted back.<br><br>Secondary syphilis: <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/45e19098c36e4e0ba69bdbc3358cbb5fx559x788.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>* A & B: Generalized non-itchy rash with no vesicles present on the palm and sole. This is the most common lesion.<br><br>* C & D: Condyloma lata.<br><br>* E: Moth-eaten non-scarring alopecia<br><br>* F: Mucous patches are flat erosions on the tongue that can coalesce to form snail track ulcers. These are the most infectious lesions.<br><br>* G: Pigmentary plaques<br><br>* H: Psoriasiform syphilitic lesions<br><br>* Generalized diffuse non-tender lymphadenopathy<br><br>Tertiary syphilis:<br><br>* Gummatous syphilis are deep punched-out ulcers, with gum-like secretions on the floor<br><br>* Pseudo-chancre redux is a gumma occurring at the site of a previously healed ulcer  <br><br>* CVS - Aortitis and aneurysm of the ascending aorta<br><br>* CNS - General paresis of the insane and tabes dorsalis <br><br>Latent syphilis is the period between secondary and tertiary syphilis.

      "solution": "The given clinical scenario, lab investigations, and ankyrin gene mutation are suggestive of Hereditary spherocytosis (HS). There is increased osmotic fragility and hence the curve will shift towards the right. <br><br>Osmotic fragility is the measure of red blood cells to resist hemolysis when placed in reducing concentrations of saline solution. Normal hemolysis begins at a concentration of 0.5% NaCl and is completed at a concentration of 0.3% NaCl. It may be altered as follows:<br><br>* Increased fragility is seen as a right shift in the graph. Here hemolysis begins at a higher concentration of the hypotonic saline solution.<br><br>* Decreased fragility is seen as a left shift in the graph. Here hemolysis begins at a much lower concentration of the hypotonic saline solution (more dilute solution)<br><br>In hereditary spherocytosis, osmotic fragility of the red blood cells is characteristically increased. These spherocytes lyse more easily in hypotonic solution than normal discoid RBCs due to the low surface area to volume ratio.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a8d93679020740bd9e42e14dc6d42887x1279x1123.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Hereditary spherocytosis is a type of hemolytic anemia that is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Mutations in α-spectrin, β-spectrin, ankyrin, band 4.2, and band 3 weaken the association of the membrane skeleton with the overlying plasma membrane, making them spheroid and less deformable. This causes red cells to shed membrane vesicles and transform into spherocytes. The non-deformable spherocytes get trapped in the splenic cords and phagocytosed by macrophages.<br><br>The ankyrin gene mutation is the most likely genetic mutation seen in autosomal-dominant hereditary spherocytosis. Mutations in the spectrin gene may result in severe forms of HS.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5fb5d6bef0014f4f84696858f25b4716x1280x1991.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Patients usually present with anemia, fatigue, splenomegaly, and jaundice and the age of presentation varies with the severity of the disease. The unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia predisposes the patient to develop gallstones. An aplastic crisis might occur when red cell production is halted due to parvovirus infection. This lasts 1 to 2 weeks, usually the time required for the immune system to clear the virus. Blood transfusions may be needed during this period.<br><br>The most common peripheral smear finding is spherocytosis, which presents as small, dark-staining (hyperchromic) red cells without the central zone of pallor. This is, however, a non-specific finding. Other features seen are reticulocytosis, Howell-Jolly bodies (dense basophilic nuclear remnants in the RBCs), marrow erythroid hyperplasia, and hemosiderosis.<br><br>Pearl PM1268: Features of Peripheral Blood Smear in Different Anemias<br><br>Type of anemia <br><br>Microcytic anemia<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Peripheral blood smear</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Thalassemia trait</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Basophilic stippling, target cells </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Iron-deficiency</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Elliptocytes, target cells</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Sideroblastic anemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Pappenheimer bodies, RBC dimorphism, ringed sideroblasts (Perl’s stain) </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Macrocytic anemia<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Peripheral blood smear</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Myelodysplastic syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypogranular or hypolobulated neutrophils, blast cells, giant or hypogranular platelets, Pappenheimer bodies</p>\n<p>Minor population of hypochromic / microcytic cells (dimorphic), poikilocytosis </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Megaloblastic anemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypersegmented neutrophils (&gt;5 lobes), ovalocytes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hemolysis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Polychromasia (purple reticulocyte) +/- spherocytes </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Chronic liver disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Target cells </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Normocytic anemia<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Peripheral blood smear</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Haemolytic anemia </p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, polychromasia, nucleated red cells </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hereditary spherocytosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>RBC lack central zone of pallor, reticulocytosis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Glucose-6-Phosphate-Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency </p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Heinz bodies (revealed by special staining),‘Bite’ cells</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Pearl PM1247: Classification of Hemolytic Anemias<br><br>Hemolytic anemias can be classified in 2 ways:<br><br>1.

BAK is a pro-apoptotic factor and does not belong to this group.<br><br>In order for apoptosis to occur permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane is necessary. This is facilitated by pro-apoptotic proteins, BAX, and BAK (represented by the group \"Y\" in the image). This action is inhibited by anti-apoptotic proteins (represented by the group \"X\" in the image). <br><br>Apoptosis is a pathway of cell death that is induced by a closely regulated suicide program in which cells destined to die activate intrinsic enzymes (caspases) that degrade the cell nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. <br><br>Mechanism of apoptosis: There are two distinct pathways that can lead to caspase activation and cause apoptosis of the cell.<br><br>* The mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway<br><br>* The death receptor or extrinsic pathway<br><br>The mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis:<br><br>* There are several proteins in the mitochondria that can induce apoptosis. These include cytochrome c and some proteins that neutralize the endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis.<br><br>* The permeability of the mitochondria is controlled by the BCL-2 family of proteins, which act as sensors.<br><br>* These sensors are activated when the cells are deprived of growth factors and other survival signals are exposed to agents that damage the DNA or accumulate a large number of misfolded proteins.<br><br>* These activated sensors, in turn, activate the proapoptotic molecules, like BAX and BAK, which form channels in the mitochondrial membrane, through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol and cause activation of caspase-9, which in turn leads to the activation of the caspase cascade and, eventually, apoptosis of the cell.<br><br>* On the other hand, if all the growth factors and other survival signals are present, then they produce more antiapoptotic members of the BH1-4 family like the BCL2, MCL 1, and BCL-XL. These proteins limit the escape of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins.<br><br>The death-receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis:<br><br>* Death receptors are surface molecules that are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family like the TNF 1 and Fas (CD 95).<br><br>* These receptors are expressed on the surface of many cells and can trigger apoptosis. In the cytoplasmic region, these receptors have a death domain.<br><br>* Fas ligand (FasL) is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T-lymphocytes. Fas-FasL interactions are required for thymic medullary negative selection. Defective interactions also cause autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. <br><br>* When these T-cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL, their cytoplasmic death domains form a binding site for an adaptor protein called Fas-associated death domain (FADD).<br><br>* These, in turn, recruit and activate caspase-8 and -10.<br><br>* In many cell types, caspase-8 and -10 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called Bid, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway.<br><br>* The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell.<br><br>* Cellular proteins, notably, a caspase antagonist called FLIP, block the activation of caspases downstream of the death receptors. Interestingly, some viruses produce homologs of FLIP, and it is suggested that this is a mechanism that viruses use to keep infected cells alive.<br><br>* The death receptor pathway is involved in the elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes and in the killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.<br><br>The following image shows a diagrammatic representation of the mechanisms of apoptosis:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/730eb17d957846f2a1b7f8d9082d02f8x1280x2420.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM0132: Apoptotic genes<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Group</td>\n<td>Members</td>\n<td>Details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anti-apoptotlc</td>\n<td>BCL2,<br/>BCL-XL<br/><br/>MCL1</td>\n<td>Present in outer mitochondrial membrane<br/>Prevent leakage of cytochrome-c and<br/>other death lnducing proteins into<br/>cytosol.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pro-apoptotlc</td>\n<td>BAX,<br/>BAK</td>\n<td>On activation, they increase mitochondrial membrane permeability.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stress Sensors</td>\n<td>BAD,<br/>BIM,<br/>BID,<br/>Puma, Noxa</td>\n<td>Act as sensors of cellular stress and damage and regulate the balance<br/>between the other two groups</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "The drug of choice for actinomycosis is Penicillin, which is a beta lactam.Beta lactams act on step 4 in the given image.<br><br>Mechanism of action of beta-lactams: They are the cell wall synthesis inhibitor. The β-lactam antibiotics inhibit this last step in peptidoglycan synthesis. They inhibit the enzyme transpeptidase which is required for cross-linking of the peptidoglycan chain. Transpeptidases cleave the terminal D-alanine of the peptide chains and form cross-linkages between them. This cross-linking provides rigidity and stability to the cell wall.   <br><br>Transpeptidases and other related proteins constitute penicillin-binding proteins(PBP) and, are located in the bacterial cell membrane. β-lactam antibiotics are bactericidal. This is because bacterias swell and burst due to deficient cell walls when they divide in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics. Penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems are examples of β-lactam antibiotics.<br><br>Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics than gram-negative because their cell wall is almost entirely made of peptidoglycan.<br><br>Resistance to β-lactam antibiotics develops due to the production of the beta-lactamase enzyme and the development of altered penicillin-binding proteins like in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). β-lactamases inactivate β-lactam antibiotics by opening the β-lactam ring. This could be overcome by using drugs that inhibit this enzyme. Examples of β-lactamase inhibitors are clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Fosfomycin inhibits step 1 in the image. It inhibits the cytoplasmic enzyme enol pyruvate transferase that catalyses the initial step in the bacterial cell wall and hence cell wall synthesis. It is used for the treatment of urinary tract infections.<br><br>Option B: Bacitracin inhibits step 2 in the image. It is a cell wall synthesis inhibitor that interferes with dephosphorylation in the cycling of the lipid carrier which transfers peptidoglycan subunits to the growing cell wall. It is only given for topical application because of its severe nephrotoxicity when given systemically.<br><br>Option C: Vancomycin inhibits step 3 in the image. It binds to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of the newly formed peptidoglycan pentapeptide. This prevents further elongation of the peptidoglycan and its cross-linking. It is used against MRSA and Clostridium difficile infection. Redman syndrome due to histamine release following infusion is an important side effect.",

It is also known as tic douloureux (a painful condition of the face). It is commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly women. <br><br>The large myelinated fibers of the trigeminal nerve carry tactile stimuli from the face and do not carry pain fibers themselves. In trigeminal neuralgia, due to compression or other pathologies, the large fibers undergo demyelination. These demyelinated large fibers become hyperexcitable and electrically coupled with the surrounding smaller unmyelinated pain fibers of the trigeminal nerve. This explains why tactile stimulation of trigger zones (lips, gums, cheek, or chin) leads to pain paroxysms. Symptoms occur due to ectopic generation of action potentials in pain-sensitive afferent fibers of the trigeminal nerve root just before entering the pons.<br><br>The pain may occur spontaneously or after movements like chewing, speaking, smiling, washing the face, brushing teeth, or exposure to wind. On examination, the physician will not find any sensory loss over the area. The pain usually lasts for seconds or minutes. The intensity of pain is severe, so much so that the patient winces.

This indicates that she is in the stage of negative iron balance. <br><br>The progression to iron deficiency develops in 3 stages. The first stage is the stage of negative iron balance. In this, the demand for iron exceeds the body's ability to absorb iron from the diet. This stage can result from a number of physiological mechanisms, like blood loss, pregnancy, rapid growth during adolescence, or inadequate dietary intake. Under such circumstances, the iron stores from the reticuloendothelial sites are mobilized. Thus, the body's iron stores level, which is reflected by serum ferritin, decreases during this phase. As long as the iron stores are present, the serum iron and RBC morphology remain normal.<br><br>When the iron stores become depleted, the serum iron and transferrin saturation begin to fall. Once the transferrin saturation falls below 20%, hemoglobin synthesis becomes impaired. This is termed as the stage of iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Gradually, the hemoglobin begins to fall and the erythrocytes become microcytic and hypochromic, leading to the stage of iron-deficiency anemia.<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td><span

It occurs due to a loss-of-function mutation in the ATP7B gene. This gene encodes ATP7B, a copper-transporting ATPase, which is responsible for biliary copper excretion and incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin.<br><br>Clinical features of Wilson's disease are:<br><br>* Hepatic: Hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites, cirrhosis, anorexia<br><br>* Neurologic: Dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, rigidity, tremors, abnormal gait, uncoordinated handwriting<br><br>* Psychiatric: Decreased scholastic performance, irritability, depression, and anxiety<br><br>* Ophthalmic:<br><br>* Kayser-Fleischer rings: These are golden-brown rings formed due to the deposition of copper in descemet’s membrane of the cornea. They are present in 95% of patients with neurologic/psychiatric symptoms and 65% of patients with hepatic symptoms.<br><br>* Sunflower cataracts: These are formed due to the deposition of copper in the lens.<br><br>* Autonomic: Orthostatic hypotension; sweating; bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction<br><br>* Endocrine: Delayed puberty, amenorrhea<br><br>* Hemolytic anemia (due to the release of copper from necrosed hepatocytes into the bloodstream)<br><br>* Osteoporosis and rickets<br><br>* Renal Fanconi syndrome<br><br>Laboratory findings show low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels and elevated hepatic enzymes. Increased urinary excretion of copper (>100 μg/24 h) is also an important diagnostic test.

Hepatic copper values >200 μg/g of dry weight indicate Wilson’s disease.  DNA testing for mutations in ATP7B can be done and can make a definitive diagnosis in about 50–75% of patients.<br><br>Treatment of Wilson's disease includes:<br><br>* Copper chelation:<br><br>* D-penicillamine: It increases urinary excretion of copper and prevents copper overload. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6 ) is administered along with it to counter pyridoxine deficiency that occurs due to penicillamine.<br><br>* Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride: This chelating agent is given in patients intolerant to D-penicillamine and those with severe neurologic manifestations (D-penicillamine worsens neurological status).<br><br>* Tetrathiomolybdate: This fast-acting agent decreases copper absorption and circulating free copper. It is currently under clinical trials.<br><br>* Zinc acetate: This is used to reduce copper absorption. Zinc is beneficial in pregnancy (lower teratogenic effects) and as a maintenance therapy.<br><br>* Liver transplantation: This is considered in advanced stages of irreversible hepatic damage or poor compliance with medical therapy.<br><br>Pearl PM0897: Diseases and Associated Cataracts - Images<br><br>Wilson's Disease/Chalcosis: Sunflower Cataract <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f38ae9ec7610483cb46270495dbc44b0x826x499.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Diabetes mellitus:  Snowflake cataract <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0235d6510b5145419c408792a18dde31x595x395.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Blunt trauma: May present as rosette-shaped cataract <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f66a5f456ef84776a83894d96c1f9b96x381x394.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Myotonic dystrophy - Christmas tree cataract <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c10ec0ef6d6948249f32b3325209b9bcx720x677.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM1591: Nazer’s Prognostic Index<br><br>Nazer’s prognostic index for Wilson’s disease<br><br>* Serum bilirubin<br><br>* Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)<br><br>* Prolongation of prothrombin time (sec)<br><br>Interpretation of Scores :<br><br>* < 7 – Medical therapy<br><br>* 7–9 – Clinical judgement, Either medical / surgical treatment<br><br>* > 9 – Liver transplantation<br><br>Pearl PM0855: Principal Serum Enzymes Used in Clinical Diagnosis<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> <strong>Serum Enzyme</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Major Diagnostic Use/Location</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Aminotransferases </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT)</td>\n<td>Liver function</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT)</td>\n<td>Viral hepatitis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Creatine kinase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CK-MM</td>\n<td>Skeletal muscle, Muscle disorders</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CK-BB</td>\n<td>Brain, Brain injury, meningitis, abnormal cell growth, severe shock, stroke, hypothermia, or restricted blood flow to the bowel.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CK-MB</td>\n<td>Heart and skeletal muscle, Myocardial Infarction, Muscular dystrophy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HHHH (I<sub>1</sub>)/LDH-1</td>\n<td>Heart &amp; RBC;Myocardial infarction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HHHM(I<sub>2</sub>)/LDH-2</td>\n<td>Reticuloendothelial system</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HHMM(I<sub>3</sub>)/LDH-3</td>\n<td>Brain and Kidney</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HMMM(I<sub>4</sub>)/LDH-4</td>\n<td>Liver &amp; Skeletal Muscles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MMMM(I<sub>5</sub>)/LDH-5</td>\n<td>Liver &amp; Skeletal Muscles; Liver diseases</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Others</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amylase, Lipase and Acid Phosphatase</td>\n<td>Acute pancreatitis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ceruloplasmin</td>\n<td>Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson disease)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>γ-Glutamyl transferase</td>\n<td>Liver diseases (Alcoholic Liver Disease)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>β-Glucocerebrosidase</td>\n<td>Gaucher disease</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alkaline Phosphatase (isozymes)</td>\n<td>Bone disorders, obstructive liver diseases</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
