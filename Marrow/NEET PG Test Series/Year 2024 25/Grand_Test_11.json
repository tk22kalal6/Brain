The sticky nature may be responsible for gastric bezoars, particularly in those with gastroparesis.<br><br>Sucralfate is composed of a sulfate of sucrose with Al(OH)3. It undergoes cross-linking to produce a viscous polymer that sticks to epithelial cells and ulcers in acidic environments. It inhibits hydrolysis of the mucosal proteins by pepsin.<br><br>It is used in the prophylaxis of stress ulcers, and in conditions where mucosal ulceration is not responding to acid suppression.<br><br>Adverse effects of sucralfate include constipation and bezoar formation. It may inhibit absorption of other drugs like digoxin, cimetidine, ketoconazole, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics due to the viscous layer formed in the stomach. Hence it should be taken at least 2 hours after administration if these drugs.<br><br>The other options:<br><br>Vitamin B12 deficiency and increased risk of bone fractures are side effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, their clinical significance has not been proven yet. Hypergastrinemia is more commonly seen with PPIs than H2 receptor antagonists.",

It plays a role in cell migration during morphogenesis and wound repair. The high concentrations of hyaluronic acid together with chondroitin sulfates in the cartilage contribute to its compressibility.<br><br>* Chondroitin Sulfates (Chondroitin 4-Sulfate & Chondroitin 6-Sulfate): The repeating disaccharide units are GlcUA and GalNAc. They maintain the structure of the extracellular matrix and are located in endochondral bone and cartilage. They are also found in high amounts in the ECM of the central nervous system. In addition to their structural function, they act as signaling molecules in the prevention of the repair of nerve endings after injury.<br><br>* Keratan Sulfates I & II: They consist of repeating Gal-GlcNAc disaccharide units. They are found in the cornea and in the cartilage. Keratin sulfate I or II are differentiated based on the different linkage to the core protein. They play a critical role in corneal transparency. Changes in the proteoglycan composition are seen in corneal scars.<br><br>* Heparin: Heparin is found in the granules of mast cells and also in the liver, lung, and skin and is an important anticoagulant. It is released into the blood from capillary walls by the action of lipoprotein lipase and it binds with factors IX and XI. Its most important interaction is with plasma antithrombin.<br><br>* Heparan Sulfate: It is found on many extracellular cell surfaces. The predominant uronic acid is GlcUA. Heparan sulfates are associated with the plasma membrane of cells as receptors, and may also participate in the mediation of cell growth and cell-cell communication. It is also found in the basement membrane of the kidney and determines the charge selectiveness of glomerular filtration.<br><br>* Dermatan Sulfate: Dermatan sulfate has a widespread distribution in tissues, and is the main GAG in the skin.

Nevertheless, all three forms are associated with the loss of sequence of the short arm of chromosome 3.<br><br>Those with VHL disease inherit a germline mutation of the VHL gene on chromosomal band 3p25 and lose the second allele by somatic mutation. This VHL gene is involved in the majority of sporadic clear cell carcinomas. Cytogenetic abnormalities giving rise to loss of a segment on chromosome 3p that has the VHL gene are seen in sporadic renal cell cancers. The second, non-deleted allele is inactivated by a somatic mutation or hypermethylation. Thus, loss or inactivation of both copies of the VHL gene is the common underlying molecular abnormality in both sporadic and familial forms of clear cell carcinomas.<br><br>The VHL protein causes the degradation of hypoxia-induced factors (HIFs), which are transcription factors that contribute to carcinogenesis by stimulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that helps drive tumour cell growth.<br><br>Histologically, they are composed of cells with clear cytoplasm. Most of them arise from the proximal tubular epithelium and usually occur as solitary unilateral lesions. They are bright yellow-grey-white spherical masses of variable size that distort the renal outline.<br><br>The margins are sharply defined and confined within the renal capsule. In clear cell carcinoma, the growth pattern varies from solid to trabecular (cordlike) or tubular (resembling tubules). The tumour cells have a rounded or polygonal shape and abundant clear or granular cytoplasm, which contains glycogen and lipids.<br><br>One of the characteristic features of clear cell carcinoma is its tendency to grow as a solid column of cells that extend from the renal vein, up to the inferior vena cava, and sometimes as far as the right side of the heart.",

This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased ventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder maximal exercise effort.<br><br>* To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase bicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and brings the pH towards normal. It removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. Hence fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort.<br><br>* Lactic acid levels increase which causes extreme fatigue. When there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid is converted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and blood.",

It may be caused by the calcification of the normal aortic valve, calcification of the congenital bicuspid valve, and rheumatic heart disease. Narrowing of the aortic valve causes a decreased stroke volume. This results in a weak pulse (parvus), which rises slowly to a delayed peak (tardus), best appreciated in the carotid arteries.<br><br>Three cardinal clinical features of aortic stenosis:<br><br>* Exertional dyspnea: This occurs due to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Raised end-diastolic LV volume and reduced LV compliance lead to increased LV pressure, leading to elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. This causes exertional dyspnea.<br><br>* Angina pectoris: It occurs due to the combination of the increased O2 needs of hypertrophied myocardium and reduction of O2 delivery <br><br>* Syncope: It occurs due to the combination of decreased cardiac output and systemic arterial dilation which lead to a reduction of cerebral perfusion.<br><br>As LV systole gets prolonged, the aortic component of S2 may become synchronous with the pulmonary component, or there may be a paradoxical splitting of S2, where the aortic component follows the pulmonary component. The murmur in aortic stenosis is typically an ejection systolic murmur best heard at the right second intercostal space and transmitted to the carotids. <br><br>Severe AS is defined as the aortic valve area <1 cm2.

It is seen in patients with severe LV dysfunction.<br><br>Option B: Pulsus bisferiens also known as bifid pulse has two systolic peaks. It is seen in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. There is a rapid upstroke to the first peak (percussion wave) and a slower rise to the second peak (tidal wave). It is also rarely appreciated in patients with severe aortic regurgitation.<br><br>Option C: Pulsus paradoxus is defined as a fall in systolic pressure >10 mmHg with inspiration.

The accumulated pregnenolone and progesterone lead to increased synthesis of aldosterone.<br><br>Patients will present with ambiguous genitalia due to a deficiency of androgens. Excessive aldosterone will lead to increased sodium retention, hypertension, and hypokalemia. Cortisol deficiency stimulates the pituitary and increases ACTH secretion, leading to adrenocortical hyperplasia.

      "solution": "In PID developing after abortions, the formation of a distended fallopian tube is unlikely.<br><br>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) refers to the infection and inflammation of the upper genital tract until the ovaries. Most of the PIDs are due to ascending or blood-borne infection, hence the lesion is often bilateral. The anatomical proximity of the ovaries to the tubes invariably leads to its involvement as well. <br><br>The most common etiological agent leading to post-abortal PID is Chlamydia trachomatis. In such cases, infection is spread through the cervical lymphatics to the broad ligament. As a result, the fallopian tube is affected from the outside and the mucosa is affected last. The wall of the tube is thickened with minimal distension. Mucosal involvement in later stages leads to blockage of the fallopian tube by multiple adhesions.<br><br>In PID occurring due to ascending infections, the mucous membrane is affected first. It becomes oedematous and infiltrated with leucocytes and plasma cells. The exudate so formed is discharged into the lumen of the tube. This causes the tube to distend, usually at the ampullary end. The inflamed and ulcerated mucosa eventually causes adhesions and tubal blockage or narrowing of the lumen. This leads to infertility or ectopic pregnancy.<br><br>In earlier stages of the disease, the inflammatory exudate pours out of the open fimbrial end to form a pelvic abscess. Eventually, the fimbrial end gets sealed and pus accumulates within the lumen leading to the formation of a distended retort-shaped fallopian tube called a pyosalpinx. <br><br>The pyosalpinx may respond to antibiotics, and the pus contained therein becomes sterile within 6 weeks of the initial attack. However, the damage to the tube remains as a chronic pyosalpinx or hydrosalpinx.<br><br>Acute PID usually presents as bilateral pain abdomen, high-grade fever, vomiting, dehydration, menstrual irregularities, and in cases of pelvic abscess, it may present as severe diarrhea due to rectal irritation.<br><br>Management includes rest, rehydration, analgesics, and antibiotics based on culture sensitivity. Antibiotics commonly used are cefoxitin, azithromycin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin. RCOG guideline recommends a single dose of IM ceftriaxone 250 mg followed by oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily with metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 14 days as outpatient treatment.

Ointments with antibiotics and steroids can also be used.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Rhinitis caseosa is a condition in which the nose is filled with purulent discharge/cheesy material. It is a unilateral condition mostly affecting males. This condition usually results from chronic sinusitis, where the mucosa of the sinuses becomes granulomatous and the sinuses are filled with cheesy material. Management includes the removal of debris and ensuring good drainage of the sinuses.<br><br>Option C: Secondary atrophic rhinitis is a condition when atrophic changes in the nasal cavity occur secondary to specific infections like syphilis, lupus, leprosy, and rhinoscleroma.<br><br>Option D: Hypertrophic rhinitis is a condition characterized by the thickening of mucosa, submucosa, seromucinous glands, periosteum, and bone. It occurs as a result of recurrent nasal infections, chronic sinusitis, and chronic irritation of the nasal mucosa. Symptoms include nasal obstruction, discharge, and headache.",

Since the pelvis is favorable, face-to-pubis delivery is possible in this mother.<br><br>Right occipito-posterior position (ROP) is the most common malposition, which occurs when the occiput is situated posteriorly over the sacroiliac joint, or directly over the sacrum. It is associated with the risk of delayed engagement of the head, prolonged labor due to transverse arrest, and the need for cesarean sections.<br><br>Features of the occipito-posterior position include infra-umbilical flattening and fetal heart sounds localized to the flank. The fetal parts are more prominently felt near the midline. The head engages through the right oblique diameter in ROP and the engaging AP diameter is occipitofrontal or suboccipito-frontal. <br><br>In the majority of cases where the pelvis is favorable, uterine contractions are strong, and no complications arise, it results in normal vaginal delivery. With the occiput (back of the baby's head) as the leading part, it rotates approximately 3/8th of a circle towards the front, positioning itself behind the symphysis pubis. Due to the limitations of the neck's ability to withstand such torsion, the shoulders then rotate about 2/8th of a circle, aligning with the right oblique diameter. Consequently, the remaining progression of labor resembles that of the right occipitoanterior position in ROP.<br><br>When there is incomplete forward rotation during labor, the occiput undergoes an anterior rotation of approximately 1/8th of a circle, causing the sagittal suture to align with the bi-spinous diameter of the pelvis. Subsequent further anterior rotation is unlikely, and when labor arrest occurs in this position, it is referred to as deep transverse arrest.<br><br>In certain instances, the labor process does not involve rotation and instead leads to a condition called oblique posterior arrest. This occurs when both the sinciput (front part of the baby's head) and the occiput (back part of the head) touch the pelvic floor at the same time. This simultaneous contact is a result of the head being moderately deflected, preventing the occiput from rotating. The sagittal suture lies in the oblique diameter.<br><br>When the head is severely deflected during labor, it can result in posterior rotation, known as the occipitosacral position. Under favorable conditions, such as having a baby of average size, strong uterine contractions, and a well-suited pelvis (such as an anthropoid or spacious gynaecoid pelvis), spontaneous delivery may occur as face to pubis. However, in unfavorable situations where labor arrest occurs, it is referred to as occipitosacral arrest.<br><br>Indications of cesarean section in the occipito-posterior position include the arrest of labor, inadequate uterine contractions, fetal distress, and other obstetrical complications.<br><br>During the second stage of labor, if the anterior rotation of the occiput is completed, delivery occurs spontaneously or may require the application of ventouse or low forceps.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c4e96c2bf728435d8baceb84d9333334x1052x990.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

In young children, hypervitaminosis A can present with headache, vomiting, and even bulging fontanelles. Pseudotumor cerebri (with elevated intracranial pressure), can present with diplopia and even papilledema. There can also be patches of itchy, desquamating skin. Abdominal examination may reveal hepatosplenomegaly.<br><br>Bones may show hyperostosis on x-ray.

It is endemic to certain parts of India like Andhra Pradesh (Nellore, Prakasam), Telangana(Nalgonda), Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Symptoms correspond to levels of fluoride intake:<br><br>* Dental fluorosis (1.5mg/L): Occurs if excess fluoride is ingested during the period of tooth calcification, i.e. in the first 7 years of life. It is best seen on the upper incisors and almost exclusively affects permanent teeth. It causes mottling of dental enamel, chalky-white appearance, and dull patches on the teeth in the early stages. The white spots progressively turn yellow and then brown-black. The loss of enamel gives a corroded appearance.<br><br>* Skeletal fluorosis (3-6mg/L): Occurs due to the heavy deposition of fluoride in the skeleton. Fluorosis stimulates osteoblastic activity, and fluorapatite crystals are laid down in bone. These are usually resistant to secondary osteoclastic resorption. This leads to calcium retention, osteosclerosis, and osteophytosis. Ossification of ligaments and fascial attachments is characteristic.<br><br>* Crippling fluorosis (>10mg/L): Can lead to permanent disability.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A - Removal of the hardness of water involves boiling water or the addition of lime to it for temporary hardness, or Base exchange/Permutit method for permanent hardness.<br><br>Option C - The Trickling filter method is a type of Secondary treatment for Sewage.<br><br>Option D- Controlled superchlorination of water is the addition of large amounts of chlorine to the water, for disinfection.

Most widely used insecticide. Attacks nerves of insects but doesn’t cause immediate death. White amorphous powder. Contains 70 – 80% of para-para isomers, which is the most active fraction of DDT. Has residual action up to 18 months. Used as a residual spray.Least toxic organo-chlorine compound.\nHCH (hexachlorocyclo-hexane) | Synthesized by Michael Faraday. Normal HCH contains 13 – 16% of gamma isomer. Gamma-HCH or lindane has 99% gamma isomer.Short residual action – 3 months.\nMalathion | Least toxicity of all organophosphorus compounds. Used as an ultra-low volume spray.\nFenthion | Also called baytex. Used as a residual spray.\nPyrethrum | Vegetable origin – Chrysanthemum cinerariafolium. Nerve poison and is excellent as a space spray.No residual action.Synergistic action with DDT as space spray.",

Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used in multiple myeloma.<br><br>Multiple myeloma typically occurs in the elderly population, and lower back pain can be a presenting feature, due to osteolytic vertebral metastatic lesions from the myeloma. Bony pain is the most common presenting symptom in multiple myeloma and should be taken seriously in the elderly. Persistent bony pain may indicate an underlying pathological fracture.<br><br>Electrophoresis refers to the movement of charged particles through an electrolyte upon being subjected to an electric field. Normally, serum electrophoresis results in 5 bands: albumin (55-65%), alpha-1-globulin(2-4%), alpha-2-globulin(6-12%), beta globulin(8-12%), and gamma globulin(12-22%). <br><br>In paraproteinemias such as Multiple Myeloma, there is a sharp spike known as M-band that is seen on electrophoresis, as seen in the image given which occurs due to monoclonal production of immunoglobulins by plasma cells. This is shown below:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f47a982fb6e14a60bcb1fed4e72dc2b3x858x842.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>The treatment of Multiple myeloma includes chemotherapy with various regimens and finally, autologous stem cell transplant to replace the affected bone marrow.

It also blocks the degradation of I-kappaBeta, which remains in a complex to NF-KB, an important inducer of cellular proliferation, which is then unable to act in the nucleus. Thus the myeloma cells undergo apoptosis in the absence of proliferative signals.<br><br>It is used as a first-line agent and also in relapsed patients of multiple myeloma and has been additionally approved for refractory/relapsed Mantle cell lymphoma. Adverse effects include thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, vomiting, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, and precipitation of hypotension, especially in volume-depleted patients.

The ducts of these glands open in the groove between the hymen and the labia minora at approximately 5 and 7 o’clock positions. These glands are stimulated by sexual arousal. Contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscle expresses gland secretions. The glands contain columnar cells that secrete mucus with lubricant properties.  <br><br>The male glands of Littre are homologous to mucous secreting periurethral glands in females.<br><br>Clinical conditions associated with the Bartholin gland are Bartholin cyst and Bartholin abscess. The cyst is caused by obstruction of the Bartholin ducts by proteinaceous material or by inflammation due to infection. An infected Bartholin cyst can lead to an abscess.<br><br>These infections commonly involve the duct and are most commonly sexually transmitted. It is generally polymicrobial. (Option A)Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, Escherichia coli, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are frequently encountered in the culture of purulent drainage. Less often, Chlamydia trachomatis may be identified.<br><br>Larger cysts can cause vaginal discomfort and dyspareunia. Abscesses will show erythema with tenderness. The cystic swelling and the abscess are both fluctuant. Bartholin cysts are transilluminating due to the clear fluid they contain. <br><br>Treatment:<br><br>* Analgesics for pain<br><br>* Antibiotic for combating infections.<br><br>* Specific treatment:<br><br>* Drainage under anesthesia: Generally conservative method, chances of re-infection and formation of granulation tissue can happen.<br><br>* Marsupialization Complete excision of sac and cyst along with drainage of the substance. The edges are also clearly approximated. This is the ideal management. (Option C) The advantages of marsupialization over other methods include:<br><br>* Simple procedure<br><br>* Can be done even under local anesthesia.<br><br>* Shorter hospital stay (24 hours).<br><br>* The postoperative complication is almost nil.<br><br>* Gland function (moisture) remains intact. <br><br>* Incision and drainage with Word catheter placement: A deflated Word catheter is used to tuck the vagina here and prevent it from damage that can happen during movement of the perineum and thus avert re-infection and granulation tissue formation. Alternatively, a 14 F foley catheter can also be used.<br><br>* Bartholinectomy: This is a very invasive surgery and carries a greater morbidity profile. This is also associated with loss of lubricant function. <br><br>In older women with recurrent Bartholin cyst, a suspicion of Bartholin gland cancer should arise and the cyst wall should be sent for biopsy.

The condition is self-limiting though debilitating with headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, petechiae rash, and leucopenia. A macular-papular recovery rash appears 3–5 days after the onset of fever, and it usually starts on the trunk before spreading peripherally.

The AV node is in the inter-atrial septum. Since the AV nodal conduction is slow, there is a delay before the impulse spreads to the ventricles.<br><br>The impulse from the AV node then spreads to the Purkinje fibers, which conduct rapidly to the ventricles. The depolarization of the ventricles starts at the interventricular septum and spreads to the cardiac apex. Thus, depolarization starts from the endocardium and then extends to the epicardium.<br><br>In normal conditions, repolarization retraces the path of depolarization and proceeds in the direction opposite to that of depolarization. So, repolarization first takes place in the epicardium and moves towards the endocardium.<br><br>Pearl PM0169: Duration of cardiac Cycle<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0d9186af5cd14040987e798d592d0312x1280x1601.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Cardiac Cycle Events | Systole(s) | Diastole(s) | Total (s)\nVentricles | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.8\nAtria | 0.1 | 0.7 | 0.8",
