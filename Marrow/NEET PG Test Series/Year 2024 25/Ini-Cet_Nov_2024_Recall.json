This bleeding prevents light from reaching the retina. If the bleeding is minor, may present with floaters. However, in more severe cases, the blood can fill the vitreous cavity, completely obstructing your vision.</li>\n<li><strong>Neovascular glaucoma</strong>: Abnormal blood vessels can grow out of the iris and can block fluid from draining properly, leading to a type of glaucoma. </li>\n<li><strong>Tractional retinal detachment</strong> occurs due to the formation of fibrovascular tissue from proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

They are <strong>weakly acid-fast</strong> because they stain with carbolfuchsin and retain when decolourized with 1–4% sulfuric acid instead of the stronger acid-alcohol decolorant.</p>\n<p>Infections caused by Nocardia include cutaneous, subcutaneous, or systemic lesions. It may lead to local abscesses, cellulitis, or lymphocutaneous lesions. Systemic nocardiosis occurs more often in <strong>immunodeficient</strong> persons.</p>\n<p>Infection follows traumatic inoculation of the organism into the subcutaneous tissue from soil or vegetable sources. They can present with a characteristic <strong>powdery substance</strong> that appears as gritty or necrotic material on the skin or within soft tissues. Accompanying this are <strong>multiple discharging</strong> <strong>sinuses</strong>, which are abnormal openings that form as the body attempts to expel infected material. These sinuses can drain purulent, often foul-smelling discharge typically associated with localised abscesses, and the discharge may be viscous, sometimes containing necrotic tissue.</p>\n<p>Systemic nocardiosis usually caused by N.asteroides manifests primarily as pulmonary disease, pneumonia, lung abscess, or other lesions resembling tuberculosis.

Hence, both drugs must be co-administered to treat both muscarinic and nicotinic symptoms.</p>\n<p>Option B: Treatment of <strong>atropine toxicity</strong> includes administration of a short-acting barbiturate or diazepam to control convulsions. <strong>Physostigmine</strong> is used as an antidote to atropine poisoning to treat delirium and coma.

When the clinical specimen from the patient is added to a suspension of the latex beads, the antibodies bind to the antigens on the microorganism forming a lattice structure, and agglutination of the beads occurs. Latex agglutination tests are mainly used for the detection of carbohydrate antigens of encapsulated microorganisms.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f6ef5f8544a042dd81434bfd70124adax720x465.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D: The <strong>Christie-Atkins-Munch-Peterson (CAMP)</strong> test is used to identify group B,  β-streptococci based on their ability to form CAMP factor, which causes synergistic hemolysis with β-hemolysin formed by Staphylococcus aureus.

Infection occurs through food or water contaminated with nightsoil or human faeces having eggs of Ascaris that contain the infective rhabditiform larva. Man is the only natural host. There is <strong>no intermediate host</strong>. Most infected humans are <strong>asymptomatic</strong>. <strong>(Option A)</strong></p>\n<p>The life cycle is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adult worms live in the lumen of the small intestine. A female produces eggs, which are passed with the faeces. </li>\n<li>Unfertilized eggs in the stool may be ingested but are not infective. The infective form of Ascaris is the <strong>embryonated egg</strong> in the soil <strong>(Option D)</strong>. Infection typically arises from consuming food or water contaminated with embryonated eggs. These eggs harbour the rhabditiform larva.</li>\n<li>After infective eggs are swallowed, the larvae hatch.</li>\n<li>The larvae invade the intestinal mucosa and are carried through the portal system, then systemic circulation to the lungs.</li>\n<li>The larvae mature further in the lungs (10 to 14 days), penetrate the alveolar walls, ascend the bronchial tree to the throat, and are swallowed. This may present with <strong>asthma-like symptoms (Option B).</strong></li>\n<li>Upon reaching the small intestine, they develop into adult worms. Between 2 and 3 months are required from ingestion of the infective eggs to oviposition by the adult female.</li>\n<li>Adult worms can live for 1 to 2 years.</li>\n<li>Adult worms can be occasionally detected in the stool or sputum of the patient. A definitive diagnosis is made by demonstration of eggs in faeces. Fertilised eggs are always bile-stained. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Effective and safe drugs for the treatment of ascariasis are <strong>Pyrantel pamoate</strong> 11 mg/kg once, <strong>Albendazole</strong> 400 mg once, <strong>Mebendazole</strong> 100 mg twice daily for 3 days, <strong>Ivermectin</strong> 150-200 mcg/kg once.</p>\n<p>The image below shows the life cycle of Ascaris lumbricoides: </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/81f6a51d04e64d3ab576fbf12e904e51x965x886.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

Poisoning with CO can lead to <strong>severe hypoxia</strong> at the cellular level, even in the presence of normal oxygen levels. <strong>(Option A)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cyanide:</strong> Cyanide binds <strong>irreversibly</strong> to the <strong>ferric (Fe³⁺) iron</strong> in the heme group of cytochrome c oxidase. It <strong>completely blocks electron transfer</strong> to oxygen, making it a potent inhibitor. Cyanide poisoning results in rapid <strong>cellular asphyxiation</strong> and is life-threatening. <strong>(Option B)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hydrogen Sulfide:</strong> Inhibits Complex IV at high concentrations by binding to its <strong>heme groups</strong>, similar to cyanide. Its inhibition is <strong>dose-dependent</strong>, but it remains a strong inhibitor at high levels.<strong> (Option D)</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Electron transport chain: components and its inhibitors</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/bcc617cb8a8343ff8c0208d7726a0ba7x1280x1468.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c87ed88288804113994e57192a28d6f8x1280x969.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

It has its own reflex circuits and can control gut motility, secretion, and blood flow without input from the brain or spinal cord, although it can be influenced by them.</p>\n<p>Statement 1: The <strong>vagus is the only afferent from the gut:</strong> While the vagus nerve does provide significant afferent (sensory) input from the gut, other nerves, such as those from the pelvic splanchnic nerves, also contribute to afferent pathways. Therefore, the vagus is not the only afferent nerve.</p>\n<p>Statement 3: <strong>​Myenteric plexus in the lamina propria: </strong>The myenteric plexus is located <strong>between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers </strong>of the gut, not in the lamina propria (which is part of the mucosal layer of the gut).</p>\n<p>​​Statement 4: <strong>Exclusively under the influence of nerves</strong>: The enteric nervous system is influenced by nerves, but it <strong>also responds to hormonal and immune system signals.</strong> Therefore, it is not exclusively under neural influence.</p>\n<p>Statement 5: <strong>Only parasympathetic connects enteric to CNS</strong>:<strong> Both parasympathetic and sympathetic connect</strong> the enteric nervous system to the central nervous system. Not just the parasympathetic.</p>\n<p>The <strong>enteric nervous system</strong> consists of submucosal and myenteric plexi. This Plexi can function independently and is often referred to as the ‘little brain’.

It innervates both these layers along the entire length of the GI tract. It primarily controls GI motility.

It innervates the GI glands, endocrine cells, and submucosal blood vessels. It primarily controls GI secretions, absorption, and local blood flow.</p>\n<p>The<strong> parasympathetic innervation</strong> of the plexi is from the vagus and pelvic nerves. They release either acetylcholine or substance P. It generally increases GI motility and secretion. </p>\n<p>The <strong>sympathetic innervation </strong>is from the celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, and hypogastric sympathetic ganglia. It generally inhibits GI motility and stimulates sphincteric contraction.</p>",

It usually signifies <strong>mild</strong> to <strong>moderate chronic vascular occlusive disease. </strong>The pain is brought on by walking, not present on taking the first step. Relieved by rest in both the standing and sitting positions, usually within 5 minutes (option A). The distance that a patient can walk without stopping is known as <strong>claudication distance</strong>. It varies only slightly from day to day. The superficial femoral artery (70%) is the <strong>most commonly </strong>affected artery by claudication and manifests as pain in the <strong>calf</strong> muscles. Aorto-iliac occlusion may cause thigh or buttock claudication. <strong>Leriche's syndrome</strong> occurs due to aortoiliac occlusion and presents with a triad of claudication, impotence, and absent femoral pulses.</p>\n<p><strong>Boyd's classification</strong> of claudication: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grade I: Patient complains of pain after walking. If the patient continues to walk, due to increased blood flow in muscle and opening of collaterals metabolites causing pain are washed away and the <strong>pain subsides</strong>.</li>\n<li>Grade II: <strong>Pain persists</strong> on continuing to walk; but can walk with effort.</li>\n<li>Grade III: The patient has to <strong>take</strong> <strong>rest</strong> to relieve the pain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Rest pain</strong> occurs when the occlusive disease progresses in severity. Though this pain is present during the day, it is exacerbated on lying down at night due to loss of gravity-dependent perfusion of the foot. This may be relieved by hanging the foot out of the bed to restore the gravitational effects.</p>\n<p>Option B: The development of pain on taking the <strong>first step </strong>of walking is a classic sign of <strong>osteoarthritis</strong>. </p>\n<p>Option C: Pain aggravated by standing and relieved by bending forward is seen in <strong>n</strong><strong>eurogenic claudication.</strong> It may be seen in cases of <strong>nerve compression</strong> from lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse or spinal stenosis.</p>",

The egg attaches to the intestine and develops into the larva and adult worm. The adult worm resides in the small intestine. Patients are usually asymptomatic. However, in heavy infections, they present with nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and irritability. Pruritus may also be present due to an allergic response.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Taenia solium</strong> is a parasitic tapeworm transmitted through undercooked pork, causing intestinal infection (taeniasis) or more severe cyst formation in tissues, including the brain (cysticercosis). It's prevalent in regions with poor sanitation and where pork is consumed.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Taenia saginata</strong> is a parasitic tapeworm transmitted through undercooked beef containing cysticerci (“measly” beef).

FSH (2mIU/ml), LH (0.3IU/L): These values are low, indicating that the pathology lies at the level of the hypothalamus or pituitary, rather than the ovaries. In hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, there is insufficient secretion of gonadotropins (FSH and LH), which are needed for ovarian function.

In response to changes in these parameters, they send impulses to the <strong>medullary respiratory centers </strong>and modify the duration and frequency of respiratory cycles.</p>\n<p>Peripheral chemoreceptors are <strong>most sensitive </strong>to a <strong>drop in partial pressure of oxygen</strong> (PaO₂) in arterial blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Type I glomus cells </strong>in the carotid and aortic bodies have <strong>O2-sensitive K+ channels</strong>, which are <strong>inactivated in response to hypoxia</strong>. This reduces the K+ efflux, <strong>depolarizing</strong> the cell and causing Ca2+ inﬂux, via L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The <strong>Ca2+ influx</strong> triggers action potentials and consequent <strong>excitation </strong>of the <strong>afferent nerve endings</strong> in the peripheral chemoreceptors.</p>\n<p><strong>Hypoxia</strong> (PaO₂ &lt; 60 mmHg) strongly <strong>stimulates </strong>these receptors, leading to an increase in respiratory rate and depth to improve oxygenation.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p>Peripheral chemoreceptors also respond to <strong>hypercapnia (Option A)</strong> and <strong>acidosis (Option C)</strong>. However, these are primarily detected by <strong>central chemoreceptors</strong>, located in the medulla, which monitor CO₂ levels in cerebrospinal fluid.</p>\n<p><strong>Alkalosis (Option D) </strong>causes a <strong>weaker response</strong> from peripheral chemoreceptors compared to hypoxia.</p>",
