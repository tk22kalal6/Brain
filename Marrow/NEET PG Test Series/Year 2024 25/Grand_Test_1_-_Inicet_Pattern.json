      "solution": "<p>Defense mechanisms involved in this scenario are <strong>displacement, avoidance,</strong> and<strong> symbolization</strong> - 1,3,4 (Option A).</p>\n<p>The clinical scenario of extreme fear of heights points toward <strong>acrophobia</strong> and the defense mechanisms involved in phobias are <strong>displacement</strong>,<strong> symbolization</strong>, and<strong> avoidance. </strong></p>\n<p>A <strong>phobia</strong> can be described as a fear that is irrational and out of proportion to the stimulus. Defense mechanisms mediate an individual's reaction to emotional conflicts and stressors. In displacement, the conflict or emotions are <strong>displaced</strong> from the actual cause to a less threatening, irrel­evant <strong>object or situation</strong>. </p>\n<p>The primary source of the conflict may have a <strong>direct associative connec­tion</strong> with the phobic object or situation that <strong>symbolizes</strong> it. This object is something the <strong>person can avoid</strong> and this protects the person from the anxiety attached to the original object or idea, which is the defense mechanism of <strong>symbolization</strong>.</p>\n<p>The phobic situation or the object is usually something that the person can <strong>avoid</strong>. With the defense mechanism of avoidance, the person can escape the anxiety associated with it. </p>\n<p><strong>Behavioral therapy</strong> is the most effective treatment for phobias. Insight-oriented therapy, virtual therapy, and exposure therapy are also used for the treatment of phobic disorders and specific phobias. <strong>β-receptor blockers</strong> can be used for the treatment of specific phobias, particularly if it is associated with panic attacks. <strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> can also be used but the chronic nature of the disease limits its effect. <strong>Paroxetine</strong> and <strong>sertraline</strong> can be used to manage <strong>social anxiety</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Dissociation</strong> is the<strong> splitting</strong> of mental contents in clusters from conscious awareness. This allows the individual to support two contradictory truths while not being aware of them. An extreme manifestation of this mechanism is seen in dissociative identity disorder. </p>\n<p><strong>Reaction formation</strong> is an unconscious defense mechanism in which the person develops a wish or impulse that is a <strong>direct antithesis</strong> to the ones that are harbored consciously or unconsciously. It develops against impulses that are unacceptable to the ego.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Defense mechanisms that operate in various diseases</h3><ul>\n<li><strong>OCD</strong> - reaction formation,

This is an inborn error of metabolism in which phenylalanine is unable to convert to tyrosine, resulting in the <strong>accumulation of phenylalanine</strong>. This results in the characteristic<strong> 'musty' odor</strong> of the urine and body fluids. These children can also present with <strong>seizures </strong>and hyperactivity.

This disorder is an <strong>inborn error of pyrimidine metabolism</strong> that presents with developmental delay, failure to thrive, and possibly epilepsy.

Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. </p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. </p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Crush Syndrome </strong></p>\n<p>Crush syndrome is the systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis. It is commonly caused due to prolonged external compression of an extremity. </p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Crush injuries sustained during motor vehicle accidents, earthquakes, mining and other occupational accidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Underperfusion of muscle causes myonecrosis. When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",

Patients present in the first few weeks of life with <strong>failure to thrive, vomiting, abdominal distention, steatorrhea,</strong> <strong>hepatosplenomegaly,</strong> and <strong>hyperlipidemia </strong>with extensive<strong> bilateral calcifications </strong>of the <strong>adrenal glands.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>LAL deficiency </strong>can present in two forms-<strong> Wolman disease</strong> and <strong>cholesterol ester storage disease</strong>. <strong>Cholesterol ester storage disease</strong> is less severe and usually <strong>presents late in adulthood</strong>, whereas <strong>Wolman</strong> disease presents within the first few weeks of life and results in <strong>death within</strong> the <strong>first 6 months of life</strong>. </p>\n<p>Wolman disease can be <strong>diagnosed</strong> by <strong>measuring LAL activity in peripheral leukocytes</strong> or cultured skin fibroblasts. <strong>Treatment</strong> is with a <strong>recombinant</strong> form of <strong>LAL.</strong> Those treated have been seen to survive beyond one year of age.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option (A): <strong>Krabbe disease</strong> is also a fatal disease of early infancy but it occurs due to a deficiency in the enzyme <strong>galactocerebrosidase</strong> and hence, the accumulation of galactosylceramide in the white matter of the brain.</p>\n<p>Option (B): <strong>Farber disease</strong> results from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme <strong>acid ceramidase</strong>. Thus, ceramide accumulates in various tissues, especially the joints. Symptoms include painful joint swelling and nodule formation, resembling rheumatoid arthritis within the first year of life.</p>\n<p>Option (D): <strong>Gaucher disease</strong> is one of the most common lysosomal storage disorders. It occurs due to a deficiency of<strong> acid β-glucosidase</strong>. It presents most commonly with organomegaly, bone pain, and pathological fractures. It is most prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Enzyme Replacement Therapy for Lysosomal Storage Disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Lysosomal Storage Disorder</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Enzyme deficient</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Enzyme Replacement Therapy</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hurler Syndrome (MPS I)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&alpha;-L -iduronidase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Laronidase (Aldurazyme)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hunter Syndrome (MPS II)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Iduronate sulfate sulfatase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Idursulfase (Elaprase)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Morquio A Syndrome (MPS IVA)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>N-Acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Elosulfase (Vimizim)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Maroteaux&ndash;Lamy Syndrome (MPS VI)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>N -Acetylgalactosamine-&alpha;-4-sulfate sulfatase (arylsulfatase B)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Galsulfase (Naglazyme)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Sly syndrome (MPS VII)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&beta;-Glucuronidase</td>\n<td>\n<p>rhGUS (recombinant human&nbsp;&beta;-Glucuronidase is under Phase III trial)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wolman disease</td>\n<td>Lysosomal acid lipase</td>\n<td>\n<p><em> Sebelipase alfa</em>(Kanuma, Alexion)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metachromatic leukodystrophy</td>\n<td>Arylsulfatase A</td>\n<td>\n<p>rhARSA (recombinant human arylsulfatase A is under Phase I/II trial)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fabry disease&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&alpha;-galactosidase A</td>\n<td>\n<p><em>agalsidase beta</em> (Fabrazyme, Genzyme)</p>\n<p><em>agalsidase alfa</em> (Replagal, Shire HGT)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gaucher disease</td>\n<td>&beta;-glucosidase</td>\n<td>\n<p><em>imiglucerase </em>[Cerezyme, Genzyme]</p>\n<p><em>velaglucerase alfa </em>[VPRIV, Shire HGT]</p>\n<p><em>taliglucerase alfa </em>(Uplyso, Protalix<br />Biotherapeutics)</p>\n<p><em>eliglusta</em>t (Cerdelga, Sanofi-Genzyme)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pompe disease</td>\n<td>acid &alpha;-1,4-glucosidase (acid maltase)&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p><em>alglucosidase alfa </em>(Myozyme)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Patients with mild disease may present with <strong>flu-like symptoms</strong> of sudden onset, fever with chills, headache, abdominal pain, conjunctival suffusion, and myalgia. The muscle pain usually affects the calves, abdomen, and back. Severe cases of leptospirosis, which can <strong>progress rapidly</strong> and have a high fatality rate, are associated with <strong>Weil's syndrome</strong>, characterized by a triad of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hemorrhage</li>\n<li>Jaundice</li>\n<li>Acute kidney injury</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The image below shows icterus and <strong>conjunctival suffusion</strong> in a patient with leptospirosis:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ecd4e30bd040404fadd04a33dc72a4c6x253x179.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Acute and convalescent sera</strong> are tested for <strong>anti-leptospiral antibodies </strong>to diagnose leptospira. The <strong>microscopic agglutination test </strong>(MAT) using paired sera (acute and convalescent phases) is the <strong>gold standard</strong> for detecting antibodies. A four-fold rise in antibody titers between acute and convalescent samples confirms the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Leptospires can be isolated from <strong>urine</strong>, but <strong>culture </strong>requires specialized media (e.g., Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris <strong>[EMJH] medium</strong>) and prolonged incubation (up to<strong> 6 weeks</strong>) (Option B). Leptospires are <strong>motile</strong> and can be visualized using <strong>dark-field microscopy</strong>, but the method is operator-dependent and <strong>lacks sensitivity </strong>(Option C). While leptospires may be found in the CSF during the first 10 days of illness, blood, and urine are more common diagnostic samples (Option D).</p>\n<p>Transmission occurs through cuts or <strong>breaks in the skin and mucous membranes</strong> (conjunctival and oral mucosa). Several outbreaks have been reported, resulting from exposure to floodwaters contaminated by <strong>urine from infected animals</strong>. The organism enters the bloodstream and lodges in the parenchymatous organs (liver and kidneys), leading to <strong>hemorrhage and tissue necrosis</strong>, which causes organ dysfunction. </p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> for leptospirosis depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, <strong>oral</strong> <strong>doxycycline</strong>, ampicillin, or amoxicillin is preferred, and in severe cases, intravenous penicillin, ampicillin, or ceftriaxone is commonly used.</p>",
