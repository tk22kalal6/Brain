      "solution": "<p>The combination of the given clinical history and JVP showing <strong>rapid y descent </strong>is highly suggestive of <strong>chronic</strong> <strong>constrictive pericarditis</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Constrictive pericarditis</strong> is a <strong>chronic</strong> type of pericarditis that results when there is healing of acute fibrinous pericarditis or absorption of chronic pericardial effusion. The most common cause in developing countries is tuberculosis, following viral pericarditis, cardiac surgery, mediastinal irradiation, or as a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis and SLE. The main abnormality that occurs in constrictive pericarditis is the inability of the ventricles to fill because of the <strong>rigid and thickened pericardium</strong>. The restriction is <strong>not uniform</strong> through the diastole as seen in <strong>tamponade</strong>. Ventricular filling is normal early in the diastole but stops suddenly when the elastic limit of the pericardium is reached.</p>\n<p>Y-descent on the JVP curve is prominent in constrictive pericarditis because it represents the <strong>rapid early filling</strong> of the ventricles. A sudden stop in ventricular filling and subsequent rising pressure is seen as a<strong> square root sign</strong> in the JVP curve.</p>\n<p>The patient presents with exertional dyspnea and orthopnea. There may be a <strong>paradoxical rise</strong> in venous pressure during inspiration (Kussmaul's sign) reflecting impaired right ventricular compliance. The ECG often shows low-voltage QRS complexes and diffuse flattening of T-waves. A chest radiograph may show pericardial calcification, especially in tuberculous pericarditis.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1f143aefb632469aa07ced16b5ffe19ex1280x878.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />The waveforms seen in a normal JVP are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>a wave</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial contraction</strong> and occurs just after the P wave (on ECG) and just before the first heart sound.</li>\n<li><strong>c wave</strong> represents the <strong>bulging of the tricuspid valve</strong> into the <strong>right atrium</strong> during ventricular systole.</li>\n<li><strong>x descent</strong> corresponds to the <strong>atrial relaxation</strong> during atrial diastole.</li>\n<li><strong>v wave</strong> represents <strong>atrial filling</strong> during <strong>ventricular</strong> <strong>systole</strong> and peaks at the second heart sound.</li>\n<li><strong>y descent</strong> represents <strong>passive emptying</strong> of the <strong>right atrium</strong> into the <strong>right ventricle</strong> after tricuspid valve opening.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A normal tracing of the jugular venous pulse is given below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/aadf1359f05d4cddb10f327bf9ca3ab6x720x470.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Cardiac tamponade</strong>:  On JVP tracing, cardiac tamponade characteristically shows a <strong>prominent x-descent</strong> and <strong>absent y-descent</strong>.</p>\n<p>The image of JVP in cardiac tamponade is given below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a0e64599e33443c2b1c7097c72d9e38bx1279x840.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C: Mid-diastolic murmur is seen in <strong>mitral stenosis</strong> (MS).

      "solution": "<p>The role of caffeine in the wakefulness in this patient is that <strong>caffeine inhibits adenosine receptors</strong>, thus leading to <strong>awakening.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Caffeine</strong>, a commonly used <strong>stimulant</strong>, plays a significant role in <strong>promoting wakefulness</strong> and <strong>alertness</strong>. It functions primarily as an <strong>antagonist</strong> at <strong>adenosine A2A receptors</strong> in the brain. <strong>Adenosine</strong>, a natural <strong>neuromodulator </strong>which accumulates in the basal forebrain area promotes <strong>sleepiness</strong> and <strong>relaxation</strong> by activating these receptors. By blocking adenosine A2A receptors, caffeine counteracts these sedative effects, thus helping to increase wakefulness and reduce fatigue.</p>\n<p>In addition to its receptor antagonism, caffeine <strong>inhibits cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases</strong>, which leads to <strong>increased</strong> levels of <strong>cyclic AMP</strong> (cAMP) in the brain. This action enhances the release of neurotransmitters such as <strong>norepinephrine (NE)</strong> and <strong>dopamine (DA)</strong>, further contributing to increased neural activity and alertness. Caffeine is <strong>rapidly absorbed</strong> from the digestive tract and crosses the blood-brain barrier easily, affecting brain function soon after consumption.</p>\n<p>Caffeine's stimulating effects can also be influenced by factors such as metabolism, which varies widely among individuals. For instance, <strong>smoking</strong> can <strong>reduce caffeine's half-life</strong>, making it clear from the body faster, while <strong>oral contraceptives</strong> can <strong>prolong </strong>its effects. Therefore, consuming caffeine close to bedtime, as in the case of drinking black coffee an hour before bed, can interfere with sleep by sustaining wakefulness and reducing the ability to fall asleep.</p>",

Recent advances in treatment include biologics such as <strong>Dupilumab</strong> and <strong>IL-5 inhibitors</strong>, which are increasingly effective in managing aspirin-induced asthma and may replace aspirin desensitization except when ongoing aspirin or NSAID therapy is required.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The reaction in aspirin-induced asthma is <strong>not</strong> due to an <strong>allergic sensitization</strong> but rather due to the inhibition of COX-1 and subsequent overproduction of leukotrienes.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Montelukast</strong>, a l<strong>eukotriene receptor antagonist,</strong> is effective in managing symptoms of aspirin-induced asthma by counteracting the elevated levels of leukotrienes that contribute to inflammation and respiratory issues.</p>\n<p>Option D: It occurs with exposure to other NSAIDs too, that block COX-1. Patients with aspirin-induced asthma can react to other <strong>NSAIDs </strong>that <strong>inhibit COX-1</strong>, not just aspirin. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Extrinsic vs Intrinsic asthma</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Component</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Extrinsic asthma</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Intrinsic asthma</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other names</td>\n<td>Atopic/ allergic asthma</td>\n<td>Non-atopic/ non-allergic/ idiosyncratic asthma</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Associated with&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Atopy, drug or food allergy (past or family history)</td>\n<td>Samter&rsquo;s triad (asthma + aspirin sensitivity + sinus disease with recurrent nasal polyps)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Onset</td>\n<td>Childhood</td>\n<td>Adult</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inflammation</td>\n<td>Eosinophil mediated</td>\n<td>Neutrophil mediated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IgE levels</td>\n<td>&uarr; IgE (type 1 hypersensitivity)</td>\n<td>Normal IgE (negative skin prick test)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Most common trigger</td>\n<td>Dermatophagoides (House mite)</td>\n<td>\n<p>Superantigen -&nbsp;<br /><em>S. aureus</em> enterotoxin</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response to inhaled corticosteroids</td>\n<td>Responds well&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased short term response</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prognosis</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td>Bad</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "<p>For managing <strong>urinary incontinence</strong> in a 75-year-old female with <strong>cognitive decline</strong> and <strong>dementia</strong>, <strong>tolterodine</strong> is useful.</p>\n<p>Tolterodine is a <strong>muscarinic receptor antagonist</strong> specifically effective for treating urinary incontinence. It exhibits selectivity for the urinary bladder, which helps to minimize side effects compared to other antimuscarinic agents. This selectivity is <strong>beneficial</strong> for patients with <strong>cognitive decline </strong>or dementia, as it <strong>reduces </strong>the risk of <strong>adverse effects.</strong> Tolterodine is <strong>metabolized</strong> by <strong>CYP2D6</strong>, so its dosage may need adjustment based on individual CYP2D6 activity, making it a suitable option for managing urinary incontinence while minimizing potential side effects.</p>\n<p>Other muscarinic antagonists for urinary incontinence include <strong>oxybutynin, trospium chloride, darifenacin, solifenacin</strong>, and <strong>fesoterodine</strong>. <strong>Oxybutynin</strong>, though effective, often causes antimuscarinic side effects such as <strong>xerostomia</strong>. <strong>Trospium</strong> chloride, being a quaternary amine, is better tolerated and <strong>excreted primarily</strong> via the<strong> kidneys</strong>, requiring dosage adjustments in renal impairment. <strong>Darifenacin</strong> and <strong>solifenacin</strong> have selectivity for<strong> M3 receptors</strong>, which helps balance efficacy and side effects, while <strong>fesoterodine</strong>, a <strong>prodrug</strong>, provides a stable pharmacokinetic profile due to its <strong>conversion</strong> to <strong>tolterodine’s active metabolite</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Tiotropium</strong> and Option C: <strong>Ipratropium</strong> are <strong>muscarinic antagonists</strong> used primarily for respiratory conditions such as <strong>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</strong> and <strong>asthma</strong>, rather than urinary incontinence. <strong>Tiotropium</strong> is a <strong>long</strong>-acting agent with selectivity for <strong>M1 </strong>and <strong>M3</strong> receptors, while <strong>Ipratropium</strong> is used more frequently for its<strong> short</strong>-acting effects.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Telenzepine</strong>, an <strong>analogue</strong> of <strong>Pirenzepine</strong>, displays higher potency and selectivity for <strong>M1</strong> receptors compared to pirenzepine and is used in treating <strong>acid-peptic diseas</strong>e, not urinary incontinence. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Muscarinic antagonists indicated for detrusor instability/overactive bladder</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mechanism/Feature</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Drug</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Direct smooth muscle relaxant &nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Flavoxate</p>\n<p>Oxybutynin</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bladder selective &nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tolterodine</p>\n<p>Fesoterodine (prodrug)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Only quaternary compound &nbsp;</td>\n<td>Trospium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>M3 selective &nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Darifenacin</p>\n<p>Solifenacin</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "<p>The \"<strong>box sign</strong>\" is associated with <strong>morphea</strong>, also known as <strong>localized scleroderma</strong>.</p>\n<p>Morphea is a condition characterized by <strong>localized skin sclerosis</strong> and <strong>fibrosis</strong> due to <strong>increased collagen deposition</strong>. This can lead to <strong>well-defined,</strong> <strong>box-like patches</strong> of thickened, hardened skin. The \"box sign\" refers to the <strong>sharp</strong>, boxy edges of these lesions, which can vary in depth and extent, sometimes involving <strong>deeper tissues</strong> such as <strong>muscle</strong> and <strong>bone</strong>.</p>\n<p>Biopsies taken during the indurative stage often display <strong>squared-off edges</strong>, resulting in a \"<strong>box-shaped</strong>\" or \"<strong>boxed dermis</strong>\" appearance under the microscope, which can vary in depth and extent, sometimes involving deeper tissues such as <strong>muscle</strong> and <strong>bone</strong>. This characteristic sign occurs because of <strong>extensive collagen sclerosis</strong> throughout the <strong>reticular dermis</strong> and extending into the <strong>subcutaneous fat septa</strong>. The pronounced sclerosis of the collagen fibers causes this distinct boxy appearance. <strong>Similar squared-off edges</strong> may also be observed in <strong>morphea-lichen sclerosus</strong> overlap and scleredema, due to comparable changes in the dermal and subcutaneous tissue structure.</p>\n<p>The epidermis in morphea can exhibit varying changes, from normal to <strong>flattened</strong> with <strong>loss of rete ridges</strong>, or slightly acanthotic. In the inflammatory phase, the reticular dermis shows edema and a dense perivascular infiltrate, which gradually gives way to thickened, <strong>horizontally oriented collagen bundles</strong>. The <strong>loss of adnexal structures</strong>, such as hair follicles and eccrine glands, is common, and the subcutaneous fat may be <strong>replaced</strong> by <strong>collagen</strong>, contributing to the appearance of a \"box sign.\"</p>\n<p>Management of morphea focuses on <strong>controlling inflammation</strong> and preventing disease progression. Early intervention is crucial and may include <strong>topical treatments</strong> like<strong> corticosteroids</strong> or <strong>tacrolimus</strong> for localized lesions. For more extensive or resistant cases, <strong>phototherapy</strong> and systemic treatments, such as <strong>methotrexate</strong> or <strong>oral corticosteroids,</strong> may be considered. The choice of therapy often depends on the extent and activity of the disease, with the goal of minimizing skin damage and improving functional outcomes.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Lichen planus</strong> is a <strong>papulosquamous</strong> lesion presenting as <strong>pruritic</strong>, <strong>purple,</strong> polygonal, planar, papules and plaques.

It is mostly seen in <strong>children</strong> and <strong>young adults</strong>. Lesions of lichen nitidus are typically described as a <strong>minute pinpoint</strong> to pinhead-size, flat or dome-shaped <strong>papules</strong> with a shiny surface.

The <strong>kidney</strong> is the <strong>most common organ</strong> involved in amyloidosis. Abnormal fibrils are produced by the aggregation of <strong>misfolded proteins</strong>. The fibrillar deposits bind a wide variety of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, including <strong>heparan sulfate </strong>and <strong>dermatan sulfate</strong>, and plasma proteins, notably serum amyloid P component (SAP).

      "solution": "<p>The clinical manifestations of severe headache with CT revealing <strong>blood</strong> in the <strong>basal cistern</strong> point to a diagnosis of <strong>subarachnoid haemorrhage</strong> (SAH).</p><p>Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is bleeding into the subarachnoid space, which is the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. The diagnosis is suspected when a <strong>hyperattenuating material</strong> is seen <strong>filling the subarachnoid space</strong>. Most commonly this is apparent <strong>around the circle of Willis</strong>, on account of the majority of berry aneurysms occurring in this region (65%), or in the Sylvian fissure (30%).</p>\n<p>The <strong>modified Fisher scale</strong> is a method for grading SAH as seen on non-contrast CT (NCCT). The <strong>Hunt and Hess scale</strong> describes the severity of SAH and is used as a predictor of survival. <strong>Xanthochromia on CSF</strong> is indicative of SAH in case of a negative CT scan. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Arteriovenous malformation</strong> (AVM) is a congenital vascular anomaly characterized by a <strong>tangle</strong> of <strong>abnormal</strong> <strong>blood vessels</strong> connecting arteries and veins. AVMs are more likely to cause <strong>haemorrhage</strong> or <strong>seizures</strong> and typically appear as highly vascular lesions on imaging, not as cystic lesions.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Intraparenchymal hemorrhage</strong> results from damage to <strong>lenticulostriate arteries</strong>. <strong>Hyperdensity</strong> within the brain parenchyma is seen on CT.</p>\n<p>Option D: Acute <strong>subdural haemorrhage</strong> results from the accumulation of blood between the <strong>arachnoid membrane</strong> and the <strong>dura</strong>. The tearing of a <strong>bridging vein</strong> from the cerebral cortex to the dural sinuses is the most common cause of acute SDH. On head CT scan, acute SDH appears as a hyperdense, crescent-shaped (concavo-convex).</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types of Intracranial Hemorrhage</h3><p><strong>1.

The abnormal head impulse test result is due to the VOR being impaired on the side of the vestibular lesion leading to <strong>saccades</strong>. Saccades are <strong>rapid, ballistic movements</strong> of the <strong>eyes</strong> that abruptly try to return to the point of fixation/ gaze.  </p>\n<p>The head impulse test is done by asking the patient to focus on a target. Then, the patient's head is quickly rotated to the left or right. If there is a <strong>deficiency in the VOR</strong>, the <strong>head movement</strong> will be followed by a<strong> catch-up saccade</strong> <strong>in the opposite direction. </strong>Thus, in <strong>left vestibular neuritis, </strong>a <strong>rightward saccade is seen</strong> following a<strong> left-side head rotation</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Vestibular neuritis</strong> is distinguished from central causes of vertigo by its characteristic findings: a <strong>positive head impulse test</strong>, <strong>absence </strong>of <strong>skew deviation</strong>, and spontaneous <strong>unidirectional nystagmus</strong>. <strong>Central vertigo</strong>, on the other hand, presents with a <strong>normal head impulse test, vertical skew deviation, bidirectional nystagmus</strong>, and additional neurological signs like diplopia, weakness, or dysarthria.

In AS, the heart works <strong>harder</strong> to <strong>overcome</strong> the <strong>elevated pressure gradient</strong> between the <strong>left ventricle</strong> (LV) and the <strong>aorta</strong>, leading to <strong>increased myocardial oxygen demand</strong>. This is in contrast to <strong>AR</strong>, where the primary issue is <strong>volume overload</strong> rather than pressure overload.</p>\n<p>Three <strong>cardinal</strong> clinical <strong>features</strong> of aortic stenosis are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Exertional dyspnea -</strong> this occurs due to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Raised end-diastolic LV volume and reduced LV compliance lead to increased LV pressure, leading to elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Angina pectoris -</strong> it occurs due to the combination of the increased O<sub><span class=\"s1\">2 </span></sub>needs of hypertrophied myocardium and reduction of O<sub><span class=\"s1\">2 </span></sub>delivery.</li>\n<li><strong>Syncope -</strong> it occurs due to the combination of decreased cardiac output and systemic arterial dilation which lead to a reduction of cerebral perfusion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The progression of AS involves a<strong> gradual narrowing </strong>of the valve orifice, which increases pressure work for the LV and leads to <strong>concentric hypertrophy</strong> as an adaptive response. This process, akin to <strong>vascular atherosclerosis</strong>, involves endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation, and inflammation, contributing to the valve's calcification and eventual stenosis. The pathophysiology of AS results in a significant systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve. Initially, this pressure gradient leads to<strong> LV hypertrophy</strong> as the heart compensates for the increased afterload. Over time, however, this compensatory mechanism becomes maladaptive, leading to decreased LV function and <strong>heart failure symptoms</strong>. In severe cases, symptoms such as <strong>exertional dyspnea, angin</strong>a, and <strong>syncope</strong> may develop, reflecting the<strong> increased myocardial oxygen demand</strong> due to the elevated pressure work.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The clinical scenario points to <strong>iron toxicity</strong>, which is managed with <strong>deferoxamine</strong> (also known as <strong>desferrioxamine</strong>), <strong>calcium EDETATE</strong> and <strong>DTPA </strong>whereas Dimercaprol, also known as <strong>BAL</strong> (British anti-Lewisite), is used to treat <strong>arsenic, mercury poisoning, and Wilson's disease.</strong></p>\n<p>Large amounts of ferrous salts can be fatal in <strong>children</strong>. Initial symptoms include <strong>abdominal pain</strong>, diarrhea, vomiting, and <strong>gastrointestinal bleeding</strong>. In severe cases, <strong>cyanosis</strong> and hyperventilation due to <strong>acidosis</strong> can develop. This can sometimes be followed by an <strong>asymptomatic phase</strong>. Later, hypoglycemia and hepatic and renal failure can develop. <strong>Pyloric stenosis</strong> and gastric scarring can develop due to its corrosive nature. Ultimately, if left untreated, the child can die.</p>\n<p>The gastric contents can be used for an iron color test to estimate the iron concentration in plasma. As iron tablets are <strong>radiopaque</strong>, an X-ray can be used to assess the number of pills taken. <strong>Deferoxamine (Option B)</strong> is selectively used as a chelating agent to manage cases of<strong> acute iron poisoning</strong>, hemochromatosis, and patients with iron overload from repetitive blood transfusions. Desferrioxamine can be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously <strong>but not orally</strong>. Side effects include pruritus, wheals, rash, and anaphylaxis. </p>\n<p><strong>Deferiprone</strong> and <strong>deferasirox</strong> are other <strong>oral</strong> iron chelators used to treat iron overload in<strong> thalassemia</strong> patients. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option C : Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (<strong>EDTA</strong>) is used for <strong>acute lead poisoning.</strong> It is <strong>not suitable</strong> for the management of chronic lead poisoning. The calcium salt of EDTA can be used in the management of<strong> heavy metal poisonings</strong> where the metal in question has a higher affinity for EDTA than calcium in vivo. Because of their lower affinity to EDTA, mercury and arsenic cannot be effectively chelated. </p>\n<p>Option D : Diethylenetriamene pentaacetate (<strong>DTPA</strong>) is a chelating agents which works by binding and holding on to <strong>radioactive materials </strong>(plutonium, americium, and curium) and poisons like iron. <strong>Calcium DTPA</strong> is well tolerated and effective as desferrioxamine in mobilising iron than<strong> Zinc DTPA.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Specific antidotes for poisoning</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ANTIDOTE</strong></td>\n<td><strong>POISONING</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4-methyl pyrazole</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>100% oxygen </strong></td>\n<td>Carbon monoxide, cyanide, methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ammonium chloride </strong></td>\n<td>Phencyclidine, amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Amyl nitrate </strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide, hydrogen sulphide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Atropine</strong></td>\n<td>Carbamate and organophosphorus poisoning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bupropion</strong></td>\n<td>Nicotine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium disodium edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, magnesium, nickel, uranium, zinc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium gluconate </strong></td>\n<td>Precipitates fluorides, magnesium and oxalates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Chlorpromazine</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Deferoxamine</strong></td>\n<td>Iron, aluminium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diazepam</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine, chloroquine, alcohol withdrawal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dicobalt edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dimercaprol (BAL)</strong></td>\n<td>Antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and gold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diphenhydramine</strong></td>\n<td>Phenothiazines and related drugs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disodium calcium edetate</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMPS *, (Unithiol)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Mercury</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMSA ** </strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>D-Penicillamine (Cuprimine) </strong></td>\n<td>Copper, lead, mercury, chromate, nickel, zinc, arsenic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ethanol</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fab fragment</strong></td>\n<td>Digoxin, digitoxin, oleander tea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Flumazenil</strong></td>\n<td>Benzodiazepine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Glucagon</strong></td>\n<td>Propranolol and other beta-blockers toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hydroxocobalamin</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Labetalol hydrochloride</strong></td>\n<td>Hypertensive crisis due to cocaine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methionine</strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methylene blue</strong></td>\n<td>Methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>N-acetylcysteine </strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol, acetaminophen toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nalorphine</strong></td>\n<td>Morphine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Naloxone (Naltrexone)</strong></td>\n<td>Narcotic, opiates, CNS depressants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nicotinamide</strong></td>\n<td>Vacor poisoning, phenylurea pesticide toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pancuronium bromide</strong></td>\n<td>Neuromuscular blocking agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Penicillamine</strong></td>\n<td>Copper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Physostigmine salicylate </strong></td>\n<td>Coma, convulsions from anticholinergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pralidoxime (2-PAM) </strong></td>\n<td>Organophosphorus insecticides, nerve agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Propranolol</strong></td>\n<td>Cocaine intoxication, beta adrenergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Protamine sulphate </strong></td>\n<td>Heparin overdose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prussian blue</strong></td>\n<td>Thallium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pyridoxine (Vit.

These symptoms are indicative of an infection caused by the <strong>Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2</strong>), which is the primary cause of genital herpes.</p>\n<p>Genital herpes is characterized by <strong>vesiculoulcerative lesions</strong>, which appear as <strong>grouped vesicles</strong> filled with clear fluid on the <strong>penis </strong>in males or on the <strong>cervix, vulva, vagina,</strong> and <strong>perineum</strong> in females. The <strong>painful </strong>nature of these lesions, combined with the history of <strong>multiple sexual partners</strong> and inconsistent condom use, supports the diagnosis. <strong>Recurrences</strong> of genital herpes are <strong>common</strong> and generally tend to be milder compared to the initial outbreak.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Chancroid</strong> caused by <em><strong>Haemophilus ducreyi</strong></em> may also present with soft wide <strong>indurated painful genital ulcers</strong> and painful genital <strong>lymphadenopathy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: In <strong>primary syphilis, </strong>the typical primary chancre usually begins as a single<strong> painless papule</strong> that rapidly becomes eroded and usually becomes indurated, with a characteristic cartilaginous consistency on palpation of the edge and base of the ulcer.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Granuloma inguinale </strong>(also known as<strong> donovanosis</strong>) is caused by <em><strong>Klebsiella granulomatis</strong></em>.

      "solution": "<p>The clinical scenario of<strong> secondary infertility </strong>with previous uneventful delivery and the laparoscopy image showing <strong>multiple granulomatous foci</strong> which are <strong>tuberculous lesions</strong> point towards the diagnosis of<strong> genital tuberculosis.</strong></p>\n<p>Genital tuberculosis is almost always secondary to a primary focus elsewhere. The most frequent location is the lungs (50%), although it can also come from lymph nodes (40%), kidneys, joints, the gastrointestinal system, or as part of a broad miliary infection. It mostly spreads via<strong> the haematogenous route or lymphatics sometimes. </strong></p>\n<p>In Genital tuberculosis, the leading presenting complaints include<strong> infertility, abdominal pain, vaginal discharge</strong>, and suspicion of neoplasm. 10-15% of women are found to be asymptomatic as well. </p>\n<p>The <strong>fallopian tubes</strong> are the<strong> most common site</strong> to be affected. The disease subsequently spreads to other genital organs and the peritoneum. </p>\n<p><strong>Investigations</strong>:</p>\n<p>1. Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (<strong>ESR</strong>), enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (<strong>ELISA</strong>) tests - lgG and IgM, and <strong>Mantoux tests</strong> are done to evaluate the case of genital tuberculosis. The nucleic acid amplification technique (<strong>NAAT</strong>) can detect tuberculosis within a few hours compared to culture.</p>\n<p>2. Hysterosalpingography (<strong>HSG</strong>) - If genital tuberculosis is suspected, HSG should not be performed because of the risk of spread of infection.</p>\n<p>If performed in an asymptomatic woman, the following patterns may be seen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The tobacco-pouch appearance</strong> of hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx with blocked fimbrial end.</li>\n<li>Rigid non-peristaltic pipe-like tube (l<strong>ead-pipe appearance</strong>).</li>\n<li><strong>Beading</strong> and variation in filling defect.</li>\n<li>The jagged fluffiness of the tubal outline.</li>\n<li><strong>Golf club appearance</strong> with slight or moderate dilatation of the ampullary portion of the fallopian tube.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3. The investigation of choice in genital tuberculosis is an <strong>endometrial biopsy</strong>. Endometrium tissue is obtained by D&amp;C/hystroscopy-directed biopsy. The endometrial scrapings are used for histopathology, PCR testing, and AFB smear and culture. </p>\n<p><strong>Diagnostic laparoscopy</strong> is widely used to establish the diagnosis of genital tuberculosis/ abdominal pelvic tuberculosis. <strong>Tuberculous lesions</strong> can be seen on the parietal peritoneum, intestinal serosa, omentum, surface of the uterus, and fallopian tubes.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: ATT Regimen for TB Patients</h3><p>As per the latest recommendations from <strong>National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP)</strong>, treatment of TB is now based primarily on <strong>drug susceptibility testing</strong>.

Increased positive pressure can contribute to the development or worsening of a tension pneumothorax.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Left-Sided Pleural Effusion: While this condition can also cause decreased breath sounds and hypoxia, it typically does not cause acute increases in intrathoracic pressure.</p>\n<p>Option C: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is characterized by diffuse lung inflammation and can lead to hypoxia. However, it generally does not cause localized decreased breath sounds.</p>\n<p>Option D: Left-Sided Pneumonia: Pneumonia can cause hypoxia and decreased breath sounds but is less likely to be associated with a sudden increase in intrathoracic pressure.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario along with the image is suggestive of <strong>congenital malformations of the airway</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Congenital pulmonary airway malformation</strong> (CPAM) is a condition where more <strong>normal lung tissue</strong> is mixed with <strong>hamartomatous</strong> or <strong>dysplastic lung tissue</strong>, usually confined to one lobe. The lesion most likely originates from a maldevelopment of <strong>terminal bronchiolar structures</strong> caused by an embryologic injury that occurred prior to the <strong>35th day</strong> of gestation.</p>\n<p><strong>Pneumothorax</strong>, <strong>recurrent respiratory infections</strong>, and <strong>respiratory distress</strong> can all manifest in patients during the <strong>newborn</strong> or early infancy period. One could <strong>mistake</strong> the lesion for a <strong>diaphragmatic hernia</strong>. Until mid-childhood, when episodes of recurrent or persistent pulmonary infection or chest pain occur, patients with <strong>smaller lesions</strong> typically are asymptomatic.</p>\n<p>Treatment includes <strong>aspiration</strong> of macrocystic lesions, <strong>excision</strong> of the <strong>affected lobe</strong> for microcystic lesions, and infrequently, <strong>open foetal surgery</strong> for severely affected infants. For patients with symptoms in the postnatal period, surgery is recommended.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Lung abscess</strong> represents <strong>necrosis</strong> and <strong>cavitation</strong> of the lung following <strong>microbial infection</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Chest X-ray</strong> features of lung abscess include a <strong>lung cavity</strong> with an <strong>air-fluid level</strong> and a thick and irregular cavity wall with surrounding pulmonary infiltrate. The image showing the lung abscess is given below:</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/8666fba9870348fe81ab3a293c491492.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia</strong> (CDH) is a <strong>birth defect</strong> of the diaphragm. Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, hindering proper lung formation and resulting in pulmonary hypoplasia.</p>\n<p>The most common type of CDH is a <strong>Bochdalek hernia,</strong> which in most cases involves the left side. CDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants and a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to two complications: <strong>pulmonary hypoplasia</strong> and <strong>pulmonary hypertension</strong>. The image of Bochdalek hernia is given below:</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/b68b2036208e43cc9f6c75d31dd58354.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Pyopneumothorax</strong> is a <strong>pleural collection</strong> of <strong>pus</strong> and <strong>gas</strong>, also referred to as <strong>empyemic hydropneumothorax</strong> or <strong>infected hydropneumothorax</strong>. It could be compared to a thoracic empyema variation that contains gas. Chest pain and fever are typically the patient's initial complaints.</p>\n<p>X-ray shows <strong>gas-fluid level</strong>. It could have <strong>loculations</strong>. There appears to be a <strong>loss of silhouette</strong> around the <strong>diaphragm</strong> dome. The thick pleural lining is strongly indicative of the pyopneumothorax.</p>",

Mineralocorticoid replacement is done with <strong>fludrocortisone</strong> 100-150 μg.</p>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p>Option A: Primary hyperaldosteronism (<strong>Conn syndrome</strong>), is characterized by <strong>excessive</strong> production of <strong>aldosterone</strong> by the adrenal glands. Patients commonly present with <strong>fatigue</strong>, <strong>muscle weakness</strong>, <strong>headaches</strong>, <strong>palpitations</strong>, and <strong>high blood pressure</strong>. <strong>Hypokalemia</strong> can cause muscle cramps, weakness, and even paralysis in severe cases. The diagnosis is suspected based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings of elevated plasma aldosterone and suppressed plasma renin activity.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Vitamin B12 deficiency</strong> can cause <strong>subacute combined degeneration</strong>. Patients present with <strong>sensory ataxia</strong> (involvement of the dorsal column) and UMN type of motor symptoms such as spasticity and positive Babinski sign (involvement of corticospinal tract). Because of coexisting <strong>peripheral neuropathy</strong>, <strong>deep tendon reflexes</strong> can be <strong>absent</strong>. Some patients also develop cortical defects such as dementia. These patients can also have skin hyperpigmentation, but the presence of hyponatremia and low blood pressure makes this unlikely. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Cushing's syndrome</strong> is characterized by clinical features that result from <strong>chronic</strong> exposure to <strong>excess glucocorticoids</strong> that can be due to prolonged exogenous administration of glucocorticoids, excess endogenous cortisol secretion, and ectopic ACTH production. Clinical features include <strong>moon facies</strong>, <strong>purple skin striae</strong>, abnormal masculinization (acne, bruising, enlargement of the clitoris in girls), pubertal developmental delay and <strong>amenorrhea</strong> in girls, <strong>proximal muscle weakness</strong>, <strong>osteoporosis</strong>, <strong>hypertension</strong>, <strong>hyperpigmentation</strong>, <strong>hypokalemic alkalosis</strong>, <strong>hyperglycemia</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of Adrenocortical Insufficiency</h3><p><strong>Primary</strong><strong>&nbsp;adrenal insufficiency:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anatomical destruction of gland</li>\n<li>Autoimmune (Addison's disease)</li>\n<li>Isolated autoimmune adrenalitis (polygenic)</li>\n<li>Infections -&nbsp;HIV, tuberculosis, fungi</li>\n<li>Surgical removal</li>\n<li>Acute hemorrhagic necrosis (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)</li>\n<li>Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis</li>\n<li>Metastatic carcinoma</li>\n<li>Cytotoxic agents &ndash; mitotane</li>\n<li>Enzyme inhibitors &ndash; metyrapone, ketoconazole</li>\n<li>Congenital adrenal hypoplasia</li>\n<li>Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (AIRE1 gene on 21q22)</li>\n<li>Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 2 (polygenic)</li>\n<li>X-linked adrenal hypoplasia (DAX1 gene on Xp21)</li>\n<li>Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD gene on Xq28)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Secondary adrenal insufficiency:</strong></p>\n<p>Hypopituitarism due to hypothalamic or pituitary disease</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Neoplasm</li>\n<li>Infiltration (sarcoidosis)</li>\n<li>Infection (tuberculosis, pyogenic, fungal)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Suppression of HPA axis</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By endogenous steroids from tumor</li>\n<li>By exogenous steroids</li>\n</ul>",

There is a marked compensatory urinary copper excretion.

Its active form, <strong>thiamine diphosphate</strong>, acts as a <strong>coenzyme</strong> for three critical enzyme complexes: <strong>pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase,</strong> and <strong>branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase.</strong> This coenzyme facilitates oxidative <strong>decarboxylation</strong> by forming a reactive carbanion that attaches to carbonyl groups like those in pyruvate, leading to the release of CO2.
