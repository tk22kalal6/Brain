It coats the particles of phosphorus with a film of copper phosphide which is relatively harmless. <strong>Vitamin K</strong>, 20 mg. i.v. can be given in repeated doses to combat hypoprothrombinaemia and coagulopathy.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Phosphorus poisoning</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Features</td>\n<td>\n<p>Phosphorus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chemistry</td>\n<td>\n<p>2 forms - White and Red Phosphorus</p>\n<p>White Phosphorus is toxic, Red Phosphorus is not.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mechanism of action</td>\n<td>Protoplasmic irritant poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Organs affected</td>\n<td>\n<p>Liver</p>\n<p>Bone</p>\n<p>Kidneys</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Characteristic clinical findings</td>\n<td>\n<p>Smoky stool syndrome</p>\n<p>Luminescent stools</p>\n<p>Garlicky odor</p>\n<p>Liver necrosis</p>\n<p>Phossy jaw</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Treatment</td>\n<td>\n<p>Symptomatic therapy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Specific antidotes for poisoning</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ANTIDOTE</strong></td>\n<td><strong>POISONING</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4-methyl pyrazole</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>100% oxygen </strong></td>\n<td>Carbon monoxide, cyanide, methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ammonium chloride </strong></td>\n<td>Phencyclidine, amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Amyl nitrate </strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide, hydrogen sulphide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Atropine</strong></td>\n<td>Carbamate and organophosphorus poisoning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bupropion</strong></td>\n<td>Nicotine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium disodium edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, magnesium, nickel, uranium, zinc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium gluconate </strong></td>\n<td>Precipitates fluorides, magnesium and oxalates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Chlorpromazine</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Deferoxamine</strong></td>\n<td>Iron, aluminium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diazepam</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine, chloroquine, alcohol withdrawal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dicobalt edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dimercaprol (BAL)</strong></td>\n<td>Antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and gold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diphenhydramine</strong></td>\n<td>Phenothiazines and related drugs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disodium calcium edetate</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMPS *, (Unithiol)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Mercury</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMSA ** </strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>D-Penicillamine (Cuprimine) </strong></td>\n<td>Copper, lead, mercury, chromate, nickel, zinc, arsenic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ethanol</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fab fragment</strong></td>\n<td>Digoxin, digitoxin, oleander tea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Flumazenil</strong></td>\n<td>Benzodiazepine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Glucagon</strong></td>\n<td>Propranolol and other beta-blockers toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hydroxocobalamin</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Labetalol hydrochloride</strong></td>\n<td>Hypertensive crisis due to cocaine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methionine</strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methylene blue</strong></td>\n<td>Methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>N-acetylcysteine </strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol, acetaminophen toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nalorphine</strong></td>\n<td>Morphine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Naloxone (Naltrexone)</strong></td>\n<td>Narcotic, opiates, CNS depressants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nicotinamide</strong></td>\n<td>Vacor poisoning, phenylurea pesticide toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pancuronium bromide</strong></td>\n<td>Neuromuscular blocking agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Penicillamine</strong></td>\n<td>Copper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Physostigmine salicylate </strong></td>\n<td>Coma, convulsions from anticholinergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pralidoxime (2-PAM) </strong></td>\n<td>Organophosphorus insecticides, nerve agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Propranolol</strong></td>\n<td>Cocaine intoxication, beta adrenergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Protamine sulphate </strong></td>\n<td>Heparin overdose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prussian blue</strong></td>\n<td>Thallium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pyridoxine (Vit.

The<strong> deficiency</strong> of glycolytic enzymes results in <strong>reduced production of ATPs</strong> and thus causes <strong>cell membrane alterations</strong> and phagocytosis in reticuloendothelial cells.  </p>\n<p>This is seen on peripheral smears as <strong>echinocytes or Burr cells </strong>which indicate cell membrane alternations. They are red cells with short, evenly spaced<strong> spicules</strong> formed due to altered cell membrane lipids. They can also be seen in<strong> uremia, bleeding ulcers,</strong> and <strong>gastric carcinoma. </strong><strong>Heterozygous </strong>individuals are often <strong>resistant </strong>to the most severe forms of <strong>malaria.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/51e14faf72e345d8bc70006f14257e07x1200x956.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>The<strong> liver pyruvate kinase</strong> (PK) is encoded by the <strong>same gene</strong> as the red blood cell isozyme. However,<strong> liver cells are unaffected </strong>because they can produce<strong> additional PK</strong> and generate ATP through <strong>oxidative phosphorylation.</strong></p>\n<p>It can be present in neonates, children, and adults. Since the enzyme defect occurs at the last step of the pathway, <strong>2,3 BPG production significantly increases</strong>, <strong>promoting oxygen delivery</strong> and thus <strong>masking</strong> the direct anaemia-related <strong>symptoms</strong>. This often leads to a late diagnosis in those with Pyruvate kinase deficiency. Severe forms of the disease may mandate <strong>iron chelation, blood transfusions</strong>, and <strong>folate supplementation. Splenectomy</strong> and cholecystectomy may also be required.</p>\n<p><strong>Mitapivat </strong>is a recently approved oral <strong>pyruvate kinase activator.</strong> It allosterically binds to the pyruvate kinase tetramer and increases pyruvate kinase (PK) activity.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterised by <strong>diastolic dysfunction</strong> of a <strong>non-dilated ventricle </strong>with, mildly decreased contractility and ejection fraction.</p>\n<p>Most of the cases are due to the <strong>infiltration</strong> of abnormal substances between myocytes like <strong>amyloidosis</strong>, abnormal metabolic products within myocytes as seen in hemochromatosis/Fabry's disease, or<strong> fibrotic injury</strong> like <strong>radiation</strong>/scleroderma.  </p>\n<p>They often present with<strong> right-sided heart symptoms</strong> like oedema, ascites, and abdominal discomfort. A fourth heart sound is predominately heard than a third heart sound and is often associated with atrial fibrillation. JVP shows <strong>rapid y descent</strong> and may increase with inspiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Kussmaul's sign</strong> </p>\n<p>Kussmaul's sign is a <strong>paradoxical rise </strong>or failure in the appropriate fall of jugular venous pressure (<strong>JVP</strong>) with <strong>inspiration</strong>. It is an <strong>indication of restrictive cardiomyopathy </strong>and is<strong> </strong>classically associated with <strong>constrictive pericarditis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Normally, during inspiration, the JVP falls due to negative intrathoracic pressure. When there is an impairment in the expansion of the right ventricle or a rise in the right atrial pressure, there is a back pressure of blood in the jugular veins. This causes a paradoxical rise in the JVP during inspiration instead of a fall.</p>\n<p>Kussmaul's sign can also be associated with</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Massive pulmonary embolism</li>\n<li>Right ventricular infarction</li>\n<li>Advanced left ventricular systolic heart failure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Dilated cardiomyopathy</strong> presents with symptoms and signs of <strong>left heart failure</strong> or biventricular heart failure. Patients show cardiomegaly, and a third heart sound can be auscultated. The most frequent causes are alcoholism, myocarditis, chemotherapy, and endocrinopathies. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular dilation and dysfunction.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</strong> presents with dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope. Examination reveals bisferiens carotid pulse. A fourth heart sound and variable systolic murmur can be auscultated. It is an inherited autosomal disease with variable penetrance. They are caused by mutation of the gene encoding for myosin heavy chains or proteins regulating calcium handling. The <strong>echocardiogram</strong> is the diagnostic tool. Any area of left ventricle thickness <strong>more than 1.5 cm</strong> confirms the disease.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</strong> presents as acute anterior myocardial infarction, with acute chest pain or shortness of breath. It occurs soon after a high catecholamine surge and is seen predominantly in postmenopausal women.  Cardiac catheterization shows normal coronaries. The LV appears as a round ampulla, resembling the Japanese octopus pot called the takotsubo pot. Imaging reveals apical left ventricular ballooning due to myocardial stunning. </p>\n<p>The image below shows a ventriculogram showing takotsubo cardiomyopathy.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/67be68fb18354695aa575ddf34550699x1279x941.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: JVP waveform and the abnormalities</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/18bbe4a977c84587903e8637a0d9303cx1280x1005.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>1) The <strong>a-wave</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial contraction</strong>.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prominent a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Pulmonary hypertension, right atrial thrombus/ mass, and tricuspid stenosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cannon a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Complete AV block, ventricular tachycardia, and premature atrial/ junctional/ ventricular beats</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Atrial fibrillation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) The <strong>c-wave</strong> corresponds to the <strong>bulging of tricuspid valve</strong> into right atrium during ventricular contraction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) The <strong>x-descent</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial relaxation</strong> during atrial diastole.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent x-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Severe tricuspid regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rapid x-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Cardiac tamponade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) The <strong>v-wave</strong> corresponds to the <strong>venous filling</strong> of right atrium.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dominant v-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Tricuspid regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5) The <strong>y-descent</strong> corresponds to the&nbsp;<strong>passive emptying of the right atrium</strong> into right ventricle.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prolonged y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Tricuspid stenosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rapid y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Constrictive pericarditis and isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Cardiac tamponade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The A (active) subunit causes prolonged activation of <strong>cellular adenylate cyclase</strong> and <strong>accumulation of cAMP</strong>, leading to the outpouring of large quantities of water and electrolytes into the small intestinal lumen and the consequent <strong>watery diarrhea.</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Food Poisoning</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Organism</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Symptoms</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Common food source</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>1&ndash;6 hrs incubation&nbsp;period</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></td>\n<td>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</td>\n<td>Ham, poultry, potato, cream pastries, mayonnaise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Bacillus cereus</em></td>\n<td>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</td>\n<td>Fried rice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>8&ndash;16 hrs incubation&nbsp;period</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Clostridium perfringes</em></td>\n<td>Abdominal cramps, diarrhea</td>\n<td>Beef, poultry, legume, gravies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Bacillus cereus</em></td>\n<td>Abdominal cramps, diarrhea</td>\n<td>Meat, vegetables, dried beans, cereals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>&gt;16 hrs incubation period</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Vibrio cholerae</em></td>\n<td>Watery diarrhea</td>\n<td>Shellfish, water</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Salmonella</em> species</td>\n<td>Inflammatory diarrhea</td>\n<td>Beef, poultry, eggs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em></td>\n<td>Watery diarrhea</td>\n<td>Salads, cheese, meats</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em></td>\n<td>Bloody diarrhea</td>\n<td>Raw milk, raw vegetables, apple juice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Campylobacter jejuni</em></td>\n<td>Inflammatory diarrhea</td>\n<td>Poultry, raw milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Shigella</em> species</td>\n<td>Dysentery</td>\n<td>Potato, egg salad, lettuce</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</em></td>\n<td>Dysentery</td>\n<td>Molluscs, crustaceans</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Mechanism of action of various bacterial toxins</h3><p>The mechanism of action of various bacterial toxins are as given below:</p>\n<p><span><strong>Increase in&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>cAMP</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bordetella pertusis</li>\n<li>Bacillus anthracis</li>\n<li>Vibrio cholerae - Cholera toxin</li>\n<li>Enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC) - heat labile toxin</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Increase in cGMP</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC) - heat stable toxin</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Inhibition of protein synthesis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diptheria toxin: inhibit elongation factor-2 (EF-2)</li>\n<li>Pseudomonas: inhibit elongation factor-2 (EF-2)</li>\n<li>Clostridium difficile</li>\n<li>Enterohemorrhagic E.coli (EHEC)-Shiga-like toxin: inhibit 60S</li>\n<li>Shigella dysenteriae-&nbsp;Shiga toxin:&nbsp;inhibit 60S</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types of motility of microorganisms</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Motility</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Microorganism</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Darting/vibratory motility&nbsp;</td>\n<td><em>Vibrio,Campylobacter</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Swarming motility</td>\n<td><em>Cl. septicum, B.cereus, Proteus</em>, some Vibrio sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tumbling motility&nbsp;</td>\n<td><em>Listeria monocytogenes</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stately motility</td>\n<td>Clostridia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spinning motility</td>\n<td><em>Fusobacterium gyrans</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cork-screw motility&nbsp;</td>\n<td><em>Treponema pallidum</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Falling leaf motility</td>\n<td>Giardia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Twitching motility</td>\n<td><em>Eikenella corrodens</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Differential motility (Motility varies at different temperatures)</td>\n<td><em>Yersinia enterocolitica </em>&amp;<em> Listeria monocytogenes</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jerky motility&nbsp;</td>\n<td><em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gliding motility</td>\n<td><em>Mycoplasma, Entamoeba</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lashing motility&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Saprophytic spirochetes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario suggests a diagnosis of <strong>MEN 1 syndrome</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple endocrine neoplasia</strong> (MEN) syndromes are characterized by tumors of two or more endocrine glands. There are <strong>four major types</strong> of MEN (MEN 1–4), and they either show an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> pattern of inheritance or occur sporadically. </p>\n<p><strong>MEN 1</strong>, also known as <strong>Wermer’s syndrome</strong>, is characterized by the triad of <strong>parathyroid</strong>, <strong>pancreatic islet cell</strong>, and <strong>anterior pituitary </strong><strong>tumors</strong>. Adrenal cortical tumors, carcinoid tumors, facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, thyroid tumors, and lipomas may also occur. MEN 1-associated tumors are usually multiple, larger, and more aggressive, resulting in resistance to treatment and poor patient outcomes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Parathyroid tumors-</strong> <strong>primary hyperparathyroidism</strong> is the <strong>most common</strong> feature of MEN 1. <strong>Hypercalcemia</strong> with or without symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, dyspepsia), nephrolithiasis, and osteitis fibrosa cystica may also occur. All four parathyroid glands are usually affected with multiple adenomas or hyperplasia. </li>\n<li><strong>Pancreatic islet cell tumors-</strong> these are <strong>neuroendocrine tumors</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gastrinoma</strong> (gastrin-secreting tumors)- associated with increased gastric acid secretion and multiple peptic ulcers (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Patients may present with diarrhea and steatorrhea. Gastrinomas are the<strong> major cause</strong> of <strong>mortality</strong> and morbidity. </li>\n<li><strong>Insulinoma</strong> (insulin-secreting tumors)- patients present with <strong>hypoglycemic symptoms</strong> (weakness, headaches, sweating, seizures, weight gain) that develop after fasting or exertion and improve after glucose intake. Along with increased plasma insulin levels and hypoglycemia, increased C peptide and proinsulin levels help in diagnosing the condition.</li>\n<li><strong>Glucagonoma</strong> (glucagon-secreting tumors)- may be associated with necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, anemia, and stomatitis. </li>\n<li><strong>VIPomas</strong> (Vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIP]-secreting tumors): The VIPoma syndrome, also known as Verner-Morrison syndrome, is characterized by watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria. These are mostly located in the <strong>tail</strong> of the <strong>pancreas</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>PPomas</strong> (Pancreatic polypeptide-secreting tumors) and <strong>nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors-</strong> are associated with a <strong>worse prognosis</strong> as they often go undiagnosed due to the absence of both clinical features and biochemical abnormalities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pituitary tumors-</strong> manifestations depend on the hormone secreted (symptoms of hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, or Cushing’s disease) and tumor size (visual disturbances or hypopituitarism due to compression of the optic chiasm or normal pituitary tissue). </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Surgical excision</strong> of the nonmetastatic tumor after localization is the <strong>curative treatment</strong>. Appropriate medical therapy can be used for some tumors when surgery is contraindicated or unsuccessful (calcimemetics for parathyroid tumors, parietal cell H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitors for gastrinomas). In case of metastasis, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, and artery embolization may be successful.</p>\n<p>MEN 1 occurs due to a mutation in the <em>MEN1 </em>gene located on <strong>chromosome 11q13</strong>. Mutational genetic analysis is necessary to confirm the clinical diagnosis and identify family members who harbor the mutation and require screening for tumor detection and early treatment.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Options B and C: <strong>MEN 2</strong>, also called <strong>Sipple’s syndrome</strong>, is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytomas, and parathyroid tumors.

There are three clinical variants -</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>MEN 2A</strong> (most common): MTC is associated with pheochromocytomas in 50% of patients and parathyroid tumors in 20% of patients. MEN 2A may also be associated with Hirschsprung’s disease and cutaneous lichen amyloidosis.</li>\n<li>MEN 2B<strong> (MEN</strong> <strong>3</strong>): MTC is associated with pheochromocytoma, along with Marfanoid habitus; mucosal neuromas of the lips, tongue, and eyelids; medullated corneal fibers; and intestinal autonomic ganglion dysfunction leading to multiple diverticulae and megacolon. Parathyroid tumors are usually absent.</li>\n<li><strong>MTC only </strong>(FMTC): MTC is the only manifestation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Option D: <strong>MEN 4 </strong>is characterized by a combination of <strong>MEN 1–associated tumors</strong> and <strong><em>CDKN1B</em> mutation-related tumors</strong> (gonadal, adrenal, renal, and thyroid tumors).</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: MEN 1 Syndrome Features</h3><p>Chromosome <strong>11q13 / MEN1 </strong>gene</p>\n<p>Also known as <strong>Wermer&rsquo;s syndrome</strong></p>\n<p>Characteristic tumors seen in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parathyroid adenoma &ndash;

The mechanism of action of <strong>ciprofloxacin</strong> (and other fluoroquinolones) is to <strong>inhibit</strong> <strong>DNA gyrase </strong>and <strong>topoisomerase IV</strong>, enzymes that are crucial for DNA replication in bacteria. </p>\n<p><strong>Ciprofloxacin</strong>, a <strong>fluoroquinolone</strong>, inhibits bacterial DNA replication and prevents the growth of bacteria that could otherwise lead to severe infection. <strong>DNA gyrase </strong>is particularly important in gram-negative bacteria, where it introduces negative supercoils into the DNA to relieve torsional strain. Ciprofloxacin binds to and inhibits this enzyme, preventing the proper replication of bacterial DNA. Additionally, topoisomerase IV is the target of gram-positive bacteria, and its inhibition by <strong>ciprofloxacin prevents chromosome segregation</strong> during cell division. </p>\n<p>Tetracyclines, such as doxycycline, inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S bacterial ribosome and preventing aminoacyl tRNA from accessing the acceptor (A) site on the mRNA-ribosome complex.</p>\n<p><strong>The post-exposure prophylaxis after potential exposure includes ciprofloxacin or doxycycline for 60 days.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Inhalational/ pulmonary anthrax</strong> is a life-threatening bacterial infection caused by <em><strong>Bacillus anthracis</strong></em> spores. It is commonly spread from sheep wool and is hence also called Wool Sorter’s disease. Anthrax is a bioterrorism category A agent and a potential tool in biological warfare. <strong>Doxycycline</strong> is used for the <strong>treatment of anthrax </strong>and is used in combination with another agent when treating inhalational or GI infections. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/3614a83e09af4ef6b5c8aa7238375c97x1280x1258.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

They are predominantly seen in females and in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2, which is an autosomal disorder associated with multiple meningiomas, schwannomas, and ependymomas.</p>\n<p>They arise from the <strong>meningothelial cells</strong> or <strong>arachnoid cap cells</strong>. The most common karyotypic abnormality is the loss of the long arm of chromosome 22. Meningiomas often express hormone receptors (eg: Progesterone), hence, they may grow rapidly in pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Meningiomas are rubbery, rounded, or bosselated dural masses. They compress the underlying brain tissue. They present with headaches, seizures, or focal neurological deficits. </p>\n<p>The tumour spreads in a sheet-like manner along the surface of the dura causing reactive<strong> hyperostotic changes</strong> in adjacent bones. They are mostly located in cerebral convexities. The lesions may be finely gritty due to numerous psammomatous calcifications. </p>\n<p>Grades of meningioma based on histologic subtypes by WHO are:</p>\n<p><strong>Grade I</strong> is the benign meningioma that has a relatively low risk of recurrence or aggressive growth. The histologic patterns are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meningothelial</strong> or <strong>syncytial</strong> (<strong>most common</strong>).

When larger and symptomatic, they should be excised. External beam radiotherapy is done for unresectable tumours.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Schwannomas</strong> are benign tumours arising from the Schwann cells. <strong>Acoustic</strong> or vestibular schwannoma arising from the vestibular portion of the eighth nerve is the most common schwannoma. Histopathologically they are composed of dense and loose areas referred to as <strong>Antoni A</strong> and <strong>Antoni B</strong> respectively. In Antoni A area, a central nuclear-free area ramified by palisading nuclei is termed as<strong> Verocay bodies. </strong>Schwannomas are associated with NF2, but they typically arise from the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII), leading to hearing loss and balance problems, not headaches and seizures. </p>\n<p>The image below shows the histology of schwannoma.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1776a6067b83435f990ea881597082c3x1279x662.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C- <strong>Medulloblastoma</strong> is a malignant embryonal tumour seen predominantly in children.

      "solution": "<p>The child with gradually progressing pain and limping with examination findings of <strong>limited abduction and internal rotation</strong> and X-ray showing <strong>necrosis</strong> of <strong>femoral epiphysis</strong> is likely to have <strong>Perthes's disease. </strong></p>\n<p><span>Perthes disease, also known as Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, is  avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis. It is most commonly seen in children between the ages of 4 and 8, with a higher incidence in boys than girls. Perthes disease is usually <strong>unilateral</strong> but can occur bilaterally in 10% of cases. Risk factors include low birth weight, passive smoking, family history, low socioeconomic status, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Perthes disease is associated with thrombophilia and protein C and S deficiencies.</span></p>\n<p>The disease is characterized by the <strong>disruption of blood flow</strong> to the femoral head due to which the bone goes for <strong>osteonecrosis</strong> and stops growing. The lateral epiphyseal artery, a branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery is involved. Over time, healing and fibrosis occur by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and weakening of the femoral head. </p>\n<p>Clinical features include<strong> pain </strong>and<strong> limping</strong>. Pain aggravates when doing any activity and is relieved by rest. Physical examination reveals <strong>pain</strong> on <strong>passive movement</strong> of the hip and <strong>abduction</strong> with <strong>internal rotation</strong> movement is limited.</p>\n<p>Xray findings depend on the stages </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial phase</strong>: Medial joint space widening and increased density in the ossific nucleus</li>\n<li><strong>Fragmentation phase</strong>: Alternating patches of sclerosis and fibrosis</li>\n<li><strong>Re-ossification phase</strong>: Complete removal of necrotic bone. Epiphyseal density is regained in this phase</li>\n<li><strong>Remodelling phase</strong>: Remodelling occurs until skeletal maturity is attained.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Children under<strong> 6</strong> years - Symptomatic treatment is <strong>conservative</strong> including activity modification, reduction in weight-bearing, abduction bracing, bisphosphonates</li>\n<li>Children aged<strong> 6-8 </strong>years - Operative management with <strong>proximal femoral varus osteotomy.</strong></li>\n<li>For children aged <strong>9</strong> and above - Operative management with <strong>pelvic osteotomy.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other options:</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Slipped capital femoral epiphysis</strong> <strong>(SCFE) </strong>occurs most likely in the age group of <strong>10-15 years </strong>with an associated <strong>endocrinal</strong> disorder. <strong>Trethowan's sign</strong> is seen in the X-ray. Klein's line is a line along the superior aspect of the femoral neck that normally is intersected by the epiphysis. When Klein's line does not intersect the lateral part of the superior femoral epiphysis on an AP radiograph of the pelvis, it is known as Trethowan’s sign. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/36d68f0d17ec4d609106778933139f66x1024x700.jpeg\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C:<strong> Septic arthritis</strong> can be ruled as the boy is afebrile in the given scenario. It presents as severe tenderness and all <strong>movements</strong> are <strong>abolished</strong> due to muscle spasm. Septic arthritis can present as acute, subacute, or chronic arthritis. X-rays may be normal or can show increased joint space and a soft tissue shadow corresponding to the distended capsule due to swelling of the joint. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Developmental Dysplasia of the hip:</strong> It is characterized by spontaneous dislocation of the hip joint before, during, or shortly after birth. This condition is more common in females. Children with this condition have a waddling gait and on examination abduction and lateral rotation of the hip is decreased.
