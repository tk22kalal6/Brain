This disease is the result of a <strong>point mutation</strong> in the <strong>beta-globin gene </strong>which results in a<strong> glutamate residue </strong>being <strong>replaced by </strong>a <strong>valine residue. </strong>The patients who are homozygous for this mutation present with the above-mentioned features. Those who are <strong>heterozygous</strong>, are said to have <strong>sickle cell trait.</strong> This trait can provide a degree of <strong>protection against falciparum malaria</strong>. This could be because of increases in oxidant stress which can damage the membranes of cells infected by the organism.</p>\n<p>Sickle cell disease results in hemolytic anemia with <strong>reticulocytosis, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong>, and <strong>irreversible sickled red blood cells.</strong> These sickle cells can <strong>obstruct vessels</strong> and cause classic <strong>pain crises</strong>. These episodes can occur in any part of the body, commonly seen in the abdomen, bones, and chest. Repeated episodes of splenic artery vaso-occlusion can result in a <strong>splenic sequestration crises.</strong> At this stage it becomes necessary to remove the spleen. This leaves the child even more vulnerable to infections. Appropriate post-splenectomy antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccination should be carried out. In patients who have <strong>undergone splenectomy,</strong> the peripheral smear can show <strong>Howell Jolly bodies,</strong> which are <strong>basophilic nuclear remnants</strong> that would <strong>normally</strong> be <strong>removed by</strong> the <strong>spleen</strong>.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis can be <strong>confirmed</strong> by <strong>hemoglobin electrophoresis</strong> and

      "solution": "<p>The given image is a <strong>susceptibility-weighted imaging </strong>(SWI)<strong> </strong>and the most probable diagnosis based on it is <strong>diffuse axonal injury</strong> (DAI).</p>\n<p>SWI is a form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence that is very sensitive to substances that <strong>distort the local magnetic field</strong>. Compounds with <strong>diamagnetic</strong>, <strong>paramagnetic</strong>, and<strong> ferromagnetic</strong> properties will interact with the local magnetic field and produce distraction. This would lead to a loss of signal in these areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Deoxyhemoglobin</strong>,<strong> hemosiderin</strong>, and <strong>ferritin</strong> are paramagnetic. <strong>Bone minerals</strong> and <strong>dystrophic calcifications</strong> are diamagnetic.</p>\n<p>The main clinical use is the identification of <strong>microhemorrhages</strong>/ blood products or calcium that are not detected in other MRI sequences. In diffuse axonal injury(DAI) there are <strong>microhemorrhages</strong> at the <strong>grey-white matter junction</strong> which are easily picked by SWI.</p><p><strong>Diffusion-weighted imaging</strong> (DWI) is an MRI technique in which contrast within the image is based on the<strong> microscopic motion of water</strong>. Thus, it is more <strong>sensitive</strong> to early changes of<strong> cytotoxic</strong> or <strong>vasogenic</strong> damage at the cellular level than traditional MRI.</p>\n<p>Diffusion gradients sensitize the MR image to the motion of water molecules. Thus, a <strong>loss of motion</strong> results in <strong>restricted diffusion</strong> and <strong>appears bright on DWI</strong> and greater motion produces a darker image. Structures with increased diffusion such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will appear dark on DWI and bright on ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) maps.</p>\n<p>Restricted diffusion on DWI will be seen in the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>acute infarct</li>\n<li>brain abscess</li>\n<li>haemorrhage</li>\n<li>lymphoma</li>\n<li>epidermoid cyst</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>DWI is the earliest modality to diagnose acute infarction</strong> (as early as 30 min).

Since the sac is filled with lymph, it is soft, fluctuating, and <strong>brilliantly trans-illuminant.</strong></p>\n<p>Initially, the treatment includes <strong>aspiration </strong>of the <strong>contents</strong>. Later once the sac or capsule gets thickened by <strong>fibrous</strong> tissue, it is <strong>excised</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Single cysts</strong> are treated with <strong>sclerosing therapy.</strong> Commonly used sclerosants include OK–432, which is an inactive strain of group A <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, pure ethanol, interferon alfa-2a, and doxycycline.</p>\n<p><strong>Complete excision</strong> is done in case of <strong>multiple cysts.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Brilliantly Transilluminating Swellings</h3><ul>\n<li>Vaginal hydrocele</li>\n<li>Epididymal cyst</li>\n<li>Cystic hygroma</li>\n<li>Ranula</li>\n<li>Meningocele</li>\n</ul>",

The amnesia is <strong>predominantly retrograde</strong> with minimal anterograde amnesia. It usually follows severe emotional trauma, interpersonal conflicts, and other <strong>stressful events</strong>, such as sexual abuse, loss of a loved one, loss of livelihood, etcetera. Clinically, the presentation is quite dramatic with significant impairment in social, personal, and occupational functioning. In order for a diagnosis of dissociative amnesia to be made, it is imperative to rule out substance use, and other neurological and psychological conditions that may lead to a presentation similar to dissociative amnesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is further categorized into the following types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selective amnesia:&nbsp;Ability to remember some of the events occurring during a circumscribed period of time.</li>\n<li>Localized amnesia:&nbsp;Inability to recall all events in a circumscribed period of time.</li>\n<li>Generalized amnesia:&nbsp;Failure to recall one&rsquo;s entire life.</li>\n<li>Continuous amnesia:&nbsp;Failure to recall successive events as they occur.</li>\n<li>Systematized amnesia:&nbsp;Amnesia for certain categories of memory, such as all memories relating to one&rsquo;s family or to a particular person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dissociative fugue</strong> is characterized by a sudden, unintended, and <strong>unexpected travel</strong> to a place away from home, or workplace, or another place involved in one's daily repertoire. It is usually brief, lasting few hours to days, and is generally reversible. It is commonly associated with dissociative amnesia. In addition to amnesia, these patients may also experience confusion, trance-like behaviors, depersonalization, derealization, and conversion symptoms. It may recur in some patients.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that dissociative fugue was deleted as a major diagnostic category in DSM-5. It is instead declared as a subtype or specifier of disso&shy;ciative amnesia.</p>\n<p>Treatment of dissociative amnesia and dissociative fugue is mainly with psychotherapy.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 475\">\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Confabulation</strong>&nbsp;refers to the&nbsp;unconscious <strong>filling</strong> of <strong>gaps</strong> in memory&nbsp;with inaccurate, fabricated, and often implausible information.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Depersonalization</strong>&nbsp;is defined as the&nbsp;persistent or recurrent feeling of&nbsp;<strong>detachment</strong> from one's self. The patient may report feeling like an automation or like they are watching themselves in a movie.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Dissociative identity disorder&nbsp;</strong>is characterized by the presence of&nbsp;two or more&nbsp;distinct identities or&nbsp;personality states&nbsp;that assume control of an individual's behavior.

The <strong>pain</strong> may occur spontaneously or <strong>after</strong> <strong>movements</strong> like <strong>chewing</strong>,<strong> </strong>speaking,<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>smiling.<strong> </strong>Certain <strong>trigger zones</strong> are <strong>present on the face</strong> which provoke these attacks.<strong> Tactile stimuli </strong>such as<strong> washing the face</strong> and brushing teeth may <strong>trigger</strong> the <strong>pain</strong>. The pain usually lasts for a <strong>few</strong> <strong>seconds</strong> <strong>to 1-2 minutes</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>large myelinated fibers</strong> of the trigeminal nerve carry<strong> tactile stimuli</strong> from the face but do not carry the pain sensation. In <strong>trigeminal neuralgia</strong>, <strong>compression</strong> <strong>of the large fibers</strong> leads to their <strong>demyelination</strong>. These demyelinated large fibers become <strong>hyperexcitable</strong> and <strong>electrically coupled</strong> with<strong> </strong>the surrounding <strong>smaller unmyelinated pain fibers</strong> of the trigeminal nerve. This explains why <strong>tactile stimulation of trigger zones</strong> <strong>leads to pain</strong> paroxysms.</p>\n<p><strong>Carbamazepine</strong> is the<strong> </strong>first-line drug in the management of patients with trigeminal neuralgia. Lamotrigine, phenytoin, topiramate, or gabapentin are other options that may be tried if carbamazepine is ineffective. <strong>Microvascular decompression</strong> of the trigeminal nerve can be done if medical therapies fail.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Options A, B: Cluster headache</strong> and <strong>SUNCT</strong> are examples of <strong>trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias</strong>.

The patient might also have <strong>visual disturbances</strong> which can lead to <strong>permanent blindness</strong>. Furthermore, the <strong>pain is</strong> usually <strong>constant</strong> and does not have triggers as in the case of trigeminal neuralgia. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgia</h3><p><strong>Types of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cluster headache</li>\n<li>Paroxysmal hemicranias</li>\n<li>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT)</li>\n<li>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform&nbsp;<em>headache</em>&nbsp;attacks with cranial autonomic features (SUNA)</li>\n<li>Hemicrania continua</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Cluster headache</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Paroxysmal hemicrania&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;SUNCT/SUNA</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gender&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Males&gt;females</td>\n<td>Female=Males</td>\n<td>Female=Males</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Character of pain&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Stabbing /boring</td>\n<td>Throbbing pain&nbsp;/stabbing /boring</td>\n<td>Burning /stabbing/sharp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severity of pain&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Excruciating&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Excruciating</td>\n<td>Severe to excruciating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Site of pain&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Orbit, temple</td>\n<td>Orbit, temple</td>\n<td>Periorbital</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Attack frequency&nbsp;</td>\n<td>1-8 /day</td>\n<td>1-20/day</td>\n<td>3-200/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Duration</td>\n<td>15min-3 hours</td>\n<td>2-30 min</td>\n<td>5-240seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Migraneous feature&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alcohol trigger&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cutaneous trigger</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response to indomethacin</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Abortive treatment</td>\n<td>\n<p>100% oxygen</p>\n<p>Sumatriptan injection</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No effective treatment</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>IV lidocaine&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prophylaxis</td>\n<td>\n<p>Chronic cluster</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lithium</li>\n<li>Verapamil</li>\n<li>Methysergide</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Episodic cluster&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steroids&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Verapamil</li>\n<li>Methysergide</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Indomethacin</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Lamotrigine</li>\n<li>Topiramate</li>\n<li>Gabapentin</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Indomethacin</strong> is effective in paroxysmal hemicrania,hemicrania continuum, and primary sexual/ exercise headache</li>\n<li>Cutaneous trigger is also seen in trigeminal neuralgia, however, <strong>trigeminal neuralgia</strong> is a <strong>separate entity </strong>and not a part of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>",

All neuromuscular blocking agents are quaternary ammonium compounds with an affinity for <strong>nicotinic ACh receptors</strong> due to the positively charged nitrogen present in them. </p>\n<p><strong>Depolarising muscle relaxants </strong>(DMRs), such as <strong>succinylcholine </strong>(SCh) closely resemble the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). When administered, they rapidly bind to the ACh receptors on the muscle end-plate and cause depolarization. Unlike ACh, DMRs are not metabolized by the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. This results in their prolonged presence in the synaptic cleft. As a result, there is <strong>continuous endplate depolarization.</strong></p>\n<p>This continuous endplate depolarization does not allow the endplate to repolarize. Hence, the time-limited perijunctional sodium channels that were inactivated during depolarization fail to re-open. This leads to muscle relaxation.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-Depolarising muscle relaxants </strong>(NDMRs) such as <strong>atracurium, pancuronium,</strong> etc compete with ACh and bind to its receptors, preventing the action of ACh on its receptors. However, the NDMRs are incapable of inducing the conformational change necessary for ion channel opening. Hence, their binding does not lead to the development of end-plate potential.</p>\n<p>Thus, <strong>DMRs </strong>behave as <strong>ACh receptor agonists </strong>while<strong> NDMRs </strong>behave as <strong>competitive antagonists. </strong></p>\n<p>In the given clinical scenario, where there is a history of a <strong>chronic denervation injury</strong>, the physiological response is that of <strong>overexpression</strong> of <strong>ACh</strong> <strong>receptors</strong> on the muscle membranes. These overexpressed receptors are low conductance receptors with a prolonged opening time, similar to fetal nicotinic ACh receptors.</p>\n<p>The prolonged opening time of these receptors leads to an exaggerated response to DMRs. Whereas, the increased number of receptors leads to resistance to the action of NDMRs, as the NDMRs now cannot block all these receptors. The net effect is an <strong>exaggerated response to DMR </strong>and<strong> resistance to NDMR.</strong></p>\n<p>The opposite happens in conditions like <strong>myasthenia gravis</strong>, where the number of ACh receptors is greatly reduced. This leads to an <strong>exaggerated response to NDMRs</strong> due to complete antagonism of all receptors and <strong>resistance to DMRs</strong> due to an inadequate number of receptors being depolarized.

Secondary osteoarthritis occurs due to an underlying disease of the joint such as avascular necrosis, coxa vara, and malunited fractures of the hip. It occurs at any age after adolescence and commonly affects the hip.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Psoriatic arthropathy</strong> presents as a polyarthritis, with the involvement of distal interphalangeal joints. It is also associated with the presence of psoriatic skin disease, nail disease characterized by onycholysis, pitting, splinter hemorrhages, and ocular disease in the form of uveitis.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The most likely diagnosis is <strong>primary polydipsia.</strong></p>\n<p>In the given clinical scenario, the patient has <strong>polyuria, nocturia, and polydipsia</strong> without glucosuria. Her <strong>urine osmolality</strong> is initially <strong>low </strong>(&lt;300 mosm/L) but <strong>increases </strong>after the<strong> fluid restriction</strong><strong> </strong>(400–800 mosmol/L). The MRI showed a bright spot in the posterior pituitary. These findings favor the diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary polydipsia</strong> means <strong>excessive intake of fluids. </strong>It can occur as a result of</p>\n<ul>\n<li>inappropriate thirst mechanism - dipsogenic diabetes insipidus</li>\n<li>as a part of psychosis - psychogenic polydipsia</li>\n<li>due to increased water intake owing to its health benefits - iatrogenic polydipsia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Excessive water intake results in <strong>decreased plasma osmolality</strong> and sodium levels, <strong>decreasing</strong> the antidiuretic hormone <strong>(ADH) secretion</strong>. There is a compensatory increase in urine volume and a decrease in urine osmolality.</p>\n<p>In patients with primary polydipsia, fluid restriction increases and brings back the plasma osmolality and sodium to normal. This increases the levels of ADH, which results in increased urinary osmolality.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In most healthy adults, the posterior pituitary emits a hyperintense signal visible in the MRI as a<strong> bright spot.</strong> This is visualized in patients with <strong>primary polydipsia</strong> and is abnormal or <strong>absent</strong> <strong>in</strong> patients with <strong>central diabetes insipidus.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Central diabetes insipidus (DI)</strong> is caused due to deficiency of ADH secretion. In this condition, the levels of ADH do not increase even after fluid restriction and therefore the <strong>urine osmolality </strong>will<strong> not increase. </strong></p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Nephrogenic diabetes</strong> insipidus occurs due to <strong>decreased action </strong>of <strong>ADH</strong>. Mutations occur in the V<sub>2</sub> receptor or the aquaporin channels and ADH cannot act on them. Therefore, in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, even if the ADH levels are normal, it cannot act on the receptors, and the <strong>urine osmolality </strong>does<strong> not increase</strong> after fluid restriction. A simpler way to differentiate between central DI and nephrogenic DI is to measure <strong>basal ADH levels</strong> and <strong>urine osmolality</strong> under unrestricted fluid intake conditions. A low urine osmolality with a concurrent elevated ADH level (<strong>&gt;1 ng/mL</strong>) indicates nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. A low ADH level is suggestive of central DI or primary polydipsia, which can be differentiated on MRI brain.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Syndrome </strong>of<strong> inappropriate ADH secretion</strong> results in increased secretions of ADH. Therefore, the patients will have <strong>decreased urine output</strong> and <strong>increased urine concentration.</strong> If the water intake is not restricted, patients also develop hyponatremia.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Water Deprivation test in Diabetes Insipidus</h3><p><strong>Procedure</strong>: Start the test at 4 am by checking the baseline urine osmolality.

Meissner's corpuscles are <strong>rapidly adapting</strong> receptors, particularly sensitive to the <strong>movement of objects</strong> over the surface of the skin, as well as to l<strong>ow-frequency vibration</strong> (5-40 Hz).</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Cutaneous Mechanoreceptor Systems</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Receptor </strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Merkel&rsquo;s disc</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Meissner corpuscle</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ruffini end organ</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Pacinian corpuscle</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Location</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tip of epidermis(Basal keratinocytes)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dermal papillae</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dermis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dermis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Best stimuli</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sustained pressure and touch<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Slow vibration<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stretch and fluttering vibration<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fast vibration and deep pressure<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Adaptation </strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Slow</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rapid</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Slow</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rapid</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Best frequency</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>5</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>50</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>-</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>200</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Threshold for vibration</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>8</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>40</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0.01</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification of Senses based on Type of Receptors</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Types of Receptors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MECHANORECEPTORS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Pacinian corpuscles,</li>\n<li>Meissner's corpuscles</li>\n<li>Merkel's discs</li>\n<li>Golgi Tendon and Muscle spindles</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>THERMORECEPTORS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Warm and Cold Receptors</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NOCICEPTORS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Free nerve endings</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ELECTROMAGNETIC RECEPTORS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Rods and Cons</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CHEMORECEPTORS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Olfactory and gustatory receptors</li>\n<li>Receptors of aortic and carotid bodies</li>\n<li>Receptors in hypothalamus for Blood Glucose</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
