It can be activated by substances like capsaicin and serotonin or during myocardial ischemia and coronary angiography, contributing to hypotension in heart disease. It also serves a protective role by limiting toxic substance absorption from the lungs.<br><br>Other options<br><br>Option A: The carotid sinus contains stretch-sensitive baroreceptors that detect high blood pressure and activate the baroreflex, which slows heart rate (via the vagus nerve) and lowers blood pressure (via reduced sympathetic tone). In contrast, low blood pressure would inhibit baroreceptor firing, leading to increased heart rate and vasoconstriction through sympathetic activation. This patient develops hypotension and bradycardia, which is paradoxical. If carotid baroreceptors were involved, they should have been inhibited by hypotension, leading to tachycardia, not bradycardia.<br><br>Option C: Activation of juxta-pulmonary capillary receptors (J reflex) would cause similar symptoms, but its primary trigger is lung hyperinflation rather than contrast administration.<br><br>Option D: Histamine release (e.g., in anaphylaxis) causes hypotension, bronchospasm, and urticaria, which are absent here.",

Type 1 error can be best avoided by decreasing the alpha value taken for the study.<br><br>In a study such as a randomized controlled trial where hypothesis testing is involved, a null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis are formulated. For example, let X be the standard of care for diabetes mellitus and Y a new drug being tested. Now an RCT is done to compare the efficacy of X with a new drug Y. The null hypothesis will state that X( standard of care) is still better than Y. The alternate hypothesis will state that Y is more effective than X.<br><br>Let us say that the study finds that Y is more efficacious than X. Then, the researchers will reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis. But if evidence comes out later, that Y was actually not more efficacious than X, then the researchers have falsely rejected a true null hypothesis. That is a Type 1 error.<br><br>Type 1 error can be reduced by decreasing the alpha value. The alpha value is the p-value taken as the cutoff value to determine whether a test result is statistically significant. Normally, a p-value of 0.05 is taken as a \" statistically significant difference\" to reject the null hypothesis. Here there is a 5% chance of a Type 1 error.

In early fasting, which is 4-18 hours after the well-fed state, the blood glucose level is maintained by hepatic glycogenolysis. The glycogen stores are sufficient for around 18 hours after a meal following which they start to deplete. Glycogen phosphorylase (Option B) is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogenolysis.<br><br>In the second stage of fasting gluconeogenesis is the source of glucose. It begins 4–6 hours after the last meal but becomes fully active only after stores of liver glycogen are depleted (after 18 hours). They can serve as a source of glucose for up to 2 days. Substrates for gluconeogenesis are glucogenic amino acids ( mainly alanine) from the muscle and glycerol from adipose tissue. These glucogenic amino acids are transported to the liver, transaminated into pyruvate, and converted to glucose.<br><br>In the third stage of fasting (after 2 days), lipolysis occurs in the adipose tissue due to the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase (Option D). It is stimulated by increased glucagon: insulin ratio. Triacylglycerols will be hydrolyzed to fatty acids and glycerol.

This does not cause a change in the reading frame of the codon sequence. Point mutations can have various functional consequences as follows:<br><br>*  Nonsense mutation: The single base pair substitution creates a stop codon, as in the given question. Stop codons are coded by UAA, UAG, and UGA codons and do not code for any amino acid. They cause premature termination of the chain and formation of shorter than normal protein which may result in various degrees of loss of function including complete loss of function of the protein.<br><br>* Silent mutation: In this point mutation, a single amino acid is substituted for the same amino acid, resulting in no change to the resulting protein. This is possible thanks to the Wobble hypothesis, which states that multiple codons code for the same amino acid. For example, GGG → GGA causes no change to protein structure as both codons code for Glycine.<br><br>*  Conservative missense mutation: In such mutations, a single base pair substitution results in a different amino acid with very similar properties to the initial amino acid, consequently no major change occurs to protein function. For example, glutamate to aspartate switch where one acidic amino acid is changed to another acidic amino acid.<br><br>* Non-conservative missense mutation: In such mutations, a single base pair substitution forms a new amino acid with completely new properties altering protein function. For example, GAG mRNA becomes GUG in Sickle cell anemia, where glutamic acid becomes valine, resulting in sickle cell disease.<br><br>Other than point mutations, other categories of mutation exist such as:<br><br>* Mutations in noncoding regions which may interfere with proper splicing and mRNA formation.<br><br>* Insertions and deletions of single base pairs may cause frameshift mutations and result in completely different proteins. If inserted in sets of three base pairs, the reading frame is not altered.<br><br>* Alterations in non-coding RNAs such as mi-RNA.<br><br>* Trinucleotide repeat mutations whereby triplet base pairs are added in increasing numbers resulting in functional alterations. Diseases like Huntington's chorea and Ataxia telangiectasia are examples of this mutation.<br><br>* Alterations in protein-coding genes other than mutations such as amplifications, deletions, and translocations.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Options B and C: UGG (tryptophan) is a neutral amino acid, and UGA is a Stop codon and hence won't convert to any amino acid.<br><br>Option D: Stop codons do not get skipped.

The sequence of events are as follows: <br><br>* Troponin I is bound to actin and tropomyosin and covers the sites where actin interacts with myosin heads in a resting muscle. The myosin head contains tightly bound adenosine phosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi).<br><br>* Following an action potential, cytosolic Ca2+ is increased due to the Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  Simultaneously Ca2+ influx happens through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels too. <br><br>* The free Ca2+ binds with troponin C. This binding will weaken the troponin I interaction with actin and exposes the actin-binding site for myosin.\nThis results in the formation of myosin-actin cross-bridges. <br><br>* The cross-bridge between the head of the myosin and the active site of the actin causes a conformational change in the head and the power stroke occurs, moving the thin filament relative to the thick filament. <br><br>* Once the head of the cross-bridge tilts, the ADP and phosphate ion that were previously attached to the head are released and a new ATP molecule can bind in that place. <br><br>* The binding of the new ATP molecule to the free site on the myosin causes detachment of the head of the myosin from the actin.\nATP is hydrolyzed and Pi released, causing a re-cocking of the myosin head and completing the cycle.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a3c27f19b832464d939cbafcfab1208ax1280x2133.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM2362: Sarcomere<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2a96ee0f49dd43f388fc7e96e279f5ccx1280x2273.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

It presents with painful genital ulceration along with painful inguinal lymphadenopathy that may develop into buboes. Auto-inoculation by the organism can result in new ulcers merging with the older ones. Hence, they are called \"kissing ulcers\".<br><br>The diagnosis is made clinically and can be supported by the gram stain findings, \"school of fish\"/\"railroad track\" appearance.<br><br>Treatment is recommended with a single dose of azithromycin (1g oral) or ceftriaxone (250mg intramuscular).<br><br>Chancroid has gained clinical significance because it can increase the risk of HIV transmission. Hence, it is important to identify and treat these patients and to inform and treat their sexual partners from the last 3 months.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Spirochetes are seen on dark field microscopy in syphilitic ulcers. They are caused by Treponema pallidum and present with a single, painless genital ulcer with painless inguinal lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis can be confirmed by specific treponemal tests such as fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS), Treponema pallidum haemagglutination test (TPHA), and the enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Treatment is with parental penicillin G, irrespective of the stage of the disease.<br><br>Darkfield microscopy with spirochetes is shown below:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/866c8710896d4b0aaf0b5d4d82b2de97x800x600.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option C: Donovan bodies are seen in granuloma inguinale, which is caused by Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. It presents with painless beefy red ulcers. Inguinal lymph nodes are not usually enlarged, but the infection can spread subcutaneously and give the appearance of \"pseudo buboes\". The diagnosis is made by Giemsa staining which shows the Donovan bodies. They show bipolar staining (\"safety-pin appearance\"). Management is with a course of azithromycin.<br><br>The slide below shows Donovan's body with the safety-pin appearance:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5fe86e3d50984d7fb2bcad097f4ca776x720x473.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option D: Multinucleated giant cells are seen on the Tzanck smear in herpes genitalis. These ulcers are caused by herpes simplex type 2 virus and present as a cluster of vesicles on an erythematous base with painful inguinal lymph nodes. The diagnosis can be made with an initial Tzanck smear by deroofing the vesicles and taking a swab. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing can be used to confirm this diagnosis.

Histologically, these tumors consist of eosinophilic spindle cells with blunt-ended, hyperchromatic nuclei arranged in interweaving fascicles. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Schwannomas are well-circumscribed, encapsulated masses attached loosely to the associated nerve without invading it.

CD34 is a marker for solitary fibrous pulmonary tumors and neurofibromas. <br><br>Option C: Rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive malignant mesenchymal tumor more commonly present in children and adolescents.

Thiorphan inhibits peripheral enkephalin degradation and potentiates the effects of endogenous enkephalins in the gastrointestinal tract to produce an antidiarrheal effect, acting predominantly as an antisecretory agent.<br><br>Option C: Zinc acetate as supplementation is now considered a standard part of care, alongside oral rehydration solutions (ORS). Intestinal zinc losses during diarrhea can worsen existing zinc deficiency. This supplementation is effective in reducing both the severity and duration of diarrhea, as well as the risk of persistent diarrhea. Zinc is supplemented as sulfate, acetate or gluconate formulation. The recommended dosage is 20 mg of elemental zinc per day for children over 6 months of age, to be taken for 14 days. <br><br>Option D: Probiotics are preparations containing a variety of bacterial strains that have shown some degree of benefit in acute diarrheal conditions, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, and infectious diarrhoea.

This occurs due to constriction of the smooth muscles lining the airways and inflammatory thickening of the walls of the airways. Because of this, there is a decrease in the maximal expiratory flow during the later part of the flow-volume curve. This produces the scooped-out or coved pattern seen in the flow-volume loop shown. This obstruction persists despite enhanced expiratory effort but can be effectively treated using β2 agonist agents.<br><br>A comparable flow-volume curve pattern occurs in COPD due to early airway closure from loss of elastic support in emphysematous lungs and lower airway inflammation in chronic bronchitis. Similar scooping of the expiratory limb is also observed in bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ebba99f0060f4851881c61e92cf1a4f0x1280x4291.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Any restrictive disease will show a reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC).

The pleural pressure is negative relative to the airway pressure during inspiration, which allows air to flow into the lungs normally despite an airway obstruction. However, the pleural pressure becomes positive relative to the airway pressure during expiration, and this worsens the effect of the obstructive lesion in the airways.",

It arises from the posterior part of the nasal cavity that is close to the superior margin of the sphenopalatine foramen. These patients have a hamartomatous nidus of vascular tissue in the nasopharynx that forms angiofibroma when testosterone appears. Therefore, it is thought to be testosterone-dependent.<br><br>Angiofibroma can extend into the nasal cavity causing obstruction, epistaxis, paranasal sinuses, pterygomaxillary fossa, infratemporal fossa, cheek, orbits causing proptosis, frog-face deformity, and cranial cavity. The clinical features include:<br><br>* Profuse, recurrent, spontaneous epistaxis- most common<br><br>* Progressive nasal obstruction and denasal speech- due to mass in the postnasal space<br><br>* Conductive hearing loss and otitis media with effusion- due to obstruction of the Eustachian tube<br><br>* Sessile, lobulated, or smooth mass in the nasopharynx<br><br>* Other clinical features include the broadening of the nasal bridge, proptosis, cheek swelling, involvement of II, III, IV, and VI cranial nerves<br><br>Diagnosis: It is mostly clinical.

The feeding vessels mostly come from the external carotid artery. In large tumours with intracranial extension, vessels come from the internal carotid system. <br><br>Biopsy of the mass is avoided due to the risk of bleeding.<br><br>Treatment: Surgery is the treatment of choice. Embolisation of the vessels can be done prior to surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding during the surgery. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy can also be considered.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A- Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a malignant tumour closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Cervical lymph node involvement, nasal obstruction, epistaxis, nasal discharge, conductive hearing loss with serous otitis media, squint, and diplopia due to involvement of the cranial nerves III, IV, and VI.<br><br>Trotter's triad, characterised by conductive deafness, ipsilateral temporoparietal neuralgia, and palatal paralysis may be seen. <br><br>Option C- Inverted papilloma/ Ringertz tumour/ Schneiderian papilloma is the tumour of the non-olfactory mucosa and paranasal sinuses. It is caused due to human papillomavirus. It is more commonly seen in males of the age group 40-70 years. Patients will almost always present with unilateral nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and epistaxis. Orbital invasion can result in proptosis, diplopia, and lacrimation.

Hence it is an oxidoreductase enzyme.<br><br>LDH has five isoenzymes, LDH 1-5 as summarised below:<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"pechZCpf\">Is</span><span class=\"jDdMHYIF\">oe</span><span class=\"ExWpvFPF\">nz</span><span class=\"sdUQUMNq\">yme</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"PqGlLOXy\">Sub</span><span class=\"WKYegjSl\">unit</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"UzKBwoVr\">Tiss</span><span class=\"ZRDwONbm\">ue</span> <span class=\"jAZEzyVL\">of</span> <span class=\"TWIaaNWv\">or</span><span class=\"vUShNLjv\">igin</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><span class=\"KnuCbsOo\">LD</span><span class=\"WKYegjSl\">H-1</span></strong></td>\n<td><strong><span class=\"Dejisbyg\">H4</span></strong></td>\n<td><strong><span class=\"LaSHrSCu\">Hea</span><span class=\"nyFlhpsT\">rt</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"KCLifHhO\">LD</span><span class=\"gHMARTzY\">H-2</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"fypyWJfl\">H3M1</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"KCLifHhO\">RBC</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"spbxHady\">LDH-</span><span class=\"pLMwOUpo\">3</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"cIlrbVkZ\">H2M2</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"yLcBTrIi\">Bra</span><span class=\"BGVAtOBx\">in</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"DIZijEJK\">LDH-</span><span class=\"mmnABbej\">4</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"qnmVpBsD\">H1M3</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"mEGXGjEP\">Live</span><span class=\"jAZEzyVL\">r</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"SACnUnnj\">LDH-</span><span class=\"ziCCbBkk\">5</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"vJvFWmhT\">M4</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"yWrPGVqL\">Sk</span><span class=\"uBpPxMUa\">ele</span><span class=\"EqEMoYjQ\">ta</span><span class=\"EgguPAMV\">l</span> <span class=\"MehLFXpZ\">musc</span><span class=\"GkxNpzxd\">le</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Normally, LDH-2 is the dominant isoform in serum, but in a patient with myocardial infarction, the LDH-1 isoform becomes elevated, and flipping of the LDH1: LDH2 ratio is highly suggestive of a cardiac insult. LDH starts becoming elevated 6-12 hours after an MI, peaks somewhere at 24- 72 hours from the onset, and returns to normal in 8-14 days.<br><br>However, as there are many isoforms of LDH raised in many conditions, it is not specific for myocardial infarction and for this indication, it has been largely superseded by cardiac troponins, which are the preferred markers.

All Trematode Helminths are generally monoecious, a significant exception is Schistosoma. An identification feature is the presence of separate sexes where the male holds the much smaller female in his gynaecophoric canal, a ventral canal on the male body for facilitating mating.<br><br>General features of Trematode parasites:<br><br>* Acoelomates- they have no body cavity<br><br>* Incomplete digestive and nervous systems<br><br>* Oviparous- produce eggs, generally operculated(except Schistosoma)<br><br>* Monoecious- hermaphrodite<br><br>* Leaf-like- dorsoventrally flattened body resembling a leaf<br><br>* Three stages in the life cycle- egg, larva, and

The implanted human embryo in the second week, also known as the \"Week of Twos\" undergoes the following developments:<br><br>* Trophoblast differentiates into the syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast layers. The syncytiotrophoblast invades the maternal decidual stroma.<br><br>* The inner cell mass differentiates into the epiblast and the hypoblast. Together they form the bilaminar germ disc.<br><br>* The extraembryonic mesoderm derived from the primitive yolk sac splits into the somatic and splanchnic layers. The somatic layer lines the cytotrophoblast and amnion and the splanchnic layer lines the yolk sac.<br><br>* Two cavities are formed: the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac cavity. Amnioblasts are derived from the epiblast and line of the amniotic cavity. Hypoblasts migrate along the exocoelomic membrane in the primitive yolk sac cavity to form the secondary/ definitive yolk sac cavity.<br><br>At the end of the second week, there are 3 cavities associated with the embryo: the amniotic cavity, the definitive yolk sac cavity, and the chorionic cavity. The below image of the definitive chorion also shows the three cavities, from above downwards being the amniotic cavity, yolk sac and the chorionic cavity encircling the others.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/bd91244e12ac4c0da7c4a65cb4055949x1022x836.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Gastrulation is the process of establishment of all three germ layers in the embryo in the third week of development. Gastrulation involves the orderly movement of cells in the germ disc. All three layers are derived from the Epiblast. The process is as follows:<br><br>* First the primitive streak forms caudally in the germ disc and at its cephalic end the primitive node develops.<br><br>* Epiblast cells migrate towards the streak and invaginate into it; some displace the hypoblast to form the endoderm, the first formed germ layer.<br><br>* Other epiblast cells come to lie in between the preexisting epiblast and the newly formed endoderm forming the second formed layer, the intra-embryonic mesoderm, which is also derived from the epiblast.<br><br>* Cells remaining in the epiblast form the final layer, the ectoderm.<br><br>The intraembryonic mesoderm is organized into three parts: the paraxial, intermediate and lateral plate mesoderm, each of which has its unique derivatives during organogenesis.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/667c4bce121e4a2ea705944c025fbba8x744x830.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "The given clinical scenario where a neonate with meconium ileus underwent pilocarpine iontophoresis and two separate tests showed abnormal elevated chloride levels satisfies the criteria to diagnose the neonate with Cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, as shown in pedigree chart number 2.<br><br>In a pedigree chart with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, the disease is manifested only in the homozygous state, both males and females are equally affected, and multiple individuals may be affected in one generation with no affected members in other generations.<br><br>Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive trait due to a mutation in the CF gene coding for the CFTR pump, a chloride and bicarbonate transport channel expressed in epithelial cells of the aerodigestive and genitourinary systems and the sweat glands on the skin.<br><br>The disease is classified into six pathogenic variants based on the type of mutation, variants 1-3 are severe and 4-6 are milder versions. The most common mutation is F508del, the deletion of phenylalanine at the 508th position in the CF gene. Diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis satisfies both points:<br><br>*  The presence of typical clinical features/ A history of CF in sibling/ A positive newborn screening test<br><br>*  Laboratory evidence of CFTR dysfunction in the form of two elevated sweat chloride concentrations obtained on separate days/ identification of two pathogenic CF variants/  abnormal nasal transepithelial potential difference.<br><br>Typical clinical features in an infant include recurrent sinopulmonary infections, fetal echogenic bowel, meconium ileus, rectal prolapse, pancreatic insufficiency, dehydration, and hypochloremic hyponatremic metabolic alkalosis. In this infant, meconium ileus prompted a sweat chloride test which was abnormal on two different days, confirming the diagnosis as cystic fibrosis.<br><br>Pilocarpine iontophoresis is the standard test done to measure sweat chloride levels. The test involves using an electric current to infuse pilocarpine over the skin of the forearm to stimulate the sweat glands, followed by testing of chloride concentration in the sweat produced. A chloride level of >60mmol/ L is diagnostic of CF in the presence of other criteria.<br><br>Newborn screening for CF is done in resource-rich settings with an IRT test- immunoreactive trypsinogen testing in the serum. Immunoreactive trypsinogen is a pancreatic proenzyme that is elevated in nearly all cases of cystic fibrosis in infancy. <br><br>Other Options:<br><br>Pedigree Chart 1: It depicts an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance as seen in conditions like achondroplasia.<br><br>Pedigree Chart 3: It depicts the X-linked dominant mode of inheritance as seen in conditions like Rett's syndrome.<br><br>Pedigree Chart 4: It depicts the X-linked recessive mode of inheritance as seen in conditions like G6PD deficiency.<br><br>Below is a pearl that summarises how to identify the

IgM can have a valency of 10 in its pentameric form. <br><br>The given question mentions four statements, each of which is a feature specific to a certain antibody. IgG is the antibody that can cross the placenta ( Option A). The heat-labile antibody is IgE, (Option B) all other antibodies are heat-stable. This implies that IgE is inactivated in one hour at 56 degrees Celcius. The antibody that exists as a dimer joined by the J-chain is IgA (Option C). The antibody with a valency of 10 is IgM.<br><br>The valency of an antibody is defined as the number of antigen-binding sites that an antibody possesses, which in turn is determined by the number of subunits it has. IgG, IgD, and IgE are monomers with only two binding sites. Hence, they have a valency of two. IgA is a dimer linked by the J-chain and secretory protein with a valency of four. IgM can exist either as a monomer with a valency of 2 or a pentamer with a valency of 10.<br><br>In CD40 ligand defect on the T-cell, other antibodies cannot be synthesized, are deficient in plasma and there is Hyper-IgM syndrome with excess IgM. The most common form of this disorder is an X-linked recessive mutation in the CD40 ligand.<br><br>The patient has a loss-of-function mutation in CD40 ligand resulting in the inability of antibodies to undergo class switching. When antibodies are first synthesized by the B-cell, they are all of the IgM variety. B-cells have CD40 receptors that interact with CD40 ligand on the CD4+ T-cell to undergo class switching, a cellular process in which IgM differentiates into the other antibodies. This process is hampered in Hyper IgM syndrome.<br><br>Excess IgM can result in hyperviscosity symptoms due to the heavy molecular weight of pentameric IgM.

It is achieved via HDL, and the steps summarised are as follows:<br><br>Nascent discoidal HDL takes up cholesterol from peripheral tissues. This cholesterol is converted by the LCAT enzyme to cholesteryl esters under the influence of Apo-A1. As HDL accumulates more cholesterol it becomes spherical. SR-B1 receptor in the liver mediates cholesteryl ester reuptake from HDL molecules. This cholesterol is removed from the body as bile acids.

      "solution": "This clinical vignette is strongly suggestive of Paget's disease of the bone. It is also known as osteitis deformans. The most appropriate treatment for this patient with Paget's disease is IV Zoledronate- a bisphosphonate. <br><br>It is characterized by an increased bone turnover due to a disorganized, alternating, and increased rate of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. It may be monostotic or polyostotic. <br><br>Clinically, it is seen more commonly in people over the age of 50. A majority of the patients are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients present with bone pain, which is constant and dull aching and mostly involves the long bones of the lower limbs, back, and hips. They may have deformities such as bowing of bones, the tibia bending anteriorly and the femur bending anterolaterally.<br><br>Skull bones may be enlarged, and the base of the skull may be flattened. Disorganised and increased bone deposition may lead to stenosis of various canals and foramina, resulting in compression of cranial nerves, spinal cord, and nerve roots (due to spinal stenosis). Hearing loss is a fairly common feature due to compression of the cranial nerve and otosclerosis, resulting in mixed sensorineural and conductive hearing loss. Pathological fractures of the long bones may be seen. One of the most baleful complications, however, is the increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. <br><br>Other complications include osteoarthritis, high-output cardiac failure, and hypercalcemia. <br><br>Laboratory investigations reveal-<br><br>* Normal calcium and phosphate levels<br><br>* Increased bone-specific alkaline phosphatase due to increased osteoblastic activity<br><br>* Increased serum levels of collagen crosslinked peptides such as CTX (C-telopeptide) due to bone resorption<br><br>* Increased urinary markers such as hydroxyproline, deoxypyridinoline, C-telopeptide, and N-telopeptide.<br><br>X-ray findings in Paget's disease reveal both sclerotic and osteolytic lesions. Characteristic radiographic findings include-<br><br>* Brim sign- Seen in Paget's disease of the pelvis due to a thickened iliopectineal line.<br><br>* Flame-shaped lesions- Seen in long bones due to localized osteolysis/osteopenia. <br><br>* Picture-frame appearance may be seen in vertebral bodies due to enlarged coarse trabeculae surrounded by a prominent radiodense periphery.<br><br>* Ivory vertebra sign may be seen due to diffuse and homogeneous increase in opacity of a vertebral body.<br><br>* Osteoporosis circumscripta describes circumscribed patches of radiolucency due to osteoporosis in the skull.<br><br>The aim of the treatment of Paget disease is to limit excessive bone remodelling and to reduce pain. The mainstay of treatment is therefore bisphosphonates as they inhibit osteoclastic activity, limiting bone resorption and disease progression. IV zoledronate is the preferred bisphosphonate. It is administered as a single IV dose of 4-5 mg and has the most sustained response. It is, however, contraindicated in renal insufficiency. <br><br>Therapeutic uses of bisphosphonates- <br><br>* Osteoporosis including postmenopausal and steroid-induced<br><br>* Paget disease <br><br>* Tumor-associated osteolysis <br><br>* Hypercalcemia. <br><br>The arrow mark in the image given below depicts the 'blade of grass'/Flame-shaped lesion.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/402bb1915c4d40fcba6af8bbb7066c91x720x720.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>The image given below depicts the Ivory vertebra sign.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/58647f14e86a4d0d8a7f2885e748c107x720x860.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>The image given below depicts the Picture-frame appearance seen in vertebral bodies.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6f136492a4e740f69ab307038f116255x512x513.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM0540: Bone Formation and Bone Resorption Markers<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Bone Formation Markers</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><strong>Bone Resorption Markers</strong></p>\n </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Blood</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Blood</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Urine</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Procollagen type I propeptides</p>\n</td>\n<td> Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Osteocalcin (OC)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cross-linked C-telopeptide of<strong> type I collagen</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hydroxyproline </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Total alkaline phosphate</p>\n<p>Bone isoform of alkaline phosphatase (BALP)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>C- telopeptide of <strong>pro</strong>collagen cross- links and </p>\n<p>N-telopeptide of <strong>pro</strong>collagen cross-links </p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Free and total pyridinolines, </p>\n<p>Free and total deoxypyridinoline</p>\n<p>(PYD and DPD)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Aminoterminal propeptide of type I collagen </p>\n<p>(PINP)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cathepsin K</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>N-telopeptide of <strong>collagen</strong> cross-links and C-telopeptide of <strong>collagen</strong> cross-links (CTX, ICTP, NTX)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Carboxyterminal propeptide of type I collagen </p>\n<p>(PICP)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p> </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Pearl PM1079: Biochemical parameters in metabolic bone diseases<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Metabolic bone disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Calcium</strong></td>\n<td><strong>PTH</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Phosphate</strong></td>\n<td><strong>ALP</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Primary hyperparathyroidism</p>\n</td>\n<td>     ↑</td>\n<td>   ↑</td>\n<td>       ↓</td>\n<td> ↑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Secondary hyperparathyroidism (Rickets / Osteomalacia)</p>\n</td>\n<td> ↓/N</td>\n<td>   ↑</td>\n<td>        ↓</td>\n<td>   ↑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Secondary hyperparathyroidism (CKD)</p>\n</td>\n<td>     ↓</td>\n<td>   ↑</td>\n<td>       ↑</td>\n<td>    ↑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tertiary hyperparathyroidism</p>\n</td>\n<td>     ↑</td>\n<td>    ↑</td>\n<td>       ↑</td>\n<td>   ↑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Osteoporosis</td>\n<td>     N</td>\n<td>   N</td>\n<td>      N</td>\n<td>  N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Paget's disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>     N</td>\n<td>   N</td>\n<td>      N</td>\n<td>  ↑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Osteopetrosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>  ↓/N</td>\n<td>↑/N</td>\n<td>    ↓/N</td>\n<td>  N</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br> ↑: Increased,  ↓: Decreased, N: Normal",

      "solution": "The mechanism of inhibition of antagonistic muscle is via reciprocal inhibition.<br><br>Afferent fibers from muscle spindles are related to the spinal motor neuron complex that supplies the same muscle. When an impulse is generated, an excitatory potential is generated that leads to the action in the muscle. Meanwhile, an inhibitory potential is produced in the motor neurons supplying the antagonistic muscle group. By this mechanism, there is both an excitatory and an inhibitory impulse known as reciprocal inhibition. <br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option A: Lateral inhibition: Stimulation of one motor neuron inhibits adjacent motor neurons. This is known as lateral inhibition. Signals from the spinal motor neurons stimulate Renshaw cells, which are inhibitory interneurons. Renshaw cells transmit inhibitory signals to the adjacent motor neurons, by releasing the neurotransmitter glycine. This helps in sharpening signals in order to maintain the desired direction of signal transmission. <br><br>Option C: Feedback inhibition (Recurrent inhibition): Signals from neurons may inhibit themselves by negative feedback. This is known as feedback inhibition or recurrent inhibition. Signals from a neuron may stimulate the Renshaw cell, which in turn inhibits the same neuron.<br><br>Option D: Feedforward inhibition: Signals from neurons stimulate inhibitory cells. These inhibitory cells then inhibit a different group of neurons. This is called feedforward inhibition. For example, granule cells stimulate the inhibitory basket cells and stellate cells via parallel fibers. These basket and stellate cells then inhibit the Purkinje cells. This is known as feedforward inhibition.",

They are not errors per se. Hence, the mean of the sample always differs from the mean of the total population. For example, consider a population with a mean weight of 75. If we take a sample of 500 people from this population, the mean weight of this sample will not be exactly 75.<br><br>* Random Sampling Distribution of Means (or Sampling Distribution):<br><br>* This refers to the distribution formed when all possible sample means from a population are plotted in a frequency distribution.<br><br>* Sampling distributions provide information into how different the samples are from each other and from the population mean.<br><br>For example, the hemoglobin levels of 100 randomly selected women in a city are measured and their sample mean is calculated. This is done every day for a year with the same sample size but different women each time. If all the sample means of hemoglobin levels of all women are plotted on frequency distribution, the resulting distribution would be called the sampling distribution. It would resemble a normal distribution.<br><br>* Central Limit Theorem: According to this theorem, as the sample size increases:<br><br>* The sampling distribution tends towards a normal distribution curve (bell curve)<br><br>* Regardless of the population's actual distribution shape<br><br>* Assuming all samples are identical in size<br><br>* The sample mean and standard deviations become closer to the population mean and standard deviations <br><br>* Standard Error of Mean (SE or σ x̄ ):<br><br>* The standard error is a measure of the extent to which the sample means deviate from the true population mean. It is nothing but the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.<br><br>* Sample means closer to the population mean lead to a lower SE and a narrower and thinner distribution curve <br><br>* More variation in sample means leads to a higher SE and a broader curve <br><br>SE = Standard deviation / √Sample size<br><br>          σ x̄ = σ/√n<br><br>Hence, SE is inversely related to √sample size.",

The emphasis is to work out the safety, tolerability, and to detect any potentially dangerous side effects.<br><br>* Phase 2 (Option B) - This phase involves about 100-500 patients with the disease and is used to work out the therapeutic efficacy, optimal dosing strategy, and ceiling effect of the drug in a controlled setting. <br><br>* Phase 3 - This phase involves a large number of patients (about 500-3000) being assigned randomly to either the treatment under investigation (e.g., drug X in the question) or to the present standard of care (e.g., methotrexate as the first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug). The aim is to establish the value of the drug in relation to existing therapy. If it is better than existing modalities, indications are finalized and guidelines for therapeutic use are formulated.<br><br>* Phase 4 (Option D) - This is a phase of postmarketing surveillance of patients after the treatment is approved.

      "solution": "Accepting gift hampers on the referral of patients is not a cognizable offense. <br><br>Accepting gift hampers on the referral of patients comes under dichotomy. It is a type of unethical act, wherein a physician offers or receives any gift or bonus for referring or procuring any patient for medical or surgical treatment. <br><br>A cognizable offense is that in which a police officer can arrest a person without having a warrant from the magistrate. Examples include cases of rape, murder, dowry death, and death due to rash or negligent acts. In such cases, the individual is sent by the police to the doctor for a medical examination. <br><br>Punishments for cognizable offense: <br><br>* Death<br><br>* Imprisonment for life<br><br>* Imprisonment could be rigorous and involve hard labor<br><br>* Forfeiture of property<br><br>* Fine<br><br>In non-cognizable offenses, the accused cannot be arrested without a warrant issued by the magistrate. The injured person can directly go to the doctor or he may file an affidavit in the court of a magistrate, who will send him to the doctor for examination and report. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Options B and C: Operating under the influence of alcohol and performing amputation on the wrong limb come under criminal negligence. Criminal negligence is when a doctor lacks gross skill or care while treating, which results in serious injury/death of the patient, or when an illegal act is performed by a doctor. Criminal negligence is a cognizable offense.<br><br>Option D: Ragging in any form is a cognizable offense.<br><br>Pearl PM2391: Contributory negligence<br><br>Contributory negligence occurs when a patient or his personal attendant shows unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care, which when combined with the negligence of the doctor, has contributed to the injury. In this case, the patient’s or attendant’s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.<br><br>So, contributory negligence occurs when both the doctor and patient are negligent. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient’s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.<br><br>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the patient:<br><br>* Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.<br><br>* Fails to follow the doctor’s instructions<br><br>* Refuses to take the treatment<br><br>* Leaves the hospital against doctor’s advice<br><br>* Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.<br><br>Contributory negligence is a defence for doctor’s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the doctrine of comparative negligence, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.<br><br>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:<br><br>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:<br><br>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient<br><br>* Ex: Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (doctor is negligent) to the patient’s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (no proper instruction). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (patient is negligent). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.<br><br> 2. Last clear chance doctrine: It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.<br><br>* Ex: Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (doctor is negligent) to the patient’s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (gave proper instruction). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (patient is negligent). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.<br><br>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:<br><br>1. Avoidable consequences rule: It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor’s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the doctor need not pay anything, and the patient will be held guilty.<br><br>* Ex: A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.<br><br>* Here, despite the doctor being negligent in the first instance, the patient is responsible for his injury as he performed an unnecessary, avoidable act, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.<br><br>2. Good Samaritan doctrine: A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.<br><br>* Ex: A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (serious danger), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car (assisted the victim and was not reckless). However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (victim’s injury was aggravated). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, will not be charged under contributory negligence.",

But the overall most common cause of rickets remains to be nutritional vitamin D deficiency. PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating endopeptidase on X chromosome) products are responsible for the inactivation of phosphatonin. Mutation of this PHEX leads to increased phosphatonin (FGF 23) levels. This leads to impaired renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate and hence the excretion of phosphorous is increased. It also inhibits renal 1-alpha hydroxylase leading to reduced 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D. <br><br>The patient's laboratory reports will show low phosphate levels or increased urinary phosphate. All other parameters such as calcium, PTH(parathyroid hormone) and pH are normal with raised alkaline phosphatase(ALP) levels.<br><br>Clinical features of X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic(XLH) rickets include lower extremity abnormalities, short stature, poor growth, delayed dentition, and tooth abscesses. The wind-swept deformity is due to genu varus(leg going inward compared to the knee joint) on one side and genu valgus(leg going outward compared to the knee) on the contralateral side.<br><br>Mainstay treatment of hypophosphatemic rickets includes oral phosphorus and 1,25-D (calcitriol). Phosphorus supplementation is usually given in 1-3 g elemental phosphorus divided into 4–5 doses. Frequent dosing reduces diarrhoea, which is a complication of high-dose oral phosphorus. Calcitriol is administered 30–70 ng/kg/day divided into 2 doses.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/da232099312d413db328feba43e9666fx1280x1838.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM1079: Biochemical parameters in metabolic bone diseases<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Metabolic bone disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Calcium</strong></td>\n<td><strong>PTH</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Phosphate</strong></td>\n<td><strong>ALP</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Primary hyperparathyroidism</p>\n</td>\n<td>     ↑</td>\n<td>   ↑</td>\n<td>       ↓</td>\n<td> ↑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Secondary hyperparathyroidism (Rickets / Osteomalacia)</p>\n</td>\n<td> ↓/N</td>\n<td>   ↑</td>\n<td>        ↓</td>\n<td>   ↑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Secondary hyperparathyroidism (CKD)</p>\n</td>\n<td>     ↓</td>\n<td>   ↑</td>\n<td>       ↑</td>\n<td>    ↑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tertiary hyperparathyroidism</p>\n</td>\n<td>     ↑</td>\n<td>    ↑</td>\n<td>       ↑</td>\n<td>   ↑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Osteoporosis</td>\n<td>     N</td>\n<td>   N</td>\n<td>      N</td>\n<td>  N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Paget's disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>     N</td>\n<td>   N</td>\n<td>      N</td>\n<td>  ↑</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Osteopetrosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>  ↓/N</td>\n<td>↑/N</td>\n<td>    ↓/N</td>\n<td>  N</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br> ↑: Increased,  ↓: Decreased, N: Normal<br><br>Pearl PM1959: Radiological Features of Rickets<br><br>Radiological features of rickets:<br><br>* Loss of provisional zone of calcification: earliest radiological finding of rickets. <br><br>* Delayed appearance of the epiphysis<br><br>* Widening of growth plate: normal width of growth plate is 2-4mm.

It is autosomal recessive and occurs due to a mutation of the GAA gene on chromosome 17.

It begins with accumulation in peripheral, voluntary muscles and progresses to involve the cardiac muscle and diaphragm. <br><br>Clinical features include hypotonia (floppy baby syndrome), motor delay, cardiomegaly, macroglossia, hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, and poor feeding. Late involvement of the diaphragm leads to respiratory failure. Cardiac involvement can lead to arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy. <br><br>Laboratory investigations will reveal elevated serum creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase. Urine glucose tetrasaccharide is a glycogen breakdown product that can be used to assess severity of disease and response to treatment. <br><br>Myozyme can prevent worsening or can reverse cardiac and skeletal abnormalities.

Blocking the action of mTOR results in the arrest of the Tcell activation and proliferation in the G1-S phase transition. Side effects of Sirolimus include:<br><br>* Lymphocele: a collection of lymphatic fluid around the transplanted kidney that appears in a dose-dependent fashion and requires close post-operative monitoring.<br><br>* Delayed wound healing<br><br>* Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia<br><br>* Hypokalemia<br><br>* Oral ulcers, GI side effects <br><br>* Increased risk of infections<br><br>Other Options:<br><br>Option B and C: Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus are termed calcineurin inhibitors. They are not known to cause lymphocele. Cyclosporine binds to cyclophilin, an immunophilin molecule and this complex inhibits a cytoplasmic phosphatase known as calcineurin. Calcineurin is responsible for the activation of NF-KB, a transcription factor in T-cells responsible for the synthesis of interleukins like IL-2, which send proliferative signals to other T-cells.<br><br>Hence, cyclosporine-induced block of NF-KB activation reduces pro-proliferative interleukin signals. Tacrolimus is a much more potent calcineurin inhibitor that binds to FKPB instead of cyclophilin, which in turn blocks NF-KB activation via calcineurin inhibition. <br><br>Option D: Muromonab is a mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody against the CD3 receptor. It causes internalization of this T-cell receptor by endocytosis which prevents proliferative signals from being received by the Tcell. It is no longer favored due to its side effects of cytokine release syndrome and pulmonary edema. Another drug in the same class, Teplizumab is under trial.<br><br>Given below is a table of immunosuppressants and their target on Tcell:<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span

      "solution": "The answer is protease inhibitor-induced nephrolithiasis. Protease inhibitors such as Indinavir, when given as part of antiretroviral therapy, can cause radiolucent stones that are missed on CT/X-ray and may cause hydronephrosis due to obstruction, as seen here on the left side.<br><br>In this IVP, the dye is seen pooling in the aberrant left pelvicalyceal system as late as 15 minutes post-contrast. The calyces appear dilated, indicating hydronephrosis, the most probable cause of which must be a lucent stone such as indinavir induced stone.<br><br>Nephrolithiasis or kidney stones are an important cause for flank pain and can be classified radiologically as either radioopaque or radiolucent stones. Radioopaque stones are calcium-based stones such as calcium oxalate, followed by slightly more lucent struvite and cystine followed by uric acid stones which may be opaque(due to calcium coating) or mostly lucent, followed by drug-induced stones that are radiolucent. Cardinal features of various stones causing urolithiasis are given:<br><br>* Calcium oxalate: Most common type, precipitated by hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypercalcemia, hyperuricosuria and hypocitraturia. The most common disease process is hyperparathyroidism.<br><br>* Calcium phosphate: Seen as apatite( in infection) or brushite (distal RTA)stones.<br><br>* Uric acid: Stone formation occurs in acidic urine and additionally promotes calcium oxalate deposition on the uric acid stone. Seen in gout, myeloproliferative diseases etc.<br><br>* Infection associated: Struvite( magnesium ammonium phosphate) and apatite stones seen, in alkaline urine formed by urease producing organisms like Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia, Enterobacter etc. Staghorn calculi are unique struvite stones that form like a cast of the pelvicalycal system.<br><br>* Cystine stones: Very hard and form in acidic urine.<br><br>Patients present with pain radiating from the flank to the groin or flank pain and difficulty and pain on urination, hematuria, pyuria, etc. The initial investigation may be with USG and/or X-ray KUB which is better as over three-fourths of all stones are radioopaque and visualized. The preferred investigation for diagnosis of nephrolithiasis is a non-contrast CT scan which can be used for both radiolucent and radiopaque stones except indinavir. <br><br>Hydronephrosis is an aseptic dilation of the pelvicalyceal system due to various degrees of obstruction to the flow of urine. On USG, it is graded based on the changes to the calyx. The cup-shaped calyx becomes blunted, following which it becomes club-shaped and finally becomes broadened in severe disease. On IVU, the normal pelvicalyceal architecture is seen as lost and the calyces may be blunted or broadened. The contrast dye takes longer than usual to drain from the pelvicalyx.<br><br>Other Options:<br><br>Option A: Cystinuria-induced nephrolithiasis is a genetic disorder (Autosomal Recessive) due to the mutations in the SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes, causing excess cystine in the urine. This leads to poorly soluble cystine stones in the kidneys causing nephrolithiasis. The Stones are radio-opaque and, hence should be visualized on X-ray.<br><br>Option B: Hypercalciuria-induced nephrolithiasis will present with a radiopaque stone, not radiolucent, so a normal plain X-ray rules it out. <br><br>Option D: Struvite nephrolithiasis, often termed 'infection stones,' arises from urinary tract infections by urease-producing bacteria, primarily Proteus mirabilis. These organisms elevate urine pH, favoring magnesium ammonium phosphate crystallization. Rapid stone growth, forming staghorn calculi which are radio-opaque can lead to renal obstruction and subsequent parenchymal damage.

VNS can be used as an adjunct to manage chronic depression that is not controlled after the adequate use of four anti-depressant drugs.<br><br>VNS is an emerging modality for managing pharmacological treatment-resistant depression, especially in concomitant bipolar disorder whereby electrodes are placed over the left vagus nerve which is stimulated using a device implanted subcutaneously in the chest. Thus VNS has two parts, the vagus lead and the impulse generator.<br><br>The left vagus is chosen as the right vagus supplies the SA node, and stimulating it may cause arrhythmia.

This disease is termed Type 2 Citrullinemia.<br><br>The Urea cycle is linked closely to the Krebs cycle via Aspartate and Fumarate. Together, these cycles form the \"Urea Bicycle\". Aspartate reacts with Citrulline in the urea cycle to form Argininosuccinate, which is broken down into Fumarate and Arginine. The Fumarate is converted to Malate which becomes Oxaloacetate which can be aminated to form Asparate. The Aspartate can be reused in the Urea cycle.<br><br>Citrin is a mitochondrial transporter responsible for shuttling aspartate from the intermembrane space of the mitochondria to the cytosol. Citrin transporter defect causes Aspartate to accumulate in mitochondria and Citrulline cannot combine with it to form Argininosuccinate.<br><br>This is called Type 2 Citrullinemia as opposed to Type 1 where there is a deficiency of the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase. Clinical features of Type 2 Citrullinemia are detailed below.<br><br>It is a recessive mutation in mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier-Citrin (ACG2) which causes the urea cycle to halt and reduces the transfer of NADH via malate aspartate shuttle. Mutations occur in the SLC25A13 gene on chromosome  7q21.3. The usual presentation is abrupt onset in adulthood(20-50) with recurrent attacks of hyperammonemia and its features, primarily related to CNS symptoms like altered mentation, convulsions, coma-like state, etc <br><br>Avoidance of carbohydrate-rich foods that trigger symptoms( due to an increase in NADH) and a preference for meat, fish, and eggs is typically seen in patients. Other triggers include surgery, alcohol consumption, and medications like paracetamol. Death occurs by cerebral edema within a few years from onset if left untreated.<br><br>Diagnosis is by assays that show elevated citrulline, arginine and ammonia with near-normal levels of glutamine. Galactose-1- phosphate levels are increased in RBCs. Confirmation of the diagnosis is by identifying a mutation in the gene.<br><br>Treatment options include avoidance of carbohydrates and a diet high in protein and fat. Supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides, arginine, and pyruvate has been shown to prevent attacks in the short term. The long-term solution is a liver transplant.<br><br>Other Options:<br><br>Options A and B: Hyperammonemia in Urea cycle disorders causes the increased conversion of NH3 to Glutamate which is converted to Glutamine.

This typically happens through the round or oval window. It can be caused by iatrogenic factors (eg. post-stapedectomy or ear surgery with stapes dislocation), as well as by head trauma and inner ear injuries resulting from forceful Valsalva maneuvers or barotrauma.<br><br>Patients with perilymph fistula typically present with intermittent vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and a sensation of fullness in the ear. Symptoms can be triggered by the fistula test (intermittent pressure over the tragus) and the Valsalva maneuver. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the temporal bone is used for diagnosis. Initial treatment is conservative, including head elevation, bed rest, and avoiding activities that raise intracranial pressure. If symptoms continue or recur, exploratory tympanotomy may be indicated.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Hemotympanum is the presence of blood in the middle ear. It can present with hearing loss, pain, and a feeling of fullness inside the ear. It is commonly associated with temporal bone fractures. <br><br>Option C: Meniere disease can also present with vertigo, tinnitus, and fluctuating deafness. However, an iatrogenic history of post-stapedectomy makes perilymph fistula the more likely diagnosis. <br><br>Option D: Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome results from an abnormal connection between the semicircular canal and the brain. It occurs due to an abnormal thinness or incomplete closure of the bony canals in the inner ear. Patients can present with vertigo, tinnitus, autophony, and hearing loss. The iatrogenic history makes it unlikely in this case.",

Therefore, at rest, the transfer of CO is not limited by perfusion but by diffusion. <br><br>The diffusing capacity of the lung for a given gas is directly proportional to the surface area of the alveolar-capillary membrane and inversely proportional to its thickness.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/d6189195e876496c9bfe7a5b847211a7x992x158.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>In this test, a small amount of CO is used to measure the alveolar gas exchange during a 10-second breath-hold. The CO in exhaled breath is then analyzed and the quantity of CO that crosses the alveolar membrane is determined. The normal value of DLco at rest is about 25 mL/min/mm Hg.<br><br>DLCO is decreased in patients with:<br><br>* Interstitial lung disease<br><br>* Emphysema (chronic bronchitis usually have normal DLCO)<br><br>DLCO is increased in patients with:<br><br>* Obesity<br><br>* Asthma<br><br>* Pulmonary hemorrhage<br><br>* Exercise",

All the other drugs given require monitoring of the coagulation profile.<br><br>Apixaban is a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor. Rivaroxaban and edoxaban also belong to the same class of drugs. These drugs are given orally in fixed doses and do not require coagulation monitoring. The drugs affect PT more than apTT. However, anti-factor Xa assays provide the best estimate of anticoagulation if all monitoring is done. Annual RFT is mandated, and more frequent testing is also done in individuals with renal disease. Treatment indications include:<br><br>* Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation<br><br>* Acute deep-vein thrombosis<br><br>* Acute pulmonary embolism<br><br>* Postoperative thromboprophylaxis in knee/hip arthroplasty<br><br>An important contraindication is stroke prevention in mechanical heart valves. They should also be avoided in APLA syndrome where warfarin is a better drug. The main adverse effect of these drugs is bleeding, which is not as severe or life-threatening as warfarin.<br><br>Other than apixaban, the other drugs cause increased GI bleeding. All drugs are substrates for p-glycoprotein and are metabolized by CYP3A4( except edoxaban) so plasma levels are reduced by inducers like Rifampicin, Phenytoin, etc. Andexanet alfa is the reversal agent for Apixaban and rivaroxaban.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Unfractionated heparin requires regular aPTT monitoring. An aPTT value that is two or three times the normal value is considered therapeutic. Plasma heparin value of 0.3-0.7 units/mL as measured by anti-factor Xa assay is the therapeutic range for heparin. Activated clotting time test is used to monitor heparin in PCI and cardiac bypass surgery candidates.<br><br>Option C: Argatroban is a synthetic parenteral anticoagulant that binds reversibly to thrombin. Its primary indication is in prophylaxis and treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. It causes an increase in both PT and aPTT and is monitored with both along with anti-Xa assays.<br><br>Option D: Desirudin is used for thromboprophylaxis in individuals undergoing hip surgery.
