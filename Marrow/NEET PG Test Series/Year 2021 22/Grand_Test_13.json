It is chiefly used for its V1 receptor-mediated actions.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Water Deprivation test in Diabetes Insipidus</h3><p><strong>Procedure</strong>: Start the test at 4 am by checking the baseline urine osmolality.

Patients will have <strong>elevated 24-hour urinary cortisol levels</strong>; they have elevated levels of plasma cortisol, which are <strong>not suppressed by dexamethasone</strong>. If these are elevated, it confirms that the patient has elevated levels of cortisol.</p>\n<p>The next step is to evaluate if the elevated cortisol levels are due to <strong>elevated ACTH</strong> or are <strong>independent of ACTH levels</strong>. In this patient, the ACTH levels are elevated, which means that increased ACTH has caused increased production of cortisol. Increased ACTH can be due to a pituitary tumor that produces ACTH or ectopic ACTH production that is seen in tumors like bronchial or pancreatic carcinoids, medullary thyroid carcinoma, etc.</p>\n<p>The source of ACTH production can be identified using an MRI of the pituitary, a corticotropin-releasing hormone test, and a high-dose dexamethasone test. If the ACTH production is due to an adenoma in the pituitary, it responds to the administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and is <strong>suppressed by the administration of dexamethasone.</strong> In this patient, both of these <strong>tests are negative</strong>, which means that ACTH production is not from the pituitary but is due to <strong>ectopic production of ACTH. </strong>The patient has to be evaluated for underlying tumours. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7b1a8d7d4f454ac69827eaedef7700a5x1200x2435.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/67f4448b6b654c48b078f570f7512206x1280x2864.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Pituitary adenoma has elevated levels of cortisol and is normal to high ACTH levels.

Thus, the intrinsic and extrinsic sphincters operate together. This permits the orderly flow of food into the stomach and prevents reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/cf32672ea3f64322b1101ef54476978bx600x657.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Mechanism of peristalsis</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/fd2cb6f000bb4468a6be9203185befdax1280x1685.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

In the end stages, the patient becomes mute, incontinent, unable to walk. They usually develop <strong>pneumonia</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease involves the accumulation of&nbsp;<strong>A&beta; amyloid </strong>and<strong> tau</strong> in the brain. The hallmarks of this condition are <strong>amyloid plaques</strong> comprised of aggregated&nbsp;A&beta; amyloid and <strong>neurofibrillary tangles</strong>. Neurofibrillary <strong>tangles</strong> are the <strong>cytoplasmic</strong> accumulation of <strong>tau</strong> filaments. Neuritic plaques are focal collections of axonal or dendritic processes around a central <strong>amyloid core</strong>. In pyramidal neurons, they appear as <strong>flame-shaped</strong>.

This prevents the reabsorption of amino acids like <strong>cystine</strong>, ornithine, lysine, and arginine. The only known complication of this disease is the <strong>formation of calculi</strong>, because of the low solubility of cystine in the urine. Cystine is more likely to precipitate in acidic urine.</p>\n<p>Prevention of stone formation in patients with cystinuria can be done by <strong>increasing fluid intake</strong> and <strong>alkalinization of the urine</strong> with sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate. Chelating agents such as <strong>penicillamine</strong> have also been found to be useful. <strong>Tiopronin</strong> is currently the best choice drug for cystine reduction, but side effects like nephrotic syndrome may limit its long-term use. A <strong>diet low in methionine</strong> may theoretically reduce the excretion of cystine in the urine by directly reducing its formation.</p><p class=\"p1\">Other options-</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option (A):<strong> Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy </strong>(ESWL) is a non-invasive method that generates shockwaves outside the body, which are focused on the stones. It is the most common method of treating urinary tract stones. Stones <strong>up to</strong> approximately <strong>1.5 cm</strong> in size <strong>are suitable</strong> for this form of treatment. <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cystine stones which are are <strong>often multiple</strong>, <strong>and very hard</strong> are relatively <strong>resistant</strong> <strong>to ESWL</strong> due to their hardness.</span></p><p> Option (C):<strong> Open surgery- </strong>A <strong>longstanding obstructing calculus </strong>can result in <strong>chronic inflammatory</strong> change in the kidney. Open surgeries are generally indicated for xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). Generally, in such cases, a <strong>subcapsular nephrectomy</strong> is performed. In extremely rare cases where both PCNL and ESWL are contraindicated, one might resort to open/laparoscopic surgery. </p>\n<p>Option (D):<strong> Ureteroscopic removal- </strong>Semi-rigid ureteroscopes are frequently used to directly visualize ureteric calculi. Advances in the design of ureterorenoscopy have made it easier to access these stones by endoscopic examination.  Stones can also be fragmented using mechanical disintegration using the lithoclast.

Therapies include giving nicotine in the form of <strong>gums or patches</strong> for a <strong>period of 1 month</strong> to manage the withdrawal symptoms. It can then be <strong>gradually tapered.</strong></p>\n<p>Nicotine gum is useful in several ways. Firstly, it provides nicotine in <strong>low doses</strong> to <strong>avoid precipitation of withdrawal,&nbsp;</strong>which is usually the reason why patients use tobacco again. Secondly, it is <strong>free of smoke</strong> and other harmful additives. Thirdly, it provides an indirect measure of craving and how heavy tobacco usage was, in the first place.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Chewing it like regular gum</strong> releases all of the nicotine at once, causing <strong>nausea.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Nicotine gum</strong> acts as a nicotine supplement and <strong>is better than a placebo</strong>. Any de-addiction requires motivation, and nicotine replacement might serve as a useful adjunct in motivated individuals.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Vaping or e-cigarettes have adverse effects</strong> on the cardiopulmonary system despite no smoke like conventional cigarettes. It consists of a battery-powered device, that converts a nicotine-containing liquid into vapor which the user inhales through the mouth, and exhales, just like a cigarette. It uses vapor instead of smoke, which is why it is referred to as vaping.</p>",

This patient's clinical picture of amenorrhea, short stature, webbed neck,&nbsp;low posterior hairline, widely spaced nipples, and lack of secondary sexual characteristics is seen in <strong>Turner's syndrome.</strong> Turner's syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality with partial or complete monosomy of the X chromosome (45+XO).</p>\n<p>In Turner's syndrome, <strong>gonadal dysgenesis</strong> causes primary ovarian failure that is <strong>hypogonadism</strong>. The levels of follicle-stimulating hormone<strong> (FSH), </strong>and luteinizing hormone <strong>(LH)&nbsp;</strong>are indicative of the cause of hypogonadism. Increased levels of FSH and LH as seen in this patient are indicative of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is defined as 1) a decrease or absence in ovarian function and 2) due to absent negative sex-steroid feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The pathophysiology in Turner's syndrome is<strong>&nbsp;</strong>primary hypergonadotropic hypogonadism where there is&nbsp;<strong>oocyte</strong>&nbsp;<strong>atresia</strong> and the replacement of ovaries by <strong>fibrous streaks.</strong> This causes a decrease in serum estrogen levels which by <strong>negative feedback</strong>&nbsp;causes a <strong>rise in g</strong>onadotropin-releasing hormone<strong> (GnRH), </strong><strong>FSH, </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>LH </strong>(gonadotropic hormones)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>as seen in this patient. <strong>Hypogonadism with</strong> a <strong>rise</strong> in <strong>gonadotropic hormones</strong> is known as <strong>hypergonadotropic hypogonadism</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option (B): <strong>Secondary hypergonadotropic hypogonadism</strong>&nbsp;patients also present with primary ovarian failure with increased levels of FSH and LH.

Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. On the passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.&nbsp;</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paresthesia:&nbsp;</strong>Paresthesia and hypoesthesia may be noted due to compression of nerves traversing the affected compartment. They are the first signs of nerve ischemia.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pallor: </strong>Pallor of the skin may not always be seen. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paralysis:</strong>&nbsp;Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a <strong>late sign</strong>.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pulselessness:&nbsp;</strong>Usually, the peripheral pulses and&nbsp;capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the <strong>intra-compartmental pressure</strong>&nbsp;using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as the&nbsp;differential pressure (&Delta;P). A&nbsp;<strong>differential pressure (&Delta;P)</strong> of <strong>less than&nbsp;30 mm Hg</strong> (4.00 kilopascals) is an <strong>indication</strong> for <strong>immediate compartment decompression</strong>.</p>\n<p>The threatened compartment must be promptly decompressed, merely splitting the plaster is not helpful and the limb must be <strong>kept flat.</strong>&nbsp;This is because elevating the limb causes a further decrease in end capillary pressure and aggravates muscle ischemia. In the case of compartment syndrome in the leg, <strong>fasciotomy </strong>should be performed. This involves&nbsp;opening all four compartments via medial and lateral incisions. Wounds to be left open and<strong> inspected 2 days</strong> later, if tissues are healthy, the wounds can be sutured.

Acute Compartment Syndrome</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Acute compartment syndrome is an elevation of the intracompartmental pressure (ICP) which increases the risk for tissue ischemia and necrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Fractures (70%) and severe soft tissue injuries (30%). Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. </p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. </p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>2.

It is commonly caused due to prolonged external compression of an extremity. </p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Crush injuries sustained during motor vehicle accidents, earthquakes, mining and other occupational accidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Underperfusion of muscle causes myonecrosis. When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",

Since a lower amount of carbohydrates are consumed and there is a continual demand for glucose, gluconeogenesis from amino acids occurs.

There is also an increased breakdown of fats that result in fatty acids, which get metabolized to ketone bodies. This metabolic state is referred to as 'nutritional ketosis.'

      "solution": "<p>The rationale behind the once-daily dosing is that the drug <strong>irreversibly inactivates</strong> the pump molecule.</p>\n<p>Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are <strong>prodrugs</strong> that are activated only after undergoing an acid-catalyzed cleavage in the canaliculi of the parietal cells of the stomach.</p>\n<p>On administration, they are absorbed in the proximal small bowel and eventually, block the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase enzyme, the \"proton pump\" in the parietal cells of the stomach. The <strong>secretion</strong> of<strong> protons</strong> by an activated <strong>H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase</strong> (proton pump) in the <strong>parietal cells</strong> into the gastric lumen is the <strong>final step</strong> involved in the production of<strong> gastric acid</strong> and inhibition of this enzyme prevents acid secretion into the stomach.</p>\n<p>Once PPIs irreversibly inactivate the H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, acid secretion resumes only after new pump molecules are synthesized and inserted into the luminal membrane. This leads to <strong>prolonged suppression of acid secretion</strong> for up to 24-48 hours, despite having a shorter plasma half-life of only 30 minutes to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>In most individuals, once-daily dosing is enough to achieve effective acid inhibition. If necessary, a second dose can be given before an evening meal.</p>\n<p>The number of H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump molecules increases after fasting and food decreases the oral bioavailability of the drug. Hence, PPIs are given around 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.</p>\n<p>PPIs <strong>cannot inhibit</strong> all gastric acid pumps with oral dosing because <strong>not all pumps are active</strong> during the short half-life of the PPI in the blood. </p>\n<p>PPIs cause maximum suppression of gastric acid. They reduce the daily production of <strong>both basal</strong> and <strong>stimulated acid secretion</strong> by 85–90%. <br /><br />There are available in the form of <strong>delayed-release</strong> tablets, capsules, and oral suspension packets and for immediate acid suppression, there are <strong>intravenous formulations</strong> for PPIs like lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole. Therefore, the <strong>release of the drug</strong> depends upon the drug <strong>formulation.</strong></p>",
