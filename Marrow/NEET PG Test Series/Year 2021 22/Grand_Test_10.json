      "solution": "<p>The most likely diagnosis is <strong>enchondroma</strong>.</p>\n<p>Enchondromas are intraosseous benign, lobulated tumours of hyaline cartilage. They are usually <strong>solitary</strong>, <strong>central</strong>, metaphyseal lesions of tubular bones, which usually affect the <strong>small bones </strong>of the<strong> hand</strong> and <strong>feet</strong> followed by the femur and humerus. Enchondromatous tumours typically begin and grow in childhood arising from rests of growth plate cartilage or chondrocytes that proliferate and enlarge, then stop growing but remain present throughout adulthood. Enchondromas can transform into chondrosarcoma. </p>\n<p>They are associated with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (<strong>IDH1</strong>) and 2 (<strong>IDH2</strong>) genes. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is an enzymatic component of the Krebs cycle which helps to convert isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate. Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 result in the alteration of the enzyme function and in increased levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG.). This elevation in D-2-HG results in inhibition of the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells; blocking osteogenic differentiation during the formation of the skeleton results in cartilaginous tumor formation.</p>\n<p><strong>Microscopically</strong>, enchondromas appear as grey-blue, translucent, hypocellular, non-vascular tumors with abundant hyaline cartilage. The nuclei of these cells are regular with few mitotic figures.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis of enchondromas requires histopathologic examination, which shows <strong>punctate calcifications</strong> of the chondroid matrix and is composed of well-circumscribed nodules of benign hyaline cartilage. The nuclei of the chondrocytes are small and uniformly round with condensed chromatin.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Osteosarcoma</strong> is the most common primary malignancy of bone that produces osteoid matrix or mineralized bone. It has a bimodal age distribution. It is typically seen in the metaphyseal<strong> </strong>regions of the distal femur and proximal tibia. RB mutations are common and there is also the inactivation of <strong>CDKN2A</strong>, a tumor suppressor gene in many cases.</p>\n<p>X-ray shows<strong> periosteal reaction </strong>and it may take the form of a <strong>Codman's triangle</strong> or it may have a <strong>sunburst (sunray) appearance </strong>as shown below.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ed7bb4b194074bf594b9538f1326a9eex720x765.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong><br /></strong>Option B:<strong> Ewing's sarcoma</strong> is the second most common primary malignancy of bone after osteosarcoma. It usually occurs at the younger age group and commonly involves the <strong>diaphysis</strong> of the long bones like the femur, tibia, fibula, and humerus. Most tumours have a balanced (11;22) (q24;q12) translocation generating in-frame fusion of the EWSRI gene on chromosome 22 to the FL1 gene on chromosome 11. </p>\n<p><strong>Onion-peel appearance</strong> due to deposition of periosteal reaction in layers is seen on radiology (as shown below) and Homer-Wright rosettes, which are round groupings of cells with a central fibrillary core may be seen histologically.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d044c62b7d2e4c44b5386632bd8e10f2x720x1363.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong><br /></strong>Option C<strong>: Osteoclastoma</strong> is also called a <strong>giant cell tumour</strong> because multinucleated osteoclast-type giant cells are present on histology. It exclusively affects adults and affects the epiphysis of long bones, commonly in the distal end of the <strong>femur </strong>followed by the proximal tibia. The neoplastic cells express high levels of <strong>RANKL</strong> which promotes the proliferation and differentiation of normal osteoclast precursors into osteoclasts.</p>\n<p>The image below shows an X-ray of a giant cell tumor showing an <strong>eccentrically</strong> located <strong>solitary</strong> lytic lesion in the <strong>epiphysis </strong>and the typical <strong>soap bubble appearance</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ad4a930d9d54475789620cc809f4e743x720x912.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Summary of Bone Tumors</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bone tumor</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Most common site</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Simple bone cyst</td>\n<td>Proximal Humeral Metaphysis</td>\n<td>&lt;20years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enchondroma</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hand bones</p>\n<p>(Metaphysis of small bones of hand)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;&amp;

Niacin can also result in <strong>hyperuricemia</strong> and may <strong>reactivate gout.</strong> Hence, a history of <strong>gout</strong> is a <strong>relative contraindication</strong> for niacin.</p>\n<p><strong>Niacin</strong> is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin and is the only vitamin that affects that lipid levels. Niacin acts by <strong>inhibiting</strong> the <strong>lipolysis</strong> of triglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase in the adipose tissue. Niacin reduces the free fatty acid transport to the liver and decreases triglyceride synthesis by inhibiting both the synthesis and esterification of fatty acids. There is also a <strong>reduction</strong> of <strong>very-low-density lipoprotein</strong> (VLDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by decreasing their productivity and enhancing their clearance. <strong>High-density</strong> lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are <strong>raised</strong> due to the decreased clearance of apo A-1 in HDL.</p>\n<p>The indications of niacin are <strong>hypertriglyceridemia</strong> and <strong>elevated LDL cholesterol.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>most common </strong>serious side effect of niacin is <strong>hepatotoxicity</strong>. Other adverse effects of niacin include <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, <strong>cutaneous</strong> <strong>flushing, and pruritus. </strong>Flushing and pruritus can be controlled<strong> </strong>with aspirin as they are prostaglandin mediated. Concurrent use of niacin with a statin can result in myopathy. Niacin is avoided in pregnant females as it resulted in birth defects in experimental animals.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Options A and B- <strong>Cholestyramine</strong> and <strong>colestipol</strong> are bile acid sequestrants. These are highly positively charged and bind to negatively charged bile acids resulting in their excretion in the stool. Hepatic cholesterol content reduces due to the increased bile acid synthesis. This increases the LDL receptors in the liver resulting in increased LDL cholesterol clearance. These agents are relatively safe but <strong>severe hypertriglyceridemia</strong> is a <strong>contraindication</strong> to its use as these agents increase the triglyceride levels.</p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>Clofibrate</strong> is a halogenated fibric acid derivative. Fibrates bind to PPAR-α and reduce triglycerides through PPAR-α mediated stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, increased lipoprotein lipase synthesis, and reduced expression of apo C-III. The adverse effects include rash, urticaria, hair loss, myalgias, fatigue, headache, and impotence. Clofibrate can result in myopathy and gall stone formation. Fibrates should not be used in children or pregnant women. <strong>Renal failure</strong> and <strong>hepatic dysfunction</strong> are <strong>relative contraindications</strong> to the use of fibrates.</p>",

It is also known as <strong>t</strong><strong>ic douloureux</strong>&nbsp;(a painful condition of the face).&nbsp;It is commonly seen in <strong>middle-aged</strong> and <strong>elderly women</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>large myelinated fibers</strong> of the trigeminal nerve carry<strong> tactile stimuli</strong> from the face and do not carry pain fibers themselves. In trigeminal neuralgia, due to <strong>compression</strong> or other pathologies, the large fibers undergo <strong>demyelination</strong>. These demyelinated large fibers become <strong>hyperexcitable</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>electrically coupled</strong> with the surrounding <strong>smaller unmyelinated pain fibers</strong>&nbsp;of the trigeminal nerve. This explains why <strong>tactile stimulation of trigger zones</strong> (lips, gums, cheek, or chin)&nbsp;<strong>leads to pain</strong> paroxysms. Symptoms occur due to ectopic generation of action potentials in pain-sensitive afferent fibers of the trigeminal nerve root just before entering the pons.</p>\n<p>The pain may occur spontaneously or after movements like <strong>chewing, speaking, smiling, </strong>washing the face, brushing teeth, or exposure to wind. On examination, the physician will <strong>not find</strong> any <strong>sensory loss over</strong> the area. The pain usually lasts for <strong>seconds</strong> or <strong>minutes</strong>.

This type of horizontal gene transfer may occur by two mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lytic cycle </strong>- In the lytic cycle, also known as the virulent cycle, a large number of progeny phages build up inside the host bacterium; eventually, the host cell ruptures, releasing the bacteriophages. Some of the bacteriophages will now contain bacterial DNA, which can then be transferred to other bacteria.</li>\n<li><strong>Lysogenic cycle </strong>- In the temperate or non-lytic cycle, the host bacterium is not lysed. Rather, the phage DNA becomes integrated with the bacterial chromosome. This phage DNA multiplies with the host cell and is transferred to daughter cells. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Conjugation</strong> is the method of gene transfer in bacteria that involves physical contact by a male or donor bacterium with a female or recipient bacterium through an extracellular protein extrusion or appendage called the <strong>sex pili.</strong> The genetic material that is transferred is usually derived from plasmids. The bacteria that possess the ability to form the sex pili contain the F<sup>+</sup> plasmid and are designated as F<sup>+</sup>. The F<sup>+</sup> bacteria can transfer a single strand of the F<sup>+</sup> plasmid DNA to F<sup>-</sup> bacteria via the sex pili. </p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Transformation</strong> is the direct uptake of naked DNA by the bacterial cell from the environment. Several bacteria such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Neisseria</em> undergo transformation. </p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Transposition</strong> is a process of gene transfer that involves special segments of DNA called transposons (jumping genes).</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1ff528084ce04586b400f1dc77721ff6x1117x517.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

Other SGLT-2 inhibitors include dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. They act by inhibiting the SGLT-2 transporter which is present on the proximal segment of the renal tubule and responsible for the reabsorption of 80-90% of filtered glucose. It inhibits glucose reabsorption resulting in glycosuria and change in the renal threshold. This results in a decrease in the blood glucose level. </p>\n<p>SGLT-2 inhibitors have a <strong>cardioprotective</strong> effect resulting from improved cardiac cell metabolism, improvement of ventricular loading mechanism, and reduction of cardiac cell necrosis and fibrosis. It also has a <strong>renoprotective</strong> property.</p>\n<p>The common side effects include <strong>urinary tract infections</strong> and<strong> genital mycotic infections</strong> due to the high glucose content of the urine. <strong>Fournier's gangrene</strong> is also one of the important adverse effects. There is a risk of the development of <strong>euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis</strong>. It increases the risk of fractures and lower limb amputations due to the creation of an imbalance with the minerals and circulating parathormone and vitamin D. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>Acarbose</strong> is an <strong>α-glucosidase inhibitor</strong> that inhibits the α-glucosidase enzyme in the brush border epithelium of the intestine and reduces the absorption of starch, dextrin, and disaccharides. The most important adverse effects are <strong>malabsorption</strong>, flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal bloating. <strong>Hypoglycemia</strong> can occur when it is given along with <strong>insulin</strong> or insulin secretagogues.</p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>Metformin</strong> belongs to the <strong>biguanide</strong> class of hypoglycemic drugs that activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduce hepatic glucose production. The most common adverse effects of metformin include anorexia, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, <strong>vitamin B12 deficiency,</strong> and <strong>lactic acidosis</strong>. Metformin should be used cautiously in renal failure patients.</p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Pioglitazone</strong> belongs to the<strong> thiazolidinediones</strong> class of hypoglycemic drugs that stimulate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) in muscle, fat, liver, and reduce insulin resistance. The most common adverse effects include <strong>weight gain</strong> and edema due to an increase in adiposity and fluid retention. They can increase the incidence of heart failure and the risk of fractures.

They have <strong>slow action</strong> and thus are not widely used.</li>\n<li><strong>Perchloron</strong> or <strong>high test hypochlorite (H.T.H.)</strong>: It is a <strong>calcium compound</strong> that has <strong>60 &ndash; 70% of available chlorine</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Break point chlorination:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The point at which the <strong>chlorine demand of water</strong>&nbsp;is met is called<strong>&nbsp;the breakpoint. </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Free chlorine</strong> (HOCl and OCl) appears when <strong>chlorine is added beyond the breakpoint</strong>.</li>\n<li>In other words, at the breakpoint, if chlorine is added, then <strong>all the combined chlorines</strong>&nbsp;would have been completely<strong>&nbsp;destroyed</strong> and <strong>free residual chlorines </strong>begin to&nbsp;<strong>appear</strong>.</li>\n<li>This corresponding dosage to achieve the appearance of free residual chlorine is called <strong>breakpoint dosage</strong> and this method is called <strong>breakpoint chlorination</strong>.</li>\n<li>It is also called <strong>controlled superchlorination</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Superchlorination </strong>followed by <strong>dechlorination </strong>is used to disinfect highly polluted waters whose quality fluctuates greatly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Orthotolidine (OT) test:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>It is a <strong>test for chlorination</strong> and determines <strong>free and combined chlorine</strong> in water, rapidly and accurately.</li>\n<li>The reagent used is <strong>analytical grade Orthotolidine</strong> dissolved in a 10% solution of hydrochloric acid.</li>\n<li>When added to water that contains chlorine, it turns <strong>yellow</strong> with varying intensity.

      "solution": "<p>The mainstay of treatment for this condition is <strong>small, frequent low carbohydrate meals</strong>.</p>\n<p>A 50-year-old female with symptoms of sweating, palpitations, colicky pain, and loose stools on consuming bulky foods after undergoing gastric bypass surgery for obesity is highly suggestive<strong> </strong>of<strong> dumping syndrome.</strong> Dietary manipulation with small, frequent low carbohydrate meals is the mainstay treatment.</p>\n<p>Dumping syndrome can be early or late.</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Early dumping syndrome</strong> is due to the high osmotic load that reaches the small bowel, leading to sequestration of fluid from the circulation into the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This shift induces autonomic responses. It is characterized by more GI and fewer cardiovascular effects. It appears to be secondary to the release of several humoral agents, such as serotonin, bradykinin-like substances, neurotensin, and entero- glucagon.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Late dumping syndrome</strong> is due to the high carbohydrate load in the small intestine, which causes an increase in insulin levels and secondary hypoglycemia. This hypoglycemia activates the adrenal gland to release catecholamines, which results in diaphoresis, tremulousness, light-headedness, tachycardia, and confusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dietary manipulation is the mainstay of treatment of early dumping syndrome. The patient is asked to consume small, dry, more frequent food with avoidance of carbohydrates.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Octreotide</strong>, a somatostatin analogue is used in <strong>intractable syndromes </strong>and is<strong> </strong>administered subcutaneously before meals. It not only inhibits gastric emptying but also affects small bowel motility. Hence, the intestinal transit of the ingested meal is prolonged.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Oral rehydration solution</strong> (ORS) is used for the supportive treatment of diarrhoea. The absorption of water and nutrients is dependent on the osmotic gradient created by sodium transport via neutral NaCl absorption, sodium absorption coupled to the absorption of organic solutes such as glucose and electrogenic sodium absorption. In diarrheal disease, disruption of these processes occurs except the absorption of sodium, coupled with glucose and other organic solutes. The preservation of this facilitated cotransporter is the scientific rationale for the development of the ORS.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Surgical treatment</strong> is considered when all other methods fail; available options include pyloric reconstruction or conversion to a Roux-en-y gastrojejunostomy.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Early Dumping vs. Late Dumping</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Early dumping</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Late dumping</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Incidence</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>5&ndash;10%</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>5%</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Relation to meals</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Almost immediate</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Second hour after meal</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Duration of attack</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>30&ndash;40 mins</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>30&ndash;40 mins</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Relief</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lying down</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Food</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Aggravated by</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>More food</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exercise</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Precipitating factor</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Carbohydrate-rich food</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Carbohydrate-rich food</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Major symptoms</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Epigastric fullness, sweating, light headedness, tachycardia, colic, sometimes diarrhoea</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tremor, faintness, prostration</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

The lump is papular with a raised pigmented area. The <strong>ulcers</strong> have often everted margins with fissured, cracked, and indurated surrounding skin. They<strong> usually bleed</strong> and cause offensive vulval discharge. The lesions are <strong>most commonly</strong> seen over the <strong>labia major</strong>.  <strong>HPV</strong> or HIV infection,<strong> diabetes</strong>, hypertension, and obesity are associated with vulval cancers. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The order of lymph node involvement in vulval cancer includes mainly the <strong>superficial inguinal lymph node,</strong> deep inguinal lymph node, and femoral group of lymph nodes.

On examination, a crusted lesion with irregular borders or a scaly, raw, vesicular, or ulcerated lesion that begins over the nipple and spreads to the surrounding areola is seen. This may be accompanied by a<strong> bloody discharge</strong>. Paget's disease is usually unilateral and nipple retraction is a rare finding but may occur with advanced disease.</p>\n<p>A bilateral breast examination should be performed. <strong>Nipple scrape cytology</strong> can accurately diagnose Paget's disease, but the diagnosis is usually established by a<strong> full-thickness wedge</strong> or <strong>punch biopsy</strong> of the nipple. </p>\n<p>The <strong>histologic hallmark</strong> of the disease is the presence of <strong>Paget cells</strong>. The cells are often large and the cytoplasm is pale to clear, and the nuclei are usually high-grade with prominent nucleoli. </p>\n<p id=\"H15\" class=\"headingAnchor\">Management is based on the stage of the tumor and prognostic factors. <strong>Simple mastectomy</strong> and <strong>breast-conserving treatment</strong> (BCT) are two of the most common procedures used in the surgical management of the tumour. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should also be done to look for axillary lymph node involvement.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Acute mastitis</strong> is usually seen in lactating women, with common etiological factors being inadequate milk sucking by the infant, milk expression causing stasis, and infection from the mouth of the infant. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly implicated organism. The affected breast or a segment of it shows the classical signs of acute inflammation which include redness, swelling, and pain. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Eczema</strong> of the nipples is a rare condition and is often bilateral. It occurs in the younger age group and is also associated with eczema elsewhere over the body. It frequently begins in the areola and may then involve the nipple while Paget's disease originates on the nipple and secondarily involves the areola.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Duct</strong> <strong>p</strong><strong>apillomas </strong>are polyploid lesions of epithelial-lined breast ducts. They are often located close to the areola, but when located close to the nipple, blood-stained nipple discharge can be present. They are not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
