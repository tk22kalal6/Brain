It&nbsp;is an irregular spiral with one or both&nbsp;ends pointed and is <strong>gram-negative.&nbsp;</strong>It is transmitted&nbsp;from person to person through body lice Pediculus&nbsp;humanus corporis.&nbsp;The incubation period is 2-10days after which fever occurs. Borreliae are abundant in the patient's blood during this period. Fever subsides in 3-5 days.&nbsp;After an afebrile period of&nbsp;4-10 days,&nbsp;another bout of fever sets in.&nbsp;The&nbsp;borreliae reappear in blood during the relapses of&nbsp;fever. The disease ultimately subsides after 3-10&nbsp;relapses.&nbsp;In lice, the borrelia is confined to the hemolymph and is not shed in saliva or excreta. So the <strong>infection is transmitted</strong> not by the bite of lice but by their<strong> being crushed</strong> and<strong> rubbed into abraded skin.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Endemic relapsing fever</strong> is caused by&nbsp;B.duttonii, B.hermsii, B.parkeri.&nbsp;Ornithodorus&nbsp;tholozoni,&nbsp;O.crossi, O.lahorensis, and the fowl tick, Argas persicus acts as vectors.&nbsp;The borrelia persists in the body of infected&nbsp;ticks throughout their life. It is transmitted transovarially&nbsp;so that the ticks act as reservoirs as well as&nbsp;vectors. It is&nbsp;transmitted to humans through the <strong>bite of ticks</strong> or&nbsp;their discharges.</p>\n<p>Borrelia is&nbsp;<strong>microaerophilic</strong> and the optimum temperature for&nbsp;growth is 28-30&deg;C.

The affected mothers are <strong>emotionally labile</strong> and the symptoms include changes in mood, <strong>sudden crying outbursts</strong>, and a <strong>lack </strong>of<strong> interest</strong> in the<strong> baby</strong>. They may also have insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and irritability.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These feelings have been ascribed to rapid changes in women's hormonal levels, the stress of childbirth, and the awareness of the increased responsibility that motherhood brings. This usually <strong>resolves spontaneously</strong> within <strong>10-14 days</strong>. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Management involves <strong>reassurance, education, </strong>and <strong>support.</strong> The patient must be followed-up and assessed for the possible development of a major depressive disorder.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option B: Symptoms should<strong> persist </strong>for<strong> &gt;2 weeks</strong> to make the diagnosis of <strong>post-partum depression.</strong> A <strong>minimum</strong> of <strong>5 symptoms</strong> of major depressive disorder i.e. impaired sleep, interest, guilt, energy, concentration, appetite, psychomotor activity, and suicidal ideation must be present. This patient is able to do her daily chores, enjoys watching TV, has a good appetite, and does not have guilt or suicidal ideation. Although this patient has disturbed sleep and fatigue, these are common physiological postpartum findings.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C:<strong> Post-partum psychosis</strong> is a <strong>psychiatric</strong> <strong>emergency</strong> and usually has a mean time of onset is <strong>2-3</strong> <strong>weeks postpartum</strong>. The predominant symptoms are <strong>hallucinations</strong>, <strong>delusions</strong>, <strong>suicidal</strong> <strong>thoughts</strong>, and<strong> thoughts</strong> of <strong>harming </strong>the <strong>baby</strong>. The onset of psychotic symptoms is usually preceded by signs such as insomnia, restlessness, labile mood, and agitation. <strong>Lithium</strong>, often in combina­tion with an <strong>antidepressant</strong>, is the treatment of choice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D: Episodes of <strong>delirium </strong>in the <strong>postpartum period</strong> are characterized by a <strong>fluctuating</strong> <strong>level</strong> of <strong>awareness</strong> or attention.

      "solution": "<p>The above scenario with the <strong>echocardiography</strong> showing a<strong>&nbsp;swinging heart&nbsp;</strong>is suggestive of <strong>pericardial </strong>effusion with<strong> tamponade</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The most appropriate immediate treatment is to perform a<strong>&nbsp;needle pericardiocentesis.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pericardiocentesis,</strong> also known as pericardial tap, can be performed with sub-xiphoid, parasternal, or apical approaches. The&nbsp;<strong>most common </strong>approach<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a&nbsp;<strong>sub-xiphoid approach</strong>&nbsp;under echocardiographic guidance.</p>\n<p>This patient has <strong>multiple rib fractures</strong> which likely have pierced the pericardium and/or the heart muscle. This leads to the accumulation of blood in the pericardial space. This space is <strong>non-distensible</strong> so fluid can compress the heart and impair contraction leading to <strong>decreased cardiac output</strong>. It also obstructs venous return which further reduces filling.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Cardiac tamponade</strong>&nbsp;is the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space. It will result in the obstruction of the blood flow into the ventricles.</p>\n<p>This manifests as&nbsp;<strong>Beck's triad,</strong> which consists of the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distended neck veins (due to decreased venous return)</li>\n<li>Muffled heart sounds (fluid accumulation in the pericardial space)</li>\n<li>Hypotension</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>chest wall movements</strong> will be <strong>normal</strong>. Echocardiography may show the swinging heart sign which suggests pericardial effusion with tamponade. An eFAST is reliable and will show fluid in the pericardial space. A chest X-ray will show an enlarged heart shadow.</p>\n<p>Cardiac tamponade can also be treated with open surgery procedures like <strong>sternotomy</strong> or <strong>left thoracotomy</strong>. This also allows for the heart to be repaired during the procedure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A: A <strong>pericardial window</strong> done via the <strong>subxiphoid</strong> or <strong>trans-diaphragmatic</strong> approach is the<strong> best</strong> way to diagnose and treat cardiac tamponade. It allows for drainage of blood and exploration of the area for the damage. It must be done under general anesthesia.&nbsp;This is the<strong> definitive management</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Chest tube insertion</strong> is used in massive <strong>hemothorax.</strong> Here, the accumulation of blood in the cavity severely restricts lung movements leading to inadequate ventilation. An appropriately placed chest tube can rapidly drain large amounts of blood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Analgesia</strong> is administered in cases of<strong> flail chest</strong>. This is because the pain from the rib fractures will further compromise respiratory movements. This patient's chest movements are normal. It is supplemented with oxygen administration and physiotherapy.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: JVP waveform and the abnormalities</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/18bbe4a977c84587903e8637a0d9303cx1280x1005.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>1) The <strong>a-wave</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial contraction</strong>.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prominent a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Pulmonary hypertension, right atrial thrombus/ mass, and tricuspid stenosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cannon a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Complete AV block, ventricular tachycardia, and premature atrial/ junctional/ ventricular beats</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Atrial fibrillation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) The <strong>c-wave</strong> corresponds to the <strong>bulging of tricuspid valve</strong> into right atrium during ventricular contraction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) The <strong>x-descent</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial relaxation</strong> during atrial diastole.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent x-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Severe tricuspid regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rapid x-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Cardiac tamponade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) The <strong>v-wave</strong> corresponds to the <strong>venous filling</strong> of right atrium.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dominant v-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Tricuspid regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5) The <strong>y-descent</strong> corresponds to the&nbsp;<strong>passive emptying of the right atrium</strong> into right ventricle.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prolonged y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Tricuspid stenosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rapid y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Constrictive pericarditis and isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Cardiac tamponade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This leads to the formation of<strong> urine </strong>with<strong> pH &gt; 5.5.</strong> The decreased H<sup>+</sup> secretion also leads to <strong>inadequate HCO<sup>3-</sup> regeneration</strong> in the alpha-intercalated cells thus leading to <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>. As <strong>H<sup>+</sup> </strong>is<strong> usually exchanged </strong>with<strong> K<sup>+</sup></strong> from the lumen in the DCT, <strong>decreased H<sup>+</sup> secretion</strong> is also associated with <strong>decreased K<sup>+</sup> absorption</strong>, resulting in <strong>hypokalemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Acidosis</strong> reduces net <strong>proximal fluid reabsorption</strong>, which leads to <strong>volume contraction</strong> and <strong>activation </strong>of the<strong> renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system</strong> (RAAS). This results in <strong>decreased proximal tubular Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption</strong> and increased distal delivery of Na<sup>+</sup> to the cortical collecting duct. These processes, along with increased aldosterone secretion, leading to increased K<sup>+</sup> secretion by activation of ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) channels in the collecting duct thus causing <strong>hypokalemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ammonium</strong> produced as a result of glutamine metabolism is <strong>secreted in the proximal tubule</strong>, which <strong>normally combines with H<sup>+</sup> ions</strong> secreted in the alpha-intercalated cells of the distal tubule to form NH4<sup>+</sup> ions. Since this process is impaired in RTA-1, the <strong>urine anion gap (UAG) is positive</strong> due to <strong>low urine NH4<sup>+ </sup>concentration</strong>.

Reactive oxygen species, prostaglandins, and platelet-activating factors are also increased. Activation of the complement pathway also occurs. The <strong>coagulation&nbsp;cascade</strong> is <strong>activated</strong> directly through <strong>factor XII</strong> and indirectly through altered endothelial function. Both&nbsp;hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressed states are triggered simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Endothelial activation and injury:</strong></p>\n<p>There is widespread<strong> vascular leakage</strong> and <strong>tissue edema</strong> as a result of the pro-inflammatory state and endothelial cell activation leading to the accumulation of protein-rich edema fluid throughout the body. <strong>Systemic</strong> <strong>hypotension</strong> is a direct consequence of vascular smooth muscle relaxation due to upregulation of NO, C3a, C5a, and PAF production.&nbsp;These changes cause a <strong>mismatch</strong> in <strong>oxygen</strong> needs and oxygen delivery.</p>\n<p><strong>Induction of a procoagulant state</strong>:</p>\n<p>Pro-inflammatory <strong>cytokines</strong> <strong>decrease</strong> the <strong>production</strong> of endothelial anticoagulant factors and decreases fibrinolysis. There is <strong>stasis</strong> of blood in small vessels and capillaries due to vascular leaks and tissue edema.

These include&nbsp;<strong>cytochrome c</strong>&nbsp;and some proteins that neutralize the endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis.</li>\n<li>The <strong>permeability</strong> of the mitochondria is controlled by the <strong>BCL-2</strong> family of proteins, which act as sensors.</li>\n<li>These sensors are activated when the cells are deprived of growth factors and other survival signals are exposed to agents that damage the DNA or accumulate a large number of misfolded proteins.</li>\n<li>These activated sensors,&nbsp;in turn, activate the&nbsp;<strong>proapoptotic molecules</strong>,&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>BAX</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>BAK</strong>, which form channels in the mitochondrial membrane, through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol and cause activation of&nbsp;<strong>caspase-9</strong>, which in turn leads to the activation of the caspase cascade and, eventually, apoptosis of the cell.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, if all the growth factors and other survival signals are present, then they produce more&nbsp;<strong>antiapoptotic</strong>&nbsp;<strong>members</strong>&nbsp;of the BH1-4 family like the&nbsp;<strong>BCL2, MCL 1,</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>BCL</strong>-<strong>XL</strong>. These proteins limit the escape of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The death-receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death receptors are surface molecules that are members of the<strong>&nbsp;tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family</strong>&nbsp;like the&nbsp;<strong>TNF 1</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Fas (CD 95).</strong></li>\n<li>These receptors are expressed on the surface of many cells and can trigger apoptosis. In the cytoplasmic region, these receptors have a death domain.</li>\n<li><strong>Fas ligand (FasL)</strong>&nbsp;is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T-lymphocytes. <strong>Fas-FasL</strong> interactions are required for thymic medullary negative selection. Defective interactions also cause <strong>autoimmune</strong> <strong>lymphoproliferative</strong> <strong>syndrome</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When these T-cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL, their cytoplasmic death domains form a binding site for an adaptor protein called&nbsp;Fas-associated death domain (<strong>FADD</strong>).</li>\n<li>These,&nbsp;in turn, recruit and activate&nbsp;<strong>caspase-8 and -10</strong>.</li>\n<li>In many cell types, caspase-8 and -10 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called&nbsp;<strong>Bid</strong>, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway.</li>\n<li>The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell.</li>\n<li>Cellular proteins, notably, a caspase antagonist called&nbsp;<strong>FLIP</strong>, block the activation of caspases downstream of the death receptors. Interestingly, some viruses produce homologs of FLIP, and it is suggested that this is a mechanism that viruses use to keep infected cells alive.</li>\n<li>The death receptor pathway is involved in the&nbsp;elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes and in the killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following image shows a diagrammatic representation of the mechanisms of apoptosis:&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/730eb17d957846f2a1b7f8d9082d02f8x1280x2420.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Apoptotic genes</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Group</td>\n<td>Members</td>\n<td>Details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anti-apoptotlc</td>\n<td>BCL2,<br />BCL-XL<br /><br />MCL1</td>\n<td>Present in outer mitochondrial&nbsp;membrane<br />Prevent leakage of cytochrome-c and<br />other death lnducing proteins into<br />cytosol.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pro-apoptotlc</td>\n<td>BAX,<br />BAK</td>\n<td>On activation, they increase&nbsp;mitochondrial membrane permeability.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stress Sensors</td>\n<td>BAD,<br />BIM,<br />BID,<br />Puma, Noxa</td>\n<td>Act as sensors of cellular stress and&nbsp;damage and regulate the balance<br />between the other two groups</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

It occurs due to infection with <strong>parainfluenza</strong> <strong>viruses</strong> <strong>commonly</strong>, but it may also be caused by influenza viruses type A or B, respiratory syncytial virus, or rhinovirus. Children aged <strong>6 months to 3 years</strong> are commonly affected. Infection results in subglottic and tracheal swelling causing stridor and other signs of respiratory obstruction.</p>\n<p>In infants and young children, the upper and lower airways are small, prone to occlusion by secretions, and susceptible to edema and swelling. As a result, the resistance to laminar airflow increases in inverse proportion to the fourth power of the radius (<strong>Poiseuille's law</strong>). Therefore, a small decrease in the radius of the airway results in a marked increase in resistance to airflow and the work of breathing. Children are more reliant on the diaphragm for inspiration, due to the relative immaturity of the intercostal muscles and accessory muscles.</p>\n<p>Treatment includes <strong>humidification </strong>of<strong> respiratory gases, oxygen, steroids, </strong>and<strong> nebulized epinephrine</strong>.&nbsp;Steroids reduce symptoms and improve croup scores 6&ndash;24 h after initial dosing, thereby reducing the need for intubation or shortening the time to extubation.</p>\n<p>Severe respiratory obstruction, as indicated by a persistently high croup score of &gt;7, despite ongoing medical treatment, is an indication for tracheal intubation.

Radiographically, they appear as large, intraosseous, osteolytic tumors with irregular, granular calcifications, giving a <strong>honeycomb </strong>or <strong>popcorn </strong>appearance. CT and MRI are useful in the diagnosis. Chondrosarcoma is <strong>resistant</strong> to both <strong>chemotherapy and radiation</strong>. Surgical excision is the only treatment.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Ewing sarcoma</strong> is related to <strong>neuroectodermal tumors</strong> and arises from the mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow. The characteristic translocation involved is <strong><em>t(11:22). </em></strong>The tumor<strong> </strong>usually develops between 10 and 20 years of age and is usually located in the diaphysis of the long bones (<strong>femur-most common</strong>). Pain is followed by swelling and a low-grade fever. On radiography, a periosteal reaction with an '<strong>onion peel'</strong> appearance is seen.

The narcotic form is characterized by giddiness, muscle tenderness, coma, and death.</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Strychnine</strong>(spinal poison)&nbsp;consumption is responsible for&nbsp;<strong>opisthotonus</strong>, <strong>emprosthotonus</strong>, and <strong>pleurosthotonus</strong>. These symptoms occur due to convulsions and muscle rigidity caused by action on the spinal reflex centres. <strong>Risus sardonicus</strong>, where the jaws and facial muscles are contracted and drawn back, may also occur.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Aconite</strong>(cardiac poison), if swallowed, causes tingling and numbness of the mouth, tongue, and pharynx.

Hence,&nbsp;<strong>immediate compartment decompression/ fasciotomy&nbsp;</strong>is indicated.</p>\n<p>All the dressings, bandages, and cast on the affected limb are removed and the limb is&nbsp;<strong>nursed flat</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fasciotomy wounds are left open. After 2 days, if there is necrosis, debridement is done. If the wounds are healthy, they can be sutured without tension. Alternatively, skin grafting can be done.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Acute Compartment and Crush Syndromes</h3><p><strong>1. Acute Compartment Syndrome</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Acute compartment syndrome is an elevation of the intracompartmental pressure (ICP) which increases the risk for tissue ischemia and necrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Fractures (70%) and severe soft tissue injuries (30%). Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. </p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. </p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Crush Syndrome </strong></p>\n<p>Crush syndrome is the systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis. It is commonly caused due to prolonged external compression of an extremity. </p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Crush injuries sustained during motor vehicle accidents, earthquakes, mining and other occupational accidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Underperfusion of muscle causes myonecrosis. When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",

Vascular signs are less common but the presence of <strong>unilateral Raynauds phenomenon</strong> should raise suspicion of thoracic outlet syndrome.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tests for thoracic outlet syndrome are provocative maneuvers that are performed to reproduce the signs and symptoms of this condition.</p>\n<p>These provocative tests are not sensitive nor specific to making a diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome.</p>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<p>Conservative management consists of shoulder muscle strengthening, postural training, and analgesics for pain.</p>\n<p>Surgical management is indicated if there is severe pain, obvious muscle wasting, or presence of vascular disturbances.

      "solution": "<p>The <strong>growth velocity</strong> expected in an 8-year-old child is <strong>6 cms/ year</strong>. The given scenario suggests that the child is suffering from pathological short stature, as he has grown only by 4 cms over the last two years. </p>\n<p>Height velocity is the rate of increase in height over a period of time. It is normal in physiological short stature. The average height velocity is 25 cms/ year in the first year and will be 75 cms tall at 1 year. At 2 years, the height is 90 cms and at 4 years, the child is 100 cm. After this, the child gains about 6cms every year until 12 years. If height velocity is lower than expected for age (as in this scenario), the child is likely to be suffering from a pathological cause of short stature.</p>\n<p>Short stature</p>\n<p>It is defined as the height below the third centile or less than two standard deviations (&lt;-2SD) in a given population. Short stature may be <strong>physiological or pathological.</strong> Physiological short stature may be<strong> familial</strong> or <strong>constitutional.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pathological short stature</strong> can be attributed to nutritional causes and systemic illnesses like congenital heat diseases, cystic fibrosis, asthma. </p>\n<p> </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Short stature: Familial vs Constitutional</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Feature</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Constitutional Delay</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Familial Short Stature</strong> &nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Height</td>\n<td>Short</td>\n<td>Short</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Final Height</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Normal</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Short &nbsp;</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Family history</td>\n<td>Delayed puberty</td>\n<td>Short stature &nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bone age</td>\n<td>Less than chronological age</td>\n<td>Normal &nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Puberty</td>\n<td>Delayed</td>\n<td>Normal &nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Height velocity</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
