Re-evaluation should be done after birth and in cases presenting with <strong>symptoms of recurrent UTI, palpable flank mass or pain, urinary obstruction, and in cases of failure to thrive</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the hydronephrosis is persistent, its <strong>severity</strong> is <strong>graded</strong> by the extent of the dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system and parenchymal thickness. It needs to be ascertained whether the other kidney is involved, the lower ureter is dilated, the bladder wall is thickened, and whether emptying of the bladder is incomplete. Based on these findings, a diagnosis can be made.</p>\n<p>In cases of hydronephrosis, <strong>long-standing urine stasis</strong> and pressure may <strong>damage the kidney</strong>s.</p>\n<p>The causes of UPJ obstruction are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intrinsic (due to an adynamic or stenotic segment of the proximal ureter) or&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Extrinsic (e.g. compression by accessory renal arteries).

In other cases, <strong>serial follow-up with ultrasonography</strong> is done to assess the spontaneous resolution of hydronephrosis.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Vesicoureteral reflux</strong> is the <strong>second most common</strong> cause of hydronephrosis after UPJ obstruction.&nbsp;In vesicoureteric reflux, the&nbsp;valve that prevents the backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter is defective;&nbsp;hence, abnormal <strong>backflow of urine</strong> occurs <strong>from</strong> the&nbsp;<strong>bladder</strong> into the <strong>ureter</strong>. It may also present with hydronephrosis; however, the distal ureter is also involved, unlike in this case.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Ureterocele</strong> is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, thought to result from the persistence of the membrane between the ureteral bud and urogenital sinus. Since the distal urinary tract is normal-looking in this case, this diagnosis is unlikely.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Posterior urethral valve</strong> is an <strong>obstructing membrane</strong> in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in-utero&nbsp;development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. As a result, bilateral hydronephrosis and bladder dilatation is seen, unlike the unilateral involvement in this case.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of Hydronephrosis</h3><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1306\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1306\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Unilateral hydronephrosis</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Extramural obstruction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tumor from adjacent structures, e.g., cervix, prostate, rectum, colon, or cecum</li>\n<li>Retrocaval ureter</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Aberrant renal vessels</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond&rsquo;s disease)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Intramural obstruction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Congenital PUJ obstruction</strong> - most common congenital cause</li>\n<li>Congenital stenosis</li>\n<li>Ureterocele</li>\n<li>Ureteric stricture - iatrogenic/ inflammatory</li>\n<li>Neoplasm of the ureter or bladder involving the ureteric orifice</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Intraluminal obstruction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Renal stones</strong> - most common acquired unilateral cause</li>\n<li>Sloughed papilla in papillary necrosis (especially, in patients with diabetes, analgesic abuse, or sickle cell disease)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><strong><span><span>Bilateral hydronephrosis</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Congenital</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span>Posterior urethral valves (associated with pulmonary hypoplasia)</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Urethral atresia</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>PUJ obstruction</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Acquired &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Benign prostatic hypertrophy or carcinoma of the prostate</li>\n<li>Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis <span><span>(Ormond's disease)</span></span></li>\n<li>Postoperative bladder neck scarring</li>\n<li>Urethral stricture</li>\n<li>Phimosis</li>\n</ul>",

As he&nbsp;mentions being in a homosexual relationship, the possibility of&nbsp;<strong>anoreceptive</strong> intercourse is considered. This clinical scenario along with the image indicates infection with <strong><em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Proctitis</strong> is a presentation of gonorrheal infection in patients who practice <strong>anoreceptive</strong> intercourse. It is a common manifestation in homosexual male partners. Women may also develop proctitis due to autoinoculation from cervical discharge or&nbsp;anoreceptive intercourse. The symptoms include <strong>mucopurulent discharge, pain on defecation, constipation, and tenesmus.</strong>&nbsp;The disruption of anorectal epithelial integrity, together with the local recruitment of HIV-target cell types (dendritic cells and CCR5/CD4+ T cells) predisposes the patient to a higher risk of developing <strong>HIV</strong> infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Gonorrhea</strong> is a sexually transmitted disease caused by&nbsp;<strong>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</strong>. It uses pilli in adhesion to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces. The cocci penetrate the intracellular spaces to reach the subepithelial tissue by the third day of infection. The incubation period is 2-8 days.</p>\n<p>The major symptoms include&nbsp;<strong>urethral discharge</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>dysuria</strong>, usually without urinary frequency or urgency. The specific symptoms seen in males and females are as follows:</p>\n<p>In males :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acute urethritis:</strong> This infection may extend along the urethra to involve the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis.</li>\n<li><strong>Genital discharge:</strong> It is mucopurulent that can be described as that resembling 'flow of seed' (semen).</li>\n<li><strong>Strictures:</strong> <strong>Chronic urethritis</strong>&nbsp;may lead to&nbsp;stricture&nbsp;formation.</li>\n<li><strong>Water-can perineum:</strong> The infection may spread to the periurethral tissues causing abscesses and multiple discharging sinuses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In females:</p>\n<p>About half the female patients remain asymptomatic.&nbsp;The patients typically present with urethritis, cervical&nbsp;discharge, pruritus, dysuria, and intermenstrual bleeding.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>ectocervix</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>vagina</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;not usually affected in&nbsp;<strong>adults</strong>&nbsp;as the&nbsp;<strong>stratified squamous epithelium is resistant</strong>&nbsp;to infection by the cocci. The&nbsp;<strong>acidic pH</strong>&nbsp;of vaginal secretions is also protective.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>principal sites</strong>&nbsp;of invasion for&nbsp;<strong>gonococcal infection</strong>&nbsp;are the&nbsp;<strong>columnar</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>transitional epithelium</strong>.</p>\n<p>The initial infection involves the&nbsp;<strong>cervix&nbsp;uteri</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>urethra</strong>&nbsp;which&nbsp;may extend to&nbsp;<strong>Bartholin glands, skene glands</strong>, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. Unilateral pain and swelling over the labia may be caused by the inflammation of the&nbsp;Bartholin glands.</p>\n<p><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>salpingitis</strong>&nbsp;may lead to&nbsp;<strong>sterility.</strong>&nbsp;Other complications are <strong>tubo-ovarian abscesses</strong> and <strong>ectopic pregnancies</strong>. Rarely peritonitis may develop with perihepatic inflammation&nbsp;<strong>(Fitz Hugh Curtis syndrome).</strong>&nbsp;The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness with abnormal liver function tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Lab diagnosis:</strong></p>\n<p>The discharge is collected and subjected to Gram's stain which reveals&nbsp;<strong>gram‐negative intracellular diplococci</strong>&nbsp;within phagocytes.&nbsp;<strong>Stuart's</strong>&nbsp;transport medium is used. Cultures can be obtained from&nbsp;<strong>chocolate agar</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Mueller-Hinton agar</strong>.&nbsp;Specifically,&nbsp;<strong>Thayer-Martin agar</strong>&nbsp;is used to isolate&nbsp;<em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae.</em></p>\n<p>Treatment</p>\n<p>According to&nbsp;<strong>CDC guidelines (2021)</strong>, treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weight &lt;150 kg &ndash; Ceftriaxone 500 mg intramuscular (IM) in a single dose</li>\n<li>Weight &ge;150 kg &ndash; Ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscular (IM) in a single dose</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The doses of ceftriaxone are higher than the previous guidelines as the gonococcal&nbsp;<strong>minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are rising worldwide</strong>. BASHH (British Association for Sexual Health and HIV) in the United Kingdom also recommends higher doses of ceftriaxone&nbsp;of about 500 mg or 1g along with&nbsp;<strong>azithromycin</strong>&nbsp;because it would result in fewer failures.</p>\n<p>Concurrent&nbsp;<strong>chlamydial</strong>&nbsp;infection must also be treated unless it has been excluded by&nbsp;<strong>molecular testing</strong>. First-line drugs used are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oral&nbsp;<strong>azithromycin</strong>&nbsp;<strong>1g</strong>&nbsp;single dose</li>\n<li>Oral&nbsp;<strong>doxycycline</strong>&nbsp;<strong>100 mg BD</strong>&nbsp;for 7 days (non-pregnant patients only)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The third-generation cephalosporins are contraindicated in patients with a history of&nbsp;IgE-mediated penicillin allergy. The treatment includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gemifloxacin</strong>&nbsp;320mg oral + Azithromycin 2g oral</li>\n<li><strong>Gentamicin</strong>&nbsp;240mg (IM)+ Azithromycin 2g oral</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sexual partners of the patient must be treated to reduce the risk of recurrence.&nbsp;<strong>Expedited partner therapy</strong>&nbsp;refers to the index patient delivering therapy to one's own partners.

The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (<strong>There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

The <strong>late distal tubule and collecting duct</strong> are <strong>similar</strong> anatomically and functionally.</p>\n<p>In the<strong> proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)</strong>, sodium, water, and chloride are mainly reabsorbed here along with <strong>glucose</strong>, <strong>amino acids</strong>, and other solutes. The total solute concentration or&nbsp;<strong>osmolarity remains the same</strong> all along the proximal tubule due to the high permeability to water.</p>\n<p>The <strong>thin descending limb</strong>&nbsp;of the <strong>loop of Henle</strong> is <strong>permeable to water</strong>, <strong>urea</strong>, and sodium. The tubular fluid becomes <strong>hypertonic&nbsp;</strong>in this segment. The <strong>thick ascending limb&nbsp;</strong>reabsorbs Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;by a <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;co-transporter</strong>. <strong>Some of the K<sup>+</sup></strong> that is reabsorbed <strong>leaks back</strong> into the lumen, creating a potential difference with more positivity in the lumen. This <strong>lumen positivity</strong> is responsible for the <strong>absorption of divalent ions like Ca<sup>+2&nbsp;</sup>and Mg<sup>+2</sup></strong>. The thick ascending limb is virtually<strong> impermeable to water.&nbsp;</strong>Since some of the solutes are reabsorbed and water is not reabsorbed, it <strong>dilutes</strong> <strong>the tubular fluid</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Early distal convoluted tubule (DCT)</strong> reabsorbs Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> by the <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter</strong>. This segment is also <strong>impermeable to water</strong>. Because of the relative solute reabsorption, there is <strong>dilution</strong> <strong>of the tubular fluid</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>late distal tubule</strong> and <strong>collecting duct</strong> have <strong>two kinds of cells</strong> as mentioned above. <strong>Principal cells</strong> <strong>reabsorb Na<sup>+</sup> and secrete K<sup>+</sup></strong> into the lumen. The Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption is through <strong>epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channels (ENaC)</strong>. The expression of ENaC is mediated by <strong>aldosterone</strong> and thus increases whenever there is activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

The amount of blood loss necessary for the hematocrit to fall to 30% can be calculated as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Estimate blood volume</li>\n<li>Estimate the red blood cell volume (RBCV) at the preoperative hematocrit (RBCV preop).</li>\n<li>Estimate RBCV at a hematocrit of 30% (RBCV 30%), assuming normal blood volume is maintained.</li>\n<li>Calculate the RBCV lost when the hematocrit is 30%; RBCV lost = RBCV preop &ndash; RBCV 30%</li>\n<li>Allowable blood loss = RBCV lost x3.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Blood Volume</strong></p>\n<p>Neonates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Premature 95 mL/kg</li>\n<li>Full-term 85 mL/kg</li>\n<li>Infants 80 mL/kg</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adults:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Men 75 mL/kg</li>\n<li>Women 65 mL/kg</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Estimated blood volume = 65 mL/kg x 75 kg = 4875 mL.</p>\n<p>RBCV 35% = 4875 x 35% = 1706 mL.</p>\n<p>RBCV 30% = 4875 x 30% = 1462 mL.</p>\n<p>Red cell loss at 30% = 1706-1462 = 244 mL.</p>\n<p>Allowable blood loss = 3 x 244 mL = 732 ~ 750ml</p>\n<p>Therefore, transfusion should be considered only when this patient&rsquo;s blood loss exceeds 750 ml.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, transfusions are not recommended until the hematocrit decreases to 24% or lower (hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL), but it is necessary to take into account the rate of blood loss and comorbid conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "solution": "<p>In the given scenario, the patient has bradycardia, hypotension, and warm peripheries, which are suggestive of<strong> neurogenic shock.&nbsp;</strong>The GCS score in this patient is E<sub>2</sub>V<sub>3</sub>M<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;= 9.<sub>&nbsp;</sub>Since only one pupil is reactive to light, one point is deduced and the <strong>GCS-P score is 8.</strong></p>\n<p>Neurogenic shock is the result of autonomic dysregulation following&nbsp;spinal cord injury, usually secondary to trauma. This&nbsp;dysregulation is due to a <strong>loss of sympathetic tone</strong> and an <strong>unopposed parasympathetic response</strong>.&nbsp;The descending sympathetic tracts are disrupted leading to direct damage to the axons and neural membranes in the intermediolateral nucleus, lateral grey mater, and anterior root leading to disrupted sympathetic tone.</p>\n<p>Other causes of neurogenic shock include spinal anesthesia, Guillain-Barre syndrome, toxins affecting the autonomic system, transverse myelitis, neuropathies, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Due to the diminished sympathetic activity, there is bradycardia and vasodilation of the cutaneous vessels leading to warm peripheries. This leads to the pooling of blood in the lower extremities, thereby reducing venous return. As a result, a decrease in JVP, cardiac output, and systolic blood pressure are seen. <strong>Bradycardia with hypotension</strong> is the characteristic feature of neurogenic shock.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As he is likely to have sustained neck injury from the RTA, stabilizing it by placing a <strong>collar</strong> is the first step before checking for airways or circulation&nbsp;due to suspected cervical spinal cord injury.&nbsp;Miami J or Philadelphia collar is commonly used.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Initial management aims at hemodynamic stabilization. i.v. boluses are relatively avoided in neurogenic shock due to the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Revised guidelines state&nbsp;<strong>1 liter</strong> of i.v. crystalloids can be given if there is concomitant hypotension. However, the physiologic effects of this shock are not reversed with fluid resuscitation alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus, <strong>vasopressors like noradrenaline</strong>&nbsp;can be given&nbsp;to increase cardiac output and systolic blood pressure. It acts on both alpha-2 G-coupled receptors causing vasoconstriction and beta1 receptors resulting in increased heart rate. <strong>Glucocorticoids</strong> like <strong>methylprednisolone</strong> are proven to help if given within 8 hours from the injury.

Commonly used dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, cabergoline, and quinagolide.</p>\n<p>Dopamine agonists <strong>reduce serum prolactin concentration</strong> and cause a significant reduction in the tumor size after several months of therapy. If the patient has any <strong>visual defects</strong> due to tumor suppression effects, they tend to i<strong>mprove within a few days</strong> after the administration of dopamine agonists.</p>\n<p>Prolonged use of <strong>ergot-derived dopamine agonists</strong> such as <strong>bromocriptine</strong> and <strong>cabergoline</strong> may cause fibrotic reactions in the heart due to interaction with 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors. These effects are mostly seen in patients with <strong>Parkinson's disease.</strong> Hence, if prolonged treatment is required, then non-ergot agents such as <strong>quinagolide</strong> are indicated.</p>\n<p>In patients who achieve normoprolactinemia and significant reduction of the tumor mass, the dopamine agonist can be withdrawn after two years of therapy.</p>\n<p>Note that surgical decompression is usually necessary only when a macroprolactinoma does not respond adequately to dopamine agonist therapy.</p>",
