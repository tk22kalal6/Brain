It is&nbsp;a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that causes<strong>&nbsp;<em>C.&nbsp;</em><em>difficile</em> infection</strong>&nbsp;after ingestion of spores of the organism. The more severe form of this condition is known as <strong>pseudomembranous colitis</strong> (PMC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PMC is most commonly associated with&nbsp;<strong>prolonged antimicrobial use</strong>,&nbsp;which interferes with the commensal colonic microflora. The most commonly implicated antibiotics are&nbsp;cephalosporins,&nbsp;ampicillin, and <strong>clindamycin.</strong> The spores are spread by contact with the&nbsp;<strong>feces</strong>&nbsp;of affected individuals or asymptomatic carriers. can persist on surfaces for months. Risk factors include&nbsp;<strong>poor hand hygiene</strong>, old age, and gastrointestinal surgery.</p>\n<p>The pseudomembranes appear as small whitish-yellow plaques initially, which later coalesce to involve the entire colon wall.

They include AV node reentry, AV reentry via an accessory pathway, and atrial tachycardia. AVNRT is the most commonly seen pattern of PSVT in healthy adults, especially in women. This form of PSVT is due to the re-entry of the electrical impulse from the AV node to the right atrium via either of the 2 pathways (superior fast pathway and inferior slow pathway).</p>\n<p>The given ECG strip shows changes suggestive of <strong>AV node reentry tachycardia</strong> based on the following findings-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Narrow QRS complex</strong> tachycardia (green arrows) at 150 bpm - indicative of a regular atrial rate (<strong>1:1 AV response</strong>). Heart rate is calculated by dividing 300 by the number of large boxes between 2 consecutive R waves. The ECG strip shows the presence of roughly 2 large boxes between 2 consecutive R waves, thereby making the HR ~150 bpm.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>No visible P waves</strong> - indicative of dual conduction pathways (slow and fast) that cause simultaneous atrial and ventricular activation.</li>\n<li>The P wave may sometimes be seen at the end of the QRS complex as a <strong>pseudo-r' wave (V1)</strong>&nbsp;(black arrow) and <strong>pseudo-S wave (II, III, aVF)&nbsp;</strong>(blue arrows).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1124ef0817754554a5b835c82e1377d2x1280x644.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><div class=\"O0\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"O0\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"O0\">Treatment - Since AVNRT depends on the functionality of the AV node, administering&nbsp;<strong>adenosine&nbsp;</strong>terminates most cases of tachycardia. This drug transiently blocks AV conduction by activating acetylcholine-sensitive K+ current in the atria, SAN, and AV nodes. These changes lead to a short action potential duration, hyperpolarization of the nodal tissues, and slowing of automaticity.</div>\n<div class=\"O0\">Intravenous verapamil or diltiazem can be used alternatively in patients who cannot tolerate adenosine.</div>\n<div class=\"O0\">&nbsp;</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/73866a11df3b4cba923658ca97b6c962x510x812.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "<p>Reflex responsible for the above scenario is the <strong>Bezold Jarisch reflex.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Activation of <strong>chemosensitive vagal C fibres</strong> in the cardiopulmonary region (eg, juxtacapillary region of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary artery) causes profound <strong>bradycardia</strong>, <strong>hypotension</strong>, and a brief period of <strong>apnea</strong> followed by <strong>rapid shallow breathing</strong>. This is called the Bezold Jarisch reflex and can be elicited by&nbsp;capsaicin, serotonin, phenylbiguanide, and veratridine. It can also be activated during myocardial infarction and on exposure to radioactive dyes during coronary angiography.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option A- C fibre endings close to the pulmonary vessels are called <strong>J (juxtacapillary) receptors</strong>. These receptors are stimulated by hyperinflation of the lungs or intravenous administration of capsaicin. The reflex produced is apnea followed by rapid breathing, bradycardia and hypotension. This is called the <strong>J reflex.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option B-<strong> Cushing reflex</strong> is the <strong>increased blood pressure</strong> and <strong>bradycardia</strong> seen in patients with raised intracranial pressure. Increased intracranial pressure compresses the cerebral blood vessels and causes <strong>hypercapnia</strong>. This stimulates the central chemoreceptors located in the ventrolateral surface of the medulla and causes increased blood pressure. This increase is proportional to the increase in the intracranial pressure. Increased blood pressure stimulates baroreceptors and causes bradycardia.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C- <strong>Brainbridge reflex</strong> is the <strong>increase</strong> in the <strong>heart rate</strong> when the atrium is <strong>stretched. </strong>Whenever there is a stretch of the atrium, the stretch receptors are activated. They transmit their afferent signals through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain. Efferent signals are then transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase the heart rate and strength of heart contraction. This reflex prevents the accumulation of blood in the atria, veins and pulmonary circulation.</p>",

It can be <strong>performed </strong>in a patient with <strong>cervical injury</strong> but caution must be followed <strong>to not hyperextend the neck</strong>.</p>\n<p>The sequence of BLS is <strong>circulation</strong> (chest compression), <strong>airway</strong>, and then <strong>breathing</strong> as per the AHA 2020 guidelines.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7339e1fa13354a7aafc600098c9b06afx1024x768.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: In a <strong>head-tilt chin-lift</strong> one hand (palm) is placed on the <strong>patient’s forehead</strong> applying pressure to <strong>tilt the head back</strong>. Simultaneously, the <strong>chin</strong> is <strong>lifted</strong> with the <strong>forefinger</strong> and <strong>middle finger</strong> of the opposite hand. This lifts the tongue from the back of the throat. Head-tilt chin-lift<strong> </strong>should<strong> </strong>not be performed in a patient with suspected cervical injury. The process is demonstrated in the GIF below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/3ffe39d3208e4135ab914887307e7d76x720x709.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C: There is no maneuver named head-extension in emergency airway management according to the BLS algorithm.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Manual inline stabilization</strong> is a maneuver that <strong>limits external head</strong> and <strong>neck movement</strong> in patients with cervical spine injuries.

Methotrexate&rsquo;s principal mechanism of action relates to the inhibition of amino-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase and&nbsp;<strong>dihydrofolate reductase(DHFR</strong>).</p>\n<p>AICAR accumulates intracellularly, and competitively inhibits AMP deaminase, leading to an <strong>accumulation of AMP</strong>.&nbsp;The AMP is released and converted extracellularly to <strong>adenosine, </strong>which is a <strong>potent inhibitor of inflammation</strong>. As a result, the inflammatory functions of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes are suppressed.</p>\n<p>Methotrexate belongs to the&nbsp;<strong>antimetabolite</strong>&nbsp;class of anticancer drugs. The antifolate action of the drug is responsible for its anti-cancer properties.</p>\n<p>Mechanism of action:</p>\n<p>It is a folic acid analogue and binds to the active catalytic site of&nbsp;<strong>dihydrofolate reductase(DHFR</strong>). This would inhibit the formation of&nbsp;<strong>tetrahydrofolate(THF)</strong>&nbsp;which is needed for purine nucleotides, thymidylate, and the amino acids serine and methionine. This would interfere with the production of DNA, RNA, and important cellular proteins.</p>\n<p><strong>Low doses</strong>&nbsp;of methotrexate are used in the management of&nbsp;<strong>rheumatic diseases.&nbsp;</strong>It is due to the inhibition of&nbsp;amino-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (<strong>AICAR</strong>) transformylase and thymidylate synthetase. This results in increased levels of adenosine that inhibits inflammation.</p>\n<p>Adverse effects:</p>\n<p>Common side effects are nausea and&nbsp;<strong>mucosal ulcers.</strong>&nbsp;Others include anaemia, leukopenia, stomatitis, GI ulcerations, and alopecia.

Thallium single photon emission computed tomography is useful in differentiating cerebral toxoplasmosis from cerebral lymphoma. Primary CNS lymphoma is rarer than cerebral toxoplasmosis in HIV infection. Generally, patients with multiple ring-enhancing lesions on the CT scan with mass effect are treated empirically for toxoplasma infection for two weeks with a combination of pyrimethamine and sulphadiazine. Failure of a radiological response (on CT scan) is an indication for brain biopsy to enable an alternative diagnosis such as lymphoma.</p>",

A macular-papular recovery rash appears 3&ndash;5 days after the onset of fever, and it usually starts on the trunk before spreading peripherally.

Aspirin/ NSAIDS like Ibuprofen should be avoided as they can cause gastritis, vomiting, acidosis, platelet dysfunction and severe bleeding.

Dose: 0.4-2 mg IV (It may be repeated every 10-15 minutes up to a maximum dose of 10 mg).</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Flumazenil</strong> is the<strong> antidote to treat benzodiazepine (BZD)</strong> intoxication. Benzodiazepines (alprazolam, flunitrazepam) are sedative-hypnotics and symptoms of intoxication include normal vital signs, sedation, diplopia, ataxia, slurred speech, and impaired motor function. Flumazenil acts as a competitive antagonist at the site of BZD action, which is the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor. </p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Physostigmine </strong>is used in the <strong>treatment of anticholinergic toxicity due to atropine</strong>. Atropine is the anticholinergic active principle derived from tropane alkaloids such as Datura stramonium and Atropa belladonna. Toxidrome consists of features such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, agitation, delirium, mydriasis, dry flushed skin, and urinary retention. Physostigmine is a reversible acetylcholine esterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine concentrations in the synaptic cleft to mitigate the effects of atropine toxicity. </p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Atropine</strong> is used in the<strong> treatment of cholinergic toxicity due to organophosphates (DDT, parathion, malathion)</strong>. Symptoms of cholinergic toxicity include bradycardia, respiratory depression, and autonomic symptoms of salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation. Atropine used in association with pralidoxime act as competitive inhibitors at the nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to neutralize the toxicity.</p>",
