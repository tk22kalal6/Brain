      "solution": "<p>The given X-ray and the history of falls on the outstretched hands suggest the diagnosis of <strong>scaphoid fracture.</strong> <strong>Herbert screw</strong> is commonly used to treat this fracture.</p>\n<p>Herbert screw is a <strong>cannulated variable pitch</strong> screw, which is used to fix <strong>unstable or displaced</strong> fractures of small articular bones such as the scaphoid. This screw helps in quick healing by <strong>providing compression</strong> at the fracture site and early return to normal activities. The advantage of cannulated screws is that we <strong>can use </strong>a<strong> guidewire </strong>under videofluoroscopy to assist in the <strong>accurate placement</strong> of the screw during surgery.</p>\n<p>Scaphoid fractures occur most commonly after a <strong>fall</strong> on an <strong>outstretched hand.</strong> The <strong>waist</strong> of the scaphoid is the <strong>most common site</strong> of fracture. Initial x-rays are done in anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views. Even if the x-rays appear normal, if there is clinical suspicion, a glass holding cast should be applied for 2 weeks followed by repeat imaging.</p>\n<p>Management depends upon the type of fracture. If the scaphoid <strong>tubercle</strong> is fractured, the patient is given a <strong>glass-holding cast</strong> for <strong>4-6 weeks</strong>. In case of <strong>undisplaced waist fractures</strong>, most people will recover with a <strong>cast</strong> in place for <strong>6-8 weeks</strong>. Percutaneous screw fixation with the <strong>Herbert screw</strong> can be offered to those with <strong>displaced or undisplaced</strong> fractures of the waist when the patient does not want to undergo prolonged cast immobilization, or if they wish to return to work/daily activities sooner. Reducing and fixing displaced fractures also <strong>reduces</strong> the <strong>risk </strong>of <strong>non-union</strong>.</p>\n<p>The most common complications include <strong>nonunion,</strong> <strong>avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) </strong>of the <strong>proximal </strong>fracture <strong>segment, </strong>and <strong>osteoarthritis. </strong></p>\n<p>Herbert screw is shown below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f984677a257341a88825c039a7cd068ex1280x1223.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Cannulated cancellous screws</strong> are commonly used to treat fractures of the <strong>neck of </strong>the <strong>femur.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: The <strong>interference screw </strong>is a biodegradable screw used during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This screw is made of polymers that increase its strength so as to improve cortical bone formation at the site as well as to ensure that the tibial tunnel is not too wide during the insertion of the newly reconstructed ligament.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Pedicle screws</strong> are used in spinal fusion surgery to provide added strength and support. They are placed<strong> </strong>above and below the <strong>vertebrae</strong> that were <strong>fused</strong>. Rods are used to connect the <strong>screws, </strong>which prevent their movement and allow the <strong>bone</strong> to heal. They are also used in the correction of scoliosis.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Plaster casts and their uses:</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp; <strong>Name of cast</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Usage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Minerva cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Cervical and upper thoracic spine disease</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Risser&rsquo;s cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Scoliosis&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Turn-buckle cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Scoliosis&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Shoulder spica</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Shoulder immobilization&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>U-slab/hanging cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture of the humerus&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Hip spica</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture of the femur</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Patellar tendon bearing cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture of tibia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Colle&rsquo;s cast (handshaking)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture lower end radius</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Bachelor cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Developmental Dysplasia of Hip</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Glass holding cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture scaphoid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Burkhalter cast</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Metacarpal or phalangeal fractures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>James slab</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>Metacarpal and phalangeal fracture&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2ddfb024ce794679a717efd532820487x1280x4597.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Common X-Ray views</h3><p><strong>Schuller's view:</strong> Mastoid and temporal bone&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Open mouth view:</strong> Odontoid</p>\n<p><strong>Waters' view:</strong>&nbsp;Paranasal sinuses</p>\n<p><strong>Swimmers view:</strong> Cervicothoracic junction</p>\n<p><strong>Stryker notch view:</strong> Hillsach's lesion</p>\n<p><strong>West point axillary view</strong>: Bankart's lesion&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Zanca view:</strong> Acromioclavicular joint</p>\n<p><strong>Oblique view:</strong> Scaphoid</p>\n<p><strong>Judet view:</strong> Acetabulum</p>\n<p><strong>Shenton's arch:</strong> Pelvis</p>\n<p><strong>Von Rosen view</strong>: Developmental dysplasia of hip</p>\n<p><strong>Skyline view:</strong> Patella</p>\n<p><strong>Mortise view:</strong> talus&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broden's view: </strong>Subtalar joint</p>\n<p><strong>Kite's view:</strong> CTEV</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</h3><p>It is a rare but severe complication of certain fractures when the blood supply to a segment of bone is affected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Common sites of AVN are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head of the femur in fracture neck of femur and posterior dislocation of the hip</li>\n<li>Body of talus in a fracture through the neck of talus</li>\n<li>Proximal pole of the scaphoid in a fracture through the waist of the scaphoid</li>\n<li>Head of the humerus</li>\n<li>The capitulum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Non-traumatic causes of AVN are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Idiopathic</li>\n<li>Steroids</li>\n<li>Sickle cell disease</li>\n<li>Caisson's disease</li>\n<li>Gaucher's disease</li>\n<li>Lupus Erythematosus</li>\n<li>Radiation therapy</li>\n<li>Alcoholism</li>\n<li>Hyperlipidemia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important signs related to avascular necrosis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Crescent sign</strong>- Seen in osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

When light strikes the photoreceptors, <strong>retinal</strong> is chemically <strong>transformed</strong> in a process called <strong>photoisomerization,</strong> which begins the transduction process.</p>\n<p>Visual pigments are a type of <strong>G</strong>-<strong>protein</strong>-<strong>coupled</strong> <strong>receptors</strong>. The receptor protein, known as <strong>opsin</strong>, is locked in its inactive state by <strong>11</strong>-<strong>cis</strong> <strong>retinal.</strong> <strong>Isomerization</strong> and <strong>photo</strong>-<strong>excitation</strong> result in the activation of G-protein and the production of <strong>cyclic</strong> <strong>GMP</strong>. <strong>Transducin</strong> serves as the <strong>G</strong>-<strong>protein</strong> specifically within the retina.   The nerve impulse that is produced in the retina is then conveyed to the <strong>visual</strong> <strong>centres</strong> in the brain. The signal is ended through the process of <strong>phosphorylation</strong>, specifically targeting a <strong>serine</strong> <strong>residue</strong> on the <strong>activated</strong> <strong>rhodopsin</strong>. This <strong>phosphorylation</strong> is carried out by an enzyme called <strong>rhodopsin</strong> <strong>kinase</strong>. The purpose of this phosphorylation is to allow the <strong>inhibitory</strong> <strong>protein</strong> <strong>beta</strong>-<strong>arrestin</strong> to <strong>connect</strong> to the <strong>rhodopsin</strong> and <strong>deactivate</strong> it.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2af7ed5d414149fb8a564120c482a583x635x600.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>The <strong>phos­phorylation</strong> of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol(PI) produces polyphosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2).</p>\n<p>The degradation of PIP2 by <strong>phospholipase</strong> <strong>C</strong> occurs in response to the binding of a variety of neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors to receptors on the cell membrane.

It works by decreasing the production of cerebrospinal fluid, which helps to reduce intracranial pressure. </p>\n<p>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension refers to a rise in intracranial pressure in the absence of a structural lesion or hydrocephalus. There is an association with <strong>obesity, female gender, pregnancy</strong>, and drugs such as <strong>tetracycline, vitamin A/retinoid </strong>derivatives. Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension typically present with a generalized <strong>headache that is present on waking up </strong>in the morning and improves as the day goes by. Transient visual obscurations are frequent during severe headache episodes. Elevated intracranial pressure can also cause<strong> VI cranial nerve palsy</strong>, causing diplopia. On examination, papilledema is seen. If <strong>accompanied by appropriate history, papilledema is considered the diagnostic sign</strong> of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. </p>\n<p>The initial evaluation of patients suspected of elevated CSF pressure is done with an <strong>MRI</strong>, including an MR angiogram. Measurement of <strong>CSF pressure</strong> using <strong>lumbar puncture</strong> can also be done.<strong> High opening pressure and improvement</strong> in the headache following CSF removal are considered diagnostic if papilledema is absent. CT of the head is often normal, but may show empty sella in some patients. Initial treatment is with <strong>diet and lifestyle</strong> modifications targeted at achieving the ideal BMI. The first-line pharmacotherapy is with<strong> Acetazolamide</strong>. If ineffective, Topiramate is the next drug of choice. Patients in whom chronic papilledema is threatening vision, optic nerve sheath fenestration, or lumbo-peritoneal shunt may be considered. Acetazolamide can cause side effects such as <strong>paresthesias</strong>, dysgeusia, and kidney stones.</p>\n<p>Option A: Furosemide is a loop diuretic that is not effective for treating IIH.</p>\n<p>Option B: Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can be used to temporarily reduce intracranial pressure. However, it is not as effective as acetazolamide for long-term treatment of IIH.</p>\n<p>Option D: Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used for migraine prophylaxis, and is ineffective for IIH.</p>",

This reduction in the heart rate <strong>decreases the myocardial oxygen demand.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The oxygen requirement of the heart mainly depends on the work done by the heart. This work mainly depends on cardiac output and peripheral resistance. An increase in these parameters will increase the oxygen requirement of the heart.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Important determinants of cardiac output are:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Stroke volume</strong>- It is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat. This stroke volume increases whenever, there is <strong>increased venous</strong> return to the heart, increased end-diastolic volume (<strong>preload</strong>), and increased contractility. Contractility further depends on the <strong>initial length</strong> of the cardiac muscle fiber and the <strong>autonomic innervation.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Heart rate</strong>- Increased heart rate increases the cardiac output which in turn increases the oxygen requirement. Heart rate&nbsp;is controlled primarily by the autonomic nerves, with sympathetic stimulation increasing the rate and parasympathetic stimulation decreasing the rate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Afterload-</strong> The tension at which the load is lifted is called afterload. As the afterload increases, the heart has to work more in order to pump blood to the organs. This in turn results in increased oxygen requirement. It is dependent on the <strong>peripheral resistance.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Drugs used in the management of angina either decrease the work done by the heart or increases the blood flow to the heart.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Nitrates</strong>- They increase the cGMP and cause venodilation. It mainly results in an increase in venous capacitance and a decrease in the ventricular preload. They might also increase coronary flow in some areas and in variant anginas.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong>- Blocking the calcium channels leads to the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles and decreased impulses in the conduction system. This leads to decreased peripheral resistance,&nbsp;decreased blood pressure, decreased contractility, decreased heart rate, and decreased oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Beta-blockers</strong>- They decrease the oxygen requirement by decreasing the&nbsp;heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility.

It reduces diastolic tension, cardiac contractility, and work.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Trimetazidine</strong>- inhibits the fatty acid oxidation in the myocardium.

Potential <strong>chronic complications</strong> of this condition include <strong>functional asplenia</strong>, <strong>cholelithiasis</strong>, <strong>pulmonary hypertension</strong>, and <strong>neurocognitive decline</strong>.</p>\n<p>Sickle cell anemia is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder that occurs due to the <strong>point mutation</strong> in the <strong>β-globin gene</strong>, which replaces glutamate residue with valine. This results in the production of <strong>hemoglobin S (HbS)</strong>. In the <strong>deoxygenated</strong> state, HbS molecules interact with each other, forming <strong>rigid polymers</strong> that give the RBC its characteristic <strong>“sickled” shape</strong>. Intravascular sickling results in <strong>obstruction of blood flow</strong>.

These include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Functional asplenia</strong> - Chronic <strong>splenic infarcts</strong> result in most children with sickle cell anemia having complete <strong>functional asplenia</strong> by <strong>5 years of age</strong>. This places them at risk of infection and death, particularly from <strong>encapsulated bacteria</strong> such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b, and <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Cholelithiasis</strong> - Chronic <strong>hemolytic disease</strong> predisposes to the development of gallstones. These are <strong>black pigment gallstones</strong> composed of <strong>calcium bilirubinate</strong> and glycoprotein matrix.</li>\n<li><strong>Pulmonary hypertension</strong> - The exact pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension in children with sickle cell anemia is unknown. However, plausible explanation includes a combination of chronic <strong>thromboembolism</strong> and <strong>hypoxia</strong>.

Children with sickle cell disease are at greater risk for <strong>academic failure</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>Flooding is not a part of systematic desensitization.</p>\n<p><strong>Systematic desensitization&nbsp;</strong>is based on the behavioral principle of <strong>counterconditioning</strong> and was developed by Joseph Wolpe. Counterconditioning involves a <strong>gradual approach</strong> to a <strong>feared situation</strong>, in a psychophysiological state that inhibits anxiety, to overcome the maladaptive anxiety elicited by that situation. It works best in cases of a clearly identifiable anxiety-provoking stimulus. It has been successfully used in the treatment of phobias, obsessions, compulsions, and certain sexual disorders.</p>\n<p>It consists of three steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Relaxation training</strong> - Patients attain a state of complete relaxation and are then exposed to the stimulus that elicits the anxiety response. Relaxation methods like <strong>yoga</strong>, <strong>progressive relaxation</strong>, <strong>hypnosis</strong>, and <strong>mental imagery</strong> can be used. The physiological changes during the relaxation process; slow heart rate, increased peripheral blood flow, and neuromuscular stability; are opposite to that of the adrenergic response invoked during anxiety. The relaxed state inhibits the negative reaction of anxiety associated with the phobia and this is known as <strong>reciprocal inhibition</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Hierarchy construction&nbsp;</strong>- The therapist determines all the conditions that elicit anxiety and the patients prepare a <strong>graded list or hierarchy</strong> of 10-12 fear-provoking scenes in the order of increasing anxiety.</li>\n<li><strong>Desensitization of the stimulus&nbsp;</strong>- Patients proceed systematically through the list from the least to the most anxiety-provoking scene while in a deeply relaxed state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Flooding</strong>&nbsp;involves repeated and prolonged exposure to fear cues of high intensity<strong>&nbsp;without</strong>&nbsp;a<strong>&nbsp;hierarchy</strong>. It is based on the premise that anxiety gets reinforced by conditioning when the patient escapes from the anxiety-provoking situation. Patients are encouraged to face the feared situations directly and are prevented from escaping. There is <strong>no gradual build-up</strong> or use of relaxation techniques.</p>\n<p>Phobia refers to&nbsp;<strong>excessive fear</strong>&nbsp;of a specific circumstance, situation, or object. A&nbsp;<strong>specific phobia</strong>&nbsp;is a strong and per&shy;sisting fear of a particular situation or an object.&nbsp;<strong>Exposure</strong>&nbsp;or<strong>&nbsp;anticipation</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>contact</strong>&nbsp;with the situation/object triggers an&nbsp;<strong>anxiety reaction</strong>. This inadvertently leads to&nbsp;<strong>panic attacks</strong> in people who are susceptible. The person goes to great lengths to avoid this situation or object. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5th edition (DSM-5), &nbsp;phobias are classified under&nbsp;<strong>Anxiety disorders</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Behavior therapy</strong> is considered the <strong>most effective</strong> treatment for phobias. Systemic desensitization is the most common behavior therapy used for phobias. Other modes of treatment of phobias include insight-oriented psychotherapy, virtual therapy, hypnosis, and family therapy.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Anxiety disorders</h3><div>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Disorder&nbsp;</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Feature</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Panic disorder</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>1.

      "solution": "<p>The electrolyte abnormalities, CHF in the context of anorexia are suspicious for <strong>refeeding syndrome</strong>: a metabolic complication that can occur in patients who are severely malnourished and are <strong>rapidly reintroduced to nutrition</strong>. This occurs due to <strong>increased insulin secretion</strong> from acute carbohydrate introduction.</p>\n<p>This is due to a <strong>shift from catabolism to anabolism</strong>, which leads to a number of metabolic changes. One of these changes is increased insulin secretion. This increase in insulin promotes glycogenesis, protein synthesis and also activates the sodium-potassium ATPase symporter, leading to <strong>movement of potassium into the cell</strong>s Magnesium and phosphate are also taken up similarly, which can lead to <strong>hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia</strong>. Additionally, insulin can<strong> inhibit the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate</strong>, which can lead to <strong>hypophosphatemia - the hallmark of refeeding syndrome. </strong><strong>Hyperglycemia</strong> is seen due to the <strong>acutely increased</strong> body <strong>insulin</strong> production <strong>not</strong> being <strong>able</strong> to <strong>keep up</strong> with the <strong>rapidly increasing blood sugar</strong> levels. </p>\n<p>Refeeding syndrome is a fatal condition that can occur with rapid and excessive feeding of patients with severe underlying malnutrition which may be due to: <strong>Starvation, Alcoholism, Delayed nutritional support, Anorexia nervosa</strong>, Massive weight loss in obese patients<br /><br />These electrolyte disorders can result in<strong> myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, respiratory dysfunction, liver dysfunction, seizures, confusion, coma, tetany, and death.</strong></p>\n<p>Prevention of refeeding involves correction of <strong>fluid and electrolyte imbalance</strong>, administering <strong>thiamine</strong> and increasing calorie intake <strong>gradually.</strong></p>\n<p>Options A, B and C: The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the metabolic changes that lead to refeeding syndrome. Decreased aldosterone secretion can lead to hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia. While increased cortisol secretion can potentiate the hyperglycemia in refeeding syndrome, it does not affect the transport of phosphate in the cells nor does it impair magnesium metabolism. Decreased thyroid hormone secretion can lead to weight gain, not weight loss.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7df2897f35cc4684b76f52c34c9763a6x628x1246.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "<p>This patient with a diagnosis of complete molar pregnancy and transvaginal ultrasonography showing the presence of multiple <strong>theca</strong> <strong>lutein</strong> <strong>cysts</strong> in the left ovary can be <strong>managed</strong> with just <strong>suction</strong> and <strong>curettage</strong>. <strong>Theca</strong> <strong>lutein</strong> cysts, usually <strong>regress</strong> <strong>spontaneously</strong> in a period of 2 to 4 months <strong>following</strong> <strong>evacuation</strong> of a molar pregnancy, hence can be <strong>managed expectantly</strong>. <strong>Sometimes</strong>,  it can undergo <strong>torsion</strong> and cause marked <strong>pelvic</strong> <strong>pain</strong>. In such instances, <strong>laparoscopic</strong> <strong>untwisting</strong> of such cysts has to be done.  </p>\n<p>Irrespective of the size of the uterus, <strong>suction curettage</strong> is typically the <strong>preferred</strong> <strong>method</strong> for molar evacuation. If the cervix is <strong>minimally</strong> <strong>dilated</strong>, it is advisable to perform <strong>preoperative</strong> <strong>cervical</strong> <strong>dilation</strong> using an <strong>osmotic</strong> <strong>dilator</strong>. The amount of bleeding during surgery can be higher in cases of molar pregnancy compared to a uterus of similar size that contains nonmolar products. Having large moles necessitates the use of appropriate anesthetic, sufficient intravenous access, and availability of blood-banking services. To perform a molar evacuation, the<strong> cervix is mechanically dilated</strong> to facilitate the insertion of a large <strong>Karman</strong> <strong>suction</strong> <strong>cannula</strong>. A normal diameter of <strong>10 to 14 mm</strong> is common, depending on the size of the uterus. <strong>Oxytocin</strong> is used during the <strong>evacuation</strong> process to <strong>minimize</strong> <strong>hemorrhage</strong>. <strong>Intraoperative</strong> <strong>sonography</strong> is frequently advised to guarantee thorough evacuation of the uterine cavity and <strong>reduce</strong> the <strong>risk</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>perforation</strong>. When the <strong>myometrium</strong> has <strong>contracted,</strong> a meticulous yet delicate <strong>curettage</strong> can be performed with a sharp large-loop <strong>Sims</strong> <strong>curette</strong>. The bleeding persists despite the removal of the uterus and the administration of oxytocin. In such cases, further <strong>uterotonic</strong> drugs <strong>are</strong> administered.

Ovarian cysts including mucous cystadenomas and dermoid cysts have the highest risks of undergoing torsion. Adnexal masses measuring &gt;6 cm in diameter have the highest rates of torsion.</p>\n<p>A patient with torsion presents with <strong>sharp lower abdominal pain</strong>, usually localized to the involved side with radiation to the flank, groin, or thigh. <strong>Nausea and vomiting</strong> are commonly associated. Adnexal necrosis may cause a <strong>low-grade fever</strong>. </p>\n<p>During torsion, the low-pressure veins are initially compressed by the twisting pedicle. This leads to continuous inflow with decreased outflow causing <strong>stromal edema and congestion</strong>. The increasing stromal swelling later compresses the arteries causing ischemia and necrosis.</p>\n<p>On USG, the ovary appears enlarged, globular, and has a heterogenous appearance compared to the contralateral ovary due to edema, engorgement, and hemorrhage. Twisting of the vascular pedicle may give rise to a '<strong>whirlpool sign</strong>', a round hyperechoic structure with concentric hypoechoic stripes. <strong>Colour Doppler</strong> sonography should be performed in suspected torsion as it may show <strong>disruption to blood flow,</strong> which is highly suggestive of torsion. However, some cases of incomplete torsion or chronic torsion, may not show decreased flow on Doppler. MRI or CT imaging can be used in patients with normal Doppler but with characteristic signs and symptoms of torsion, to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Management involves <strong>urgent laparotomy or laparoscopic evaluation.</strong> Salvage of the involved adnexa with the removal of any associated cyst/tumor and possible oophoropexy are the goals. However, necrosis of the adnexa necessitates the removal of the adnexal structures.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: In a woman of reproductive age group, ovulatory pain following the rupture of Graafian follicle (ovulation) may present similarly with lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. This patient has a regular 28-day cycle and should have ovulated around the 14<sup>th</sup> day. </p>\n<p>Option B: Tubo-ovarian abscess presents with a more indolent course, and may be associated with fever. The characteristic appearance on USG is of a complex, multilocular mass. </p>\n<p>Option C: Ectopic pregnancy presents with nausea, vomiting, and adnexal pain, with or without a mass. However, this patient has a negative UPT, and serum β-HCG level is in the non-pregnant range (&lt; 2 mIU/L) excluding ectopic pregnancy.</p>",

Each such episode should last for at least <strong>10 seconds, resulting in ≥ 3% drop in oxygen saturation</strong> or a brain cortical arousal. OSA is diagnosed by overnight<strong> polysomnogram</strong> (PSG). This includes measurement of breathing, oxygenation, body position, cardiac rhythm, sleep stages, and snoring intensity.

It is secreted by the <strong>type II alveolar epithelial cells</strong>. It contains&nbsp;phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol, and fatty acids. <strong>Phosphatidylcholine</strong> is the major phospholipid. Other phospholipids are&nbsp;phosphatidylglycerol,&nbsp;phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine. <strong>Ceramide</strong> is<strong> not</strong> a major component of surfactants. Important proteins are surfactant protein (SP)- A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The important function is to <strong>reduce the surface tension</strong> of the alveoli. The pressure required for the expansion of alveoli is directly proportional to the surface tension present over the alveolar sacs.

Therefore, the baby has to put more effort to expand the lungs. This results in respiratory distress and hypoxemia.&nbsp;Ischemic damage to the alveoli causes the transudation of proteins into the alveoli that form the <strong>hyaline membrane<span class=\"s1\">.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It usually occurs in the first few hours of life.
