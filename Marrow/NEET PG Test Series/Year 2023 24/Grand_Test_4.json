      "solution": "<p><strong>Poor feeding</strong>, <strong>convulsions</strong>, and characteristic<strong> boxing-bicycling</strong> movements with a <strong>positive dinitrophenylhydrazine test</strong> point to the diagnosis of <strong>Maple syrup urine disease</strong> (<strong>MSUD</strong>). The peculiar <strong>burnt sugar odor</strong> of urine is characteristic of this disease.</p>\n<p>Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are the 3 essential amino acids, which are branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Their decarboxylation is accomplished by <strong>branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase</strong>&nbsp;<strong>complex</strong> (BCKDH) using <strong>thiamine</strong> (vitamin B1) pyrophosphate as a <strong>coenzyme</strong>. MSUD is an&nbsp;<strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder that occurs due to a <strong>deficiency</strong> of <strong>BCKDH</strong>. This impairs the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids&nbsp;<strong>valine</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>leucine</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>isoleucine,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>alloisoleucine</strong>.&nbsp;These amino acids, particularly&nbsp;<strong>leucine</strong> and their corresponding &alpha;-keto acids accumulate in the blood, causing toxic effects on the brain. The patient excretes these ketoacids in the urine which will be positive for the <strong>dinitrophenylhydrazine test</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Leucine</strong> is now metabolized by BCAA aminotransferase to<strong> &alpha;-ketoisocaproic acid</strong>, which leads to the disrupted metabolism of neurotransmitters and amino acids (glutamate, GABA, glutamine, alanine, and aspartate). &alpha;-Ketoisocaproic acid can reversibly inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and result in <strong>cerebral lactic acidosis</strong>. It may clinically manifest as <strong>encephalopathy</strong> and <strong>brain edema</strong> known as<strong> leucinosis</strong>. The disease presents as <strong>poor feeding</strong> and <strong>vomiting</strong> on the first few days of life and may progress to lethargy and coma. Examination reveals periods of <strong>hypertonicity</strong> that <strong>alternate</strong> with bouts of <strong>flaccidity</strong>. This appears as repetitive <strong>boxing</strong> and <strong>bicycling movements</strong> of the extremities. Convulsions occur in most infants.</p>\n<p>Treatment options include <strong>restricting dietary</strong> substances and supplementing with <strong>thiamine</strong> for milder forms. <strong>Hemodialysis</strong> is considered in critically ill cases.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Phenylketonuria</strong> (PKU) results from a deficiency of the enzyme <strong>phenylalanine hydroxylase</strong>. It manifests as a progressive <strong>intellectual disability</strong>.&nbsp;Patients with PKU have a <strong>musty or mousy odor</strong> due to phenylacetic acid accumulation and a <strong>positive dinitrophenylhydrazine test</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Hawkinsinuria&nbsp;</strong>is an&nbsp;<strong>autosomal-dominant</strong> condition due to a deficiency of the enzyme <strong>4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase</strong>&nbsp;which&nbsp;catalyzes the reaction of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisic acid in the tyrosine catabolism pathway. It leads to the accumulation of the metabolite <strong>hawkinsin</strong>. Most of the patients present during the weaning period with features of persistent <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong> and <strong>failure to thrive</strong>. The&nbsp;<strong>swimming pool odor&nbsp;</strong>of the urine is characteristic of this condition.</p>\n<p>Option D: &nbsp;<strong>Type I tyrosinemia</strong>&nbsp;is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme&nbsp;<strong>fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase</strong>. Children present with&nbsp;mild mental retardation,&nbsp;<strong>liver failure</strong>, and <strong>hypoglycemia</strong>. Urine typically has a&nbsp;<strong>boiled cabbage</strong>&nbsp;odor.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Maple syrup urine disease(MSUD)</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/431a47e4c13446e19249e1e6d5459e66x1280x1324.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

      "solution": "<p>Gadolinium can cause <strong>nephrogenic systemic fibrosis</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis</strong> is a systemic condition that primarily <strong>affects </strong>the skin of <strong>patients with renal impairment</strong>. Increased numbers of fibrocytes result in <strong>skin thickening </strong>and plaque formation which evolves to cause <strong>flexion contractures, paraesthesia, and pruritus. </strong>As a result, gadolinium-containing contrast is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in patients with <strong>GFR under 30 ml/min</strong></p>\n<p>Recent research has also demonstrated radiologically and pathologically detected <strong>gadolinium deposition in brain tissue </strong>including the dentate nuclei, pons, globus pallidus, and thalamus in patients who have undergone multiple MRI scans using gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). The <strong>clinical significance</strong> of this deposition is as yet <strong>unknown. </strong><strong>Gadolinium</strong> is the contrast agent used for <strong>MRI. </strong>It acts by reducing both the T1/T2 relaxation time of the tissue. The predominant effect is on T1, so post-contrast is a<strong> T1-weighted image.</strong> Since gadolinium ion is toxic <strong>Gd-DTPA</strong> is used.</p>\n<p><strong>Other options</strong></p>\n<p>Ditrazoate, Ioxaglate, and Iohexol are <strong>iodinated contrast agents</strong>. <strong>Ditrazoate</strong> is a <strong>high-osmolality</strong> contrast agent, <strong>Ioxaglate </strong>is an <strong>iso-osmolality</strong> contrast agent and <strong>Iohexol</strong> is a <strong>low-osmolality</strong> contrast agent.</p>\n<p>They increase the risk of <strong>Contrast-induced nephropathy(CIN)</strong>. Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria for AKI be applied for the diagnosis of CIN. AKI is diagnosed if <strong>any one of the following</strong> criteria is met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Absolute <strong>serum creatinine increase &gt;0.3 mg/dL in 48 hours</strong></li>\n<li><strong>&gt;50%</strong> increase in serum creatinine in 7 days</li>\n<li><strong>Urine output decreased</strong> to &lt;0.5 mL/kg/h for at least 6 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hence <strong>alternative imaging methods</strong>, without iodinated contrast media, should be chosen in patients with considerably impaired renal function <strong>(CKD 4 or 5)</strong>. In patients with<strong> moderate renal impairment</strong> (<strong>CKD 3</strong>) <strong>volume expansion </strong>with<strong> 0.9% saline</strong> at 100 mL/h beginning 6 to 2 hours before CT and continuing for 4 to 12 hours after should be done.</p>",

The tubular fluid becomes <strong>hypertonic&nbsp;</strong>in this segment. The <strong>thick ascending limb&nbsp;</strong>reabsorbs Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;by a <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;co-transporter</strong>. <strong>Some of the K<sup>+</sup></strong> that is reabsorbed <strong>leaks back</strong> into the lumen, creating a potential difference with more positivity in the lumen. This <strong>lumen positivity</strong> is responsible for the <strong>absorption of divalent ions like Ca<sup>+2&nbsp;</sup>and Mg<sup>+2</sup></strong>. The thick ascending limb is virtually<strong> impermeable to water.&nbsp;</strong>Since some of the solutes are reabsorbed and water is not reabsorbed, it <strong>dilutes</strong> <strong>the tubular fluid</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Early distal convoluted tubule (DCT)</strong> reabsorbs Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> by the <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter</strong>. This segment is also <strong>impermeable to water</strong>. Because of the relative solute reabsorption, there is <strong>dilution</strong> <strong>of the tubular fluid</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>late distal tubule</strong> and <strong>collecting duct</strong> have <strong>two kinds of cells</strong> as mentioned above. <strong>Principal cells</strong> <strong>reabsorb Na<sup>+</sup> and secrete K<sup>+</sup></strong> into the lumen. The Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption is through <strong>epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channels (ENaC)</strong>. The expression of ENaC is mediated by <strong>aldosterone</strong> and thus increases whenever there is activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> is balanced by the secretion of K+ into the lumen.</p>\n<p>The <strong>water permeability</strong> of the principal cells is<strong> controlled by ADH</strong>. When <strong>ADH</strong> levels are <strong>high</strong>, <strong>aquaporin 2</strong> channels are <strong>inserted</strong> in the luminal membrane of the principal cells, leading to <strong>water reabsorption</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Intercalated cells</strong> <strong>reabsorb K<sup>+</sup> and secrete H<sup>+</sup></strong> by an <strong>H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> counter-transporter</strong>. They also have an H<sup>+</sup> pump which is responsible for acid secretion.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Summary of Transport Across Proximal and Distal Portions of the Nephron</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><strong>Proximal Tubule</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Reabsorption</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Secretion</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>67% of filtered Na<sup>+</sup> actively reabsorbed, not subject to control; Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> follows passively</p>\n<p>All filtered glucose and amino acids reabsorbed by secondary active transport; not subject to control</p>\n<p>Variable amounts of filtered PO4<sup>3- </sup>and other electrolytes reabsorbed; subject to control</p>\n<p>65% of filtered H<sub>2</sub>O osmotically reabsorbed; not subject to control</p>\n<p>50% of filtered urea passively reabsorbed; not subject to control</p>\n<p>Almost all filtered K<sup>+</sup> reabsorbed; not subject to control</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Variable H<sup>+</sup> secretion, depending on acid-base status of body</p>\n<p>Organic ion secretion; not subject to control</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Distal tubule</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Reabsorption</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Secretion</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Variable Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption, controlled by aldosterone; Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> follows passively</p>\n<p>Variable H<sub>2</sub>O reabsorption, controlled by vasopressin</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Variable H<sup>+ </sup>secretion, depending on acid-base status of body</p>\n<p>Variable K<sup>+</sup> secretion, controlled by aldosterone</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Hence, the blockade of these receptors by strychnine results in unopposed muscle contraction, resulting in the classical clinical features.

It can identify extra parenchymal hemorrhages, subarachnoid hemorrhages, neoplasms, abscesses, and other conditions that can mimic stroke. However, in the case of ischemic stroke, the <strong>CT may appear normal</strong> for the first few hours and the infarct may not appear until 24-48 hours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imaging modalities that can be useful in the early identification of stroke are diffusion-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and MR perfusion studies using gadolinium contrast.</p>\n<p>Treatment of acute ischemic stroke:</p>\n<p>Initial treatment: Check for the patient's pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature, and glucose levels.&nbsp;<strong>Treat hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia,</strong> or<strong> fever</strong> if present. Maintain the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation.</p>\n<p>Blood pressure should be reduced acutely if :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blood pressure &gt; 220/120 mmHg</li>\n<li>There is malignant hypertension</li>\n<li>There is concomitant myocardial ischemia</li>\n<li>Blood pressure is &gt; 185/110 mmHg and the patient is being planned for intravenous thrombolysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Serum glucose should be maintained between <strong>180mg/dL and 60mg/dL.</strong></p>\n<p>Ischemia can result in edema which peaks on the second or third day and can lead to a mass effect for around 10 days.

This lack of healing response can be due to open fracture injuries, subsequent surgical treatment, or host factors like <strong>diabetes, smoking, </strong>etc. Clinical features in a case of nonunion include <strong>persistent pain at the fracture site, pain on stressing the fracture, and mobility at the fracture site.</strong> A bone scan is used to differentiate atrophic nonunion from oligotrophic nonunion. Bone scan shows<strong> hot spots in oligotrophic </strong>nonunion whereas it shows <strong>cold spots in atrophic</strong> nonunion. Management includes <strong>autologous bone grafting or bone morphogenic protein</strong> to stimulate fracture healing.</p>\n<p>Based on the <strong>biological activity at the fracture site</strong>, non-union can be classified as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Atrophic nonunion:&nbsp;</strong>Poor healing response with no callus formation due to little or no active bone-forming cells at the fracture site. The <strong>blood supply is typically poor</strong>.
