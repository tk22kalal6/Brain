The <strong>causes of type 2 RTA</strong> include <strong>Fanconi syndrome</strong>, <strong>multiple myeloma</strong>, and <strong>Wilson's disease</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Gitelman syndrome </strong>causes <strong>increased fluid delivery</strong> to the distal tubule, leading to more Na+ absorption, and increased H+ and K+ secretion under the influence of aldosterone. Thus, it causes <strong>metabolic alkalosis</strong> and <strong>hypokalemia.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Bartter syndrome</strong> also causes <strong>increased Na<sup>+</sup> absorption</strong>, and <strong>increased H<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> secretion</strong> under the influence of aldosterone, thus, causing<strong> metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>Option D: <strong> Liddle syndrome</strong> occurs due to a <strong>gain of function mutation in the ENaC</strong> channels in the distal tubule.

Out of the given drugs,&nbsp;<strong>Verapamil</strong>&nbsp;can be used in the <strong>treatment of PSVT</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>PSVT</strong> is an arrhythmia characterized by sudden onset and offset with rapid ventricular response. It <strong>includes</strong>&nbsp;<strong>atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia</strong>, junctional tachycardia, and AV reentry tachycardia.&nbsp;<strong>Initial management</strong>&nbsp;of PSVT is by vagal maneuvers such as&nbsp;<strong>carotid massage</strong>. If this method is ineffective,&nbsp;<strong>intravenous adenosine</strong>&nbsp;is used which will <strong>terminate the majority of PSVT</strong> episodes <strong>by&nbsp;blocking the conduction at AV node</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Beta-blockers</strong>&nbsp;and non-DHP calcium channel blockers like&nbsp;<strong>Verapamil</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Diltiazem</strong>&nbsp;are also able to <strong>block AV nodal conduction</strong> and can therefore be used in patients with PSVT.</p>\n<p><strong>Verapamil</strong>&nbsp;is a class IV anti-arrhythmic agent. It is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts by slowing down the SA node automaticity and AV nodal conduction velocity. This&nbsp;<strong>decreases</strong>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>conduction velocity</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>prolongs</strong>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>refractory period</strong>, leading to the effective termination of the re-entrant current. Additionally, they also decrease cardiac contractility and reduce blood pressure. Diltiazem acts in a similar manner.&nbsp;Side effects of Verapamil include hypotension, bradycardia, <strong>constipation</strong>, and rarely, worsening of heart failure.</p>\n<p>Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like Nifedipine, Amlodipine, and Cilnidipine do not have any antiarrhythmic properties.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<div class=\"ng-star-inserted\">\n<div class=\"table-responsive font-weight-light answer-scroll ng-star-inserted\">\n<p>Option A:<strong>&nbsp;Cilnidipine</strong>&nbsp;blocks both&nbsp;<strong>N and L-type calcium channels.&nbsp;</strong>It is a&nbsp;<strong>dihydropyridine</strong>&nbsp;calcium channel blocker.

Stroke and retinopathy leading to loss of visual acuity and even blindness.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaso-occlusive crises, or pain crises</strong>&nbsp;are characterized by episodes of hypoxic injury and infarction that cause severe pain in the affected region, hand-foot syndrome, or dactylitis.&nbsp;<strong>Osteomyelitis</strong>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;<strong>sickle cell anemia patient</strong>&nbsp;is commonly caused by Salmonella and it most likely affects the&nbsp;<strong>diaphysis</strong>&nbsp;of bones.&nbsp;<strong>Acute chest syndrome </strong>is a&nbsp;vaso-occlusive crisis involving the lungs with fever, cough, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates.&nbsp;<strong>Sequestration crises</strong>&nbsp;is seen in children with intact spleens. Massive entrapment of sickle red cells leads to rapid splenic enlargement, hypovolemia, and sometimes shock.&nbsp;<strong>Aplastic crises</strong>&nbsp;occur due to the infection of red cell progenitors by <strong>parvovirus B19, </strong>which causes a transient arrest of erythropoiesis and a sudden worsening of the anemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased </strong>susceptibility to infection with<strong> encapsulated organisms</strong> is another risk due to altered splenic function.&nbsp;<strong>Pneumococcus&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> Haemophilus influenzae </strong>septicemia and meningitis are common, particularly in children, but can be <strong>reduced by vaccination </strong>and prophylactic antibiotics. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is also used to demonstrate the presence of HbS.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disease that results from&nbsp;<strong>acquired mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation group A gene</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(<em>PIGA</em>)</strong>, which is required for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG). These cells lack the ability to synthesize proteins that limit the activity of complement. As a result, they are sensitive to lysis by the complement C5b-C9 membrane attack complex</p>\n<p>Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by mutations that most frequently involve ankyrin, band 3, or spectrin (i.e. inherited defects in the membrane skeleton).</p>\n<p><strong>A nonsense mutation</strong>&nbsp;is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon. For example, a point mutation affecting the codon for glutamine (CAG) creates a&nbsp;<strong>stop codon (UAG)</strong>&nbsp;if U is substituted for C. This change leads to premature termination of &beta;-globin gene translation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded. The resulting deficiency of &beta;-globin chains can give rise to a severe form of anemia called&nbsp;<strong>&beta;<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;t</strong><strong>halassemia.</strong></p>",

Hence, this is a case of metabolic acidosis.</p>\n<p>Step 3: To predict the respiratory compensation, we use the formula <strong>HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + 15</strong>.

A <strong>transfer time of 45 minutes</strong> is well <strong>below</strong> <strong>the maximum permitted time</strong> interval of <strong>120 minutes</strong> between the first medical contact and stent placement. Therefore, the <strong>most appropriate next step</strong> for this patient would be a&nbsp;<strong>transfer to a PCI-capable hospital without</strong>&nbsp;the administration of a&nbsp;<strong>fibrinolytic agent</strong>.</p>\n<p>The patient in question has multiple <strong>risk factors for coronary artery disease</strong>, such as <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong>, <strong>hypertension,</strong> and <strong>smoking</strong>. Previous <strong>episodes of chest pain</strong> that were <strong>relieved on rest</strong> indicate <strong>stable angina</strong>. Now the patient has presented with severe <strong>chest pain</strong> that <strong>began on exertion</strong> (climbing the stairs) and is <strong>not getting relieved even on rest</strong>. This is suggestive of an <strong>acute coronary syndrome</strong>, most likely due to an <strong>acute change</strong> such as <strong>thrombosis</strong> in <strong>previously stable atherosclerotic plaque</strong> in the coronary arteries.</p>\n<p>The vitals of the patient are unremarkable, except for elevated BP. The <strong>absence of desaturation and hypotension</strong> indicates that despite an ongoing acute coronary syndrome, the patient's<strong> heart function is fair</strong> at the moment. A 12-lead ECG showing <strong>ST-elevation in leads I, aVL, V5 and V6</strong> indicates <strong>lateral wall STEMI</strong>. The <strong>ST depression</strong> seen <strong>in</strong> <strong>reciprocal leads</strong> II, III, and aVF supports this.</p>\n<p>In a patient with STEMI,<strong> primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; <strong>angioplasty</strong> <strong>with/without stenting but without prior fibrinolysis</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; is <strong>more effective than fibrinolysis alone</strong> in opening the occluded coronary vessel and has better clinical outcomes. In case the <strong>patient has presented to a PCI-capable hospital</strong>, <strong>primary PCI should be done within 90 minutes of the patient presenting</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the <strong>patient has presented to a non-PCI-capable hospital</strong>, a <strong>fibrinolytic agent is given within 30 minutes</strong> of the patient presenting <strong>if the anticipated time to PCI is &gt;120 minutes</strong>. This time limit includes the time spent in non-PCI-capable hospital and the time taken to transfer the patient to a PCI-capable setup. If the <strong>anticipated time to PCI is &le;120 minutes</strong>, the <strong>patient is directly transferred to PCI-capable</strong> <strong>hospital</strong> <strong>without fibrinolysis</strong>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above management, the patients are also stated on <strong>oxygen</strong> (if hypoxemia is present), <strong>morphine</strong>, <strong>aspirin</strong>, <strong>sublingual</strong> <strong>nitroglycerine</strong>, and <strong>beta-blockers</strong>. <strong>Nitrates</strong> should be <strong>avoided</strong> <strong>in</strong> patients with <strong>suspected right ventricular infarction</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; <strong>hypotension</strong> with <strong>clear lung fields</strong> on auscultation.</p>",

Since&nbsp;the <strong>pelvis</strong> is<strong> favorable</strong>, <strong>face-to-pubis delivery</strong> is possible in this mother.</p>\n<p><strong>Right occipito-posterior position (ROP)</strong> is the most common malposition, which occurs<strong>&nbsp;</strong>when the&nbsp;<strong>occiput</strong>&nbsp;is situated<strong>&nbsp;posteriorly</strong>&nbsp;over the&nbsp;<strong>sacroiliac joint</strong>, or directly over the sacrum. It is associated with the risk of delayed engagement of the head, prolonged labor due to transverse arrest, and the need for cesarean sections.</p>\n<p>Features of the occipito-posterior position include&nbsp;<strong>infra-umbilical flattening</strong>&nbsp;and fetal heart sounds localized to the<strong> flank</strong>. The fetal parts are more prominently felt near the midline. The head engages through the <strong>right oblique diameter</strong> in ROP and the engaging AP diameter is <strong>occipitofrontal</strong> or <strong>suboccipito-frontal</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the majority of cases where the <strong>pelvis is favorable</strong>, uterine <strong>contractions</strong> are <strong>strong</strong>, and no complications arise, it results in <strong>normal vaginal delivery</strong>. With the occiput (back of the baby's head) as the leading part, it rotates approximately <strong>3/8th of a circle towards the front</strong>, positioning itself behind the symphysis pubis. Due to the limitations of the neck's ability to withstand such torsion, the shoulders then rotate about 2/8th of a circle, aligning with the right oblique diameter. Consequently, the remaining progression of labor resembles that of the right occipitoanterior position in ROP.</p>\n<p>When there is <strong>incomplete forward rotation</strong> during labor, the occiput undergoes an <strong>anterior rotation</strong> of approximately 1/8th of a circle, causing the sagittal suture to align with the bi-spinous diameter of the pelvis. Subsequent further anterior rotation is unlikely, and when labor arrest occurs in this position, it is referred to as <strong>deep transverse arrest</strong>.</p>\n<p>In certain instances, the labor process <strong>does not involve rotation</strong> and instead leads to a condition called <strong>oblique posterior arrest</strong>. This occurs when both the sinciput (front part of the baby's head) and the occiput (back part of the head) touch the pelvic floor at the same time. This simultaneous contact is a result of the head being <strong>moderately deflected</strong>, preventing the occiput from rotating. The sagittal suture&nbsp;lies in the oblique diameter.</p>\n<p>When the head is <strong>severely deflected</strong> during labor, it can result in <strong>posterior rotation</strong>, known as the <strong>occipitosacral position</strong>. Under favorable conditions, such as having a baby of average size, strong uterine contractions, and a well-suited pelvis (such as an <strong>anthropoid or spacious gynaecoid pelvis</strong>), spontaneous delivery may occur as <strong>face to pubis</strong>. However, in <strong>unfavorable</strong> situations where labor arrest occurs, it is referred to as <strong>occipitosacral arrest</strong>.</p>\n<p>Indications of <strong>cesarean section</strong> in the occipito-posterior position include the arrest of labor, inadequate uterine contractions, fetal distress, and other obstetrical complications.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 449\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>During the second stage of labor, if the anterior rotation of the occiput is completed, delivery occurs <strong>spontaneously</strong> or may require the application of&nbsp;<strong>ventouse&nbsp;or low forceps</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c4e96c2bf728435d8baceb84d9333334x1052x990.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

If there is an <strong>adequate response</strong> to inhaled NO, then <strong>DHP-type calcium channel blockers</strong> such as sustained-release <strong>nifedipine</strong> can be <strong>used for the management of PAH</strong>. <strong>Inhaled NO</strong> is also used for the management of <strong>persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn</strong>. <strong>Riociguat</strong> is another drug used in PAH that <strong>activates soluble guanylyl cyclase enzyme</strong> (statement 2) and causes vasodilation.</p>\n<p><strong>Endothelin antagonists</strong> that are used for PAH include drugs like <strong>ambrisentan</strong>, <strong>bosentan</strong>, and <strong>macitentan</strong>. While <strong>bosentan</strong> and <strong>macitentan</strong> <strong>block both endothelin A and B</strong> (statement 3) receptors, <strong>ambrisentan</strong> is a <strong>selective blocker of endothelin A</strong> receptors. The <strong>adverse effects</strong> of endothelin antagonists include <strong>pulmonary edema</strong>, risk of <strong>testicular atrophy</strong>, and <strong>elevated liver enzymes</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Epoprostenol</strong> was the first <strong>synthetic prostacyclin</strong>. It is given by a <strong>continuous IV infusion</strong> by a drug delivery pump. The <strong>adverse effects</strong> include <strong>myalgia</strong>, headache, <strong>flushing</strong>, <strong>diarrhea,</strong> and hypotension. <strong>Treprostinil</strong> is a prostacyclin analog that is available as an IV infusion, subcutaneous injection, inhalation, and <strong>oral delivery</strong>. Iloprost is another prostacyclin analog available as an inhaled formulation. <strong>Selexipag</strong> is an orally active <strong>prostacyclin receptor agonist</strong> (statement 5).</p>\n<p>Another class of drugs used in PAH is <strong>phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors</strong>. These drugs prevent the breakdown of cGMP by phosphodiesterase, thus keeping the vessels in a dilated state. This class of drugs includes <strong>sildenafil</strong> and <strong>tadalafil</strong>. <strong>Headache</strong> and <strong>flushing</strong> are the most commonly reported <strong>side effects</strong>.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e78da2196a8f48dc97e5db27603061c7x1280x1794.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Drugs used in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Drug Class</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Examples</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prostacyclin derivative</td>\n<td>\n<p>Epoprostenol</p>\n<p>Iloprost</p>\n<p>Treprostinil</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Endothelin receptor antagonist</td>\n<td>\n<p>Bosentan</p>\n<p>Ambrisentan</p>\n<p>Macitentan</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PDE5 inhibitor</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sildenafil</p>\n<p>Tadalafil</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Soluble guanyl cyclase stimulator</td>\n<td>Riociguat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Calcium channel blocker</td>\n<td>\n<p>Nifedipine</p>\n<p>Diltiazem</p>\n<p>Amlodipine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
