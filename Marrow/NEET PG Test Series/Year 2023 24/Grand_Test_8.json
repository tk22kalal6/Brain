It can be classified into 4 types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Secretory diarrhea</strong> is an isotonic stool and persists during fasting.</li>\n<li><strong>Osmotic diarrhea</strong> is due to the osmotic force exerted by unabsorbed luminal solutes. The diarrheal fluid is greater than 50 mOsm. Diarrhea decreases on fasting.</li>\n<li><strong>Malabsorptive diarrhea</strong> is due to failure of nutrient absorption. It is associated with steatorrhea and it gets relived on fasting.</li>\n<li><strong>Exudative diarrhea</strong> is due to inflammatory diseases which has pus and blood on them, it continues during fasting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>Lactase deficiency&nbsp;</strong>is due to the <strong>absence</strong> of lactase in the villous epithelial cells. Lactose remains in the intestinal lumen and exerts an osmotic force causing <strong>osmotic diarrhea</strong>.

After gently pushing the inverted uterine fundus back into the vagina, the nozzle of the irrigating cannula is inserted into the vagina, and the vaginal orifice is closed by the hands of the operator and an assistant. Around 3-5L of fluid may be required, and the inversion will be slowly corrected by the hydrostatic pressure.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Necroptosis</strong> is a <strong>caspase-independent</strong>&nbsp;pathway.</p>\n<p><strong>Necroptosis</strong>, as the name suggests has features similar to necrosis and apoptosis. Like necrosis, it is characterized by loss of ATP, cellular and organelle swelling, the release of lysosomal enzymes, and rupture of the plasma membrane. However, like apoptosis, this is programmed cell death. This is a <strong>caspase-independent</strong> programmed cell death. It is also called <strong>programmed necrosis.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>TNF-&alpha; activates TNFR1 and, in turn, induces the recruitment of RIP1 and RIP3 kinase and other proteins to form a complex.</li>\n<li>This complex includes caspase 8. But,&nbsp;<strong>caspase 8</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>not activated</strong> in this pathway.</li>\n<li><span>RIPK3 phosphorylates a cytoplasmic protein called MLKL. On </span><span>phosphorylation, MLKL monomers assemble into oligomers, translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, and cause plasma membrane disruption.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Other options</span></p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Pyroptosis</strong> occurs due to the release of fever-inducing cytokine <strong>interleukin-1 (IL-1).</strong> Cytoplasmic innate immune receptors recognize <strong>microbial products</strong> that entered the infected cells and activate the multiprotein complex called the <strong>inflammasome</strong>. Inflammasome activates <strong>caspase 1</strong> and helps in the release of the biologically activated forms of <strong>IL-1</strong>.&nbsp;Along with caspase 1, caspases 4 and 5 also induce cell death. Unlike classical apoptosis, pyroptosis is characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Options A and B: The <strong>intrinsic</strong> mitochondrial and <strong>extrinsic</strong> death receptor-initiated <strong>pathways</strong> converge to <strong>activate</strong> a <strong>caspase</strong> cascade that <strong>mediates</strong> the final phase of <strong>apoptosis.</strong> The <strong>intrinsic pathway </strong>activates<strong> caspase 9</strong> whereas the <strong>extrinsic pathway</strong> activates <strong>caspases 8 </strong>and<strong> 10</strong>. These caspases then activate<strong>&nbsp;caspase 3, </strong>and<strong> caspase 6</strong>.&nbsp;Activated caspases cause DNA degradation and nuclei fragmentation.</p>",
