However, with time, this stasis leads to splenic infarction, fibrosis, and shrinkage of the spleen. <strong>By adolescence</strong>, only a <strong>small fibrous remnant </strong>may be<strong> left behind</strong> in place of the normal spleen. This is known as <strong>autosplenectomy</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main pathology behind autosplenectomy is <strong>microvascular occlusion</strong> which occurs in patients with sickle cell anemia. In the parts of the body where the <strong>blood flow is sluggish</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; such as in <strong>inflamed</strong> <strong>areas</strong>, or in the<strong> cords of the spleen</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; there is a <strong>higher tendency</strong> for the <strong>sickled RBCs</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>adhere</strong> to the endothelium. This is because sickled red cells express higher amounts of adhesion molecules. Mediators released from granulocytes during an inflammatory process worsen this tendency.</p>\n<p><strong>Vascular occlusion</strong> due to the adhesion of the sickled RBCs to the vessel wall can cause <strong>infarcts</strong> in other tissues such as bones, brain and kidney as well. Painful bone crises due to vascular occlusion are common in children and can manifest as <strong>hand-foot syndrome</strong> (<strong>dactylitis</strong> of the bones of hands and feet),<strong> acute chest syndrome</strong> (involves the lung and presents with fever, cough, and chest pain) and <strong>priapism</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Thalassemia</strong> and <strong>hereditary</strong> <strong>spherocytosis</strong> both present with <strong>splenomegaly</strong> and not autosplenectomy.&nbsp;</p>",

      "solution": "<p>From the given clinical scenario the likely diagnosis is <strong>tuberculosis verrucosa cutis. </strong>It is caused by exogenous inoculation of <strong><em>M.</em> <em>tuberculosis</em></strong> into the skin through open wounds or abrasions. Lesions appear at the site of inoculation. They appear as <strong>verrucous plaque</strong> which extends with a <strong>serpiginous outline</strong> with <strong>finger‐like projections</strong>. The <strong>center</strong> of the lesion may have a <strong>white atrophic scar.</strong></p>\n<p>It is also known as<strong> anatomist’s warts, prosector’s warts </strong>and <strong>verruca necrogenica. </strong> It occurs in a person who is already sensitized by <strong>previous exposure</strong> to TB. Thus it is a form of <strong>post-primary TB</strong>. Patients having this condition have good immunity against TB. Because of good immunity, they are <strong>effective</strong> in <strong>clearing</strong> the TB bacilli and thus, the lesion is <strong>paucibacillary</strong>. This condition is treated with anti-tubercular drugs. </p>\n<p>Other options- </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option A- <strong>Lupus vulgaris</strong> originates from an underlying focus of tuberculosis, typically in a bone, joint, or lymph node, or maybe from the hematogenous and lymphatic spread. It presents as a <strong>slowly enlarging plaque</strong> with an <strong>elevated border</strong> and <strong>central atrophy</strong>. The edges of the lesion gradually extend in some areas and <strong>heal with scarring</strong> in others. In India, the buttocks, and trunk are more frequently involved. <strong>Apple jelly nodules</strong> are demonstrated on <strong>diascopy.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The below image shows Lupus vulgaris: </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/32adfa20edc84314940a464e684a529ax720x413.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p class=\"p1\">Option C- <strong>Lichen scrofulosorum</strong> is a type of<strong> tuberculid</strong>. It occurs due to hypersensitivity to the active tubercular infection. They appear as closely <strong>grouped lichenoid papules</strong>. The lesions are usually skin coloured and are often <strong>perifollicular</strong>.

It is caused by the vigorous agitation of the tracheal and bronchial mucous secretions, edema fluid, and alveolar surfactant during respiratory efforts. </li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Cutis anserina</strong> - The contraction of the erector pilorum muscles causes puckering and a grainy appearance of the skin. This resembles goose skin; hence, it is called cutis anserina.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Washerwoman’s hand</strong> - Maceration of the skin on the palms and soles gives a wrinkled, sodden, and bleached appearance due to submersion.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Cadaveric spasm</strong> - Gravel, weed, soil, grass, etc. is firmly held in the clenched hands due to cadaveric spasm. This is a <strong>vital sign</strong> of <strong>antemortem drowning</strong>. The material also indicates the place of submersion.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Rigor mortis</strong> - This appears early in cases of a violent antemortem struggle.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Face - It is bloated and discolored, with cyanosis.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Eyes - Conjunctiva are suffused and pupils dilated.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Tongue - It may be swollen and protruded.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Antemortem injuries</strong> - These may be sustained by striking objects, such as rocks, during the fall into the water body. Examination for such injuries must be performed only after the body is dry.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Lungs</strong> - They appear <strong>voluminous</strong> and <strong>distended</strong> show ballooning. The cut section will exude copious amounts of frothy, bloodstained fluid.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Larynx, trachea, and bronchioles - The presence of sand, silt, and aquatic vegetation in the trachea and lower respiratory tract are characteristic findings of antemortem drowning.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Heart and blood vessels- <strong>Gettler test</strong> can be done to estimate the chloride content in the right and left sides of the heart to differentiate between freshwater and saltwater drowning. </li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Diatom test</strong>- Diatoms are microscopic algae. Their presence in the organs, particularly in the <strong>bone marrow</strong>, is suggestive of <strong>antemortem drowning</strong>.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Stomach and small intestines- These organs may contain water in some cases. Water present in the small intestine is positive evidence of death by drowning.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Middle ear - The presence of water in the middle ear is highly suggestive of antemortem drowning.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Brain - It is congested, and edematous, with loss of gray-white junction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Hydrostatic lung,</strong> is seen in postmortem drowning. When a dead body is thrown into the water, water passes into the lungs due to hydrostatic pressure. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Emphysema aquosum</strong> - This is seen in cases when the victim is alive and conscious. Overinflation of the lungs in drowning is known as emphysema aquosum. It is one of the most valuable <strong>positive</strong> signs of <strong>drowning.</strong> The edema fluid in the bronchi blocks the <strong>passive collapse</strong> that normally occurs at death. Hence, the lungs are held in the <strong>inspiratory position.</strong> The impression of the ribs on this overinflated lung leaves visible and palpable grooves on the lateral surface. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Diatom test-</strong> Diatoms are microscopic algae. Their presence in the organs, particularly in the <strong>bone marrow,</strong> is suggestive of <strong>antemortem</strong> drowning. In <strong>postmortem drowning,</strong> diatoms do not spread to distant organs because of the absence of circulation and are <strong>limited</strong> to the <strong>lungs.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>",

There is a typical antecedent <strong>history</strong> of <strong>infection 1-4 weeks</strong> before the onset of arthritic symptoms.</p>\n<p>Clinical features of ReA include constitutional symptoms like fever, malaise, fatigue and weight loss. There may be <strong>asymmetric arthritis</strong> with the involvement of a new joint within a few days.

Other risk factors for the development of IRIS include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rapid initial fall in HIV viral load due to ART</li>\n<li>Severity of TB disease</li>\n<li>Male sex and younger age</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The underlying pathogenesis appears to be similar to a <strong>type IV hypersensitivity</strong> reaction and reflects the immediate improvements in immune function as there is a drop in the levels of HIV RNA. IRIS related to a <strong>known</strong> pre-existing <strong>infection</strong> is called <strong>paradoxical</strong> <strong>IRIS</strong>; IRIS associated with a <strong>previously undiagnosed condition</strong> is referred to as <strong>unmasking IRIS</strong>. Signs and symptoms can appear <strong>within two weeks to two years</strong> of starting ART and can include <strong>lymphadenitis, prolonged fever, pulmonary infiltrates</strong>, hepatitis and increase intracranial pressure.</p>\n<p>IRIS is <strong>generally self-limiting</strong> and interruption of ART is rarely indicated. In most cases, <strong>recognition and management of ongoing infection</strong> with antimicrobial therapy is sufficient. Short-term therapy with <strong>corticosteroids</strong> or <strong>NSAIDs</strong> can be given to reduce the inflammation. Temporary cessation of ART is to be considered for potentially life-threatening forms of IRIS. For the <strong>prevention of IRIS</strong> in a patient with HIV and TB co-infection, <strong>anti-tubercular treatment is started first</strong> and then <strong>ART</strong> is <strong>added</strong> <strong>two weeks later</strong>.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Opportunistic Infections/HIV related conditions and ART initiation</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Clinical scenario</td>\n<td>Action&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Any undiagnosed active infection with fever</td>\n<td>Diagnose and treat first; start Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) when stable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tuberculosis (TB)</td>\n<td>Start TB treatment first; start ART as soon as possible after 2 weeks and before 2 months.

      "solution": "<p>The phenomenon described in the question is immunoglobulin <strong>isotype switching.</strong> </p>\n<p>During class switching(Also known as isotype switching, or isotypic commutation, or class switch recombination (CSR), the same assembled V<sub>H</sub> (immunoglobulin variable region genes) can associate with different C<sub>H </sub>(immunoglobulin constant region genes) so that the immunoglobulins produced later are <strong>specific for the same antigen</strong> as the original IgM <strong>but</strong> have <strong>different biological characteristics</strong>. <strong>Class switching</strong> can occur <strong>only</strong> with <strong>heavy chains</strong>. Switch recombinase is the enzyme that catalyzes the rearrangement of VDJ genes during class switching. </p>\n<p><strong>IL-4</strong> enhances the class switching to <strong>IgE</strong> whereas <strong>IL-5</strong> increases the <strong>IgA</strong>. Moreover, the interaction of the CD40 protein on the B-cell with the CD40 ligand on the helper T-cell also enables class switching. In <strong>hyper-IgM syndrome</strong>, there is a <strong>failure in the interaction of CD40 and CD40 ligand</strong>. This leads to an <strong>overproduction</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>IgM</strong> and a deficiency of IgG, IgA, and IgE.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Somatic hypermutation</strong> (option A) is a cellular response by which the immune system modifies the immune response to antigens. It is done by adding nucleotides in V gene regions of heavy and light chains, resulting in a<strong> better fit</strong> <strong>of antigen with the antibodies</strong>. This <strong>increases</strong> the <strong>affinity</strong> of antibodies to antigens. Due to this, the subset of plasma cells with improved hypervariable regions is more strongly selected by the antigen and constitutes a larger part of the population of antibody-producing cells. This process is called <strong>affinity maturation </strong>(Option C).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Allelic exclusion</strong> (option D) is the process by which a cell <strong>expresses one </strong>of the<strong> two alleles</strong> of the gene and excludes the other allele. <strong>B cells </strong>are <strong>diploid</strong>, therefore, each B cell has <strong>six gene segment pools </strong>related to antibody chains: <strong>two heavy-chain pools </strong>(one from each parent) and <strong>four light-chain pools </strong>(one κ and one λ from each parent). However, <strong>each B cell uses</strong> <strong>only two</strong> of the six <strong>gene segment pools</strong>: one out of the two heavy-chain pools (maternal and paternal) and one out of the four light-chain pools. Thus, each B cell must choose not only between its κ and λ light-chain pools but also between its maternal and paternal light-chain and heavy-chain pools.

      "solution": "<p><strong>ADP</strong> would have contributed to the <strong>pro-thrombotic state</strong> in this patient.</p>\n<p>Following a traumatic vascular injury, the circulating platelets come in contact with the subendothelial connective tissue. <strong>Platelet adhesion</strong> is mediated by <strong>GpIb</strong> glycoprotein receptor present on the platelets and the <strong>von Willebrand factor (vWF)</strong> present on the exposed tissue below the vascular endothelium. Following this, the platelets rapidly change shape and <strong>release granule contents</strong>. This is known as <strong>platelet activation</strong>. <strong>ADP</strong>, which is present in <strong>dense granules</strong>, <strong>causes</strong> the <strong>activation of more platelets</strong> by binding to <strong>P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor</strong>. This phenomenon is called recruitment. The next step is <strong>platelet aggregation</strong>. <strong>GpIIb/IIIa</strong> undergoes a conformational change during platelet activation and allows binding to <strong>fibrinogen</strong>, leading to their aggregation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Local activation of the <strong>coagulation cascade</strong> occurs following the formation of the platelet plug. This leads to <strong>fibrin polymerization</strong> and cementing of the platelets into the definitive secondary hemostatic plug. However, there are certain counter-regulatory mechanisms that keep the process of coagulation limited to the site of the injury. This includes <strong>fibrinolysis</strong>, which is mediated by <strong>plasmin</strong>. Fibrin is broken down during this process and its further polymerization is stopped. Plasmin is generated by the catabolism of the <strong>precursor plasminogen</strong> by circulating <strong>plasminogen activators, such as t-PA&nbsp;</strong>(option A).&nbsp;Furthermore, <strong>thrombomodulin&nbsp;</strong>(option B)&nbsp;binds to thrombin and converts it into an anti-coagulant. <strong>Prostacyclin</strong> (option D) is <strong>PGI<sub>2</sub></strong>.

Ilizarov described this as &ldquo;<strong>the tension stress effect</strong>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The most important application of the tension-stress principle is known as&nbsp;<strong>callus distraction</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>callotaxis</strong>). A careful fracture of the bone is performed, followed by a short wait. The young callus formed is gradually distracted using a circular or unilateral external fixator.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Osteogenesis requires a dynamic state by either a controlled distraction or a controlled compression. This dynamic force causes <strong>dormant mesenchymal cells</strong> at the non-union site to differentiate into functioning osteoblasts. This results in bone synthesis and fracture healing. The&nbsp;fixation system is called a <strong>ring fixator</strong>.&nbsp; Distraction or compression can be applied by twisting nuts on the fixation system at the fracture or corticotomy site.&nbsp; Distraction or compression is carried out at the rate of <strong>1 mm per day</strong>. This is done in four sittings&mdash; &frac14; mm, four times a day. This is used in limb lengthening or filling of large segmental defects in the bone.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/47ed227996da4c54b15ba2e01db8469dx1280x2560.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
