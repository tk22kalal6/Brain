This process is aided by platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (<strong>PECAM-1</strong>).</p>\n<p><strong>Diapedesis </strong>occurs through the <strong>inter endothelial gap</strong> towards the chemical concentration gradient created by the chemokines at the site of injury. This occurs with the help of adhesion molecules present in the intercellular junctions such as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule <strong>(PECAM-1) or CD31.</strong> </p>\n<p>The process of acute inflammation has 3 components: An increase in blood flow due to small vessel dilation, and increased permeability of the microvasculature to aid plasma proteins and leukocytes to leave the circulation and migrate to the site of injury to exert their effects. The recruitment of leukocytes to the site of injury involves the following steps:</p>\n<p><strong>Margination and rolling</strong>: Leukocytes assume a peripheral position along the endothelial surface because of stasis of blood flow and start rolling on the vessel wall because of signaling molecules from the endothelium; Mediated by: <strong>E-Selectin, P-Selectin, Glycam-1 and CD34.</strong><br /><strong>Adhesion</strong>: Leukocytes are attached to the endothelium because of adhesion molecules that are activated by cytokines. Mediated by: <strong>ICAM-1, VCAM-1.</strong><br /><strong>Diapedesis/Transmigration: </strong>of the leukocytes across the vascular endothelium. Mediated by: <strong>PECAM-1.</strong><br /><strong>Migration:</strong> towards a chemotactic stimulus in the extravascular tissues. Chemotactic/Inflammatory factors mediating this process: <strong>C5a, IL-8, LTB4, Kallikrein, PAF. </strong>(Options A, B and D)</p>\n<p><strong>Selectins, integrins</strong>, and their ligands are the most important proteins involved in adhesion and migration. Selectins are of 3 types: <strong>L-selectin</strong> present on leukocytes,<strong> E-selectin</strong> present on endothelium, and <strong>P-selectins</strong> present in platelets and on the endothelium. </p>\n<p>The weak rolling action slows down the leukocytes and allows them to bind more firmly to the endothelium with the help of integrins. Chemokines that are produced at the site of injury bind to the endothelial cell proteoglycans. These chemokines then bind to the rolling leukocytes and activate them. This in turn converts the ligands for <strong>β1 and β2 integrins, VLA-4, and LFA-1 </strong>present on the leukocytes to a high-affinity state.</p>\n<p>This combination of cytokine-induced expression of integrin ligands on the endothelium and increased integrin affinity on the leukocytes leads to firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium at the site of inflammation.</p>\n<p> </p>",

It occurs when an electrical signal gets trapped in a circuit within the AV node, causing it to fire rapidly and repeatedly, causing a re-entry circuit. This results in a<strong> </strong>regular narrow QRS complex tachycardia.</p>\n<p>The given ECG strip shows changes suggestive of AV node reentry tachycardia based on the following findings:</p>\n<p><strong>Narrow QRS complex tachycardia</strong> at 150 bpm, indicative of a regular atrial rate (<strong>1:1 AV response</strong>). Heart rate is calculated by dividing 300 by the number of large boxes between 2 consecutive R waves. The ECG strip shows the presence of roughly 2 large boxes between 2 consecutive R waves, thereby making the HR ~150 bpm.<br /><strong>No visible P waves</strong> - indicative of <strong>dual conduction pathways</strong> (<strong>slow and fast</strong>) that cause <strong>simultaneous atrial and ventricular activation</strong>.<br />The <strong>P wave </strong>may sometimes be seen at the <strong>end of the QRS complex</strong> as a<strong> pseudo-r' wave (V1)</strong> and <strong>pseudo-S wave.

Wolf Parkinson White is a type of <strong>preexcitation syndrome</strong>, i.e., abnormally early ventricular excitation, which in WPW, occurs via a bypass tract (Bundle of Kent). Normally, there is a normal AV nodal delay to allow adequate ventricular filling. The bypass tract allows impulses to skip the nodal delay leading to preexcitation of the ventricles. In this syndrome, there is both <strong>preexcitation and delayed conduction</strong> leading to a <strong>shortened PR interval </strong>(&lt; 0.12 secs) and <strong>wide QRS.</strong> There is a characteristic <strong>delta wave</strong> notch in the QRS wave.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Automaticity from multiple atrial foci</strong>: <strong>Multifocal atrial tachycardia</strong> is a type of PSVT caused by multiple atrial foci discharging independently at a rapid rate, this can occur due to lung pathology such as<strong> COPD</strong>.

Therefore, increasing dietary sodium intake is not recommended for patients with recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.</p>\n<p>Option C: While it may<em> </em>seem counterintuitive, *<strong>restricting dietary calcium intake can actually increase the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation</strong>. This is because the body compensates for the reduced calcium intake by <strong>increasing intestinal absorption of oxalate</strong>, leading to hyperoxaluria. <strong>Hyperoxaluria</strong>, in turn, increases the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. Therefore, lowering calcium intake is not recommended for patients with recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Urinary citrate </strong>plays a crucial role in preventing calcium oxalate stone formation by <strong>inhibiting crystal formation </strong>and promoting <strong>stone dissolution</strong>. Therefore, lowering citrate intake can increase the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. Hence, maintaining adequate citrate levels through dietary choices is essential for preventing recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.</p>",

This results in <strong>dilution of the extracellular fluid and hyponatremia</strong>.</p>\n<p>In psychogenic polydipsia, the serum osmolality is low, reflecting the diluted extracellular fluid. The urine sodium is also low, as the kidneys are attempting to excrete excess water. However, the urine osmolality is also low, indicating that the kidneys are not effectively concentrating urine. This is because the <strong>excessive water intake</strong> has <strong>suppressed</strong> the production of <strong>ADH</strong>, which is necessary for the kidneys to concentrate urine.</p>\n<p>Types of hyponatremia:</p>\n<p><strong>Hypovolemic hyponatremia,</strong> patients have a volume deficit due to loss of fluids rich in sodium. There is volume depletion but the depletion of sodium is relatively more than the depletion of water. This may be due to extra-renal or renal causes.In the case of extra-renal causes, there is hypovolemia due to fluid loss in conditions such as diarrhoea, vomiting, burns, etc. due to which sodium is lost along with the fluid and hence urine sodium concentration will also be low. However, in case of renal loss, the sodium is lost at the nephron level itself, causing increased urine sodium concentration, as seen in adrenal insufficiency.<br /><strong>Euvolemic hyponatremia</strong>, there is no volume depletion, but low sodium concentration relative to the total body water, as seen in conditions such as hypothyroidism and SIADH.<br /><strong>Hypervolemic hyponatremia</strong>, patients are in a condition of fluid overload. In case of fluid overload due to acute or chronic renal failure, urine sodium concentration will be high. <br />In case of fluid overload due to cirrhosis, CCF and nephrotic syndrome, urine sodium concentration will be low.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A.

Euvolemia, SOsm &lt;275 mOsm/kg, UOsm &gt; 100 mOSm/kg</p>\n<p>This option describes a patient with <strong>euvolemic hyponatremia</strong>. The low SOsm reflects diluted serum due to excess reabsorption. However, the high UOsm indicates that the kidneys are <strong>able to concentrate urine</strong>, which suggests that the hyponatremia is not due to a problem with the kidneys' ability to conserve water. This is seen in <strong>SIADH.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D: Hypervolemia, SOsm &lt;275 mOsm/kg, UNa &lt;25 mEq/L:</p>\n<p>This option describes a patient with hypervolemic hyponatremia.

The glycogen stores are sufficient for around 18 hours after a meal following which they start to deplete. So the source of blood glucose in a person fasting for 11 hours will be liver glycogenolysis.<br /><br />The <strong>second stage</strong> of fasting: <strong>Gluconeogenesis</strong> begins 4–6 hours after the last meal but becomes fully active only after stores of liver glycogen are depleted<strong> (after 18 hours)</strong>. They can serve as a source of glucose for up to <strong>2 days</strong>. Substrates for gluconeogenesis are <strong>glucogenic amino acids</strong> ( mainly alanine) from the muscle and <strong>glycerol</strong> from adipose tissue </p>\n<p>During fasting, the glucogenic amino acids are transported to the liver, transaminated into pyruvate, and converted to glucose.</p>\n<p>The <strong>third stage</strong> of fasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Lipolysis</strong> occurs in the adipose tissue due to the activity of <strong>hormone-sensitive lipase,</strong> stimulated by <strong>increased glucagon: insulin ratio.</strong></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Free fatty acids</strong> are the source of energy in this stage and not glucose.

It is also one of the most common<strong> inborn errors of metabolism</strong>. MCAD is an important enzyme involved in fatty acid <strong>beta-oxidation</strong>. This process is <strong>important in</strong> the production of <strong>ketone bodies</strong> as an energy source when blood glucose levels are low.</p>\n<p>It is usually <strong>diagnosed at birth</strong> during <strong>routine screening</strong> for disorders of the newborn.

The common laboratory results seen in these patients result from a failure to synthesize ketone bodies during episodes of hypoglycemia. Hence, the child will present with <strong>hypoketotic hypoglycemia</strong>. The <strong>diagnosis</strong> can be confirmed with a combination of <strong>biochemical </strong>and <strong>genetic testing</strong>. This illness, once diagnosed can be easily <strong>managed with small frequent meals</strong>, to avoid a state of hypoglycemia. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option (B)- <strong>Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency</strong> can result in <strong>phenylketonuria</strong>. This is an inborn error of metabolism in which phenylalanine is unable to convert to tyrosine, resulting in the <strong>accumulation of phenylalanine</strong>. This results in the characteristic<strong> 'musty' odor</strong> of the urine and body fluids. These children can also present with <strong>seizures </strong>and hyperactivity. In fact, many of the symptoms result from <strong>increased phenylpyruvate (a ketoacid)</strong> derived from the buildup of phenylalanine in this condition.</p>\n<p>Option (C)-<strong> UMP synthase</strong> is an enzyme <strong>deficiency</strong> that results in <strong>orotic aciduria</strong>. This disorder is an <strong>inborn error of pyrimidine metabolism</strong> that presents with developmental delay, failure to thrive, and possibly epilepsy.

      "solution": "<p>In the given ECG, the presence of <strong>narrow-complex regular tachycardia</strong> and P-waves occurring after QRS complexes, known as<strong> retro P waves</strong> or <strong>pseudo-r' waves</strong>, (especially prominent in lead V1) point to a diagnosis of <strong>paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)</strong>. Out of the given drugs, <strong>Verapamil</strong> can be used in the treatment of PSVT.</p>\n<p>PSVT is an arrhythmia characterized by sudden onset and offset with rapid ventricular response. It includes <strong>atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia</strong>, junctional tachycardia, and AV reentry tachycardia. <strong>Initial management</strong> of PSVT is by vagal maneuvers such as <strong>carotid massage</strong>. If this method is ineffective, <strong>intravenous adenosine</strong> is used which will terminate the majority of PSVT episodes by<strong> blocking the conduction at AV node</strong>. <strong>Beta-blockers</strong> and non-DHP calcium channel blockers like <strong>Verapamil</strong> and <strong>Diltiazem</strong> are also able to block AV nodal conduction and can therefore be used in patients with PSVT.</p>\n<p><strong>Verapamil</strong> is a class IV anti-arrhythmic agent. It is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts by slowing down the SA node automaticity and AV nodal conduction velocity. This <strong>decreases</strong> the <strong>conduction velocity</strong> and <strong>prolongs</strong> the <strong>refractory period</strong>, leading to the effective termination of the re-entrant current. Additionally, they also decrease cardiac contractility and reduce blood pressure. Diltiazem acts in a similar manner. Side effects of Verapamil include hypotension, bradycardia, constipation, and rarely, worsening of heart failure.</p>\n<p>Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like Nifedipine, Amlodipine, and Cilnidipine do not have any antiarrhythmic properties.</p>\n<p> </p><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Cilnidipine</strong> blocks both <strong>N and L-type calcium channels. </strong>It is a <strong>dihydropyridine</strong> calcium channel blocker. It blocks the L-type calcium channels in blood vessels and inhibits the contraction of blood vessels and blocks the N-type calcium channels located at the sympathetic nerve endings, inhibiting the release of norepinephrine. It is used in <strong>hypertension,</strong> especially in patients with diabetes who present with albuminuria and chronic kidney disease as it has end-organ protective properties.</p><p>Option B: <strong>Fenoldopam</strong> injection is a dopaminergic agonist. It is indicated in adult patients for short-term management of severe hypertension when rapid and reversible reduction of blood pressure is clinically indicated, including for hypertensive emergencies. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Nifedipine </strong>is a<strong> dihydropyridine</strong> that acts by blocking <strong>L-type calcium channels, </strong>having a<strong> rapid onset and short duration of action.</strong> It results in an <strong>abrupt decrease in blood pressure</strong> resulting in <strong>reflex tachycardia</strong>. Increased heart rate increases the O<sub>2</sub> demand and might precipitate angina.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/30f2784da3374673a8c185c3edb7ffbbx510x812.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Supraventricular tachycardias</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Supraventricular tachycardias with narrow QRS complex:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Narrow QRS with regular RR interval</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ECG features</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sinus tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td>Normal P wave, normal ECG features except for the rate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Focal atrial tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td>A single type of abnormal p wave morphology is seen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Junctional tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td>No p waves.

This can lead to significant sleep disturbances and <strong>insomnia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D : <strong>Pavor nocturnus (night terrors)</strong> are sleep arousal disorders that are seen in <strong>NREM sleep</strong>.

As a result, the ratio of FEV1/FVC also decreases. The <strong>total lung capacity is increased</strong> in emphysema. <strong>Functional Residual Capacity</strong> (FRC) is the <strong>volume of air present</strong> in the lungs at the <strong>end of passive expiration</strong>. In COPD/Emphysema, FRC is <strong>increased.</strong></p>\n<p>Emphysema is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease commonly seen in patients who are between 50–75 years of age with dyspnea being severe very early in the disease, and late-onset cough with scanty sputum. They are often referred to as \"pink puffers\" due to their typical thin non-cyanotic (pink) appearance with severe dyspnea even at rest. </p>\n<p>Emphysema occurs due to irreversible dilatation and destruction of airspace walls distal to terminal bronchioles. It is particularly severe in patients with α1-antitrypsin deficiency, and in smokers. Lung tissue destruction is caused by toxic injury, protease-antiprotease imbalance, oxidative stress, and infection. As a result, the diffusing capacity may be reduced.</p>\n<p>In emphysema, the upper two-thirds of the lungs are markedly affected. Due to hyperinflation, the lungs become voluminous completely eclipsing the heart anteriorly.  On microscopy, a thin septum with focal centriacinar fibrosis is seen between abnormally large alveoli.
