      "solution": "<p>The most likely diagnosis in this case is<strong>&nbsp;thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) </strong>is&nbsp;<strong>thrombotic microangiopathy</strong> that can be inherited or spontaneously acquired. It results from a <strong>deficiency of</strong>&nbsp;the metalloprotease <strong>ADAMTS13,&nbsp;</strong>which&nbsp;normally <strong>cleaves multimers</strong> of<strong>&nbsp;vWF</strong>. <strong>Failure to cleave</strong> these multimers results in <strong>excessive platelet adhesion </strong>and<strong> aggregation</strong>. This causes&nbsp;platelet thrombi and fibrin deposits to form at various sites in the circulation. These thrombi result in the <strong>classic pentad</strong> of clinical features:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)</li>\n<li>Thrombocytopenia</li>\n<li>Renal failure</li>\n<li>Neurologic findings</li>\n<li>Fever</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>platelet thrombi narrow</strong> the vessel <strong>lumen,</strong>&nbsp;causing&nbsp;<strong>shearing stress</strong> on the red blood cells that are passing through. This results in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The same <strong>platelet thrombi&nbsp;</strong>cause <strong>microvascular occlusion</strong> and result in features like<strong> renal failure</strong> and <strong>neurological manifestations</strong>. On <strong>peripheral smear</strong>, these fragmented red cells appear as <strong>schistocytes</strong> or <strong>helmet cells,</strong> as shown in the image below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7698db7a0b9c479d9e61b2dc0d1b4fd4x754x594.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MAHA is an example of<strong> intravascular hemolysis</strong>. It causes an <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>free hemoglobin</strong> in the blood, which is <strong>taken up by haptoglobin</strong>. This <strong>reduces free haptoglobin</strong> in the blood. Moreover, the activation of the coagulation cascade is not of primary importance in TTP and HUS, and hence the <strong>coagulation studies are usually normal</strong>. The mainstay of <strong>treatment</strong> of TTP is <strong>therapeutic plasma exchange</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other causes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Most common)</li>\n<li>Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)</li>\n<li>Malignant hypertension</li>\n<li>Systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\n<li>Disseminated cancer&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Immune thrombocytopenic purpura</strong> occurs as a <strong>chronic</strong> <strong>disease</strong> in adults with several episodes over time, usually <strong>following infections</strong>.&nbsp;It presents as mucocutaneous bleeding and very low platelet counts. These patients have abnormally l<strong>arge platelets (megathrobocytes)</strong> in the peripheral smear, which is a sign of accelerated thrombopoiesis. <strong>Coagulation</strong> <strong>studies</strong> are <strong>normal</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Disseminated intravascular coagulation&nbsp;</strong>refers to the<strong> widespread intravascular clot formation</strong>, commonly due to sepsis, trauma, and obstetric complications. These patients present with petechiae, ecchymoses, and&nbsp;<strong>oozing from venipuncture sites.</strong>&nbsp;They do not display the classic pentad seen in TTP. Schistocytes may be present on peripheral smears. <strong>Deranged clotting parameters</strong> are seen and <strong>fibrin degradation products</strong> such as D-dimers are <strong>elevated</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Hemolytic uremic syndrome</strong> is a disorder seen predominantly in <strong>children</strong>, following an episode of <strong>bloody diarrhea</strong>. <strong><em>Escherichia coli</em> O157:H7</strong> is most commonly the cause of this diarrhea. It can also present with&nbsp;acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia, but <strong>neurological manifestations are less common</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Differences between TTP and HUS</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TTP</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>HUS</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Causative agent</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>A deficiency of, or antibodies to the metalloprotease ADAMTS13</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>E. coli (O157: H7)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GI prodrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Uncommon</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Often</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Age group affected</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Adults</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Children</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Sex affected</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Females</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No sex predilection</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Relapses</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Common</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rare</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Renal impairment</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Usually mild</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Often severe</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Severe thrombocytopenia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Often</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rare</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><strong>Pentad of TTP and triad of HUS</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f1004c9ccec548288509c1eaed783d3fx1280x1840.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Indications of Plasma exchange Therapy</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Speciality</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Condition</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Neurology</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Acute Guillain Barre syndrome</p>\n<p>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy</p>\n<p>Myasthenia gravis</p>\n<p>Polyneuropathy associated with paraproteinaemias</p>\n<p>PANDAS</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hematology</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura</p>\n<p>Atypical hemolytic-uraemic syndrome</p>\n<p>Hyperviscosity syndromes</p>\n<p>Severe/symptomatic cryoglobulinemia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Renal</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Goodpasture&rsquo;s syndrome</p>\n<p>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis</p>\n<p>Recurrent focal segmental glomerular sclerosis</p>\n<p>Antibody-mediated renal transplant rejection</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Metabolic</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Familial hypercholesterolemia</p>\n<p>Fulminant Wilson&rsquo;s disease</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

A <strong>positive turtle sign</strong> may be seen which refers to a definite <strong>recoil</strong> of the<strong> head back</strong> against the perineum.

As a result, there is increased excretion of orotic acid in urine.</p>\n<p>The condition is characterized by <strong>hypochromic megaloblastic anemia</strong> that is <strong>unresponsive to vitamin B12 and folic acid</strong>, growth retardation, and neurologic abnormalities.</p>\n<p>Treatment includes,<strong> the administration of uridine</strong> (100–200 mg/kg per day), which corrects anemia, reduces orotic acid excretion, and improves the other sequelae of the disorder.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Option A:</strong> <strong>Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase</strong> is responsible for the <strong>degradation</strong> of <strong>uracil and thymine</strong>. Deficiency of the enzyme causes excessive urinary excretion of uracil and thymine. Clinical features are nonspecific cerebral dysfunction with <strong>convulsive</strong> disorders, <strong>motor</strong> retardation, and <strong>mental</strong> retardation. There is no specific treatment available.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Pyrimidine 5′- nucleotidase</strong> catalyzes the <strong>removal</strong> of the<strong> phosphate group</strong> from pyrimidine ribonucleoside monophosphates (cytidine-5′-monophosphate or UMP). Deficiency of this enzyme causes <strong>hemolytic anemia</strong> with prominent basophilic stippling of erythrocytes. The accumulation of pyrimidines or cytidine diphosphate choline induces hemolysis. Acquired pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase deficiency is seen in <strong>lead poisoning</strong> and in <strong>thalassemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: Deficiency of <strong>xanthine oxidase</strong> causes <strong>hereditary xanthinuria</strong>. This results in all purine in the urine occurring in the form of hypoxanthine and xanthine.

MG shows a <strong>decremental</strong> <strong>response</strong> on repetitive nerve stimulation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MG is an <strong>autoimmune disorder</strong> most commonly caused by <strong>antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR)</strong>. These antibodies cause damage to the postsynaptic muscle membrane and increased endocytosis of the AChR. This autoimmune response against the AChR seems to be mediated by the thymus.

There is some <strong>thymic abnormality in most patients</strong> with MG. <strong>Thymic hyperplasia</strong> is seen in <strong>65%</strong> of the patients, and <strong>thymomas</strong> are seen in<strong> 10%</strong> of the patients.

Ventricular <strong>filling</strong> is <strong>normal</strong> <strong>early</strong> in the diastole but <strong>stops suddenly</strong> when the elastic limit of the pericardium is reached. <strong>Y-descent</strong> on the JVP curve is <strong>prominent</strong> in constrictive pericarditis because it represents the rapid early filling of the ventricles.

This allows it to replicate unchecked. <em>M. tuberculosis</em> recruits a <strong>host protein coronin</strong> to block the fusion of phagosome and lysosome. <strong>Th1 response</strong> to M. tuberculosis is mounted about <strong>three weeks</strong> following the infection. The antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present mycobacterial antigens to the T-cells in the lymph nodes and release IL-12 and IL-18 to cause the differentiation of T-cells into <strong>Th1 cells </strong>(option B).</p>\n<p>Th1 cells produce <strong>IFN-γ</strong>. IFN-γ is the critical step in the body's defense against<em> M. tuberculosis</em>. It acts by activating<strong> macrophages </strong>(option C), causing maturation<strong> </strong>of<strong> phagolysosome</strong>, and inducing nitric oxide synthase enzyme to form more reactive nitrogen species.

The excess phenylalanine in the blood is metabolized to phenyl ketones (<strong>phenylpyruvate</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>phenylacetate</strong>)&nbsp;which are <strong>excreted in the urine</strong> and are termed phenylketonuria.

Decreased intestinal absorption of tryptophan in conjunction with its increased renal loss leads to its reduced bioavailability. This <strong>hampers</strong> <strong>niacin</strong> <strong>synthesis</strong>, and Hartnup disorder can thus present with manifestations of niacin deficiency (<strong>pellagra</strong>) like diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia.</p>\n<p>The major clinical manifestation is<strong> cutaneous photosensitivity</strong>. The skin becomes erythematous after sun exposure and might develop a <strong>pellagra-like rash</strong> and eczema over time. Some patients might have <strong>intermittent ataxia</strong> manifested as unsteady, wide-based gait. Cognitive development is usually normal, but there may be <strong>episodic psychiatric manifestations</strong> such as irritability, emotional instability, and depression.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The diagnosis of Hartnup disorder is established by typical clinical history and the <strong>presence of neutral amino acids in the urine</strong>. <strong>Urinary excretion of other amino acids remains normal</strong>, which differentiates it from causes of generalized aminoaciduria like Fanconi syndrome.&nbsp;<strong>Treatment</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>nicotinamide</strong> and a high-protein diet gives a good response in symptomatic patients.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Benedict's test&nbsp;</strong>detects the excretion of<strong>&nbsp;reducing substances&nbsp;</strong>in the urine. About 0.5 ml of urine is boiled with 5 ml of Benedict's reagent for 2 minutes. The formation of a precipitate is observed on cooling. The test is semi-quantitative and the color of the precipitate roughly parallels the concentration of reducing sugar.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Guthrie bacterial inhibition</strong>&nbsp;test is a screening test for phenylketonuria.

The reagent is resorcinol in HCl. 3 ml of the reagent and 0.5 ml of urine are heated for 30 seconds up to a boiling point.

A suit <strong>filed after two years will be dismissed</strong>. But, where a breach of duty to provide care as per a particular contract between a patient and a doctor is committed, legal action can be initiated <strong>up to three years</strong> from the date of alleged negligence.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Contributory negligence</h3><p><strong>Contributory negligence</strong> occurs when a <strong>patient</strong> or his <strong>personal attendant</strong> shows unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care, which when combined with the negligence of the doctor, has contributed to the injury. In this case, the patient&rsquo;s or attendant&rsquo;s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.</p>\n<p>So, contributory negligence occurs when <strong>both the doctor and patient are negligent</strong>. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient&rsquo;s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the<strong> patient:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.</li>\n<li>Fails to follow the doctor&rsquo;s instructions</li>\n<li>Refuses to take the treatment</li>\n<li>Leaves the hospital against doctor&rsquo;s advice</li>\n<li>Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contributory negligence is a defence </strong>for doctor&rsquo;s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the <strong>doctrine of comparative negligence</strong>, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>no</strong> <strong>proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is negligent</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<strong>Last clear chance doctrine: </strong>It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>gave proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (<strong>There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

If accompanied by appropriate history, papilledema is considered the <strong>diagnostic sign</strong> of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>initial evaluation</strong> of patients suspected of elevated CSF pressure is done with an <strong>MRI, including an MR angiogram</strong>. Measurement of CSF pressure using <strong>lumbar puncture</strong> can also be done. High opening pressure and improvement in the headache following CSF removal are considered diagnostic if papilledema is absent. <strong>CT</strong> of the <strong>head</strong> is often <strong>normal</strong>, but may show empty sella in some patients.&nbsp;<strong>Initial treatment</strong> is with <strong>diet</strong> and <strong>lifestyle modifications</strong> targeted at achieving the ideal BMI. The first-line pharmacotherapy is with&nbsp;<strong>Acetazolamide</strong>. If ineffective, Topiramate is the next drug of choice. Patients in whom <strong>chronic papilledema</strong> is <strong>threatening vision</strong>, <strong>optic nerve sheath fenestration</strong>, or lumbo-peritoneal shunt may be considered.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Cluster headaches</strong> present with a unilateral, <strong>stabbing,</strong> and <strong>deep-seated type of pain</strong>. They are accompanied by <strong>congestion</strong> and <strong>watering</strong> of the <strong>ipsilateral eye</strong>&nbsp;and nasal congestion. <strong>Papilledema</strong> is <strong>absent</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Normal pressure hydrocephalus</strong> presents with a characteristic clinical triad of ataxia in the form of <strong>wide-based gait (magnetic gait)</strong>, <strong>urinary incontinence,</strong> and <strong>dementia</strong>. Since intracranial pressure is normal, there will be <strong>no papilledema</strong> in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Migraine&nbsp;</strong>presents as a <strong>unilateral throbbing</strong> headache, usually accompanied by features like nausea, <strong>vomiting</strong>, and <strong>sensitivity to light and sound</strong>.&nbsp;It may be preceded by an <strong>aura</strong>, which is usually some form of visual disturbance. On <strong>examination</strong>, the patient is usually <strong>normal</strong>. There may be some <strong>neurological deficits</strong>, but they are <strong>transient</strong>. <strong>Papilledema</strong> is <strong>absent</strong>.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Simplified diagnostic criteria for migraine</h3><p>Repeated attacks of headache lasting 4-72 h in patients with a normal physical examination with no other reasonable cause for the headache, and</p>\n<p><strong>At least 2 of the following features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unilateral pain</li>\n<li>Throbbing pain</li>\n<li>Aggravation by movement</li>\n<li>Moderate or severe intensity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Plus at least 1 of the following features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nausea/vomiting</li>\n<li>Photophobia and phonophobia</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgia</h3><p><strong>Types of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cluster headache</li>\n<li>Paroxysmal hemicranias</li>\n<li>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT)</li>\n<li>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform&nbsp;<em>headache</em>&nbsp;attacks with cranial autonomic features (SUNA)</li>\n<li>Hemicrania continua</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Cluster headache</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Paroxysmal hemicrania&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;SUNCT/SUNA</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gender&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Males&gt;females</td>\n<td>Female=Males</td>\n<td>Female=Males</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Character of pain&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Stabbing /boring</td>\n<td>Throbbing pain&nbsp;/stabbing /boring</td>\n<td>Burning /stabbing/sharp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severity of pain&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Excruciating&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Excruciating</td>\n<td>Severe to excruciating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Site of pain&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Orbit, temple</td>\n<td>Orbit, temple</td>\n<td>Periorbital</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Attack frequency&nbsp;</td>\n<td>1-8 /day</td>\n<td>1-20/day</td>\n<td>3-200/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Duration</td>\n<td>15min-3 hours</td>\n<td>2-30 min</td>\n<td>5-240seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Migraneous feature&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alcohol trigger&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cutaneous trigger</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response to indomethacin</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Abortive treatment</td>\n<td>\n<p>100% oxygen</p>\n<p>Sumatriptan injection</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No effective treatment</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>IV lidocaine&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prophylaxis</td>\n<td>\n<p>Chronic cluster</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lithium</li>\n<li>Verapamil</li>\n<li>Methysergide</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Episodic cluster&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steroids&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Verapamil</li>\n<li>Methysergide</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Indomethacin</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Lamotrigine</li>\n<li>Topiramate</li>\n<li>Gabapentin</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Indomethacin</strong> is effective in paroxysmal hemicrania,hemicrania continuum, and primary sexual/ exercise headache</li>\n<li>Cutaneous trigger is also seen in trigeminal neuralgia, however, <strong>trigeminal neuralgia</strong> is a <strong>separate entity </strong>and not a part of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>",

It most commonly arises from the <strong>adrenal glands</strong>, followed by sites along the sympathetic chain, such as the paravertebral region of the abdomen and posterior mediastinum. Neuroblastoma is derived from <strong>primordial neural crest cells</strong> which populate these sites. In young children, they present as large <strong>abdominal masses</strong> with fever and weight loss. They can also metastasize widely and present with symptoms related to other systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>90% of neuroblastoma produce <strong>catecholamines</strong>. Urinary levels of <strong>VMA</strong> and <strong>HVA</strong> act as important <strong>tumor markers</strong> and help in making the diagnosis of the disease. Despite the elaboration of catecholamines, <strong>hypertension is less frequent</strong> in these tumors compared to pheochromocytoma. Histologically, neuroblastoma show small, primitive-appearing cells with dark nuclei&nbsp;&mdash; and thus may be difficult to differentiate from other <strong>small round blue cell</strong> tumors. The background shows faintly <strong>eosinophilic fibrillary material (neuropil)</strong> which represents the neuritic processes of the primitive neuroblasts. Around the neuropil, the <strong>tumor cells</strong> are <strong>arranged concentrically</strong>. This is referred to as <strong>Homer-Wright pseudorosettes</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The dominant clinical feature in <strong>pheochromocytoma</strong> is <strong>hypertension</strong>. Most patients have <strong>paroxysmal episodes</strong>, which are abrupt elevations in blood pressure. They are accompanied by <strong>tachycardia</strong>, <strong>palpitations</strong>, <strong>headache</strong>, and sweating. Lab diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is based on the demonstration of <strong>increased urinary excretion</strong> of <strong>free catecholamines</strong> and their metabolites such as <strong>VMA</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma)</strong> usually presents as a <strong>unilateral abdominal mass</strong>, abdominal pain, <strong>hypertension</strong>, and gross <strong>hematuria</strong>. Wilms tumor thrombus can extend into the inferior vena cava and the right atrium. Laboratory findings that can be seen include <strong>polycythemia</strong> and <strong>thrombocytosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Hepatoblastoma</strong> presents as an <strong>asymptomatic mass in the right upper quadrant</strong> of the abdomen. It mostly arises from the right lobe of the liver. Patients have <strong>non-specific symptoms</strong> such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, and anorexia. A biopsy of the liver mass is necessary to make the diagnosis. <strong>Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)</strong> is a useful tumor marker that is used in diagnosis and monitoring.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/865333df5e6d4bc6944f21720fcf027cx1280x1096.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
