      "solution": "<p><strong>Rifaximin</strong> has a role in the <strong>treatment of hepatic encephalopathy</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>mainstay</strong> of <strong>treatment</strong> of hepatic encephalopathy is the use of <strong>lactulose</strong>. Lactulose is a <strong>non-absorbable disaccharide</strong> that is <strong>catabolized by the colonic flora</strong> into acidic compounds, thus r<strong>educing the colonic pH to acidic</strong>. This reduction in pH leads to the<strong> formation of non-absorbable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup></strong> from NH3, thus <strong>reducing the plasma ammonia</strong> levels. Lactulose also <strong>increases the hyperosmolar load</strong> on the colon, <strong>improving gastrointestinal transit </strong>and reducing the time for ammonia reabsorption.</p>\n<p><strong>Adjunctive</strong> <strong>therapy</strong> for hepatic encephalopathy includes the administration of <strong>antibiotics with poor systemic absorption</strong>. <strong>Rifaximin</strong> reduces the recurrences of encephalopathy episodes in patients with cirrhosis.</p>\n<p>There is <strong>no role of protein restriction</strong> in the treatment of encephalopathy because of the <strong>overall negative effect </strong>of this step <strong>on the nutritional status</strong> of the patient.</p>",

Hypomania mainly includes symptoms like <strong>persistently elevated </strong>or<strong> irritable mood</strong> and abnormally <strong>increased energy</strong> lasting for at least&nbsp;<strong>4 consecutive days.</strong> The depression seen in cyclothymia does not qualify the criteria for a major depressive episode.</p>\n<p>Around half of the patients complain of <strong>depression</strong> as their <strong>major symptom</strong> but some may have primarily hypomanic symptoms. Most of these patients have <strong>problems</strong> in their <strong>social</strong> and <strong>professional lives</strong> due to this disorder. The mood changes are abrupt and occur within hours leading to a great amount of stress. This makes patients feel that they are out of control.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Substances like <strong>alcohol, benzodiazepines</strong>, or <strong>marijuana</strong> are often used to self-medicate. In some cases during the hypomanic state patients may take cocaine, amphetamines, or hallucinogens to further stimulate themselves.</p>\n<p>The <strong>DSM-5 criteria</strong> for diagnosis of cyclothymia:</p>\n<p>A. For at least <strong>2 years</strong> (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been many periods with <strong>hypomanic</strong> symptoms <strong>not meeting the criteria</strong> for a <strong>manic</strong> <strong>episode</strong> and many periods with <strong>depressive</strong> symptoms <strong>not meeting the criteria</strong> for a <strong>major depressive episode.</strong></p>\n<p>B. During the above 2-year period (1 year in children and adolescents), the hypomanic and depressive periods have been present for at least half the time and the individual has not had a <strong>symptom-free interval</strong> of more than <strong>2 months.</strong></p>\n<p>C. Criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have never been met.</p>\n<p>D. The symptoms in criterion A are not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.</p>\n<p>E. The symptoms cannot be explained by the physiological effects of a substance or any other medical condition.</p>\n<p>F. The symptoms cause significant difficulties in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.</p>\n<p>Mood stabilizers like<strong> lithium</strong> and antimanic drugs like <strong>sodium valproate</strong>&nbsp;are the first lines of treatment. <strong>Psychotherapy</strong> is a great way for patients to develop coping mechanisms to help with their mood swings. Patients often require <strong>life-long treatment.</strong></p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Major depressive disorder</strong> usually presents with depressed mood, anhedonia, significant change in weight or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness nearly every day. These symptoms are&nbsp;present for a minimum of <strong>2 weeks.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Adjustment disorder </strong>is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms that develop&nbsp;<strong>within 3 months of exposure</strong>&nbsp;to an identifiable stressor and usually&nbsp;<strong>do not last more than 6 months</strong>&nbsp;after the stressor ends.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Dysthymic&nbsp;disorder&nbsp;</strong>is the presence of a persistently depressed mood that lasts most of the day and is continuous. There are also feelings of guilt, irritability, and anger associated with it. These symptoms are present for at least 2 years.&nbsp;It is distinguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that patients mention that they have always been depressed.

It is most common in North America and is also called&nbsp;<strong>North American Blastomycosis.</strong></p>\n<p>Humans are infected by the<strong>&nbsp;inhalation of spores</strong>&nbsp;in contaminated soil.</p>\n<p>Blastomycosis can present in&nbsp;<strong>three </strong>forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pulmonary infection</strong> - can be asymptomatic, focal or diffuse consolidation, military lesions or abscess formation.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Disseminated disease</strong> - can lead to multiple abscesses and has high fatality.</li>\n<li><strong>Cutaneous disease</strong> over the skin of the face.

Invasive&nbsp;or severe cases are treated with <strong>amphotericin B</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong><em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em></strong> is a dimorphic fungus causing histoplasmosis. Infection is acquired by inhalation. Most infections are asymptomatic but infection of the reticuloendothelial system manifests as lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, fever, and anemia and it is highly fatal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C- <strong><em>Coccidiodes immitis&nbsp;</em></strong>is also a dimorphic fungus causing coccidiomycosis. Infection is acquired through inhalation of dust-containing spores of the fungus. Mostly they are asymptomatic and a self-limiting influenza-like fever termed valley fever or desert rheumatism develops in some individuals. The infection leads to lifetime immunity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D- <em><strong>Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis</strong></em> is again a dimorphic fungus causing paracoccidioidomycosis also termed <strong>South American blastomycosis</strong>. Infection is initially acquired by the inhalation of spores causing primary pulmonary infection. It spreads to the mucosa of the nose, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and lymphatics by hematogenous spread resulting in ulcerative granulomas of the buccal and nasal mucosa.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Systemic fungi - Histopathological findings</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0eb743b778a54477a01712589ecfe242x958x666.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Histoplasma</strong>: Tiny oval yeast cells (2- 4 &mu;m size) with narrow-based budding within the macrophages with an underlying granulomatous response.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/540a9635ff20406ca14c9f44eabab597x958x649.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Blastomyces</strong> : Thick-walled round yeast cells of 8- 15 &mu;m size with single broad-based budding (figure of 8 appearance)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b92b3162957241d9aad7ef723c0cd59ex958x656.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Coccidoides</strong> : Mature spherules of coccidioidomycus is seen in the above image.

The incidence rate is expressed in <strong>person-time</strong> units, usually per 1000 per year. It is given by the following formula:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6f6cc8bc207d4585865b98fbe2659e6ax1280x274.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>It is generally used for <strong>acute illnesses. </strong>It provides insight into the <strong>effectiveness of health services and programs. </strong>Incidence can be determined from <strong>cohort studies and longitudinal studies.</strong></p>\n<p>The incidence rate of <strong>spells of sickness</strong> =  (Number of spells of sickness starting in the specified period/Mean number of people exposed to that risk in the specified time) x <strong>1000.</strong></p>\n<p>Special types of incidence rates:</p>\n<p>1.<strong> Attack rate: </strong>It is used when there is a risk for a limited period of time.</p>\n<p>2.<strong> Secondary attack rate: </strong>It is the number of exposed persons developing the disease within the range of incubation period following exposure to a primary case.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prevalence in Epidemiology:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prevalence is the proportion of all cases, <strong>old and new</strong>, of a particular disease at a given point in time or over a period of time in a given population.

The <strong>test used to confirm</strong> the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is the <strong>ACTH stimulation test </strong>(also known as the <strong>short cosyntropin test</strong> or <strong>short Synacthen test</strong>).</p>\n<p><strong>ACTH stimulation test</strong> involves the <strong>administration of an exogenous, synthetic peptide</strong> that has an <strong>activity similar to ACTH</strong> on the adrenal glands. <strong>Serum cortisol</strong> levels are <strong>measured prior to, and after the administration</strong> of the synthetic peptide. <strong>Cortisol levels lower than the cut-off</strong> value indicate a <strong>failure of the adrenal glands to increase the production of cortisol</strong> in response to synthetic ACTH — thus <strong>confirming the diagnosis</strong> of adrenal insufficiency. Note that this will be <strong>seen in both primary and secondary</strong> adrenal insufficiency.</p>\n<p>Adrenal insufficiency can be divided into:</p>\n<p><strong>Primary adrenal insufficiency</strong> <strong>(Addison's disease)</strong> is most commonly due to <strong>autoimmune adrenalitis</strong>. These patients are likely to develop other autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo, premature ovarian failure, and autoimmune thyroid disease. Other causes of Addison's disease include <strong>destruction of the adrenal gland due to infections such as TB</strong>, <strong>hemorrhage</strong> (<strong>Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome</strong> due to meningococcemia) or <strong>infiltration</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary adrenal insufficiency</strong> occurs due to hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction. This can include <strong>iatrogenic suppression</strong> due to chronic therapy with glucocorticoids, or because of <strong>pituitary</strong> and <strong>hypothalamic</strong> <strong>tumors</strong>.<strong> Pituitary apoplexy</strong> because of hypovolemic shock during parturition <strong>(Sheehan syndrome)</strong> can also cause secondary adrenal insufficiency.</p>\n<p>The patients present with <strong>fatigue</strong> and <strong>loss of energy</strong>. Primary adrenal insufficiency causes <strong>hyperpigmentation due to excess ACTH</strong>, which stimulates the melanocytes to produce more pigment. Hyperpigmentation is <strong>maximally seen in areas exposed to sunlight</strong> or that which <strong>undergo friction</strong>. However, <strong>secondary adrenal insufficiency</strong> presents with<strong> skin paleness</strong> due to the complete absence of ACTH. </p>\n<p>The <strong>diagnosis</strong> of adrenal insufficiency is <strong>established by the ACTH stimulation test</strong> as described above.

It is done in order to <strong>prevent the complications</strong> that might occur if the testes continue to remain inside the abdomen, such as <strong>infertility</strong> and the<strong> risk of malignancy</strong>. The surgery is usually <strong>performed between the ages of 6 months to 18 months.</strong> The testes and the spermatic cord are mobilized, the fibrous adhesions around the deep ring are divided, and the <strong>testes are repositioned</strong> in the scrotum, in a <strong>pouch constructed</strong> <strong>between</strong> the <strong>dartos muscle</strong> <strong>and</strong> the <strong>skin</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cryptorchidism</strong> refers to the <strong>incomplete descent of the testes</strong>, <strong>but in their normal path </strong>from the abdomen to the scrotum. <strong>If</strong> they <strong>lie outside</strong> the <strong>normal path</strong>, they are referred to as <strong>ectopic testes</strong>. The occurrence of <strong>cryptorchidism</strong> is more common in <strong>premature infants</strong>. In two-thirds of the cases, the testes will reach the scrotum by 3 months of life; full descent after this time is unlikely. The descent of the testes may be arrested in any of the following positions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abdominal (15%)</li>\n<li>Inguinal (25%)</li>\n<li><strong>High up in the scrotum (60%)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">Undescended testes can give rise to a number of more <strong>serious consequences</strong>. This includes <strong>infertility</strong>, <strong>testicular malignancy</strong>, and <strong>testicular torsion.</strong> By the second year of life, there is a significant degeneration of the spermatogenic tissue. An <strong>orchidopexy done during adulthood (after puberty)</strong> will result in <strong>no significant fertility benefits</strong> and <strong>no reduction in the risk of testicular malignancy</strong>. Therefore, <strong>orchidopexy should be done as early as possible within the recommended age </strong>to prevent the occurrence of these complications.&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">One important <strong>differential</strong> to be considered in these patients is <strong>retractile testis</strong>. Because of the strong cremasteric reflex, the stimulation of the scrotal skin causes the testis to ascend upwards and disappear into the inguinal canal. If it is a case of <strong>retractile testis</strong>, the <strong>scrotal skin will be well developed</strong>, in contrast to the <strong>underdeveloped scrotal skin seen in cryptorchidism</strong>. Further, the retractile testis that has ascended into the inguinal canal can be gently milked downwards, but this is not the case with true undescended testis.</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1337\">In <strong>most cases</strong> of cryptorchidism, the <strong>testis can be palpated in the inguinal region </strong>and thus local exploration and orchidopexy can be done. In cases when the testis is not palpable, <strong>ultrasound</strong> and <strong>laparoscopy</strong> are done <strong>to pinpoint the location of the testis </strong>and plan further management. The diagnostic and treatment algorithm is given below.</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f530ca2dd23449229702cac5bd6d370cx1280x1611.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

Subsequently, additional enzymes produced in activated neutrophils, like myeloperoxidase (MPO) and elastase, penetrate the nucleus and induce further chromatin relaxation. This process eventually leads to the disruption of the nuclear membrane and the release of chromatin.</p>\n<p>NETs are <strong>networks </strong>of <strong>extracellular fibers</strong> that consist of a viscous meshwork of nuclear chromatin. They <strong>trap microbes</strong> at sites of infection, preventing their further spread. They also contain a high concentration of <strong>antimicrobial proteins</strong> like neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and histones that have a high affinity for DNA.</p>\n<p>They are <strong>produced by neutrophils</strong> in response to the following triggers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pathogens </strong>- <strong>Mainly bacteria and fungi</strong></li>\n<li>Inflammatory mediators<strong> -</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Chemokines</li>\n<li>Cytokines (mainly interferons)</li>\n<li>Complement proteins</li>\n<li>Reactive oxygen species</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NETs have also been detected in the blood during <strong>sepsis.</strong> In this condition,<strong> platelet activation</strong> is involved in the NET formation. The <strong>nuclear chromatin</strong> in the <strong>NETs</strong> is a <strong>source</strong> of <strong>nuclear antigens</strong> (histones and associated DNA) in systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (<strong>SLE</strong>). This triggers autoantibody production and further clinical manifestations.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Superoxide dismutases</strong> (SODs) are present in various cell types and play a role in converting<strong> oxygen (</strong>O2) <strong>into hydrogen peroxide</strong> (H2O2). This group of enzymes consists of manganese-SOD, which is predominantly found in mitochondria, and copper-zinc-SOD, which is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Their function is to assist in the <strong>elimination of free radicals.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated through the swift assembly and activation of a complex oxidase known as <strong>NADPH oxidase</strong>, or <strong>phagocyte oxidase</strong>. This oxidase facilitates the conversion of <strong>oxygen into superoxide anions.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: Nuclear alterations in necrosis occur due to the degradation of DNA. One pattern involves the fading of chromatin basophilia, known as <strong>karyolysis</strong>, which likely occurs due to the enzymatic breakdown of DNA by <strong>endonucleases</strong>.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical image shows <strong>rectal prolapse</strong>. A history of <strong>irreducible rectal prolapse</strong> with <strong>severe</strong> and <strong>continuous pain</strong> is <strong>suggestive of incarcerated rectal prolapse</strong>, most likely getting <strong>strangulated</strong>. In such a case, the <strong>surgery of choice is Altemeier's procedure</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Altemeier's procedure</strong> is a <strong>perineal approach surgery</strong> for <strong>rectal prolapse</strong>. It involves prolapsing the rectum through the anal canal, followed by <strong>full-thickness resection of the rectum</strong>. Following this, colorectal continuity is established by stapled or hand-sewn anastomosis. Since the procedure involves full-thickness resection of the rectum, it is the <strong>surgery of choice for</strong> patients who are presenting with <strong>incarcerated (irreducible) or strangulated (compromised vascularity) rectal prolapse</strong>.</p>\n<p>When the layers of the rectum protrude through the anal orifice, it is termed rectal prolapse. Depending on the layers which protrude out, it can be divided as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <strong>partial rectal prolapse, </strong>only the <strong>mucosal layer</strong> of the rectum is <strong>prolapsed</strong>. It is often seen in <strong>children</strong>. The first episode is <strong>managed by digital repositioning</strong>. If there is a recurrence, then injection sclerotherapy is done. </li>\n<li><strong>Complete rectal prolapse </strong>or<strong> full-thickness prolapse </strong>involves<strong> all the layers</strong> of the rectum. It is most often seen in <strong>adults</strong> due to the weakening of the pelvic floor and chronic straining. The surgical approaches to manage complete rectal prolapse are given below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Perineal approaches</strong> have the advantage of <strong>minimal post-op pain</strong>, <strong>early mobility</strong> of the patient, and <strong>lower morbidity</strong> due to the surgery. However, they are associated with <strong>higher recurrence</strong> compared to the abdominal approaches. Perineal approaches include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thiersch's procedure </strong>involves the<strong> placement of a steel wire/nylon tape</strong>, is placed around the anal canal. This is rarely done now because it is associated with chronic perineal infection and stenosis of the anal canal.</li>\n<li><strong>Delorme's procedure </strong>involves circumferential <strong>stripping of the mucosa</strong> from the rectum throughout the length of the prolapse. The underlying <strong>muscle</strong> is then <strong>plicated</strong> with a series of sutures. The excess rectal mucosa is excised and a mucosal anastomosis is performed.</li>\n<li><strong>Altemeier's procedure </strong>has already been described above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Abdominal operations </strong>can be laparoscopic or open. They are associated with a <strong>higher risk of damage to the pelvic autonomic nerves</strong>, causing <strong>sexual dysfunction</strong>. Thus, perineal approaches are preferred in young patients.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anterior mesh rectopexy</strong> / <strong>Ripstein's procedure</strong> involves the suturing of a prosthetic mesh to the anterior part of the rectum and sacral promontory. </li>\n<li><strong>Posterior mesh rectopexy</strong> / <strong>Well's procedure</strong> involves suturing of a prosthetic mesh to the posterior part of the lower rectum and the sacral promontory.</li>\n<li><strong>Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy</strong> / <strong>D'Hoore's procedure</strong> involves suturing of a prosthetic mesh to the distal-most part of the anterior wall of the rectum and sacral promontory. In addition, the posterior part of the vagina is sutured to the mesh, thus reinforcing the rectovaginal septum.</li>\n</ul>",

The inhaled carbon particles are engulfed by the lung macrophages and then accumulate in the connective tissue along the lymphatics or in lymphoid tissue along the bronchi or the hilum, blackening the tissues.

Unlike asbestosis, this condition does not predispose to cancer.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Panacinar emphysema</strong> is caused by <strong>alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency</strong>. It affects the entire acinus and primarily involves the lower lobes. It is not related to occupational exposures like mining but rather a genetic enzyme deficiency that leads to lung damage, making it an unlikely cause in this patient.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Paraseptal emphysema</strong> involves <strong>distal acinar </strong>destruction, often affecting subpleural areas. It is associated with <strong>spontaneous pneumothorax</strong> in young adults. Since this condition is not linked to prolonged dust exposure or mining, it is not the correct answer for this case.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Irregular emphysema</strong> occurs secondary to <strong>lung scarring</strong>, often due to previous infections or fibrosis rather than occupational lung diseases. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Some common pneumoconiosis</h3><div class=\"page\"

However, when the <strong>tension becomes too great</strong> and can cause damage to the muscle fibers, the contraction suddenly stops and the <strong>muscle relaxes</strong>. This is known as the <strong>inverse stretch reflex</strong>. </p>\n<p>The <strong>receptor</strong> for the inverse stretch reflex is the <strong>Golgi tendon organ</strong>. It <strong>lies in series</strong> with the muscle fibers and is <strong>stimulated by</strong> passive stretch and<strong> active contraction of the muscle</strong>, but mainly the latter. The Golgi tendon organ is<strong> innervated by type Ib sensory fibers</strong>. These fibers <strong>synapse with an inhibitory interneuron</strong> which terminates on the motor neuron innervating the same muscle. The <strong>inverse stretch reflex</strong> is thus <strong>disynaptic</strong>. Stimulation of the Golgi tendon organ brings about the <strong>relaxation of the muscle</strong>.</p>\n<p>Note: Reflex arcs in which interneurons are interposed between the afferent and efferent neurons are called polysynaptic reflexes. There can be anywhere from two to hundreds of synapses in a polysynaptic reflex arc.

This facilitates easy removal and allows the user to ensure that the IUD remains in the uterus.</p>\n<p>It acts by continuously releasing copper into the uterine cavity. This copper interferes with <strong>sperm transport</strong> and <strong>fertilization</strong> of the egg. If an IUCD is inserted within 5 days (120 hours) after coitus, it serves as an emergency contraceptive and is highly effective.</p>",
