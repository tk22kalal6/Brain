Ultrasound evaluation using eFAST to look for pericardium, pleural cavities, and abdomen in combination with plain radiographs of the chest and pelvis will usually identify the source of the bleed. </p>\n<p>In patients with persistent hypotension due to blunt trauma, the pelvis should be <strong>wrapped in a sheet</strong> for <strong>stabilization</strong> until radiography can be done. </p>\n<p>Evaluation of <strong>CVP</strong> or <strong>ultrasound of the IVC</strong> may further assist in <strong>distinguishing</strong> between cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock.</p>\n<p>It is mostly fatal if not controlled, and requires immediate management.
