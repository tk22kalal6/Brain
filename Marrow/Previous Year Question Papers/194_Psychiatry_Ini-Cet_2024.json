Rapid cycling disorder is more <strong>common </strong>in f<strong>emales</strong>.</p>\n<p>Rapid cycling disorder is diagnosed when the patient has a combination of<strong> 4 or more bipolar episodes within the last 12 months</strong>. Two separate episodes can be demarcated from one another by either switch in polarity or full/partial remission for at least 2 months. <strong>Manic </strong>and<strong> hypomanic</strong> episodes are considered to be on the same pole, hence a switch in polarity includes an episode of mania/hypomania with an episode of depression.</p>\n<p>Possible risk factors for rapid cycling disorder include <strong>female patients</strong>, <strong>diabetes</strong>, childhood abuse or family trauma, and alcoholism or substance abuse. Rapid-cycling bipolar patients are significantly more likely than non-rapid-cycling patients to have a lifetime history of comorbidities like anxiety disorders, ADHD, OCD, bulimia nervosa, and substance use disorders.</p>\n<p>The drug of choice for prophylaxis of rapid cycling disorder is <strong>valproate</strong></p>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p>Option B: Conditions like hypothyroidism and diabetes are possibly involved in some cases of rapid cycling .</p>\n<p>Option D: Usage of antidepressants could worsen rapid cycling in bipolar depression.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Supportive psychotherapy is not indicated in a person who has <strong>good motivation and control over frustration</strong>. Such individuals are better treated by <strong>expressive psychotherapy</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Supportive psychotherapy</strong> places major etiological emphasis on<strong> external </strong>rather than intrapsychic events, particularly on <strong>stressful</strong> <strong>environmental and interpersonal influences</strong> on a<strong> severely damaged self</strong>. The general aim of supportive treatment is the amelioration or relief of symptoms through behavioral or environmental restructuring within the existing psychic framework. This often means helping the patient to <strong>adapt better to problems</strong> and to live more comfortably with his or her psychopathology. </p>\n<p>Supportive therapy uses several methods, either singly or in combination, including warm, friendly, strong leadership; help in developing pleasurable activities (e.g., hobbies); removal of excessive strain, when possible; medication to alleviate symptoms; and guidance and advice in dealing with current issues. This therapy uses techniques to help patients feel <strong>secure</strong>, <strong>accepted</strong>, <strong>encouraged,</strong> and not anxious.</p>\n<p>Supportive psychotherapy is generally indicated for those patients for whom classic psychoanalysis or insight-oriented psychoanalytic psychotherapy is typically contraindicated- those who have <strong>poor ego strength</strong> and whose potential for <strong>decompensation is high</strong>.</p>\n<p>Amenable patients fall into the following major areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individuals in <strong>acute crisis</strong> or a temporary state of disorganization and inability to cope, whose intolerable life circumstances have produced <strong>extreme anxiety or sudden turmoil</strong> (e.g., individuals going through grief reactions, illness, divorce, job loss, or who were victims of crime, abuse, natural disaster, or accident);</li>\n<li>Patients with <strong>chronic severe pathology </strong>with fragile or <strong>deficient ego functioning</strong> (e.g., those with latent psychosis, impulse disorder, or severe character disturbance);</li>\n<li>Patients whose <strong>cognitive deficits and physical symptoms</strong> make them particularly<strong> vulnerable</strong> and, thus, unsuitable for an insight-oriented approach (e.g., certain psychosomatic or medically ill persons);</li>\n<li>Individuals who are <strong>psychologically unmotivated</strong> (e.g., patients who come to treatment in response to family or agency pressure and are interested only in immediate relief or those who need assistance in very specific problem areas of social adjustment as a possible prelude to more exploratory work).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because support forms a tacit part of every therapeutic modality, it is rarely contraindicated as such. The typical attitude regards better-functioning patients as unsuitable not because they will be harmed by a supportive approach, but because they will not be sufficiently benefited by it.</p>",
