      "solution": "<p>The clinical scenario depicting&nbsp;<strong>pruritic</strong> lesions at a <strong>flexural site</strong> along with a family history of <strong>atopy</strong> (asthma) is suggestive of <strong>atopic dermatitis&nbsp;</strong>(AD) or atopic eczema (AE).&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>scratch marks&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>excoriations</strong> shown in the image are due to pruritis, which is the hallmark feature of AD.</p>\n<p>AD is a&nbsp;<strong>chronic</strong>&nbsp;relapsing <strong>inflammatory&nbsp;</strong>condition. It presents with <strong>erythematous macules</strong>, papules and <strong>vesicles</strong> that often start in <strong>early</strong> childhood, usually less than 2 years old.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The lesions later&nbsp;become excoriated and <strong>lichenified</strong>. It is frequently associated with <strong>dryness</strong> of the skin and<strong>&nbsp;s</strong><strong>econdary infections.&nbsp;</strong>In infancy, the lesions initially appear on <strong>face</strong> (sparing the napkin area) and later on <strong>extensor</strong> aspect of knees and elbows as the child starts crawling. In later childhood and in adults, the principal site of involvement is <strong>flexures</strong>.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>filaggrin</strong> monomers in keratinocytes in the epidermis bind and aggregate keratin bundles and intermediate filaments to form the <strong>epidermal</strong> <strong>barrier</strong>. Any <strong>damage</strong>/<strong>dysfunction</strong> of this barrier is associated with an <strong>increased</strong> <strong>risk</strong> of developing AD.&nbsp;Damage to this barrier can be due to <strong>environmental</strong> <strong>factors</strong>&nbsp;(detergents, hard water, UV light) or <strong>local</strong> <strong>inflammatory</strong> reactions.&nbsp;Dysfunction of the barrier can be due to <strong>genetic</strong> <strong>mutation</strong> of the&nbsp;<strong>FLG</strong> gene leading to reduced filaggrin production or <strong>local</strong> <strong>immunomodulatory</strong> <strong>effects</strong>&nbsp;leading to reduced filaggrin expression.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Seborrheic dermatitis</strong> is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythema, pruritus, <strong>scaling</strong>, flaking, or crusting of the skin.
