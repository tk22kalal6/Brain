      "solution": "<p>A patient presenting with an obsession with contamination and repetitive handwashing is suggestive of classical&nbsp;<strong>obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</strong> and the best treatment option for this patient is<strong> exposure and response prevention (ERP)</strong>.</p>\n<p>First line management of OCD in adults can include<strong> pharmacotherapy </strong>or<strong> psychotherapy.&nbsp;</strong>Psychotherapy is primarily based on <strong>exposure and response prevention.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Exposure and response prevention</strong> is a form of exposure therapy that is included under behavioral therapy. It is a more <strong>specific</strong> treatment modality for <strong>OCD</strong> than CBT. It refers to exposing the patient to OCD-inducing situations and preventing them from exhibiting the usual compulsive responses. The level of exposure and control of response to it, is gradual and is decided by the therapist and the patient. The dose and duration of exposure and response prevention therapy should be sufficient for it to be effective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cognitive therapies aim to address distortions in thought like increased responsibility to clean hands by replacing them with adaptive thinking patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Pharmacotherapy</strong> consists of <strong>SSRIs</strong> and <strong>clomipramine</strong>. Pharmacotherapy is preferred in patients with severe symptoms or with <strong>co-morbid depression</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Combined therapy</strong> with Pharmacotherapy+ Psychotherapy are effective in patients not responding to either of them alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Somatic therapies</strong> like targeted neurosurgical lesions to cortico-striatal-thalamic cortical tracts (CSPC) and <strong>deep brain stimulation</strong> have proven efficacious in <strong>treatment-refractory patients</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy </strong>(Option D)<strong>&nbsp;with ERP </strong>for OCD is preferred in children and adolescents<strong>.&nbsp;Cognitive-Behavioral therapy</strong> comprises of a number of treatment patterns that include both cognitive and behavioral interventions. Cognitive therapy aims to correct maladaptive beliefs and behavioral therapy facilitates better functioning by reducing symptoms. Broadly, it is used to treat depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, eating disorders, substance use disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, insomnia, smoking, low back pain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT)</strong>&nbsp;is a long-term behavioral intervention that is used in <strong>borderline personality disorder</strong> and to reduce suicidal behavior in adults.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Systemic desensitization </strong>is counterconditioning the patient by approaching the feared situation gradually, in a relaxed state. It is useful in <strong>phobias, obsessions, compulsions</strong>, and some <strong>sexual disorders</strong>. It includes relaxation training, hierarchy construction and desensitization of the stimulus.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Obsessive-compulsive disorder</h3><p>Key points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most common:\n<ul>\n<li>Obsession: <strong>Contamination</strong></li>\n<li>Compulsion: <strong>Checking, cleaning</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Treatment: Exposure and Response prevention - 1st line, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy(CBT), CBT with ERP, Pharmacotherapy.</li>\n<li>Drug of choice:&nbsp;High dose <strong>SSRI</strong></li>\n<li>Treatment in nonresponsive patients:&nbsp;Clomipramine or antipsychotic augmentation</li>\n<li>Treatment of severe or refractory cases:&nbsp;<strong>Deep brain stimulation</strong></li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Neurotransmitters</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Neuro-transmitters</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Major source</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Function</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Increased in</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Decreased in</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Serotonin</strong></td>\n<td><span>Midline Raphe Nucleus</span>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Inhibitory</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><span>Regulation of mood, sleep, appetite, sexual behavior, decreases anxiety</span></p>\n<p><span>Inhibits the dopaminergic function</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Serotonin syndrome</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Depression</span></p>\n<p><span>OCD</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;<span>Substantia Nigra</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Inhibitory</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><span>Motor movement and alertness</span></p>\n<p><span>Reward seeking, pleasure, motivation</span></p>\n<p><span>Major neurotransmitter in the basal ganglia</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Schizophrenia</span></p>\n<p><span>OCD</span></p>\n<p><span>Mania</span></p>\n<p><span>Delirium</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Parkinson's disease</span></p>\n<p><span>Depression</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Endorphins</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;<span>Pituitary gland</span></td>\n<td><span>Pain control, feelings of pleasure, stress reduction, \"natural opium\"</span></td>\n<td><span>Addiction</span></td>\n<td><span>Inability to combat pain</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Acetylcholine</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;<span>Nucleus Basalis (of Meynert)</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Excitatory</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><span>Motor movement, learning and memory</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Parkinson's disease</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Alzheimer's disease</span></p>\n<p><span>Delirium</span></p>\n<p><span>Dementia</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>GABA</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Inhibitory</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><span>Decreases anxiety and reduces insomnia</span></p>\n<p><span>Interacts with dopamine, inhibits dopaminergic neurons</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Anxiety</span></p>\n<p><span>Seizure disorder</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Norepinephrine</strong></td>\n<td><span>Locus ceruleus</span>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Excitatory:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>\"Fight or flight\"</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Mania</span></td>\n<td><span>Lack of energy, anhedonia in Schizophrenia,&nbsp;</span><span>Depression</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Glutamate</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Excitatory</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><span>Links between neurons for learning and long term memory</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Seizures</span></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong> (OCD) is<strong> commonly associated</strong> with <strong>depression</strong>. The lifetime <strong>prevalence</strong> of the major depressive disorder in patients with OCD is <strong>67 percent</strong>. Other common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with OCD are social phobia, alcohol use disorders, panic, and personality disorders.</p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) comprises symptoms that include intrusive thoughts, preoccupations, and compulsions. These recurrent obses&shy;sions or compulsions cause severe distress to the patient.

They repeatedly wash their hands or avoid touching objects which are thought to be contaminated. In extreme cases, patients may rub the skin off their hands due to excessive hand washing or may refuse to leave the house in fear of germs.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pathological doubt</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;- This is the <strong>second most common</strong> symptom pattern. The patient presents with an obsession with doubt and a compulsion to check. This obsession arises due to possible danger or violence (e.g., forgetting to turn off&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">the stove or not locking a door) which is followed by multiple trips to check, for example, if the stove is turned off, if the door is locked, etc.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Intrusive thoughts</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;-This is the <strong>third most common</strong> symptom pattern. These patients have intrusive obsessional thoughts without compulsion. These thoughts could be sexual or an aggressive act that the patient doesn't agree. The patients might report themselves to the police or confess to a spiritual leader.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Symmetry</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;- This is the fourth most common pattern which can lead to a compulsion of slowness.

      "solution": "<p>In <strong>Korsakoff's psychosis</strong>, there is <strong>anterograde amnesia</strong> with loss of recent memory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Korsakoff's syndrome</strong> is a chronic amnestic syndrome that can follow Wernicke's syndrome. It is caused by thiamine deficiency that is associated with chronic alcohol abuse. The typical feature of this disease is <strong>anterograde amnesia </strong>with<strong> loss </strong>of<strong> recent memory</strong> in an alert and responsive patient.&nbsp;Patients with Korsakoff's syndrome also typically have a <strong>change in personality</strong>, with a lack of initiative, reduced spontaneity, and a lack of interest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The treatment is with <strong>100 mg of thiamine </strong>orally&nbsp;for 3-12 months. Despite adequate treatment and nutritional support, very few of the patients fully recover.&nbsp;With treatment, patients may remain amnestic for up to 3 months, and then improve gradually during the next year.</p>\n<p>Prolonged use of alcohol causes <strong>alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder</strong> with <strong>loss of short-term memory</strong>. When the symptoms are <strong>acute</strong>, it is called <strong>Wernicke's encephalopathy</strong> and when<strong> chronic</strong>, it leads to <strong>Korsakoff's syndrome</strong>.
