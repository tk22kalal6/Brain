      "solution": "The maneuver shown in the image is Lovset's maneuver, used for the delivery of extended arms in breech presentation.<br><br>The principle of this maneuver is based on the curved birth canal. The shoulder placement favorable for this maneuver is:<br><br>* anterior shoulder - above the symphysis pubis<br><br>* posterior shoulder - below the sacral promontory.<br><br>Rotating the trunk while keeping the back anterior and applying downward traction brings the posterior shoulder under the symphysis pubis.<br><br>The technique followed in Lovset's maneuver is <br><br>* The baby is grasped with both hands using a femoropelvic grip, keeping the thumbs parallel to the vertebral column. The maneuver should start only when the inferior angle of the anterior scapula is visible underneath the pubic arch.<br><br>* The baby is lifted slightly to cause lateral flexion. The trunk is rotated 180°, keeping the back anterior and maintaining downward traction.<br><br>* The trunk is then rotated in the reverse direction, keeping the back anterior, to deliver the former anterior shoulder under the symphysis pubis.<br><br>Lovset's maneuver can be employed in all types of arm displacement.

The Graafian follicle secretes 17-β-oestradiol, which produces proliferative changes in the endometrium. This oestrogen produces proliferative changes in the endometrium, secretes inhibin which inhibits further secretion of FSH, and stimulates LH receptors in the theca cells while also stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete LH.<br><br>* At ovulation (which occurs around day 14), the maximum peak of oestrogen secretion is seen about 48 hours before ovulation, whereas the LH surge occurs about 24–36 hours before ovulation. LH causes rupture of the follicle and formation of the corpus luteum.<br><br>* In the luteal phase (in this case), the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. As a result, progesterone levels rise markedly, while oestrogen is also moderately increased. These high levels exert negative feedback, so FSH and LH remain low.<br><br>* In the menstrual phase, in the absence of pregnancy, the corpus luteum regresses, leading to a decline in both oestrogen and progesterone levels. This fall removes the negative feedback, and gonadotropins begins to rise again, initiating recruitment of new follicles for the next cycle.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8d5ebfcc1da1424897cbb1ff64995863x1280x2327.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

Additionally, granulosa cell tumors rarely cause massive ascites, and they typically secrete inhibin, which is a marker for this tumour.<br><br>Option B: Sertoli–Leydig cell tumour are rare ovarian tumours that are androgen-producing, which causes defeminization followed by masculinization. They usually present with features such as flattening of breasts, amenorrhea, hirsutism, enlargement of the clitoris, and even breaking of the voice. Imaging often shows a gross appearance like that of other mesenchymomas, and CA-125 is usually not markedly elevated.<br><br>Option C: Immature teratoma is a rare tumour containing elements from multiple germ layers. They are mostly solid tumours with a trabeculated appearance. The solid part of the tumour contains cartilage, bone, and muscle, whereas hair and sebaceous material are found in the cystic spaces.

This is done by elevating the buttocks and tilting head back (trendelenberg position), and filling the bladder with fluid. These measures lift the presenting part off the cord and improve blood flow.<br><br>Vago's method is used in cord prolapse to alleviate pressure on the cord. Vagos method is also known as the bladder-filling method. Here, the bladder is distended with saline to push the presenting part higher up, thereby preventing compression in case of cord prolapse. The bladder is filled with 400–750 mL of normal saline with a Foley’s catheter. Then, the balloon is inflated and the catheter is clamped.<br><br>The management algorithm for cord prolapse is based on three important factors:<br><br>* Living or dead baby<br><br>* Viability of the baby<br><br>* Degree of cervical dilatation<br><br>The definitive treatment for cord prolapse is delivery by cesarean section when the baby is alive and mature as in this clinical scenario.

It is predominantly seen in multiparous women above the age of 40 years. Patients generally present with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic discomfort, and backache, while some patients are asymptomatic. On examination, there is a gross symmetrical enlargement of the uterus corresponding to a 12-14 week size. The uterus is soft and tender on bimanual examination.<br><br>TVS findings include alternating vertical stripes of hyperechoic and hypoechoic bands, which is called the Venetian blind appearance. On MRI, a diffuse, widened low-intensity junctional zone ≥12 mm predicts adenomyosis with high accuracy, while a junctional zone ≤8 mm excludes it with high accuracy. However, the only definitive mode of diagnosis is histopathological examination.<br><br>Since most women affected by the condition are past the childbearing age, total hysterectomy is the treatment of choice. Localised excision/Levonorgestrel-containing IUCD can be tried in younger women.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/aa955a2d570d4aac938126e7364dc481x1280x1362.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option A: Fibroid clinically presents similarly to adenomyosis, but fibroid is usually focal, well-circumscribed, the uterus can get more enlarged, and the uterine contour is usually irregular. There is no thickening of the junctional zone as seen in the image.<br><br>Option C: Endometrial polyps are overgrowths of benign endometrial stroma covered by columnar epithelium. They appear as smooth polypoid masses arising from the endometrium into the uterine cavity. The USG below shows a characteristic feeding vessel sign on the colour Doppler.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/bbb9852d346a460c8842c4bbee539e6cx660x452.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option D: Endometriosis is the presence of endometrium at a site outside the endometrial lining. It can be found in ectopic sites such as the ovary, pouch of Douglas, uterosacral ligaments, appendix, pelvic lymph nodes, lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) scar endometriosis, umbilicus, and lung. MRI shows haemorrhages, deep pelvic lesions and fibrosis.",

On examination, the cervix was 8 cm dilated and the vertex at –1 station, meaning the fetal head is still 1 cm above the ischial spines and not yet engaged, making instrumental delivery unsafe. Hence, the next best step is an Emergency Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS) to prevent complete rupture and prevent further maternal and fetal complications.<br><br>Uterine rupture is defined as a disruption in the continuity of all the uterine layers (endometrium, myometrium, and serosa) after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It is a potentially life-threatening maternal complication, often associated with an unsuccessful Trial of Labour after Caesarean (TOLAC). <br><br>The risk factors of uterine rupture include: <br><br>* More the number (>2) of prior cesarean delivery<br><br>* lnterpregnancy interval <24 months<br><br>* Induced labor, especially with misoprostol<br><br>* Augmentation of labor with high dose oxytocin<br><br>* Women having single layer uterine closure in prior cesarean delivery compared to double layer closure<br><br>Clinical features include dull abdominal pain over the scar area with slight vaginal bleeding. There are varying degrees of tenderness on uterine palpation. FHS may be irregular or absent. CTG tracings reveal variable or late deceleration (most consistent finding). If the fetal presenting part has already entered the pelvis with labour, loss of station may be detected by pelvic examination. <br><br>To prevent uterine rupture, undue delay in the progress of labor in a multipara with a previous uneventful delivery should be viewed with concern, and the cause should be sought for. Attempted forceps delivery or breech extraction through incompletely dilated cervix should be avoided. The only effective measure to save the fetus is by immediate delivery via emergency LSCS. Following complete rupture during TOLAC, hysterectomy may also be required.",
