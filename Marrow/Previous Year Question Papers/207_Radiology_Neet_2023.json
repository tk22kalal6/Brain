It is <strong>never present at birth</strong> but gradually develops after 12–24 h.

Subgaleal hematoma can cross suture lines and typically presents as a soft, fluctuant swelling on the scalp.</p>\n<p><strong>Caput succedaneum</strong> is an <strong>edema</strong> of the <strong>scalp</strong> that can <strong>cross suture lines</strong>. It is usually <strong>present at birth</strong> or develops shortly after due to pressure on the presenting part of the head during labor. It generally <strong>resolves within a few days</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Encephalocele</strong> is a neural tube defect that results in a <strong>sac-like protrusion of the brain and its meninges</strong> through an opening in the skull. It is a congenital condition and is typically diagnosed at birth or via prenatal ultrasound. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Caput succedaneum and Cephalohematoma</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Indicators</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Caput Succedaneum</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cephalhematoma</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Location</td>\n<td>Presenting part of the head</td>\n<td>The periosteum of skull bone and bone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Time of appearance&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Immediately after birth</td>\n<td>Several hours after birth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cause</td>\n<td>Prolonged labor, causing venous stasis and edema&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Instrumental delivery, causes rupture of emissary veins in skull</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Extent of movement</td>\n<td>Both hemispheres; crosses the suture line</td>\n<td>Individual bones; do not cross the suture lines</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Period of absorption</td>\n<td>2-4 days</td>\n<td>2 weeks to 3 months</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Treatment</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>\n<p>Supportive.</p>\n<p>It can cause neonatal jaundice&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/3fa55d5b4d7f42e4a0bba6bb3784ac85x1280x2360.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

In a posteroanterior (PA) chest X-ray, this consolidation may be difficult to appreciate, but it would be more evident in a lateral view.</p>\n<p><strong>Loculated pleural effusion</strong>: In a chest X-ray showing a loculated pleural effusion, there would be a fluid collection within the pleural space. This fluid collection would appear as a well-defined opacity, typically with a convex border facing the lung parenchyma.
