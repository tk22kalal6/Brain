      "solution": "<p>In internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) the lesion is at the <strong>medial longitudinal fasciculus </strong>(MLF).</p>\n<p>In INO, there is&nbsp;<strong>impaired adduction</strong>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<strong>ipsilateral</strong>&nbsp;side of the lesion, and<strong>&nbsp;nystagmus on abduction&nbsp;</strong>on the&nbsp;<strong>contralateral side</strong>. When the gaze is initiated in the motor cortex, the horizontal gaze center or the <strong>paramedian pontine reticular formation</strong>&nbsp;(PPRF) generates the eye movements.</p>\n<p>The PPRF has&nbsp;<strong>two outputs</strong>. The first is to the&nbsp;<strong>ipsilateral 6th cranial nerve nucleus</strong>&nbsp;which causes abduction of the ipsilateral eye. The second output is to the <strong>contralateral</strong> <strong>MLF</strong>&nbsp;which sends an impulse to the&nbsp;<strong>contralateral 3rd cranial nerve nucleus</strong>&nbsp;causing contralateral adduction. These two outputs from PPRF lead to conjugate movement of the eyes to the same side.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Therefore, a<strong> lesion </strong>in the<strong> right MLF</strong> leads to <strong>failure </strong>of the<strong> right eye adduction</strong>. The <strong>left eye</strong>, however, <strong>abducts normally</strong>. This is called <strong>internuclear ophthalmoplegia</strong>.</p>\n<p>The following image shows the pathway for horizontal eye movements as described above.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ffe506e7bffa4858b3825b7f36d2cfd2x1280x2152.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/836881526ea24eafbaa3a6dc3f6fc92bx1280x2259.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
