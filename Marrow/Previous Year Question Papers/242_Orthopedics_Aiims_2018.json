When there is a spasm of the muscles, the stronger flexors pull the hip in flexion. <strong>Soft tissue contractures</strong> can convert this into a <strong>fixed flexion deformity</strong>, making locomotion impossible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Thomas test is used to evaluate the degree of flexion deformity. The aim is to <strong>eliminate compensatory lumbar lordosis</strong> and <strong>reveal the obvious flexion deformity</strong> for measurement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the test, the patient lies supine on a hard surface with legs straight. The patient may compensate for the flexion deformity by arching the lower back, creating excessive lumbar lordosis. The <strong>easy passage of the examiner's hand between the bed and the back of the patient </strong>is considered a <strong>positive test</strong> as normally this is not possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By gradually flexing the unaffected hip, the pelvis tilts and eliminates lumbar lordosis, causing the affected hip to assume the flexed position.

      "solution": "<p>The <strong>earliest symptom</strong> of <strong>acute compartment syndrome</strong> is <strong>pain</strong>.</p>\n<p>Acute compartment syndrome is a<strong> surgical emergency</strong> caused by<strong> increased pressure</strong> within a <strong>fascial compartment</strong>, leading to<strong> tissue ischemia</strong>. It is characterized by rapid progression of pain and swelling in an extremity, commonly precipitated by <strong>traumatic injury</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the 5 P's:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Pain</strong> - It is the<strong> first symptom</strong> of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. On <strong>passive stretching</strong> of the muscles, <strong>severe pain</strong> can be elicited.&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Paresthesia</strong> - It is the<strong> first sign</strong> of nerve ischemia.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Pallor</strong> - It may not be seen always. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Paralysis</strong> - Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a <strong>late sign</strong>.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Pulselessness</strong> - Usually, the peripheral pulses and capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. <strong>If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the <strong>intra-compartmental pressure</strong> using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (&Delta;P). A <strong>differential pressure (&Delta;P)</strong> of<strong> less than 30 mm Hg</strong> (4.00 kilopascals) is an <strong>indication</strong> for immediate compartment decompression by performing a <strong>fasciotomy</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Acute Compartment and Crush Syndromes</h3><p><strong>1. Acute Compartment Syndrome</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Acute compartment syndrome is an elevation of the intracompartmental pressure (ICP) which increases the risk for tissue ischemia and necrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Fractures (70%) and severe soft tissue injuries (30%). Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. </p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. </p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Crush Syndrome </strong></p>\n<p>Crush syndrome is the systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis. It is commonly caused due to prolonged external compression of an extremity. </p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Crush injuries sustained during motor vehicle accidents, earthquakes, mining and other occupational accidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Underperfusion of muscle causes myonecrosis. When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",
