      "solution": "The image depicts binocular vision. Figure 1 describes simultaneous macular perception, and Figure 2 describes fusion.<br><br>When a normal individual fixes their visual attention on an object of regard, the image is formed on the fovea of both eyes separately, but the individual perceives a single image. The visual axes of the two eyes intersect at the point of fixation. The images are aligned by the fusion reflex and combined by binocular responsive cells in the visual cortex. This is known as binocular single vision. It is a conditioned reflex that is not present since birth but is acquired during the initial months and is completed during the first few years of development, called the critical period of visual development. <br><br>It has 3 grades:<br><br>* Simultaneous perception<br><br>* Fusion<br><br>* Stereopsis<br><br>Prerequisites for the development of binocular single vision are:<br><br>* Motor mechanism- Straight eyes starting from the neonatal period, with precise coordination for all directions of gaze<br><br>* Sensory mechanism- Reasonably clear vision in both eyes so that similar images are presented to each retina<br><br>* Mental process- Ability of the visual cortex to promote binocular single vision <br><br>The field of binocular single vision can be tested using Goldmann perimetry, a tangent screen, or a Hess chart. It usually measures about 45° to 50° from the fixation point, except on the nasal side. It represents the parts of the visual field of each eye that overlap, and where bifoveal fusion of the objects occurs.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/92e50aece7e747b28810b39c4deb5c54x1280x3084.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM1014: Grades of binocular vision<br><br>I - Simultaneous perception                        <br><br>* Ability to see two dissimilar objects simultaneously<br><br>II - Fusion<br><br>* Ability to superimpose two incomplete but similar images<br><br>III - Stereopsis<br><br>* Ability to perceive depth<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/39c446b2dd13447c8f788ae592bc965dx1280x3027.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

There is a radially indented peripheral layer of pseudoexfoliative material, separated by a clear zone maintained by pupillary abrasion. Pupillary dilation helps in visualising this peripheral capsular deposition.<br><br>The material can get collected in the anterior chamber angle and impede the aqueous humour drainage, thus developing secondary open-angle glaucoma. Systemic manifestations due to abnormal fibrillary deposition may also be seen.

      "solution": "The given clinical scenario of a girl with painless swelling, gradually progressing over one year, and the given image suggest the most probable diagnosis to be a dermoid cyst.<br><br>A dermoid cyst is a choristoma that occurs due to the displacement of ectoderm to a subcutaneous location along embryonic lines of closure. They are lined by keratinised stratified squamous epithelium, have a fibrous wall and contain dermal appendages such as sweat glands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles.<br><br>They can be superficial, located anterior to the orbital septum or deep, located posterior to the orbital septum. A superficial orbital dermoid cyst presents in infancy with a painless nodule in the superotemporal and occasionally in the superonasal part of the orbit. It is mobile under the skin but is usually attached to the adjacent periosteum, and the posterior margins are easily palpable.<br><br>A deep dermoid cyst presents in adolescence or adult life with a gradually increasing proptosis of the eye or acutely with an inflamed orbit due to rupture. It has indistinct posterior margins. Imaging is done to rule out dumb-bell or subperiosteal extension. Superficial dermoid cyst shows a well-circumscribed heterogeneous cystic lesion, while deep cyst shows a well-circumscribed lesion that may be associated with bony defects or may extend into the inferotemporal fossa or intracranially.<br><br>A dermoid cyst is treated by excision in toto. Care must be taken to prevent the leaking of keratin into the surrounding tissue because it can result in severe granulomatous inflammation.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Lacrimal gland mass presents as a smooth, firm, non-tender, painless, slowly progressive mass in the superolateral eyelid mass leading to proptosis with inferonasal dystopia. It is usually seen in older age groups.<br><br>Option B: Hemangioma that presents as a proptosis is located deeper, while the superficial ones present as a red-coloured cutaneous lesion.<br><br>Option C: Osteoma is a palpable bony nodule, but does not usually present in the eye.",
