Some patients develop a morbilliform rash shortly after birth because maternal T cells are transferred across the placenta and attack the fetus, causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).</p>\n<p>Persons with SCID are extremely susceptible to recurrent, severe infections by a wide range of pathogens, including: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Candida albicans</li>\n<li>Pneumocystis jiroveci</li>\n<li>Pseudomonas</li>\n<li>Cytomegalovirus</li>\n<li>Varicella</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>thymus biopsy</strong> shows remnants of <strong>Hassall's corpuscles</strong>, indicating <strong>severe combined immunodeficiency</strong> (SCID) due to <strong>adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency</strong>. SCID affects both <strong>humoral</strong> and <strong>cell-mediated immune</strong> <strong>responses,</strong> primarily impacting T cells and resulting in the absence or severe underdevelopment of lymphoid tissues like lymph nodes and tonsils.</p>\n<p>There are<strong> two </strong>main types of SCID:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>X-linked SCID</strong>: The <strong>most common</strong> form, caused by a mutation in the <strong>common γ-chain (γc) subunit</strong> of <strong>cytokine receptors</strong>. This leads to reduced T-cell numbers and impaired antibody synthesis despite normal B-cell counts. The thymus shows undifferentiated epithelial cells.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosomal recessive SCID</strong>: Often due to ADA deficiency, causing<strong> toxic metabolite accumulation</strong> that <strong>damages T cells</strong>, resulting in greater T-cell reduction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both forms, the <strong>thymus</strong> is small and<strong> lacks lymphoid cells</strong>, but ADA deficiency uniquely features remnants of Hassall’s corpuscles.</p>\n<p>Note: X-linked SCID is the first human disease in which gene therapy has been successful.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Lesch-Nyhan syndrome</strong> is due to a deficiency of the enzyme Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase(HGPRT). It is an X-linked recessive disease. The clinical features include intellectual disability, self-mutilation, aggression, hyperuricemia, and gout. </p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Ataxia Telangiectasia</strong> is a progressive neurodegenerative genetic disease causing poor coordination and small dilated blood vessels. It is autosomal recessive in inheritance due to ATM gene mutation on Ch 11q22-23.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Friedrich's ataxia</strong> involves the posterior column, pyramidal, and spinocerebellar tracts. Clinical features include cardiomyopathy, optic atrophy, and diabetes mellitus. It should be differentiated from other forms of ataxia as Tabes dorsalis and SACD(Subacute Combined Degeneration).</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Primary immunodeficiency disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Affected component</strong><strong>&nbsp;of the immune system</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Disorder</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Humoral immunity:&nbsp;</strong>Problems with<strong> B cells</strong>&nbsp;and their <strong>antibody&nbsp;</strong><strong>production</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Common variable immunodeficiency</li>\n<li>Selective immunoglobulin deficiency, such as IgA deficiency</li>\n<li>Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy</li>\n<li>X-linked agammaglobulinemia</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Cellular immunity:&nbsp;</strong>Problems with<strong> T cells&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis</li>\n<li>DiGeorge syndrome</li>\n<li>X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Combined </strong>humoral and cellular immunity:&nbsp;Problems with<strong> B and T cells</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ataxia-telangiectasia</li>\n<li>Hyperimmunoglobulinemia M syndrome</li>\n<li>Severe combined immunodeficiency</li>\n<li>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Phagocytes:&nbsp;</strong>Problems with the<strong> movement or killing&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronic granulomatous disease</li>\n<li>Ch&eacute;diak-Higashi syndrome&nbsp;(rare)</li>\n<li>Tuftsin deficiency</li>\n<li>Cyclic neutropenia</li>\n<li>Leukocyte adhesion defects</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Complement </strong>proteins:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Deficiency of complement </strong>proteins</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Complement component 1 (C1) inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema)</li>\n<li>Terminal complement deficiency (C5-C9): Recurrent Neisseria infections</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Difference between various causes of ataxia</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Friedreich's&nbsp;</strong><strong>ataxia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Tabes&nbsp;</strong><strong>dorsalis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;SACD</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tract&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Posterior column</p>\n<p>Pyramidal&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spinocerebellar tracts&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Posterior column</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Posterior column</p>\n<p>Pyramidal&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Peripheral nerves</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vibration sense</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent</p>\n</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n<td>Absent&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Proprioception</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent</p>\n</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pain/Temperature</td>\n<td>\n<p>Present</p>\n</td>\n<td>Present</td>\n<td>Present</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deep tendon reflex</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent</p>\n</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n<td>Present.
