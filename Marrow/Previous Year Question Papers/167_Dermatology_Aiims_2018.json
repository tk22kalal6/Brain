      "solution": "<p>The given slide shows a<strong>&nbsp;row of tombstones&nbsp;</strong>appearance, which is classically seen in&nbsp;<strong>pemphigus</strong> <strong>vulgaris.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this condition, there is a <strong>suprabasal splitting</strong> of the epidermis leading to blister formation. The <strong>basal layer</strong>&nbsp;remains&nbsp;<strong>adherent</strong> to the <strong>basement</strong> <strong>membrane</strong> and gives the resemblance to a row of tombstones as shown in the histology image below.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0c66be1b066a4daaaca44d79f53553efx510x517.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Pemphigus vulgaris</strong> is a <strong>chronic immunobullous</strong> disorder characterized by the presence of <strong>antibodies</strong> against <strong>desmosomal proteins</strong>,<strong> desmogleins 1 and 3</strong>&nbsp;expressed in the <strong>skin</strong> and <strong>mucosa.</strong></p>\n<p>Clinically, the patients present with&nbsp;ill-defined, <strong>irregular, slow-to-heal </strong>oral lesions&nbsp;and erosions.&nbsp;<strong>Flaccid blisters</strong> filled with <strong>clear fluid </strong>may&nbsp;arise on normal skin or an erythematous base. The rupture&nbsp;of such blisters produces&nbsp;<strong>painful erosions&nbsp;</strong>and heals&nbsp;<strong>without scarring.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nikolsky's sign</strong> is positive which is elicited by applying firm <strong>tangential</strong> sliding pressure with a finger on lesional or perilesional skin. This leads to the separation of<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the normal‐looking epidermis from the dermis, producing <strong>erosion.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Direct immunofluorescence</strong>&nbsp;is considered the most accurate&nbsp;<strong>confirmatory&nbsp;test</strong>&nbsp;of this condition. It shows intercellular&nbsp;<strong>IgG</strong> and <strong>C3</strong> deposition&nbsp;on the <strong>surface </strong>of <strong>keratinocytes</strong> throughout the epidermis in <strong>normal, perilesional skin,</strong>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;<strong>characteristic fishnet/chickenwire appearance&nbsp;</strong>as seen below.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0f94366c078c446e8976a3fec9ef39c9x1279x1302.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
