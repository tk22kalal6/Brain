It typically presents during<strong>&nbsp;late childhood</strong>&nbsp;or in the <strong>second decade</strong> of life. The&nbsp;muscle glycogen phosphorylase enzyme deficiency interferes with ATP generation by glycogenolysis in the muscles. This causes <strong>muscle</strong>&nbsp;<strong>glycogen accumulation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Symptoms are&nbsp;<strong>exercise intolerance</strong>&nbsp;associated with&nbsp;<strong>muscle cramps</strong>.&nbsp;Due to high-intensity exercise, sudden persistent muscle contraction occurs. This leads to severe muscle damage resulting in a massive release of muscle proteins and&nbsp;<strong>myoglobin </strong>in the blood.&nbsp;<strong>Myoglobinuria</strong>&nbsp;secondary to<strong>&nbsp;rhabdomyolysis</strong>&nbsp;leads to the passage of&nbsp;<strong>burgundy-colored urine</strong>&nbsp;in some patients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A unique feature associated with McArdle is the<strong> improvement in symptoms after rest for a few minutes.</strong> This is termed as the&nbsp;<strong>second wind phenomenon</strong>.&nbsp;This occurs due to the increased blood flow to the muscles and increased utilization of free fatty acids (FFAs) for energy production after resting for a few minutes. This compensates for the impaired ATP generation from glycogenolysis. Patients with McArdle disease can benefit from engaging in regular aerobic exercises, such as walking or cycling, which can help increase their exercise tolerance and cardiovascular fitness. However, they should avoid high-intensity exercises or activities that can trigger muscle cramps and rhabdomyolysis.&nbsp;Glucose administration&nbsp;before exercise can improve tolerance.&nbsp;Vitamin B6&nbsp;is also recommended.</p>\n<p>Standard diagnosis includes muscle biopsy, which shows periodic acid Schiff <strong>(PAS)</strong>-<strong>positive</strong> <strong>vacuoles</strong>&nbsp;(Shown in the image below) of <strong>high glycogen content</strong> due to lack of myophosphorylase and genetic testing (PYGM gene sequencing).</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1228795a38d34c2b83144d18e40bc213x720x534.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Hers disease (type VI glycogen storage disorder) - It is caused by the deficiency of liver glycogen phosphorylase.
