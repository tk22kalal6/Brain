A rapid bolus of<strong>&nbsp;Intralipid 20% IV</strong> (1.5 mL/kg) is administered without delay, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min. The infusion should be given continuously for at least 10 minutes after hemodynamic stability is achieved.</li>\n<li>Intralipid decreases cardiac bupivacaine concentration by 11% within 3 minutes of administration, and cerebral bupivacaine concentration by 18% within 15 minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bupivacaine is a long-acting local anesthetic that is the most <strong>cardiotoxic</strong> among the local anesthetics. It depresses the rapid phase of depolarization in Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle&nbsp;due to a decreased availability of fast sodium channels in cardiac membranes. This reduced rate of depolarization <strong>depresses myocardial contractility.</strong> Hence, bupivacaine is a potent cardio-depressant.</p>\n<p>Note: Local anesthesia systemic toxicity (LAST) can also affect the central nervous system (CNS), which is&nbsp;more susceptible to local anesthetic action as compared to the cardiovascular system. Dizziness, tinnitus, and disorientation are the initial symptoms. Shivering, muscular twitching, and tremors follow. <strong>Tonic-clonic seizures</strong> occur. Finally, respiratory depression can lead to respiratory arrest.</p>",
