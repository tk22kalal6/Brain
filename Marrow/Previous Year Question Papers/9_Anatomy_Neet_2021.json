      "solution": "<p>The given clinical vignette in a patient with <strong>paresthesia</strong> and <strong>sensory loss</strong> over the <strong>medial aspect</strong> of the <strong>leg</strong> and <strong>foot</strong> is suggestive of<strong> injury</strong> to the <strong>saphenous nerve.</strong></p>\n<p>Injury to the saphenous nerve is common following venous cut down for access to the <strong>great saphenous vein,</strong> in this case for <strong>coronary bypass graft.</strong></p>\n<p>Saphenous nerve:</p>\n<p>It is the <strong>longest</strong> and <strong>largest cutaneous branch</strong> of the <strong>femoral nerve</strong> and is the longest nerve in the body. It arises from the posterior division of the femoral nerve. It then enters the adductor canal and exits it by piercing the fascia lata between the gracilis and sartorius and supplies the skin over the patella. The saphenous nerve then descends along the medial border of the tibia along with the <strong>great</strong> <strong>saphenous vein</strong>&nbsp;(anterior to the vein) and supplies the <strong>skin</strong> on the <strong>medial side</strong> of the&nbsp;<strong>knee, leg,</strong> and <strong>foot</strong> as far as up to the first metatarsophalangeal joint.</p>\n<p>Saphenous nerve injury:</p>\n<p>When the great saphenous vein is being harvested for <strong>coronary bypass graft</strong>, injury to the saphenous nerve is common as it closely travels with the great saphenous vein. <strong>Sensory loss</strong> over the <strong>medial side</strong> of the <strong>knee, leg</strong>, and <strong>foot</strong> is observed in saphenous nerve injury.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1bcf317d5365432489370c5ef96c4211x1200x1836.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2a225a0207504f2eb7125b41861488dcx1200x1447.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Superficial peroneal nerve</strong> injury causes sensory loss over the lateral aspect of the leg and the dorsum of the foot.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Femoral nerve&nbsp;</strong>gives rise to anterior cutaneous branches, the saphenous nerve, and motor supply to the quadriceps and sartorius. Anterior cutaneous branches supply the skin on the anterior thigh and knee. If the saphenous nerve was not an option in the question, the femoral nerve would have been the next best answer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Sural nerve</strong> injury causes sensory loss over the posterior and lateral aspects&nbsp;of the distal third of the leg and lateral side of the foot and fifth toe. It is often used as an autologous peripheral nerve graft as it is readily identified and easy to harvest.</p>",
