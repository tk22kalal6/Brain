These are benign solid encapsulated <strong>slow-growing</strong> tumors <strong>over 5 cm in diameter</strong>. It presents as a painless lump in the breast. They are managed by excision via a submammary incision<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Phyllodes tumors</strong> usually occur in women over the age of 40 years but can appear in younger women. Phyllodes tumor is mostly benign even though it is also called cystosarcoma phyllodes. It presents as a large tumor with an unevenly bosselated surface. They are usually mobile over the chest wall despite their large size. This tumor <strong>does not infiltrate</strong> the skin. Nipple retraction is not seen in this condition. <strong>Benign</strong> lesions can be treated with enucleation or wide local excision. Massive tumours, recurrent tumours and malignant lesions are treated with a mastectomy.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Galactocele </strong>are the <strong>most</strong> <strong>common</strong> <strong>benign breast</strong> lesions in <strong>lactating</strong> women. It is a cystic enlargement of the mammary gland containing milk. They are mostly detected <strong>during lactation </strong>or in<strong> the third trimester</strong> of pregnancy but rarely, may also present after stopping breastfeeding. Clinically, the mass is usually <strong>firm</strong> and <strong>non-tender</strong> and presents as a solid tumour-like lesion on physical examination. The patient usually notes the lesion <strong>during</strong> <strong>lactation</strong> or some period after lactation. <strong>Needle</strong> <strong>aspiration</strong>, followed by <strong>excision</strong> should it recur, is the <strong>standard</strong> <strong>method</strong> of treating galactocele. </p>",

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario and erect X-ray abdomen showing&nbsp;<strong>gas under the diaphragm&nbsp;</strong>are suggestive of <strong>pneumoperitoneum,&nbsp;</strong>which is managed by <strong>initial resuscitation with IV fluids</strong> followed by <strong>exploratory laparotomy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Pneumoperitoneum is the presence of air or gas in the peritoneal cavity. The most common cause of pneumoperitoneum is a <strong>perforation of a hollow viscus.&nbsp; </strong>Other causes of pneumoperitoneum in adults include peritoneal dialysis, and mechanical ventilation, after procedures like colonoscopy and endoscopy. In children, it can be caused by necrotizing enterocolitis, hirschsprung's disease, meconium ileus and mechanical ventilation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The patient presents with abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, fever, constipation, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and reduced urine output. Per-abdomen examination can show guarding and rigidity.</p>\n<p>An erect X-ray abdomen is highly sensitive for the detection of free intraperitoneal gas. Some of the signs seen in the X-ray include:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cupola sign</strong> is the presence of air underneath the diaphragm, giving a <strong>dome-like appearance</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Rigler's sign</strong> is where both bowel surfaces are seen together as a sharp margin.</li>\n<li><strong>Falciform ligament sign</strong> is the outlining of the falciform ligament with free abdominal gas.</li>\n<li><strong>Liver/gallbladder edge sign</strong> is where the sharp margins of the liver/gallbladder are visible due to the collection of air.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Management includes,</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adequate preoperative resuscitation</strong> with <strong>intravenous fluids</strong> followed by correction of electrolyte imbalance, instituting broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and</li>\n<li>Early surgical <strong>intervention/laparotomy</strong> to address the cause of pneumoperitoneum and prevent further contamination of the peritoneal cavity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
