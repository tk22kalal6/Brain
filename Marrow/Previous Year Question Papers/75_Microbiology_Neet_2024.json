      "solution": "<p><strong>Multiplex PCR</strong> can be used for syndromic diagnosis of meningitis.</p>\n<p>A<strong> syndromic diagnosis </strong>is a method of <strong>diagnosing infectious diseases</strong> that uses a <strong>single test </strong>to screen for<strong> multiple pathogens</strong> that could be causing a <strong>specific set </strong>of <strong>symptoms. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Multiplex PCR</strong> (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a variation of the standard PCR technique that allows <strong>simultaneous amplification</strong> of <strong>multiple target sequences</strong> in a <strong>single reaction.</strong> It uses more than one set of primers (specific to different target sequences) to <strong>amplify different DNA fragments</strong> at the same time.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Real-time PCR</strong> helps quantify the PCR and gives an estimate of the pathogen DNA load in the specimen. It uses fluorescent dyes or specific DNA probes. It is also known as qPCR (Quantitative PCR).</p>\n<p>Option B<strong>: Nested PCR</strong> involves the sequential use of two primer sets. The first primer set is used for amplification and the amplicon obtained is then used as a target sequence for second amplification. This ensures specificity. Used in GeneXpert to detect Mycobacterium TB and resistance to rifampicin.</p>\n<p>Option C<strong>: Reverse transcriptase PCR</strong>: The enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) is used to synthesize a complimentary copy of DNA (cDNA) from RNA and this cDNA is then used as a template for PCR. Unlike conventional PCR which can only amplify DNA, this one can even amplify RNA. It is used to detect H1N1 from Nasopharyngeal swab.</p>",

It is most common in North America and so is also called <strong>North American Blastomycosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>The disease has a broad demographic impact, occurring in both <strong>immunocompetent</strong> and<strong> immunocompromised individuals</strong>. However, those with<strong> impaired immune systems</strong>—such as patients with <strong>AIDS</strong>, those on <strong>glucocorticoid therapy</strong>, or those <strong>receiving TNF-α inhibitors</strong>—are at <strong>higher risk</strong> for severe or <strong>disseminated disease</strong> involving the <strong>skin, bone</strong>, or <strong>central nervous system</strong>. <strong>Healthy individuals</strong> may experience a range of symptoms from <strong>mild pulmonary illness</strong> to more severe forms of <strong>pneumonia. </strong>It is more commonly observed in <strong>males aged 30-50 years</strong>, possibly due to <strong>occupational</strong> or <strong>recreational exposures</strong>.</p>\n<p>Blastomycosis can present in <strong>three forms</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pulmonary disease:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Presents with cough, sputum production, chest pain, and fever</li>\n<li>Hilar lymphadenopathy may be present</li>\n<li>Focal or diffuse <strong>consolidation, miliary lesions, or abscess formation</strong> may occur.</li>\n<li>Resembles TB and Histoplasmosis </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Cutaneous disease:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Involvement of face and exposed parts of the skin</li>\n<li>Skin lesion: ulcerated <strong>verrucous granulomas</strong> with an advancing border and central scarring.

This is a <strong>dimorphic</strong> fungus that exists in the <strong>yeast</strong> form in body tissues and cultures maintained at 37°C, and in the<strong> filamentou</strong>s mould form in cultures at room temperature (25°C).</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Coccidiomycosis</strong> is caused by <em>Coccidioides immitis</em> which is a thermally <strong>dimorphic</strong> fungus. It occurs as a <strong>spherule</strong> in tissues and culture at 37°C and as the <strong>mycelial</strong> form in soil and culture at room temperature. They are endemic to the arid desert regions of the southwestern USA and California. Infection is acquired by <strong>inhaling</strong> dust containing arthrospores of the fungus.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Candidiasis</strong> is caused by candida species which are <strong>yeast-like fungi</strong>.

It is endemic in the USA, in the states bordering the <strong>Ohio River valley</strong> and the lower <strong>Mississippi River</strong>. In India, it is reported from the region of <strong>West Bengal</strong>, along the Ganga River. The fungus inhabits humid and acidic soil that contains a large amount of bird or <strong>bat droppings</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>H. capsulatum</em> is transmitted by <strong>inhalation</strong> of spores (i.e. <strong>microconidia</strong>) which usually circulate in the air after the contaminated soil is disturbed. After the spores enter into the lungs, they are engulfed inside the <strong>alveolar macrophages</strong> and then transform into <strong>yeast forms</strong>. </p>\n<p>Clinically, the classical histoplasmosis ranges from <strong>asymptomatic infection</strong> (in immunocompetent people) to life-threatening illness seen in people with low CMI. The various clinical types include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pulmonary histoplasmosis</strong> - Acute form presents with mild flu-like illness, pulmonary infiltrates in the chest X-ray with <strong>hilar</strong> or <strong>mediastinal lymphadenopathy. </strong>Chronic cavitary histoplasmosis may be seen in smokers with underlying structural lung disease.</li>\n<li><strong>Mucocutaneous histoplasmosis</strong> - Skin and oral mucosal lesions may develop secondary to pulmonary infection. Oral lesions are particularly seen in <strong>Indian</strong> patients.</li>\n<li><strong>Disseminated histoplasmosis </strong>- It develops if CMI is very low (e.g. untreated HIV-infected people or following organ transplantation). The common sites affected are <strong>bone marrow</strong>, <strong>spleen</strong>, <strong>liver</strong>, eyes, and <strong>adrenal glands</strong>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Diagnosis : </p>\n<p>Direct microscopy - Histopathological staining of the specimens reveals tiny oval <strong>yeast cells</strong> (2–4 μm size) with <strong>narrow-based budding</strong> within the <strong>macrophages</strong> with an underlying granulomatous response.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/88740ebe90e44fa9bb015134e80cbeaex1280x852.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Culture - It is the gold standard method of diagnosis.

The discharge is collected and subjected to Gram's stain which reveals<strong> gram‐negative intracellular diplococci </strong>within phagocytes. <strong>Stuart's media</strong> is used as <strong>transport media </strong>and <strong>Thayer Martin media</strong> is used for <strong>culture.</strong> Thayer-Martin medium contains vancomycin, colistin and nystatin.</p>\n<p>Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease where infection occurs due to the<strong> adhesion </strong>of gonococci to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces with the help of<strong> pili.</strong> By the third day of infection, the cocci have penetrated intracellular spaces and reached subepithelial tissue. The incubation period ranges from<strong> 2 to 8 days</strong>. The main symptoms are <strong>urethral</strong> <strong>discharge </strong>and <strong>dysuria.</strong></p>\n<p>In <strong>females:</strong> The infection begins in the cervix uteri and urethra and may spread to the Bartholin glands, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. The vaginal mucosa is usually unaffected in adults because the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to cocci infection and also because vaginal secretions have an acidic pH. Rarely peritonitis may develop with perihepatic inflammation <strong>(Fitz Hugh Curtis syndrome)</strong>.</p>\n<p>In <strong>males:</strong> The disease starts as acute urethritis. This infection has the potential to spread down the urethra and into the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis. Chronic urethritis may lead to stricture formation.
