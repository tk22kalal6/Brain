      "solution": "<p>The difficulty in buttoning the shirt and the inability to make the \"O\" shape with fingers suggest the involvement of the <strong>abductor pollicis brevis muscle</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is a case of <strong>anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) syndrome</strong>. The <strong>AIN</strong> is a <strong>purely motor branch</strong> of the <strong>median nerve </strong>that affects specific muscles in the forearm, the<strong> flexor pollicis longus</strong> and <strong>flexor digitorum profundus </strong>leading to difficulty in performing tasks requiring fine motor control, such as the <strong>\"OK\" sign</strong>. Among the options provided, the <strong>abductor pollicis brevis</strong> is uniquely and <strong>consistently innervated</strong> by the<strong> recurrent motor branch</strong> of the <strong>median nerve</strong>, making it susceptible to dysfunction in conditions affecting the median nerve.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The <strong>opponens pollicis</strong> is innervated primarily by the <strong>lateral terminal branch</strong> of the <strong>median nerve</strong>, with some contributions from a branch of the deep terminal branch of the <strong>ulnar nerve</strong>. While it plays a role in thumb opposition, it is not consistently affected in anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) syndrome, which primarily impacts deeper flexor muscles like the flexor pollicis longus. Therefore, it is less likely to be the cause of the patient’s inability to perform the \"OK\" sign.</p>\n<p>Option B: The <strong>palmar interossei</strong> muscles are innervated by the deep branch of the <strong>ulnar nerve</strong>. Because they do not receive any innervation from the median nerve, they are not implicated in AIN syndrome. Their primary function involves the <strong>adduction</strong> of the fingers.</p>\n<p>Option C: The <strong>flexor pollicis brevis</strong> has dual innervation: the superficial head is supplied by the<strong> recurrent branch</strong> of the<strong> median nerve</strong>, while the deep head is innervated by the deep branch of the <strong>ulnar nerve</strong>. This dual supply makes it less likely to be solely affected in AIN syndrome. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Upper limb nerve integrity tests</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<strong>Nerve</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; Test</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> Muscle</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Ulnar&nbsp; &nbsp;nerve</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;1.Book test</p>\n<p>&nbsp;2.Card test</p>\n<p>&nbsp;3.Froment's sign</p>\n<p>&nbsp;4.Egawa test</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;1.Adductor&nbsp; &nbsp;pollicis</p>\n<p>&nbsp;2.Palmar&nbsp; &nbsp;interossei</p>\n<p>&nbsp;3.Flexor pollicis&nbsp; &nbsp;substitutes for&nbsp; &nbsp;adductor pollicis</p>\n<p>&nbsp;4.Dorsal&nbsp; &nbsp;interossei</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Median&nbsp; &nbsp;nerve</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;1.Ape thumb</p>\n<p>&nbsp;2.Pen test</p>\n<p>&nbsp;3.Pincer grasp&nbsp; &nbsp;(Kiloh Nevin&nbsp; &nbsp;Sign)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;4.Pointing index&nbsp; &nbsp;(ochners&nbsp; clasp/Benediction&nbsp; &nbsp;test)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;1.Thenar&nbsp; &nbsp;muscles</p>\n<p>&nbsp;2.
