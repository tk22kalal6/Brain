      "solution": "The given clinical scenario of difficulty in walking, a broad-based gait, and inability to perform heel-to-toe walking, hyperreflexive, and positive Babinski sign suggests a clinical diagnosis of Spastic diplegic type of Cerebral palsy. <br><br>Spastic diplegia involves bilateral spasticity of the legs that is greater than in the arms. Spastic diplegia occurs due to the injury to the immature white matter during the vulnerable period of immature oligodendroglia between 20 and 34 weeks of gestation, hence seen in those born prematurely. It is often noted when an affected infant begins to crawl. The child uses the arms normally but tends to drag the legs behind more as a rudder, like a commando-crawl, rather than using the normal four-limbed crawling movement.<br><br>Examination of the child reveals symmetric spasticity in the legs with brisk reflexes, ankle clonus, and a bilateral Babinski sign. Walking can get significantly delayed, the feet are held in a position of equinovarus, and the child walks on tiptoes. In older children, a scissoring gait is characterized by the knees and thighs pressed together or crossing each other while walking, caused by high muscle tone (spasticity) in the hip adductors.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4cd47fd3961947d3b969b5d3877c37eax510x520.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>The subtypes of cerebral palsy and the pathology involved are given below:<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><span class=\"qSkIscAl\">Cere</span><span class=\"XPHAGBxs\">bral</span> <span class=\"hdghrUZa\">pal</span><span class=\"OLXqukpR\">sy</span> <span class=\"rIVjOGka\">subt</span><span class=\"jxfpwpeS\">ype</span></strong></td>\n<td><strong><span class=\"rMCTiRwD\">Pat</span><span class=\"xCMClKxG\">holo</span><span class=\"LOotpDsm\">gy</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><span class=\"sIsyMkIm\">Spa</span><span class=\"yiHFxOMY\">stic</span> <span class=\"FkVTFDou\">dipl</span><span class=\"FutpSwiC\">egia</span></strong></td>\n<td><strong><span class=\"CpVuvYxk\">Pe</span><span class=\"rMCTiRwD\">rive</span><span class=\"LTtPlThD\">nt</span><span class=\"HaYQCybY\">ri</span><span class=\"GBHkqTww\">cula</span><span class=\"eKMAbsgQ\">r</span> <span class=\"ASOCugYp\">le</span><span class=\"JBrmtfYi\">ukom</span><span class=\"veucnhSB\">alac</span><span class=\"sIsyMkIm\">ia</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"oBFljOBV\">Spa</span><span class=\"LPEFCSua\">st</span><span class=\"BULNLvOs\">ic</span> <span class=\"wNAXqULy\">quad</span><span class=\"xmYrYOIr\">rip</span><span class=\"bznWlHJP\">legi</span><span class=\"huRrVlVt\">a</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"CcPiLBue\">Mul</span><span class=\"CcPiLBue\">ti-</span><span class=\"OLXqukpR\">cy</span><span class=\"nXBrkFDN\">stic</span> <span class=\"HwJcvYhI\">enc</span><span class=\"Syqytuyt\">ep</span><span class=\"CcPiLBue\">halo</span><span class=\"imYuHVsZ\">mala</span><span class=\"xmYrYOIr\">ci</span><span class=\"hWIZYKGW\">a</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"uMKUwksT\">Spas</span><span class=\"BULNLvOs\">tic</span> <span class=\"ePmAQchy\">hemi</span><span class=\"hWIZYKGW\">pl</span><span class=\"hdghrUZa\">egia</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"yiHFxOMY\">Mi</span><span class=\"hSUAXicf\">ddl</span><span class=\"oBFljOBV\">e</span> <span class=\"UAvplxoC\">ce</span><span class=\"GBHkqTww\">rebr</span><span class=\"CpVuvYxk\">al</span> <span class=\"LTtPlThD\">art</span><span class=\"JDpHYeXM\">ery</span> <span class=\"UUyfgIiY\">ter</span><span class=\"ASOCugYp\">rito</span><span class=\"yVkGYicb\">ry</span> <span class=\"UUyfgIiY\">in</span><span class=\"OiUQkeje\">farc</span><span class=\"nXBrkFDN\">tion</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"HaYQCybY\">Dy</span><span class=\"qGQIXqDI\">sk</span><span class=\"sFzlsLgV\">inet</span><span class=\"QWkxwOxv\">ic</span> <span class=\"nXBrkFDN\">ce</span><span class=\"nXBrkFDN\">rebr</span><span class=\"SMgOVTuQ\">al</span> <span class=\"FDZTdpeT\">pa</span><span class=\"zsgdLUqP\">lsy</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"FlKbqllE\">Basa</span><span class=\"FrHiMFBE\">l</span> <span class=\"CalTSUiJ\">ga</span><span class=\"CpVuvYxk\">ngli</span><span class=\"xmYrYOIr\">a</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Guillain-Barré syndrome causes acute flaccid paralysis.

It is the most common oesophageal disorder in children of all ages and can occur physiologically.<br><br>Infantile reflux presents with regurgitation, especially postprandially. Signs of esophagitis, like irritability, arching, choking, gagging, and feeding aversion, can also be seen. All these result in failure to thrive. Symptoms resolve spontaneously in the majority of infants by 12-24 months. Infants may also present with obstructive apnea or stridor or lower airway disease, in which reflux complicates primary airway disease, such as laryngomalacia or bronchopulmonary dysplasia.<br><br>Treatment depends on the patient’s age, nature and severity of symptoms. Infants should be burped well, and overfeeding must be avoided.

It occurs due to ineffective clearance of fetal lung fluid, which leads to retained fetal lung fluid, which decreases pulmonary compliance and impedes gas exchange. <br><br>It is characterised by the early onset of tachypnea (>60 breaths/min), and sometimes along with retractions or expiratory grunting. Cyanosis, if present, is relieved by minimal O2 supplementation (<40%). The chest radiograph shows prominent perihilar pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. Small pleural effusions may be present rarely. Supportive treatment is required, and most of the infants recover rapidly. <br><br>Other options :<br><br>Option B: Respiratory distress syndrome occurs primarily in neonates of less than 34 weeks of gestation. The X-ray in such cases shows low lung volumes, a diffuse, fine reticular granularity of the parenchyma (ground-glass appearance), and air bronchograms.<br><br>Option C: Meconium aspiration syndrome commonly affects term and post-term babies. Also, the chest X-ray here will show patchy infiltrates, coarse streaking of both lung fields, increased anteroposterior diameter, and flattening of the diaphragm with possible pneumothorax. There is usually a history of fetal distress and hypoxia requiring resuscitation at birth, and infants are meconium-stained.<br><br>Option D: Pneumonia is seen in term and preterm neonates.
