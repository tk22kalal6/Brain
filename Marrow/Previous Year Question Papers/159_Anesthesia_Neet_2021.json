      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario of a patient being operated under halothane, developing <strong>hyperthermia</strong> and <strong>muscle rigidity</strong> is suggestive of an episode of <strong>malignant hyperthermia.</strong> The drug most likely implicating/causing this condition is <strong>suxamethonium </strong>(succinylcholine).</p>\n<p>Suxamethonium is a peripherally acting<strong> depolarizing muscle relaxant,</strong> commonly administered during the induction of anesthesia to relax muscles of the jaw, neck, and airway and thereby facilitate laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.</p>\n<p>Malignant hyperthermia is a rare genetic hypermetabolic muscle disease. It occurs due to mutation of the gene for the<strong> ryanodine</strong><strong>&nbsp;receptor </strong>(Ryr 1), located on chromosome 19. Ryr 1 is an ion channel responsible for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>\n<p>The symptoms develop when the patient is exposed to <strong>inhaled anesthetics</strong> (halothane in this case) or <strong>suxamethonium/succinylcholine.</strong></p>\n<p>The mutated Ryr 1 leads to&nbsp;a sudden release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the skeletal muscle. This&nbsp;<strong>uncontrolled increase</strong> in <strong>intracellular calcium</strong>&nbsp;removes the inhibition of troponin, resulting in <strong>sustained muscle contraction</strong>, which in turn, leads to an increase in adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity. This results in an uncontrolled hypermetabolic state with <strong>increased oxygen consumption </strong>and <strong>CO2 production</strong>, producing severe lactic acidosis and hyperthermia.</p>\n<p>The key clinical features are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Succinylcholine-induced masseter muscle rigidity</strong>&nbsp;(causing trismus) or generalized muscle rigidity</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Tachycardia&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Hypercarbia ( increased CO2 production) and reduced oxygen saturation</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Hyperthermia ( rise of 1&deg; Celsius can occur every 5 minutes)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Arrhythmia</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Hypertension</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Myoglobinuria and myoglobinemia indicating muscle damage</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Metabolic derangements like hyperkalemia and mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment is to <strong>discontinue</strong> the <strong>triggering agents</strong> i.e; inhaled anesthetics and succinylcholine followed by administration of <strong>100% oxygen.</strong> Metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia need to be corrected.

One hand (palm) is placed on the patient&rsquo;s forehead applying pressure to tilt the head back. Simultaneously, the chin is lifted with the forefinger and index finger of the opposite hand.

A 22-gauge needle is advanced through the skin. In the lateral recumbent position, the bevel should face up, and in the sitting position, it should face to one side or the other, to avoid injury to the dural fibers.

It depresses the rapid phase of depolarization in Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle&nbsp;due to a decreased availability of fast sodium channels in cardiac membranes. This reduced rate of depolarization <strong>depresses myocardial contractility.</strong> Hence, bupivacaine is a potent cardio depressant.</p>\n<p>Cardio-vascular effects of bupivacaine-induced toxicity are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Left ventricular depression</li>\n<li>Atrioventricular heart block</li>\n<li>Ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation</li>\n<li>Sinus bradycardia can lead to cardiac arrest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Initial management includes immediate initiation of<strong> cardiopulmonary resuscitation</strong> (CPR) and <strong>defibrillation</strong> as per the <strong>advanced cardiac life support</strong> (ACLS) algorithm.</p>\n<p>Following CPR, <strong>intralipid therapy</strong> is initiated.
