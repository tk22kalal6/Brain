      "solution": "<p>Based on the given clinical findings, the most likely cause is a bite of<strong>&nbsp;viper snake</strong>, resulting in a&nbsp;<strong>haemotoxic envenomation.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 588\">The Russell's viper has a flat and triangular head with a&nbsp;<strong>V-shaped mark</strong>, white in color, with the angle of the V pointing forwards. Along the&nbsp;<strong>back</strong>, it has&nbsp;<strong>three rows</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>diamond-shaped spots</strong>. Other points of identification include broad plates on its belly, the small scales on the head, and a shield beneath the tail divided into two rows. It is commonly found throughout India.</div>\n<p>Patients with Russell's viper bite usually present with <strong>severe pain</strong>, and <strong>redness</strong> around the bite site. <strong>Swelling</strong> usually develops followed by<strong> blisters</strong> in and around the wound site. <strong>Persistent bleeding</strong> from the bite site is a constant feature. Patients may develop hemorrhagic syndrome due to bleeding from various sites like gums, nose, rectum, etc.&nbsp;In severe cases, <strong>shock</strong> may develop. <strong>Bleeding</strong> and <strong>clotting time</strong> are usually prolonged. <strong>Death</strong> usually occurs due to shock or hemorrhage.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Cobra</strong> <strong>venom</strong> usually produces <strong>neurotoxic effect</strong>s with minimal local effects. Neurological manifestations of cobra venom include <strong>ptosis,</strong> paralysis of the <strong>face, palate, jaws, tongue, neck muscles, muscles of deglutitio</strong>n, and <strong>respiratory muscles</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Wasp stings</strong> cause immediate <strong>pain</strong>, a <strong>wheal and flare</strong> reaction, and <strong>local edema</strong> and <strong>swelling</strong> that subside in a few hours. Multiple stings can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, generalized edema, dyspnea, hypotension, and collapse.</p>\n<p>Option D: Scorpion sting usually presents with <strong>localized redness</strong> and <strong>burning pain</strong> which is unable to localize due to its radiation along the dermatomes involved, <strong>localized swelling</strong>, and <strong>punctate hemorrhagic spots</strong>. Other features include headache, profuse perspiration, chest discomfort, paraesthesias, hypersalivation, cold extremities, and sometimes, priapism.<strong> Hypertension</strong> usually develops early, while <strong>pulmonary edema</strong> and <strong>myocarditis</strong> may develop later.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Mechanism of action of snake
