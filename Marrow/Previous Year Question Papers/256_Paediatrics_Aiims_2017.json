Here, the <strong>history of conjunctivitis&nbsp;</strong>makes it more likely to be a chlamydial infection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pneumonia caused by <em>C. trachomatis</em> can develop in infants born to women with an untreated chlamydial infection in 10-20% of cases.&nbsp;It&nbsp;has a very characteristic <strong>presentation in infancy</strong>,&nbsp;disease <strong>onset</strong> usually occurs around&nbsp;<strong>1 and 3 months of age</strong> and is <strong>insidious</strong>, with a persistent cough, tachypnea, and <strong>absence of fever </strong>(atypical pneumonia). Auscultation reveals rales; wheezing is uncommon.</p>\n<p>The <strong>absence of fever</strong> and <strong>wheezing</strong> helps to distinguish C. trachomatis pneumonia from respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia.</p>\n<p>A distinctive laboratory finding is the presence of <strong>peripheral eosinophilia </strong>(&gt;400 cells/&micro;L).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The most consistent finding on <strong>chest radiographs is hyperinflation </strong>accompanied by <strong>minimal interstitial </strong>or<strong> alveolar infiltrates.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Pneumococcal pneumonia generally presents with features of lobar pneumonia.

Neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis is caused by <strong>serotypes D to K. </strong>Chlamydia trachomatis inclusion conjunctivitis manifests relatively late, usually over 1 week after birth.</p>\n<p>It is usually a venereal infection derived from the cervix or urethra of the mother during delivery. On examination, the conjunctiva is <strong>swollen</strong> and <strong>edematous</strong>. The discharge is initially <strong>watery</strong>, but later becomes <strong>muco</strong><strong>purulent</strong> or <strong>bloody</strong>.</p>\n<p>Newborns with suspected chlamydia infection should have samples drawn from both the <strong>conjunctivae</strong> and <strong>oropharynx</strong>. Since it is an <strong>obligate</strong> <strong>intracellular</strong> organism, swabs should also include conjunctival epithelial cells if possible. Giemsa staining shows characteristic <strong>intracellular</strong> <strong>inclusion</strong> <strong>bodies. Diagnosis&nbsp;</strong>is usually established by <strong>PCR</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The treatment includes&nbsp;<strong>oral erythromycin for two weeks</strong>. Topical erythromycin to tetracycline ointment may also be used.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If left untreated, associated systemic diseases such as <strong>chlamydial otitis</strong> and <strong>pneumonia</strong> may develop later.
