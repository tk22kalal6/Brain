The equilibrium&nbsp;between Hb and O<sub>2</sub> can be understood from the following equation:</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 642\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>HbO<sub>2</sub></strong> + 2,3-DPG <strong>⇄</strong> <strong>Hb</strong>&minus;2,3-DPG + <strong>O<sub>2</sub></strong></p>\n<p>In stored blood, the 2,3 DPG levels usually fall. As a result, stored blood releases less oxygen to the tissues than the normal circulating blood, thus limiting its use in hypoxic patients (Eg: anaemia).</p>\n<p>However, such a<strong> fall in 2,3 DPG is less</strong> when it is stored in a phosphate-containing solution like <strong>CPDA</strong> (Citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine), rather than <strong>ACD</strong> (Acid citrate dextrose). Therefore, the blood stored in CPDA, in comparison with blood stored in ACD has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher 2,3 DPG concentration</li>\n<li>More amount of deoxygenated blood bound to 2,3 DPG</li>\n<li>Decreased affinity of Hb to the oxygen.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased release of oxygen</strong> to the tissues.</li>\n<li><strong>Raised</strong> <strong>P50</strong> (PO2 at which Hb is half saturated)</li>\n<li>Shift in O2-Hb dissociation curve to the right</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Acid citrate dextrose solution was introduced during the second world war, CPD eventually replaced ACD becoming the commonly used preservative.
