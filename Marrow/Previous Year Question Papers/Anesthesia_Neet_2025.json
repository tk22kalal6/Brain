The image shows cricothyrotomy, a temporary emergency airway that must be followed by tracheostomy because of risks such as perichondritis, subglottic edema, and laryngeal stenosis.<br><br>If intubation fails, options include a laryngeal mask airway, laryngeal tube airway, or surgical airway. Surgical airway is indicated in airway obstruction from glottic edema, laryngeal fracture, or severe oropharyngeal bleeding. <br><br>Cricothyrotomy can be of two types:<br><br>* Needle cricothyrotomy: A needle is introduced through the cricothyroid membrane to provide short-term ventilation. This may be combined with percutaneous transtracheal oxygenation at 15 L/min using a cannula and Y-connector. Intermittent insufflation (1 sec on, 4 sec off) provides oxygenation but inadequate CO2 clearance, so it is limited to 30-45 minutes.<br><br>* Surgical cricothyrotomy: A transverse incision is made over the cricothyroid membrane, and a tube is inserted. It is preferred in emergencies over tracheostomy as it is faster, easier, and associated with less bleeding.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Surgical cricothyrotomy can be used for effective ventilation up to 24 to 48 hours. Needle cricothyrotomy can be used only for 30 to 45 minutes.<br><br>Option B: Cricothyrotomy is used for emergency airway management and not for the measurement of central venous pressure.<br><br>Option C: In cricothyrotomy, the upper airway is bypassed, resulting in less resistance to airflow. Therefore, the work of breathing in cricothyrotomy is less, not more, than with bag-mask ventilation.",
