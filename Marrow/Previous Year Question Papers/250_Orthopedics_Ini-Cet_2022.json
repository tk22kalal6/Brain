      "solution": "<p><strong>Statement C</strong> is false. Nerve injury is more common in <strong>posterior hip</strong> <strong>dislocation.</strong> The <strong>sciatic nerve</strong>, lying <strong>behind</strong> the posterior wall of the acetabulum is most commonly involved here.</p>\n<p><strong>Sciatic nerve injury</strong> is seen in 10-20 % of cases with posterior hip dislocation. It is usually a <strong>neuropraxia</strong> type of injury and resolves spontaneously. But, if it is suspected after a reduction maneuver, immediate exploration must be carried out.</p>\n<p><strong>Posterior hip dislocation</strong> is the <strong>commonest </strong>type of hip dislocation (80%), commonly seen following dashboard injuries. The patient presents with <strong>flexion, adduction, and internal rotation</strong> deformities.</p>\n<p>X-ray findings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Femoral head lying above and behind the acetabulum and appears <strong>smaller</strong> than normal</li>\n<li><strong>Lesser trochanter</strong> is <strong>not visualized</strong> as the thigh is internally rotated</li>\n<li>Femoral head and posterior acetabular wall fractures may also be seen</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Treatment </strong>includes<strong> </strong>an <strong>early reduction</strong> to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis and osteoarthritis. <strong>Closed reduction</strong> under sedation or general anaesthesia is done in most cases. If there is an associated <strong>femoral neck fracture</strong>, the <strong>closed reduction</strong> <strong>should not be attempted</strong> as it can lead to the displacement of the femoral neck and disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head.</p>\n<p><strong>Anterior hip dislocation </strong>is less common than posterior hip dislocations and accounts for about 10-20% of all hip dislocations. This injury is usually sustained following a high-energy accident. The affected limb in this condition will be<strong> abducted, externally rotated, and slightly flexed.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Although vascular injuries are seen in posterior dislocations as well, they are most likely with anterior dislocation. This is because of the femoral artery lying anterior to the head.
