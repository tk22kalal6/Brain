      "solution": "<p>The probable diagnosis in the given scenario of a 16-year-old girl with <strong>intense food cravings</strong> followed by <strong>self-induced vomiting</strong> is <strong>bulimia nervosa.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong> is an eating disorder, often seen in young women. It is characterized by <strong>binge-eating episodes</strong>, followed by inappropriate, compensatory measures to stop&nbsp;weight gain, like&nbsp;<strong>self-induced vomiting</strong>, laxative abuse, diuretics, enema, and emetic abuse. These binge-eating episodes occur at least once a week and are present for at least 3 months. The patient fears gaining weight and has a relentless drive to be thin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>weight</strong> is <strong>normal</strong> in most patients with bulimia nervosa. However, few patients may either be overweight or underweight. There is a risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Treatment modalities are cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, and antidepressants such as fluoxetine.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Anorexia nervosa </strong>is an eating disorder that is often seen between the ages of 10 and 30. Typical features are self-induced <strong>starvation</strong>, voluntary and <strong>unhealthy reduction in weight</strong>, intense drive for thinness, and fear of becoming obese. These symptoms are usually present for at least a period of 3 months. Associated features can include depression, anxiety, amenorrhea in females, hypothermia, and bradycardia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Atypical depression</strong> is a type of depression characterized by <strong>mood reactivity,</strong>&nbsp;which is brightening of the mood in response to positive events;&nbsp;<strong>significant weight gain</strong>&nbsp;or increase in appetite;&nbsp;<strong>hypersomnia;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>leaden paralysis;</strong>&nbsp;and/or interpersonal rejection sensitivity, resulting in sig&shy;nificant social or occupational impairment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Binge-eating disorder</strong> is the most common eating disorder. It is characterized by <strong>rapid intake of abnormally large quantities of food</strong> over a short period of time, even when not hungry. There are feelings of guilt about the eating episodes, but these patients <strong>do not compensate</strong> in any way following the episodes of binge.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Eating Disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Anorexia nervosa</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Binge-eating disorder</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Avoidance of food</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>(calorie deficit)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Binge eating</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+/-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Compensation</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>(purge/vomit)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>&nbsp;+/-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>BMI</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>LOW*</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>NORMAL (</span><span>18.5&ndash;22.9)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>HIGH</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;*In <strong>atypical anorexia nervosa</strong>, all the features of anorexia nervosa will be present, but the patient will have normal BMI.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Postpartum blues</strong> is the most likely diagnosis in a postpartum woman with <strong>tearfulness</strong>, <strong>mood swings</strong>, and <strong>insomnia</strong> from <strong>day 4.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Postpartum blues, also known as baby blues, is a transient mood disorder characterized by sadness, tearfulness, confusion, and dysphoria. There are no suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming the baby. These symptoms typically develop <strong>3-5 days after delivery. </strong>They are thought to be due to hormonal changes, the stress of giving birth, and the responsibilities of motherhood. They <strong>resolve spontaneously</strong> <strong>within 10-14 days. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Management involves <strong>reassurance, education, </strong>and <strong>support.</strong> The patient must be followed up and assessed if symptoms persist for &gt;2 weeks to evaluate postpartum depression.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option A: When the symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, insomnia, and weight changes <strong>start within 4 weeks</strong> as per <strong>DSM 5 </strong>or<strong> 6 weeks </strong>as per<strong> ICD 11,</strong> and the symptoms <strong>persist for ≥ 2 weeks</strong>, the diagnosis will be <strong>postpartum depression</strong><strong>. </strong>The patient may have <strong>occasional thoughts </strong>of<strong> harming </strong>the<strong> baby </strong>and<strong> suicidal thoughts</strong>. It can persist for months to years when untreated.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C: <strong>Postpartum psychosis</strong> is a psychiatric <strong>emergency </strong>that usually occurs within <strong>4 weeks</strong> after delivery (DSM 5) or <strong>6 weeks</strong> after delivery (ICD 11). The predominant symptoms are <strong>hallucinations</strong>, <strong>delusions</strong>, <strong>suicidal</strong> <strong>thoughts</strong>, and thoughts of <strong>harming the baby</strong>. Psychotic symptoms such as insomnia, restlessness, labile mood, and agitation are seen. Lithium<strong>,</strong> antipsychotics, and an antidepressant is the treatment of choice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D: <strong>Postpartum anxiety</strong> is not defined by DSM-5. However, some platforms might describe postpartum anxiety as excessive or severe worry after childbirth.</p>\n<p>Note:  Zuranolone is the first-ever oral drug to be approved specifically for the treatment of postpartum depression. It is a neuroactive steroid that enhances the action of GABA in the brain and regulates mood. </p>\n<p> </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Postpartum mood disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Disorders and features</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Incidence and timeline</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Harmful thoughts</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Treatment</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Postpartum blues</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><span>Depressed affect, tearfulness and fatigue</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>30-75%</span></p>\n<p><span>Starts 2-3 days after delivery.
