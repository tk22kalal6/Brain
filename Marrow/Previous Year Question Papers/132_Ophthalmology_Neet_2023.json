      "solution": "<p>Visual loss in the right halves of both eyes is suggestive of <strong>right homonymous hemianopia.</strong> The site of the lesion in this case is the <strong>left optic tract.</strong></p>\n<p>Here, vision is lost in the right half of both eyes, which means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the left eye, the nasal visual field is lost, and</li>\n<li>in the right eye, the temporal visual field is lost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It means <strong>left temporal</strong> and <strong>right nasal</strong> fibers are destroyed, which leads to <strong>right homonymous hemianopia</strong>. Anatomically, this can be explained&nbsp;by the fact that each optic tract contains fibers&nbsp;from the ipsilateral temporal half of the retina and the contralateral nasal half of the retina.</p>\n<p>Optic tract lesions can occur due to&nbsp;pituitary adenomas (most common),&nbsp;craniopharyngioma, tumors of the optic thalamus, large aneurysm of superior&nbsp;cerebellar or posterior cerebral arteries,&nbsp;demyelinating diseases,&nbsp;and infarction.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Optic radiation lesions result in contralateral homonymous hemianopia, which means that the visual loss would occur in the left halves of both eyes rather than the right halves, as described in the question.</p>\n<p>Option C: Lesions at the optic chiasma typically cause bitemporal hemianopia, which involves visual loss in the outer (temporal) halves of the visual field in both eyes. This is not consistent with the patient's described symptoms.</p>\n<p>Option D: A lesion in the right optic tract would result in left homonymous hemianopia, causing visual loss in the left halves of both eyes.

      "solution": "<p>The most likely diagnosis based on the given clinical scenario and the image is <strong>index myopia </strong>seen in<strong> nuclear senile cataracts.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Index myopia</strong> occurs due to an<strong> increase</strong> in the refractive index of the crystalline lens due to <strong>nuclear sclerosis</strong>. Nuclear sclerosis is an <strong>ageing</strong> process in which the lens becomes hard and inelastic resulting in an <strong>increase</strong> in the<strong> refractive index</strong>, causing <strong>progressive myopia</strong> (decreased distant vision).
