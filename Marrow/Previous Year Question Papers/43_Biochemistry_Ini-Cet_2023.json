The quaternary structure of haemoglobin determines its affinity for O<sub>2</sub>. In <strong>deoxyhemoglobin</strong>, the <strong>globin</strong> units are <strong>tightly</strong> bound in a <strong>tense</strong> (T) configuration, which <strong>reduces</strong> the affinity of the <strong>molecule</strong> for <strong>O<sub>2</sub></strong>. When O<sub>2</sub> is first bound, the bonds holding the globin units are released, producing a relaxed (R) configuration, which exposes more O<sub>2</sub> binding sites. The net result is a 500-fold increase in O<sub>2</sub>. In <strong>tissues</strong>, these reactions are <strong>reversed</strong>, resulting in O<sub>2</sub>  dissociation.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0b3e356275cc4fed8e57fa6dc3f8dc73x1280x1009.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

This model is the initial proposition aimed at elucidating the mechanism of an enzymatic catalytic process. Based on this concept, it can be inferred that the enzyme's structure or conformation exhibits a state of <strong>rigidity</strong>. The substrate effectively conforms to the binding site, which is now referred to as the active site, in a manner analogous to a <strong>key</strong> fitting precisely into its corresponding <strong>lock</strong> or a <strong>hand</strong> fitting snugly into a well-fitting <strong>glove</strong>. The <strong>active</strong> <strong>site</strong> of an enzyme can be described as a <strong>stiff</strong> and pre-configured template that selectively accommodates a certain substrate for binding. </p>\n<p>The <strong>induced</strong> <strong>fit</strong> or <strong>Koshland</strong> <strong>theory</strong> states that the active site <strong>does</strong> <strong>not possess</strong> a <strong>firm</strong> and pre-determined <strong>conformation</strong>. The emerging active site exhibits the fundamental characteristics of the substrate binding site. The substrate's contact with the enzyme elicits a conformational change in the enzyme, leading to the establishment of a robust binding site for the substrate. Moreover, as a result of induced fit, the enzyme undergoes conformational changes that lead to the <strong>repositioning</strong> <strong>of</strong> the <strong>specific</strong> <strong>amino</strong> <strong>acids</strong> involved in the formation of the active site, hence facilitating the catalytic process. The induced fit model has garnered substantial empirical support through <strong>X</strong>-<strong>ray</strong> <strong>diffraction</strong> studies. Koshland's model additionally elucidates the mechanisms by which allosteric modulators and competitive inhibition exert their effects on enzymes.</p>\n<p>The substrate strain theory states that the substrate experiences <strong>strain</strong> as a result of the <strong>conformational</strong> <strong>alteration</strong> generated <strong>by</strong> the <strong>enzyme</strong>. It is plausible that upon the binding of a substrate to the preexisting active site, the enzyme elicits a strain on the substrate. The presence of a stressed or <strong>strained</strong> <strong>substrate facilitates</strong> the generation of the <strong>desired product</strong>. The enzymatic action is believed to involve a <strong>combination</strong> of the <strong>induced</strong> <strong>fit</strong> model <strong>and</strong> <strong>substrate</strong> <strong>strain</strong>.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/318a7d77f8654988b9bacc8e5c22376cx1279x883.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The complementary active site of the enzyme binds to the substrate to <strong>form</strong> the <strong>product.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: The active site of the enzyme is <strong>not</strong> <strong>complementary</strong> to the <strong>allosteric activator</strong>. Allosteric sites are separate and specific sites on the enzyme that are modulated with allosteric effect modifiers and hence are complementary to them.</p>\n<p>Option D: The active site of the enzyme binds to the substrate which <strong>form</strong> a <strong>transitional</strong> <strong>state</strong> which is unstable and later dissociates to form a product.</p>",

The latter is comprised of a porphyrin ring containing an iron atom. The heme group present in cytochromes exhibits distinct characteristics when compared to the heme group observed in the structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin. The heme iron within cytochromes undergoes a <strong>cyclic process of oxidation (Fe3+) and reduction (Fe2+)</strong>, playing a crucial role in facilitating electron movement throughout the electron transport chain (ETC). This stands in <strong>opposition</strong> to the <strong>heme iron found in haemoglobin </strong>and <strong>myoglobin</strong>, which remains in the <strong>ferrous</strong> (<strong>Fe2+</strong>) form. The cytochromes were initially assigned the designations of a, b, and c based on the specific heme type they contained and their corresponding absorption spectra.

These antibodies are produced by <strong>hybridoma technology</strong>. </p>\n<p>In this technology, the B-lymphocytes of mice spleen are immunized with an antigen to produce a specific antibody. These specific antibody-producing B lymphocytes are then <strong>fused with myeloma cells</strong> that can multiply indefinitely.</p>\n<p>The myeloma cells are <strong>deficient</strong> in the hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (<strong>HGPRT</strong>) gene and do not produce immunoglobulins. Therefore, the resulting hybrid cell is producing antibodies against a single antigen indefinitely. These <strong>hybrid</strong> cells are <strong>cultured</strong> in a <strong>HAT medium</strong> (containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine) and the monoclonal antibodies are obtained. It is well-established that nucleotides present in DNA and RNA consist of purine and pyrimidine bases. The synthesis of these nucleotides can occur through <strong>either</strong> the <strong>De novo</strong> pathway <strong>or </strong>the <strong>salvage pathway</strong>. Consequently, the inclusion of aminopterin in the HAT medium effectively inhibits the De novo pathway, thereby rendering the <strong>synthesis</strong> of <strong>purine dependent</strong> on the <strong>salvage pathway</strong>. However, it should be noted that the <strong>salvage pathway</strong> exclusively takes place in the presence of the enzymes <strong>HGPRT</strong> and <strong>thymidine kinase</strong>. The hybridoma cell is <strong>uniquely capable</strong> of <strong>proliferating</strong> on the <strong>HAT medium</strong> due to its <strong>distinct composition</strong>.
