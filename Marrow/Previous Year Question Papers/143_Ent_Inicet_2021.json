This method involves <strong>holding</strong> one’s <strong>breath</strong> to close the airway <strong>prior</strong> to swallowing, followed by <strong>coughing</strong> voluntarily immediately after swallowing to clear any residual food or liquid from the airway entrance. It is an effortful breath-holding technique, which not only results in Valsalva and subsequent leakage of bolus but can also result in arrhythmias. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: A<strong> tracheoesophageal prosthesis(TEP)</strong> involves a <strong>one-way</strong> valve that is inserted through a previously-created tracheoesophageal puncture.
