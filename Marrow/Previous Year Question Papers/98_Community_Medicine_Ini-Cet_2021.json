Therefore, in a population with a <strong>high</strong> prevalence of the disease, a positive result with a highly sensitive test means true positive. Example:&nbsp;Hypothyroidism&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>more prevalent in hilly areas</strong>&nbsp;than in coastal areas. If someone from a<strong>&nbsp;hilly area </strong>tests <strong>positive</strong>&nbsp;he is&nbsp;<strong>more likely to have the disease</strong>&nbsp;than someone who tests positive in a coastal area.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if the <strong>prevalence</strong> <strong>decreases</strong>, the <strong>PPV</strong> will also become <strong>low</strong>. So in a population with a&nbsp;low prevalence of the disease, positive result with a highly sensitive test need not always mean true positive as it can produce an<strong> unacceptably high proportion of false positive</strong> results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Predictive value is affected&nbsp;<strong>the most</strong>&nbsp;by prevalence.
