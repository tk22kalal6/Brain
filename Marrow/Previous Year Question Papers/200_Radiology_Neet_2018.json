      "solution": "<p>The<strong> Bragg peak effect </strong>is pronounced in <strong>protons</strong>.</p>\n<p>The proton is a heavy and charged particle that gradually loses its speed as it interacts with human tissue. It is easily controlled and delivers its maximum dose at a precise depth and can go as far as 32 cm. The absorbed dose increases very gradually with greater depth and lower speed, <strong>suddenly rising</strong> to a <strong>peak</strong> when the proton is ultimately stopped. This is known as the Bragg peak.</p>\n<p>The behavior of the proton can be precisely determined, and the beam can be directed, allowing the Bragg peak to occur within the tumor site. Immediately following this burst of energy, the protons cease radiating and come to a complete stop. This property of <strong>proton therapy </strong>enables<strong> targeting tumors</strong> within the body, delivering radiation directly to the tumor while <strong>sparing</strong> the <strong>surrounding healthy cells</strong>, offering a much less invasive alternative to treat cancer.</p>\n<p>The Bragg curve shown below plots the energy loss of ionizing radiation during its travel through matter.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/62c4f6d692354217afdc5a9e9ef3ce48x1280x901.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
