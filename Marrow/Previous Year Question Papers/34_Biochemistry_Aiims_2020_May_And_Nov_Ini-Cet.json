With every DNA replication during cell division,<strong> telomere shortening</strong> occurs. Once telomeres are almost negligible or non-existent in length, the DNA is unable to replicate and the cell dies. Hence, there is a limit to the number of times a cell can divide.</p>\n<p><strong>In stem cells </strong>and<strong> cancer cells</strong>, an enzyme <strong>telomerase </strong>having <strong>reverse transcriptase activity</strong> (RNA dependent DNA polymerase) adds telomeres to the chromosome ends, thereby <strong>preserving</strong> chromosomal length. It allows the stem cells and cancer cells to multiply a lot more number of times than a normal adult cell.</p>",
