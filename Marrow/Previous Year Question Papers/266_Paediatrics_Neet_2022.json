Hence, a<strong>&nbsp;dried spot sample </strong>for<strong> HIV DNA PCR</strong> is the next best step.</p>\n<p><strong>AIDS enteropathy,</strong> a syndrome of malabsorption with partial villous atrophy not associated with a specific pathogen, has been postulated to be a<br />result of direct HIV infection of the gut.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis of HIV infection in babies&nbsp;born to HIV-infected mothers is done by <strong>HIV proviral DNA</strong> or RNA PCR, HIV culture, or HIV p24 antigen. The national program (Early Infant Diagnosis) now uses HIV total nucleic acid (RNA + proviral DNA) PCR test on <strong>dried blood spot samples</strong>. All positive tests need to be confirmed with an HIV PCR test on another sample.</p>\n<p>An infant born to an HIV-positive mother should be <strong>breastfed exclusively</strong> or by <strong>replacement feeds</strong> exclusively for <strong>6 months</strong> of age. Infants should receive <strong>ARV prophylaxis</strong> with <strong>s</strong><strong>yrup nevirapine </strong>or<strong> zidovudine</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is common in HIV-infected babies. Common pathogens identified are bacteria (<em>Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, Mycobacterium avium complex</em>), protozoa (<em><strong>Giardia,</strong> Cryptosporidium, Isospora, microsporidia</em>), viruses (CMV, HSV, rotavirus), and fungi (<strong><em>Candida</em></strong>). MAC and protozoal infections are most severe and protracted in children.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Test stool for giardiasis and give antibiotics </strong>is not preferred as the immediate next step. First, the diagnosis of HIV infection should be established before treating secondary infections.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Antibody tests for HIV</strong> are not useful in establishing the diagnosis of HIV infection. This is because all infants born to HIV-infected mothers test antibody positive at birth because of the passive transfer of maternal HIV antibodies across the placenta. It can be used as a diagnostic tool after <strong>18 months</strong> of age.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Aerobic culture </strong>is not used for the diagnosis of HIV infection.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Clinical stages of HIV in children/ infants</h3><p><strong>Stage 1</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asymptomatic</strong></li>\n<li>Persistent<strong> generalized lymphadenopathy</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>General-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unexplained persistent hepatosplenomegaly</strong></li>\n<li>Recurrent or chronic upper&nbsp;respiratory infections&nbsp;(otitis media, otorrhoea,&nbsp;sinusitis, tonsilitis)</li>\n<li>Fungal nail infections</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Oral-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recurrent oral ulcerations</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Unexplained persistent parotid enlargement</strong></li>\n<li>Linear gingival erythema</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Skin-&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Papular pruritic eruptions</li>\n<li>Extensive wart virus infection</li>\n<li>Extensive molluscum contagiosum</li>\n<li><strong>Herpes zoster</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong></p>\n<p><strong>General-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unexplained moderate malnutrition not adequately responding to standard therapy</li>\n<li><strong>Unexplained persistent diarrhea</strong> (14 days or more)</li>\n<li><strong>Unexplained persistent fever</strong> (above 37.6 &deg;C intermittent or constant, for longer than one month)</li>\n<li><strong>Unexplained anemia </strong>(&lt;8 g/dL),<strong> neutropenia</strong> (&lt;0.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L)&nbsp;or<strong> chronic thrombocytopenia </strong>(&lt;50 &times; 10<sup>9</sup>/L)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Oral-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Persistent oral candidiasis </strong>(after first 6-8 weeks of life)</li>\n<li><strong>Oral hairy leukoplakia</strong></li>\n<li>Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis/periodontitis</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Respiratory-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pulmonary TB/ Lymph node TB</strong></li>\n<li>Severe recurrent bacterial pneumonia</li>\n<li><strong>Symptomatic lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis</strong></li>\n<li>Chronic HIV-associated lung disease including bronchiectasis</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong></p>\n<p><strong>General-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unexplained severe wasting, stunting or malnutrition not responding to standard therapy</li>\n<li>Chronic herpes simplex infection; (oro-labial or cutaneous of more than one month's duration or visceral at any site)</li>\n<li><strong>Extrapulmonary TB </strong>and disseminated non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infection</li>\n<li><strong>Kaposi sarcoma</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Oesophageal candidiasis</strong> (or candidiasis of trachea, bronchi or lungs)</li>\n<li><strong>Cytomegalovirus infection</strong>; retinitis or CMV infection affecting another organ, with onset at age over 1 month)</li>\n<li>Disseminated endemic mycosis (extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis)</li>\n<li>Chronic cryptosporidiosis and&nbsp;isosporiasis</li>\n<li><strong>Symptomatic HIV-associated nephropathy </strong>or HIV-associated<strong> cardiomyopathy</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Neurological-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Central nervous system toxoplasmosis (after one month of life)</li>\n<li>HIV encephalopathy</li>\n<li>Cerebral or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma</li>\n<li>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy</li>\n<li>Extrapulmonary cryptococcosis (including meningitis)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Respiratory-</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pneumocystis pneumonia</strong></li>\n<li>Recurrent severe bacterial infections (e.g., empyema, pyomyositis, bone or joint infection, meningitis, but excluding pneumonia)</li>\n</ul>",
