Thus, the <strong>mean</strong> is the measure of central tendency which is <strong>maximally affected by extreme values</strong> (option B). It is usually an <strong>inappropriate</strong> measure <strong>for describing skewed distributions</strong>. However, <strong>repeated</strong> <strong>samples</strong> from the <strong>same population</strong> will always tend to have <strong>similar</strong> <strong>means</strong>. Mean is able to <strong>resist fluctuations</strong> between different samples drawn from the same population better than mode or median.</p>\n<p>To obtain the median of a given set of data, the<strong> values are first arranged in ascending or descending order</strong> of magnitude, and then the value of the <strong>middle observation</strong> is noted. Since the data has to be first arranged in order before the median can be determined, an <strong>overall observation</strong> is necessary for its calculation (option C).</p>\n<p><strong>Mode</strong> is the <strong>observed value</strong> in the frequency distribution that occurs with the<strong> greatest frequency</strong>.

Functional status refers to the comprehensive assessment of an individual's health effect within the framework of their surroundings and social support network. It encompasses the individual's capacity to do the physical and social tasks required for their typical activities and duties. The constituents of functional status encompass <strong>activities</strong> of <strong>daily</strong> <strong>living</strong> (ADLs), <strong>instrumental</strong> <strong>activities</strong> of <strong>daily</strong> <strong>living</strong> (IADLs), and <strong>advanced</strong> <strong>activities</strong> of <strong>daily</strong> <strong>living</strong> (AADLs). Two often employed measures in the field are the <strong>Katz</strong> <strong>index</strong>, which assesses activities of daily living (<strong>ADLs</strong>), and the <strong>Lawton</strong> scale, which evaluates <strong>instrumental</strong> activities of <strong>daily</strong> <strong>living</strong> (IADLs). The most effective approach for ascertaining AADLS involves the utilization of <strong>open</strong>-<strong>ended</strong> inquiries, such as \"In what manner do you allocate your time throughout the day?\" or \"What activities do you find enjoyable?\"</p>\n<p>There is a growing trend in geriatric assessment to integrate perspectives from non-clinical office workers, patients, and their relatives or loved ones. This collaborative approach may encompass the use of standing orders, forms, and questionnaires. An advisable strategy involves doing an annual evaluation of functional status, <strong>commencing</strong> at the age of <strong>65</strong> <strong>years</strong>, using the <strong>Medicare</strong> <strong>Annual</strong> <strong>Wellness</strong> <strong>Visit</strong>. For individuals below the age of 75 years with multiple comorbidities or those aged 75 years and above, it is recommended to augment this assessment with supplementary components. Furthermore, it is recommended that some components of geriatric assessment, such as evaluating activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), measuring gait, balance, and the risk of falls, evaluating mood and affect, as well as assessing cognition, be conducted following significant illnesses, particularly those necessitating hospitalization.</p>",

A vertical line, referred to as the <strong>centre</strong> <strong>line</strong> or <strong>spine</strong>, is then <strong>positioned</strong> to the left of the box where the problem is documented. Subsequently, <strong>diagonal</strong> <strong>lines</strong> resembling fish <strong>bones</strong> are sketched <strong>emanating</strong> from the <strong>central</strong> <strong>line</strong>, also known as the spine. The <strong>diagonal</strong> <strong>lines</strong> depicted in the diagram signify <strong>distinct</strong> <strong>categorizations</strong> of the underlying factors contributing to the issue. <strong>Supplementary</strong> <strong>branches</strong> may also be delineated from the primary skeletal structure to symbolize <strong>underlying</strong> <strong>factors</strong> leading to the causes.</p>\n<p>The groupings are typically <strong>structured into</strong> <strong>categories</strong>, commonly known as the <strong>five Ps</strong> (patients/clients, providers, policies, processes and procedures, and place/equipment), the <strong>six Ms </strong>(machine, method, materials, measurement, man, and Mother Nature), and the<strong> four Ss</strong> (surroundings, suppliers, systems, and skills). Nevertheless, the groupings need to be tailored to the organization and problem being investigated. The responsibility for ensuring this specificity lies with the quality improvement team. Once the categories have been delineated, the quality improvement team proceeds to partake in a brainstorming session to <strong>identify</strong> <strong>causes</strong> that are specific to each respective grouping. The aforementioned procedure persists until the team reaches a point where they are unable to ascertain any further underlying factors.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d9849f51c2dd4db6afdb2eb6bb03f414x1280x941.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Logistic</strong> <strong>regression</strong> may be used in some situations where we are <strong>not interested</strong> in a <strong>numerical</strong> <strong>outcome</strong> (like risk, etc) but we want a <strong>nominal</strong> or <strong>categorical</strong> one (like death/survival, developing a disease/not developing a disease). Here, the relationship between the variables will not be a linear one as the outcome from survival to death in relationship with the risk factor can change suddenly. Thus these outcomes are represented by 0 and 1.</p>\n<p>Option B: A<strong> bar graph i</strong>s a pictorial way of presenting a set of <strong>numbers</strong>, the magnitudes of which are proportional to the length of the bars in the graph.

The process of planning campaigns necessitates proactive <strong>participation</strong> and <strong>cooperation</strong>, signifying a heightened level of engagement in decision-making procedures that have a direct influence on the welfare of the community. This level of participation <strong>also</strong> <strong>includes</strong> <strong>engaging</strong> with the community's <strong>perceived</strong> <strong>needs</strong> through actively contributing to the strategic design and implementation of initiatives that aim to enhance health outcomes.</p>\n<p>Earlier <strong>socialisation</strong> was envisaged as an idea for the utilisation of services but recently WHO and UNICEF deemed <strong>community</strong> <strong>participation</strong> would be of even greater help. They have defined it as ''<em>the process by which individuals and families assume responsibility for their health and welfare for those of the community and develop the capacity to contribute to their and the community's development</em>.'' It also signifies the involvement of the community in the process of planning, organizing, and managing their healthcare services. This concept is commonly referred to as \"<strong>Health by the People</strong>.\" </p>\n<p>There are <strong>three ways</strong> in which a <strong>community</strong> would be able to <strong>participate</strong>:</p>\n<p>1) The community can <strong>offer</strong> various <strong>resources</strong> such as facilities, human resources, logistical assistance, and maybe financial help.</p>\n<p>2) Active community engagement is crucial in the processes of planning, management, and assessment.</p>\n<p>3) Another significant contribution that individuals may make is by actively participating in and utilizing healthcare services.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Options A, B and C are also methods by which a community will be able to participate but planning of health-related campaigns is considered the highest form of community participation. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Elements and Principles of Primary Health Care</h3><p><strong>A.
