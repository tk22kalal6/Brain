      "solution": "The given clinical scenario of an 8-year-old boy limping painlessly for 10 months, with the X-ray showing a fragmented head of the left femur, suggests the probable diagnosis to be Perthes disease.<br><br>Perthes disease, also known as Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, is the avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis. It is most commonly seen in the age group of 4-9 years. The incidence is higher in boys than in girls.<br><br>It is usually a unilateral disease, but can occur bilaterally in 10% of cases. Risk factors include low birth weight, passive smoking, family history, low socioeconomic status, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.<br><br>The disease is characterised by the disruption of blood flow to the femoral head, resulting in osteonecrosis and the cessation of bone growth. The lateral epiphyseal artery is involved. Over time, healing and fibrosis occur by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone, which leads to a loss of bone mass and weakening of the femoral head. <br><br>Clinical features include pain and limping. Pain aggravates on doing any activity and is relieved by rest. Physical examination reveals pain on passive movement of the hip, and abduction with internal rotation is limited.<br><br>X-ray findings depend on the stages <br><br>* Initial phase: Medial joint space widening and increased density in the ossific nucleus<br><br>* Fragmentation phase: Alternating patches of sclerosis and fibrosis<br><br>* Re-ossification phase: Complete removal of necrotic bone. Epiphyseal density is regained in this phase<br><br>* Remodelling phase: Remodelling occurs until skeletal maturity is attained<br><br>The radiograph below shows features of bone necrosis followed by remodelling in Perthes disease.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4648e5cd327446ebbcb5713124cc21c4x720x513.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: DDH (Developmental dysplasia of the hip) is usually diagnosed in the neonatal period.

The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as the differential pressure (ΔP). A differential pressure (ΔP) of less than 30 mm Hg (4.00 kilopascals) is an indication for immediate compartment decompression.<br><br>The threatened compartment must be promptly decompressed. Only splitting the plaster is not helpful, and the limb must be kept flat. This is because elevating the limb causes a further decrease in end capillary pressure and aggravates muscle ischemia.<br><br>In the case of compartment syndrome in the leg, fasciotomy should be performed. This involves opening all four compartments via medial and lateral incisions. Wounds to be left open and inspected 2 days later. If tissues are healthy, the wounds can be sutured, but if there is muscle necrosis, debridement needs to be carried out.<br><br>The image below shows a fasciotomy.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f4e08e8551f945efb8257f9f3358eda8x720x956.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM2207: Acute Compartment and Crush Syndromes<br><br>1. Acute Compartment Syndrome<br><br>Acute compartment syndrome is an elevation of the intracompartmental pressure (ICP) which increases the risk for tissue ischemia and necrosis.<br><br>Causes: Fractures (70%) and severe soft tissue injuries (30%). Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. <br><br>Pathology: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. <br><br>Clinical features: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. <br><br>Management: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg.  <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br> <br><br>2. Crush Syndrome <br><br>Crush syndrome is the systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis. It is commonly caused due to prolonged external compression of an extremity. <br><br>Causes: Crush injuries sustained during motor vehicle accidents, earthquakes, mining and other occupational accidents.<br><br>Pathology: Underperfusion of muscle causes myonecrosis. When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. <br><br>Clinical features: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.<br><br>Management: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome.",
