      "solution": "<p>The image shows a child with a <strong>well-circumscribed</strong>, <strong>black</strong>, <strong>heterogenous</strong> lesion <strong>covered with hair</strong>. This is characteristic of a&nbsp;<strong>congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN).&nbsp;</strong>They&nbsp;may be present at birth or develop shortly thereafter. They&nbsp;are <strong>benign</strong> and can be brown, black, purplish, or red, and are usually a&nbsp;<strong>palpable lesion.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They can be <strong>classified</strong> based on size: small (&lt;1.5 cm), medium (1.5-19.9 cm), and large or giant (&gt;20 cm). <strong>Larger CMN have a higher risk of developing malignant melanoma.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong> of CMN depends on the size and location of the lesion. Smaller nevi may be observed, while larger nevi or those at a higher risk for complications may require surgical excision, particularly if there is a concern for malignant transformation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Complications</strong> of CMN include neurological abnormalities (<strong>intraparenchymal melanosis</strong> is the commonest finding),<strong>&nbsp;malignant melanoma</strong>, and other tumors like <strong>rhabdomyosarcoma.</strong></p><p>The images below show different melanotic skin lesions:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6d3584e078a943baacc5d17c44dddf1fx1280x1255.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/40155b7532ed40a2a93ca6fabfd39223x1280x1023.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1c19fbc8e62b49a79c636aa0aa549726x1280x992.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
