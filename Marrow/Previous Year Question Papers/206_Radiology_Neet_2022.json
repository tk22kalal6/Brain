      "solution": "<p>The above imaging modality is a&nbsp;<strong>PET</strong> <strong>CT&nbsp;</strong>scan.</p>\n<p>PET (<strong>positron-emission tomography</strong>) CT scan is a<strong> hybrid</strong> technique that combines PET and CT scan that is used for<strong> targeted imaging</strong> of tumor physiology and biology. It&nbsp;is based on the principle that<strong> tumor cells</strong> generally have<strong> high metabolic activity</strong> compared with normal tissues.</p>\n<p>A small dose of the radiopharmaceutical agent <strong>18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)</strong>. This enters cells and is phosphorylated to<strong> FDG 6-phosphate</strong>&nbsp;which cannot be metabolized further. Since it is a highly polar molecule, it <strong>cannot</strong> easily <strong>diffuse back</strong> out of the cell. After intravenous injection of FDG, it continuously <strong>accumulates</strong> in the metabolically active cell.</p>\n<p>The main <strong>advantage</strong> of PET-CT is the<strong> identification</strong> of distant<strong> metastatic disease</strong> not seen on CT alone. The disadvantages of PET scans are <strong>radiation burden</strong>,<strong> poorer spatial</strong> resolution when used alone, and <strong>high cost.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Cerebral blood flow</strong> scan refers to the<strong> perfusion MRI</strong> that uses gadolinium as contrast and provides information about the cerebral blood flow and volume.</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;The<strong> sestamibi scan</strong> is used for<strong> parathyroid localization</strong> and is now considered the most<strong> accurate</strong> and <strong>reliable</strong> method for imaging the parathyroid glands. Sestamibi<strong> accumulates</strong> in <strong>mitochondria.&nbsp;</strong>Parathyroid <strong>adenomas</strong> often have a<strong> high</strong> concentration of <strong>oxyphilic cells</strong> with <strong>high mitochondrial content</strong>. These retain sestamibi tracer and adenomas&nbsp;are therefore associated with a <strong>slow washout</strong> when compared with the thyroid gland.</p>\n<p>Option D: The<strong> full body MDCT</strong> scan refers to the <strong>multidetector CT</strong> scan which is an advanced CT imaging technique that uses multiple detector elements that provide improvement in speed, quality, and scope.</p>",
