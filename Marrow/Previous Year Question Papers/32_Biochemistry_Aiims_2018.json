Since<strong> insulin </strong>is an <strong>inhibitor </strong>of <strong>hormone-sensitive lipase</strong> (HSL), an insulin-deficient state will cause <strong>HSL overactivity</strong> in adipocytes and the <strong>breakdown of lipid</strong> into fatty acids (<strong>lipolysis</strong>). Free fatty acids will undergo <strong>beta-oxidation</strong> and produce a large amount of <strong>acetyl CoA</strong>, which gets converted to <strong>ketone bodies</strong> ( acetoacetate, acetone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, etc.)</p>",
