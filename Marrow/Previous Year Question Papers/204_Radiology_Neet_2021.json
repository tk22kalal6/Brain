The compartment is retroperitoneal and hence, the abscess is also called a&nbsp;<strong>retroperitoneal</strong> abscess. The compartment contains iliacus and iliopsoas muscles. The psoas compartment muscles lie in close proximity to major abdominal organs and is richly supplied by iliolumbar, external iliac and common femoral arteries. Owing to these reasons, there is hematogenous spread of infections like <strong>tuberculosis</strong> leading to abscess.</p>\n<p>Clinical presentation is with back pain, fever, and lassitude. The hip may be in fixed flexion or there may be pain on passive extension.<br />CT is performed for diagnosis. Treatment is with percutaneous CT-guided drainage and antibiotic therapy.</p>\n<p>Other muscles marked in the image are depicted below.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6773c1adab414e7bbb63ee98dc50f18ax600x905.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
