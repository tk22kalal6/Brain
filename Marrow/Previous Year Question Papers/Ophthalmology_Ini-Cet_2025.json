As seen in the image above, on the left gaze, there is impaired adduction of the right eye and nystagmus on the abduction of the left eye. This means that the lesion is in the right MLF, leading to a defect in left gaze. The right gaze is normal. In INO, there is impaired adduction on the ipsilateral side of the lesion, and nystagmus on abduction on the contralateral side.<br><br>When the gaze is initiated, the horizontal gaze centre or the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) generates the eye movements. The PPRF has two outputs. The first is to the ipsilateral 6th cranial nerve nucleus, which causes abduction of the ipsilateral eye. The second output is to the MLF, which sends an impulse to the contralateral 3rd cranial nerve nucleus, causing contralateral adduction. These two outputs from PPRF lead to conjugate movement of the eyes to the same side. <br><br>The following image shows the pathway for horizontal eye movements as described above.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3542fd4606848a783616049d10e66f8x1280x2228.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7098121a0401435b81b262d9575b1346x1280x2152.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Features of unilateral INO include<br><br>* Straight gaze in the primary position of the eyes<br><br>* Impaired adduction of the ipsilateral eye, with the contralateral eye having nystagmus on abduction<br><br>* Looking at the ipsilateral side has no gaze issues<br><br>* Convergence may be intact if the lesion is anterior and discrete.<br><br>Bilateral INO would present with a limitation of ipsilateral adduction and nystagmus of the contralateral eye on both sides. A few causes of INO include demyelinating diseases (such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome), strokes, and tumours.<br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option B: 3rd nerve palsy leads to ptosis. Eyeball is turned down, out and slightly intorted due to actions of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles.<br><br>Option C: Horizontal gaze palsy occurs due to a lesion of the horizontal gaze centre in the PPRF, leading to ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy, with an inability to look in the direction of the lesion.\n \nOption D: Thyroid eye disease is characterised by lid retraction, lid lag, and proptosis.",
