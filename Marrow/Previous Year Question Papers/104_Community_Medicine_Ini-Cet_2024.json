However, per the <strong>CDC guidelines</strong>, the maximum age for all rotavirus vaccines is <strong>8 months, 0 days</strong>. Since this is a recall question, the options appeared as such in the exam. Additionally, rotavirus is a live vaccine, making option 2 (which states that it is a subunit vaccine) the distinctly wrong statement and the better answer.</p>",
