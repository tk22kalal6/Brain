Thus, live vaccines can <strong>either</strong> be given on the <strong>same day</strong> according to the schedule <strong>or 4 weeks apart</strong>.</p>\n<p>Note: In Park 27th ed. the minimum interval between two live vaccines is given as 3 weeks. However, several other standard sources including CDC and UNDP suggested an interval of 4 weeks. When both are given in options, it is recommended to mark 4 weeks as the correct answer.</p>",
