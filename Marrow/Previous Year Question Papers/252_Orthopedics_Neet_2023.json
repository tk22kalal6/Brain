It is a benign but locally aggressive tumor. It is exclusively seen in <strong>adults</strong> and affects the<strong> ends of long bones</strong>, involving metaphysis/ epiphysis&nbsp;of long bones. GCT is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and distal radius.&nbsp;Common presenting complaints are&nbsp;<strong>swelling</strong>&nbsp;and vague<strong>&nbsp;pain</strong>.
