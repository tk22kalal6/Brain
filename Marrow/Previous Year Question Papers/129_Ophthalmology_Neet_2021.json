On examination, <strong>giant papillae</strong> are seen on the upper tarsal conjunctiva with hyperemia. Focal apical ulceration and whitish scarring may develop on larger papillae.</p>\n<p>Papillae are reddish, flat-topped, raised areas that give a red and velvety appearance to the tarsal conjunctiva.

Flexner Winterstein rosettes refer to an arrangement of columnar cells around a central lumen, which is highly characteristic of retinoblastoma.</p>\n<p>Retinoblastoma is a malignant proliferation of immature retinal neural cells and is the <strong>most common</strong> <strong>intraocular malignancy</strong> in <strong>children</strong>. It is associated with mutations in the <strong>RB1 gene</strong> at chromosome <strong>13q14. </strong>It is a&nbsp;tumour of a group called small round blue cell tumours because the immature retinal neural cells are seen as small round cells with large nuclei.</p>\n<p><strong>White pupillary reflex</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>leukocoria</strong> is the most common presenting feature, followed by a squint which is usually convergent.

      "solution": "<p><strong>MRI</strong> can be <strong>detrimental</strong> for a patient with a history of an <strong>intraocular foreign body (IOFB)</strong> after cutting stone with a hammer and <strong>iron</strong> chisel. It can cause further damage by producing movements of the foreign body if it is magnetic. The use of <strong>MRI</strong> is <strong>contraindicated</strong> for metallic (iron) foreign bodies and is not recommended as a screening procedure.</p>\n<p>The foreign bodies most likely to penetrate and be retained in the eye are minute chips of iron or steel. While chipping stone with an iron chisel, the chip of the iron chisel is more likely to enter the eye than the stone. A foreign body entering the eye may cause damage by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mechanical effects</li>\n<li>introduction of infection</li>\n<li>reacting with the intraocular tissues</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Anteroposterior</strong> and <strong>lateral</strong> view <strong>X-rays</strong> are recommended for locating an IOFB as most foreign bodies are <strong>radio-opaque</strong>. <strong>Ultrasonographic</strong> localization can tell the position of even <strong>non-radiopaque</strong> foreign bodies. <strong>CT scan</strong> is the <strong>best</strong> method of IOFB localization.
