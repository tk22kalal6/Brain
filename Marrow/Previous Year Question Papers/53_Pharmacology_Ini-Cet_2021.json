If there is downregulation of this enzyme it will cause a decrease in the efficacy of clopidogrel and can lead to thrombotic events like stroke.

      "solution": "<p>Vancomycin acts on <strong>step 4</strong>&nbsp;in the given image.</p>\n<p>Mechanism of action of vancomycin: It is a <strong>cell wall synthesis inhibitor</strong>. It binds to the <strong>D-Ala-D-Ala terminus</strong> of the newly formed peptidoglycan pentapeptide and <strong>inhibits the&nbsp;transglycosylase</strong> enzyme. This would <strong>prevent further elongation</strong> of <strong>the peptidoglycan</strong> and its cross-linking.</p>\n<p>Vancomycin is a bactericidal agent for <strong>gram-positive</strong> organisms. It is also active against many gram-positive anaerobes like <strong>Clostridium difficile</strong>.&nbsp;Resistance against vancomycin in enterococci is due to the alternation in its binding site where D-Ala is replaced by D-Lactate.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical uses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parenteral vancomycin is given for bloodstream infections and <strong>endocarditis caused by MRSA</strong>.</li>\n<li>Vancomycin plus gentamicin is given as an alternative regimen for enterococcal endocarditis with penicillin allergy.</li>\n<li>In combination with other agents for suspected meningitis or <strong>meningitis due to penicillin-resistant pneumococcus</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Oral vancomycin</strong> is given for <strong>Clostridium difficile colitis.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adverse effects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Injection site phlebitis</li>\n<li>Nephrotoxicity</li>\n<li><strong>\"Redman\" syndrome</strong> due to histamine release following infusion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Fosfomycin</strong> inhibits <strong>step 1</strong> in the image. It acts at a very early stage in cell wall synthesis and inhibits the cytoplasmic enzyme<strong>&nbsp;enol pyruvate transferase</strong>. This would block the&nbsp;addition of phosphoenolpyruvate to UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. This <strong>prevents the formation of&nbsp;UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid</strong> which is the precursor&nbsp;N-acetylmuramic acid. N-acetylmuramic acid is a component of the bacterial cell wall and hence cell wall synthesis is inhibited.</p>\n<p><strong>Cycloserine</strong> inhibits <strong>step 2</strong> in the image. It is a structural analog of D-alanine and inhibits the enzymes <strong>alanine racemase</strong> that&nbsp;converts L-alanine to D-alanine and <strong>d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase</strong>. This would thereby inhibit the incorporation of D-alanine into the peptidoglycan pentapeptide. It is mainly used in the management of tuberculosis where there is resistance to the first-line agents.</p>\n<p><strong>Bacitracin</strong> inhibits <strong>step 3</strong> in the image. It is a cell wall synthesis inhibitor that interferes with&nbsp;<strong>dephosphorylation</strong> in the cycling of the <strong>lipid carrier</strong> which transfers&nbsp;peptidoglycan subunits to the growing cell wall. It is only given for topical application because of its severe nephrotoxicity when given systemically.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p><strong>Beta-lactam</strong> antibiotics prevent cross-linking by inhibiting the<strong> transpeptidases</strong>.

Varenicline is taken orally and the dose taken is 0.5 mg once daily on days 1 to 3, increased to 0.5 mg twice daily on days 4 through 7 and 1 mg twice daily after day 8 for 11 weeks. Therapy should start one week before the target quit date.
