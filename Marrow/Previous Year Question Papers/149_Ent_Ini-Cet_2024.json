      "solution": "<p><strong>Malleus-incus discontinuity </strong>with an <strong>intact tympanic membrane</strong> causes <strong>maximum</strong> hearing loss.</p>\n<p>This condition causes maximum conductive hearing loss, <strong>up to 60 dB</strong>,  as there is no alternative pathway for sound transmission to the cochlea. Even though the tympanic membrane is intact, the disconnection of the ossicular chain severely disrupts sound transmission to the inner ear.</p>\n<p>Hearing loss <strong>severity</strong> depends on the extent to which the normal <strong>transmission of sound waves</strong> through the middle ear is disrupted. </p>\n<p>Average hearing losses seen in different lesions of conductive apparatus</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete obstruction of the ear canal: 30 dB</li>\n<li>Perforation of tympanic membrane: 10-40 dB</li>\n<li>Ossicular interruption with intact drum: <strong>54 dB</strong></li>\n<li>Ossicular interruption with perforation: <strong>38 dB</strong></li>\n<li>Malleus fixation: 10-25 dB</li>\n<li>Closure of oval window: 60 dB</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p>Option B: Malleus-incus discontinuity with <strong>perforation</strong> of the tympanic membrane: Although this results in <strong>conductive</strong> hearing loss (<strong>38-40 dB</strong>), the perforated tympanic membrane allows some direct transmission of sound to the inner ear, slightly reducing the severity compared to an intact tympanic membrane with ossicular discontinuity.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Partial fixation</strong> of the <strong>footplate of stapes</strong> causes a milder form of <strong>conductive</strong> hearing loss compared to ossicular discontinuity, typically around <strong>30–40 dB</strong> because some sound transmission still occurs through the fixed stapes.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Otitis media with effusion</strong> leads to mild to moderate <strong>conductive</strong> hearing loss (<strong>20–30 dB</strong>), as fluid in the middle ear dampens sound vibrations but does not fully block sound transmission.</p>\n<p> </p>",
