      "solution": "<p><strong>Methylergometrine</strong> is contraindicated in the management of postpartum hemorrhage in a female with <strong>chronic hypertension</strong>.</p>\n<p>Methylergometrine is an ergot derivative, which acts directly on the myometrium. It excites uterine contractions which come so frequently one after the other with increasing intensity that the uterus passes into a state of spasm<strong> without </strong>any relaxation in between. Hence, it should be used only be used either in the <strong>late second stage</strong> of labor(after the delivery of the anterior shoulder) or following the delivery of the baby.</p>\n<p>Indications :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prophylactic - Active management of the third stage of labor as prophylaxis to excess bleeding following delivery</li>\n<li>Therapeutic - To stop the atonic <strong>uterine bleeding</strong>, following delivery, abortion or expulsion of hydatidiform mole. It is used at a dose of <strong>0.2mg</strong> im/iv, repeated every 2-4 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Side effects :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nausea and vomiting.</li>\n<li>Because of its vasoconstrictive action, it may precipitate a rise in <strong>blood pressure</strong>, myocardial infarction, stroke and bronchospasm.</li>\n<li>Repeated use may lead to <strong>gangrene</strong> of the toes due to its vasoconstrictive effect.</li>\n<li>Repeated use in puerperium may interfere with lactation by lowering prolactin levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contraindications :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multiple pregnancy </strong>- If given accidentally with the delivery of the first baby, the second baby is compromised by the tetanic contractions of the uterus.</li>\n<li><strong>Heart disease</strong> - Results in sudden squeezing of blood from the uterine circulation into the systemic circulation causing overloading of the right heart and failure.</li>\n<li><strong>Hypertensive</strong> disorders, <strong>pre-eclampsia</strong> and eclampsia</li>\n<li><strong>Rh-negative</strong> mother - More risk of fetomaternal microtransfusion.</li>\n<li>Vascular disease</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Misoprostol </strong>is a methyl ester of PGE1, used in the <strong>induction of labor </strong>and in the management of <strong>postpartum hemorrhage</strong>. Side effects include <strong>fever</strong>, <strong>tachysystole</strong> (hyperstimulation), fetal heart rate changes and meconium passage. It should not be used for cases with <strong>previous cesarean birth</strong> because the risk of uterine <strong>rupture</strong> is high.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Oxytocin</strong> is used in the active management of the <strong>third stage of labor</strong>, <strong>augmentation</strong> of labor and control of <strong>postpartum</strong> <strong>hemorrhage</strong>. Contraindications for its use are <strong>hypovolemic</strong> states, obstructed labor and <strong>cardiac disease.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Prostaglandin F2 alpha</strong> derivative (carboprost) is used in the management of <strong>postpartum hemorrhage</strong>.

These are features of <strong>Mullerian agenesis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Congenital <strong>absence</strong> of both the <strong>uterus</strong> and<strong> vagina</strong> is termed Mullerian agenesis or <strong>Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser</strong> syndrome. Females have a <strong>shallow vaginal pouch</strong> (1 to 2 inches deep). The uterus, cervix, and upper part of the vagina are absent. Typically, <strong>normal ovaries </strong>persist, as they originate from the genital ridge. Individual presents with <strong>primary amenorrhea</strong>, have a normal female appearance, <strong>secondary sexual characteristics</strong>, and <strong>46 XX</strong> karyotype. Most patients with Mullerian agenesis have only small rudimentary Mullerian bulbs without endometrial activity. </p>\n<p>With Mullerian agenesis, traditional conception is not possible, but pregnancy may be achieved using oocyte retrieval, fertilization, and gestational surrogacy.</p>\n<p>Individuals with Mullerian agenesis or hypoplasia have associated congenital <strong>renal</strong> or <strong>skeletal </strong>anomalies.

Skeletal malformations include spina bifida, sacralization, sacral bone lumbarization, and cervical vertebral anomalies.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Kallmann syndrome</strong> presents with primary amenorrhea due to <strong>hypogonadotropic</strong> hypogonadism from deficiency of <strong>GnRH</strong>. The<strong> FSH</strong> and <strong>LH</strong> levels are <strong>lower</strong> than normal, leading to <strong>poor development</strong> of secondary sexual characteristics. It is associated with olfactory dysfunction and<strong> anosmia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Androgen insensitivity syndrome</strong> occurs due to a defect in the <strong>androgen receptor</strong> in a genotypic male (<strong>XY</strong>). These individuals are phenotypic females with <strong>no male or female internal genitalia</strong>. They have normal <strong>female external genitalia </strong>with an absent or shallow vagina, <strong>well-developed breasts</strong>, and <strong>scanty body hair</strong> (axillary and pubic) and present with primary amenorrhea.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Gonadal dysgenesis</strong> in the form of 45XO (Turner syndrome) or 46XY (Swyer syndrome) presents with <strong>poor development </strong>of<strong> </strong>secondary sexual characteristics.

      "solution": "<p>The low FSH and LH levels, along with the low BMI, suggest<strong> hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.</strong></p>\n<p>BMI of 17.5 kg/m² indicates low body weight, which can lead to hypothalamic suppression and a disruption in the normal feedback mechanisms that regulate the menstrual cycle. FSH (2mIU/ml), LH (0.3IU/L): These values are low, indicating that the pathology lies at the level of the hypothalamus or pituitary, rather than the ovaries. In hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, there is insufficient secretion of gonadotropins (FSH and LH), which are needed for ovarian function. TSH (1.2mIU/ml) and Prolactin (20 ng/ml) are normal, which rules out thyroid dysfunction or hyperprolactinemia as the cause of the amenorrhea.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong> of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kallman's syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome</li>\n<li>Pituitary tumors, apoplexy</li>\n<li><strong>Anorexia nervosa, excess exercise</strong></li>\n<li>Irradiation, Infection,Trauma</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Exercise-induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (EIHG)</strong>: intense and prolonged physical activity leads to a decrease in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, resulting in lower levels of sex hormones. This occurs due to reduced secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which subsequently lowers levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).</p>\n<p><strong>Causes: </strong>Excessive physical training, especially in endurance sports. Energy imbalance (low calorie intake vs. high energy expenditure). Psychological stress and overtraining.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Men: Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and muscle weakness.</li>\n<li>Women: Irregular or absent menstrual cycles (amenorrhea).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Management </strong>includes rest and reduced exercise intensity. Adequate caloric intake to correct energy deficits. EIHG is a reversible condition with lifestyle modifications and is most commonly seen in athletes or individuals with excessive physical demands.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Primary ovarian failure </strong>(Premature ovarian insufficiency) is associated with elevated FSH and LH levels due to a lack of negative feedback from the ovaries, which is not the case here (FSH and LH are low).</p>\n<p><strong>Option C: Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism</strong> refers to primary ovarian failure, where <strong>FSH and LH levels </strong>are <strong>elevated</strong> due to the lack of ovarian response. The low levels of FSH and LH here rule out this condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: Normogonadotropic Normogonadism </strong>would indicate<strong> normal levels</strong> of FSH, LH, and estrogen, typically seen in conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, in this case, the low FSH and LH levels suggest a hypothalamic or pituitary issue.</p>",
