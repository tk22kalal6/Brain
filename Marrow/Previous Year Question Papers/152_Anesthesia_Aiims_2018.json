VAE into severed vessels is likely to occur when the surgical site is above the right atrium and venous pressure at the incision site is below the atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary artery pressure will rise and etCO<sub>2</sub> will fall after a venous air embolism.</p>\n<p>In sympathetic overactivity and carotid body stimulation, blood pressure will rise.</p>\n<p>In vagal stimulation, a drastic drop in etCO<sub>2</sub> is unlikely.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a recent AIIMS question.
