A <strong>low Km </strong>reflects a <strong>high affinity</strong> of the enzyme for substrate and vice versa. The value of Km is given by the <strong>substrate concentration</strong> at which the reaction velocity is equal to<strong> one-half Vmax.</strong> It does not change with changes in enzyme concentration.</li>\n<li><strong>Vmax</strong> is the maximum velocity of a reaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Competitive inhibition</strong> is when the inhibitor binds <strong>reversibly</strong> to the <strong>substrate-binding site</strong> and competes with the substrate for the active enzyme-binding site.

A defect in this enzyme leads to the <strong>accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes </strong>of peripheral, voluntary muscles and progresses to involve the <strong>cardiac muscle</strong> and diaphragm. Clinical features include <strong>hypotonia</strong> (floppy baby syndrome), <strong>cardiomyopathy</strong>, hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive. <strong>Myozyme</strong> can prevent worsening or can reverse cardiac and skeletal abnormalities.</p>\n<p><strong>Cori disease</strong> (type III glycogen storage disorder) occurs due to a deficiency of the <strong>glycogen debranching enzyme</strong>. The features of Cori disease include <strong>hypoglycemia</strong>, <strong>hepatomegaly</strong>, and hyperlipidemia but with normal blood lactate and uric acid levels.

This leads to severe muscle damage resulting in a massive release of <strong>myoglobin</strong> in the blood. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Glycogen Storage Diseases</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/782e85c36f0648698a222dca988adfabx1280x1863.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Enzyme deficiency</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type 0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glycogen synthase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Early death</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type Ia</p>\n<p><strong>Von Gierke's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glucose-6- phosphatase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hepatomegaly and renomegaly&nbsp;due to glycogen accumulation</p>\n<p>Severe fasting hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Growth failure</p>\n<p>Lactic acidosis</p>\n<p>Hyperuricemia</p>\n<p>Hyperlipidemia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type Ib</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Endoplasmic reticulum glucose-6- phosphate transporter</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Same as Von Gierke's disease</p>\n<p>Recurrent infections due to impaired neutrophil function</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type II</p>\n<p><strong>Pompe's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lysosomal &alpha;1,4:1,6 glucosidase</p>\n<p>(Acid maltase)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle weakness</p>\n<p>Death by age ~ 2 years (infantile variant)</p>\n<p>Cardiomegaly and heart failure</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type III</p>\n<p><strong>Cori's/Forbes disease</strong></p>\n<p>(Limit dextrinosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glycogen debranching enzyme</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle weakness</p>\n<p>Fasting hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Hepatomegaly due to accumulation of branched-chain polysaccharide (limit dextrins)</p>\n<p>Growth retardation</p>\n<p>Normal lactate and uric acid levels</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type IV</p>\n<p><strong>Andersen disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glycogen branching enzyme</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Failure to thrive</p>\n<p>Hepatomegaly due to accumulation of polysaccharides with few branch points</p>\n<p>Death at age ~ 5 years</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type V</p>\n<p><strong>McArdle disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle glycogen phosphorylase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exercise-induced cramps</p>\n<p>Renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria</p>\n<p>Second wind phenomenon</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type VI</p>\n<p><strong>Her's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Liver glycogen phosphorylase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Generally benign</p>\n<p>Mild hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Hepatomegaly</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type VII</p>\n<p><strong>Tarui's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle phosphofructokinase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exercise-induced muscle cramps and weakness</p>\n<p>Growth retardation</p>\n<p>Hemolytic anemia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Folic acid plays a key role in <strong>one</strong>-<strong>carbon metabolism</strong>, essential for the biosynthesis of several compounds. <strong>Tetrahydrofolate</strong> (THF), the reduced, coenzyme form of folate, receives one-carbon fragments from donors such as serine, glycine, and histidine and transfers them to intermediates in the synthesis of <strong>amino acids</strong>, <strong>purine nucleotides</strong>, and <strong>thymidine monophosphate </strong>(TMP), a pyrimidine nucleotide incorporated into DNA.</p>\n<p><strong>Leafy vegetables</strong> such as spinach, turnip, lettuce and fortified cereal products are rich sources.</p>\n<p><strong>Folate deficiency</strong> is caused by increased demand (e.g., <strong>pregnancy</strong> and lactation), poor absorption caused by pathology of the small intestine, <strong>alcoholism</strong>, or treatment with drugs (e.g., <strong>methotrexate</strong>) that are dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors. Children with <strong>hemolytic anemia</strong> have high folate requirements due to increased erythropoiesis predisposing them to deficiency (option B). Its manifestations are :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anemia</strong> -  A primary result of folic acid deficiency is <strong>megaloblastic anemia</strong>, caused by diminished synthesis of purine nucleotides and TMP, which leads to an inability of cells to make DNA and, therefore, an inability to divide. </li>\n<li><strong>Neural tube defects </strong>- Maternal deficiency of folate, during pregnancy, is implicated in neural tube defects. <strong>Periconceptional</strong> folate supplements, begun <strong>1 month before conception</strong> and continued for 3 months after, are recommended to reduce the risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyperhomocysteinemia</strong> - Folate, along with <strong>vitamin B12</strong>, is involved in converting <strong>homocysteine</strong> to <strong>methionine</strong>, as depicted below.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Congenital lactic acidosis</strong> is seen due to a defect in <strong>pyruvate dehydrogenase</strong>.</p>\n<p>The major source of <strong>acetyl CoA</strong> for the <strong>tricarboxylic acid </strong>(TCA)<strong>cycle</strong> is the <strong>oxidative decarboxylation</strong> of <strong>pyruvate</strong> by the multienzyme <strong>pyruvate dehydrogenase complex</strong> (PDHC). The PDHC is a protein aggregate of multiple copies of three enzymes, <strong>pyruvate decarboxylase</strong> (E1), <strong>dihydrolipoyl transacetylase</strong> (E2), and <strong>dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase</strong> (E3). Each catalyzes a part of the overall reaction.</p>\n<p>A deficiency of the <strong>E1 component</strong> of the PDHC is the most common biochemical cause of <strong>congenital lactic acidosis</strong>. The deficiency results in a decreased ability to convert pyruvate to acetyl CoA, causing pyruvate to be shunted to <strong>lactate</strong> via lactate dehydrogenase. This creates particular problems for the brain, which relies on the TCA cycle for most of its energy and is particularly sensitive to acidosis. Symptoms include <strong>neurodegeneration</strong>, <strong>muscle spasticity</strong>, and, in the neonatal-onset form, early death. The inheritance pattern is <strong>X- linked dominant</strong>, with both males and females affected. Although there is no proven treatment for PDHC deficiency, <strong>dietary restriction of carbohydrates</strong> and supplementation with<strong> thiamine</strong> may reduce symptoms in select patients. </p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase </strong>deficiency results in <strong>maple syrup urine disease</strong>. There is defective oxidative decarboxylation of <strong>leucine</strong>, <strong>isoleucine</strong> and <strong>valine</strong>. The disease is characterized by feeding problems, ketoacidosis, changes in muscle tone, and coma.</p>\n<p>Option C -  Defective transketolase is a rare disorder of pentose phosphate metabolism with symptoms apparent in infancy including developmental delay and intellectual disability, delayed or absent speech, short stature, and congenital heart defects. </p>\n<p>Option D -  Isocitrate dehydrogenase is an enzyme of the TCA cycle which converts isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate.
