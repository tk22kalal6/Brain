If the disease is perceived to have a <strong>high severity</strong>, then the person is more likely to adopt a <strong>healthier lifestyle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Perceived threat</strong> comprises perceived susceptibility and severity. People with a higher perceived threat tend to take on health-promoting activities.</p>\n<p>Action:</p>\n<p><strong>Perceived benefits</strong> refer to a person's subjective judgment on how a particular health habit is modifying his chances of developing a disease. If the person&nbsp;believes that a habit is likely to reduce his/her chances of susceptibility to a disease or lower the severity of a disease, he/she is more likely to follow that healthy habit.</p>\n<p><strong>Perceived barriers </strong>to action also influence if a person wants to follow healthy behavior. The benefits of a particular health habit must overweigh the barriers that a person must overcome to continue following that behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Cues to action</strong> may be internal or external. Internal cues include pain and clinical symptoms. External cues include awareness through media, physicians, and friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Behavioral modification (Option B)</strong> is part of the action after assessing all of the above-mentioned concepts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Self-efficacy (Option D)&nbsp;</strong>can be defined as a person's capacity in achieving his health goals.

All internal and external factors, including demographic and psychological characteristics, aim at <strong>health motivation </strong>to attain the action phase of a health belief system.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Perceived control</strong> refers to a person's internal belief in the control they would have over things that are part of the past or the future or over a process, behavior, and outcome.

The&nbsp;<strong>exposure</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>microorganism in an infectious disease</strong>. For lung cancer, it is any factor that initiates the process, such as&nbsp;<strong>asbestos</strong>&nbsp;fibres or components in&nbsp;<strong>tobacco smoke.&nbsp;</strong>Primary prevention<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(health promotion and specific protection) is applicable in this period.</p>\n<p>The<strong> period of pathogenesis </strong>starts after the disease process has been triggered and pathological changes occur without the individual being aware of it. It&nbsp;begins with&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>entry</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<strong>organism</strong>&nbsp;till <strong>recovery</strong>, <strong>death,</strong> or <strong>disability.</strong>&nbsp;The<strong> subclinical</strong> or <strong>asymptomatic period</strong>&nbsp;between&nbsp;<strong>exposure</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>onset of symptoms</strong>&nbsp;is called the&nbsp;<strong>incubation period</strong>&nbsp;for infectious diseases, and the&nbsp;<strong>latency period</strong>&nbsp;for chronic diseases.&nbsp;<strong>The onset of clinical symptoms</strong>&nbsp;is the beginning of the&nbsp;<strong>clinical stage</strong>&nbsp;of the disease.&nbsp;Secondary (halting of the disease process) and tertiary prevention (measures to limit disability) are applicable in this period.</p>\n<p><strong>Rehabilitation</strong> has been defined as the use of medical, social, educational, and vocational measures for <strong>training</strong>&nbsp;the individual to the highest possible level of <strong>functional ability. </strong>It is a part of tertiary prevention like providing <strong>callipers</strong> for walking patients and arranging <strong>schooling</strong> after being affected by polio.</p>",
