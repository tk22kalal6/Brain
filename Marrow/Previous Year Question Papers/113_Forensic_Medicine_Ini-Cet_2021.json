      "solution": "<p>The description of the wound given in the question suggests a <strong>split laceration</strong> and the mechanism is&nbsp;the <strong>tissue being crushed</strong> between the underlying bone (i.e. skull) and the weapon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A laceration is a tear or a split in the skin, mucous membrane, muscle, or any internal organ produced by blunt force. The margins are irregular and may show minute tears and bruising.&nbsp;Tears that are seen at the ends, diverging away from the main laceration are called&nbsp;<strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">swallowtails.</span></strong>&nbsp;In skin lacerations, usually one of the margins overhangs the other. This helps in assessing the direction of the force.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Classification of a laceration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Split laceration (incised-like laceration): </strong>It<strong>&nbsp;</strong>occurs when the skin is&nbsp;<strong>crushed between two hard objects.&nbsp;</strong>For example, during a fall, the scalp gets crushed between the skull from inside and hard ground outside. This results in a wound, which usually mimics an incised one unless examined closely.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Incised-looking lacerated wound</strong>&nbsp;is a wound with the&nbsp;<strong>linear splitting </strong>of the tissue caused by blunt force.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is seen where the skin overlies an area of the bone where there is scanty underlying subcutaneous tissue such as the&nbsp;scalp, forehead, shin, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Avulsed laceration:</strong>&nbsp;A lesion where the&nbsp;<strong>skin separates</strong>&nbsp;or peels off by tearing from the underlying tissues. An avulsion is a laceration produced by a <strong>shearing force delivered at an acute angle</strong> to tear off a portion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachments.&nbsp;It may&nbsp;overhang the wound. It is also called&nbsp;<strong>flaying</strong>.&nbsp;This is common in road traffic accidents. <strong>(Option A)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Tears:&nbsp;</strong>Tearing of skin and subcutaneous tissue can occur from localized <strong>impact by or against irregular or semi-sharp objects</strong>.&nbsp;It may be due to blows by broken glass, or a fall on a rough projected object. <strong>(Option B)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Stretch laceration:&nbsp;</strong>It occurs due to the&nbsp;<strong>over-stretching of the skin</strong>, beyond its elasticity.&nbsp;This is seen in wounds produced from running over by a motor vehicle, and when a fracture produces a sudden deformity of the bone. <strong>(Option C)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Cut laceration:&nbsp;</strong>Injury by a heavy sharp-edged instrument. For example, cut from ax, chopper, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The image shows a split laceration which is incised looking laceration.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/150f914a52b1444a8af8d0c2813175eex720x746.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ac9d233eed604aec8aa0a949c2c63343x600x782.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

There is a sweetish metallic taste. Features include:\n<ul>\n<li>GIT:&nbsp;<strong>Constriction in the throat</strong> and dysphagia, <strong>burning,</strong> and colicky pain in the <strong>esophagus</strong>, stomach, and bowel occur. Intense thirst and severe vomiting are constant symptoms. Involuntary and frequent<strong>&nbsp;dark-colored</strong>, stinking, and bloody stools that later become colorless, odorless, and watery resembling rice-water stools of <strong>cholera</strong>. A garlicky odor of breath and feces may be noted</li>\n<li>Renal: Oliguria, uremia, albuminuria, red cell casts.</li>\n<li>Cardiovascular system: Acute circulatory collapse with vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, ventricular tachycardia, and fibrillation.</li>\n<li>Central nervous system: Headache, vertigo, hyperthermia, convulsions, coma. Peripheral neuropathy is more sensory than motor.</li>\n<li>Death is usually due to circulatory failure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Fulminant type</strong>: Massive doses of arsenic when rapidly absorbed cause death in one to three hours. Death occurs due to shock and peripheral vascular failure. Arsenic also has a direct action on the heart muscle. In this type gastrointestinal symptoms are absent.</li>\n<li><strong>Narcotic type</strong>: The gastrointestinal symptoms are minimal. There is giddiness, formication, delirium. Arseniuretted hydrogen when inhaled as a gas, destroys hemoglobin and causes hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and renal failure. Death is instantaneous.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Repeated stomach washes with&nbsp;warm water and milk.</li>\n<li>Emetics should not be used</li>\n<li>Oral hydrated ferric oxide is given in small doses.

The oral cavity is discolored, inflamed, and superficially corroded.

Other symptoms include&nbsp;muscle and joint pain, convulsions, optic neuritis, delirium. Loss of the <strong>outer third of eyebrows</strong> is significant. Maculo-papular butterfly-shaped skin eruption on the face is characteristic. There may be <strong>Mees lines</strong> on the nails.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Acute</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Lead poisoning</strong>&nbsp;causes dry throat, burning abdominal pain, peripheral circulatory collapse, insomnia, paraesthesias, depression, coma, and death. Cerebellar ataxia is common in children with acute lead poisoning. A screening test for lead poisoning is the presence of porphyrinuria, mainly due to <strong>coproporphyrin III</strong>.

He was found with his head hanging to his left side with saliva dribbling from the left angle of his mouth. Both the pupils are dilated and the right eye is open. Compression of which of the following structures is the probable reason for an open right eye in this case?",

It indicates antemortem hanging.</p>\n<p><strong>Dribbling of saliva</strong> is the surest sign of antemortem hanging.&nbsp;This occurs due to the increased salivation before death due to the stimulation of the salivary glands by the ligature or by congestive hypoxia. Stimulation of pterygopalatine ganglion also causes increased salivation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dribbling of saliva occurs from the angle of the mouth opposite to the side of the knot. When the knot is on the nape of the neck, it occurs across the middle of the lower lip.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>The ligature mark</strong>&nbsp;is usually above the <strong>hyoid bone.</strong>&nbsp;It runs obliquely, backward, upwards, is non &shy;continuous, and towards the point of suspension. The mark is noncontinuous because of a gap at the nape of the neck. When the knot is in an inverted V shape when it is in contact with the skin, because the ligature material extends downward on both sides. The skin is usually depressed/grooved, yellowish-brown, dry, hard, with small abrasions called rope burns at its edges.</p>\n<p><strong>Protrusion of tongue</strong> results&nbsp;from the pressure on floor of the mouth by ligature. It is usually swollen and blue.

In these cases, the face remains pale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D-<strong> Right internal carotid artery</strong> compression can cause transverse tears of carotid artery intima, known as the <strong>Amussat's sign. </strong>It&nbsp;is seen with antemortem hanging.
