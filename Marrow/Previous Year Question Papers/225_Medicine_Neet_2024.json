      "solution": "<p>The combination of the given clinical history and JVP showing <strong>rapid y descent </strong>is highly suggestive of <strong>chronic</strong> <strong>constrictive pericarditis</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Constrictive pericarditis</strong> is a <strong>chronic</strong> type of pericarditis that results when there is healing of acute fibrinous pericarditis or absorption of chronic pericardial effusion. The most common cause in developing countries is tuberculosis, following viral pericarditis, cardiac surgery, mediastinal irradiation, or as a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis and SLE. The main abnormality that occurs in constrictive pericarditis is the inability of the ventricles to fill because of the <strong>rigid and thickened pericardium</strong>. The restriction is <strong>not uniform</strong> through the diastole as seen in <strong>tamponade</strong>. Ventricular filling is normal early in the diastole but stops suddenly when the elastic limit of the pericardium is reached.</p>\n<p>Y-descent on the JVP curve is prominent in constrictive pericarditis because it represents the <strong>rapid early filling</strong> of the ventricles. A sudden stop in ventricular filling and subsequent rising pressure is seen as a<strong> square root sign</strong> in the JVP curve.</p>\n<p>The patient presents with exertional dyspnea and orthopnea. There may be a <strong>paradoxical rise</strong> in venous pressure during inspiration (Kussmaul's sign) reflecting impaired right ventricular compliance. The ECG often shows low-voltage QRS complexes and diffuse flattening of T-waves. A chest radiograph may show pericardial calcification, especially in tuberculous pericarditis.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1f143aefb632469aa07ced16b5ffe19ex1280x878.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />The waveforms seen in a normal JVP are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>a wave</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial contraction</strong> and occurs just after the P wave (on ECG) and just before the first heart sound.</li>\n<li><strong>c wave</strong> represents the <strong>bulging of the tricuspid valve</strong> into the <strong>right atrium</strong> during ventricular systole.</li>\n<li><strong>x descent</strong> corresponds to the <strong>atrial relaxation</strong> during atrial diastole.</li>\n<li><strong>v wave</strong> represents <strong>atrial filling</strong> during <strong>ventricular</strong> <strong>systole</strong> and peaks at the second heart sound.</li>\n<li><strong>y descent</strong> represents <strong>passive emptying</strong> of the <strong>right atrium</strong> into the <strong>right ventricle</strong> after tricuspid valve opening.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A normal tracing of the jugular venous pulse is given below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/aadf1359f05d4cddb10f327bf9ca3ab6x720x470.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Cardiac tamponade</strong>:  On JVP tracing, cardiac tamponade characteristically shows a <strong>prominent x-descent</strong> and <strong>absent y-descent</strong>.</p>\n<p>The image of JVP in cardiac tamponade is given below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a0e64599e33443c2b1c7097c72d9e38bx1279x840.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C: Mid-diastolic murmur is seen in <strong>mitral stenosis</strong> (MS).

      "solution": "<p>In evaluating the case of a 50-year-old female presenting with <strong>dyspnea</strong> and <strong>angina episodes</strong>, it is essential to differentiate between aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR). The key factor to consider in aortic stenosis(AS) is that <strong>increased myocardial oxygen consumption </strong>is more <strong>closely associated </strong>with<strong> increased pressure work </strong>rather <strong>than increased volume</strong>.</p>\n<p>AS is the <strong>narrowing</strong> of the <strong>aortic valve</strong>. It may be caused due to the <strong>calcification</strong> of the <strong>normal</strong> aortic valve, <strong>calcification</strong> of the <strong>congenital bicuspid</strong> valve, and <strong>rheumatic heart disease</strong>. In AS, the heart works <strong>harder</strong> to <strong>overcome</strong> the <strong>elevated pressure gradient</strong> between the <strong>left ventricle</strong> (LV) and the <strong>aorta</strong>, leading to <strong>increased myocardial oxygen demand</strong>. This is in contrast to <strong>AR</strong>, where the primary issue is <strong>volume overload</strong> rather than pressure overload.</p>\n<p>Three <strong>cardinal</strong> clinical <strong>features</strong> of aortic stenosis are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Exertional dyspnea -</strong> this occurs due to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Raised end-diastolic LV volume and reduced LV compliance lead to increased LV pressure, leading to elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Angina pectoris -</strong> it occurs due to the combination of the increased O<sub><span class=\"s1\">2 </span></sub>needs of hypertrophied myocardium and reduction of O<sub><span class=\"s1\">2 </span></sub>delivery.</li>\n<li><strong>Syncope -</strong> it occurs due to the combination of decreased cardiac output and systemic arterial dilation which lead to a reduction of cerebral perfusion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The progression of AS involves a<strong> gradual narrowing </strong>of the valve orifice, which increases pressure work for the LV and leads to <strong>concentric hypertrophy</strong> as an adaptive response. This process, akin to <strong>vascular atherosclerosis</strong>, involves endothelial dysfunction, lipid accumulation, and inflammation, contributing to the valve's calcification and eventual stenosis. The pathophysiology of AS results in a significant systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve. Initially, this pressure gradient leads to<strong> LV hypertrophy</strong> as the heart compensates for the increased afterload. Over time, however, this compensatory mechanism becomes maladaptive, leading to decreased LV function and <strong>heart failure symptoms</strong>. In severe cases, symptoms such as <strong>exertional dyspnea, angin</strong>a, and <strong>syncope</strong> may develop, reflecting the<strong> increased myocardial oxygen demand</strong> due to the elevated pressure work.</p>",

Note that this will be <strong>seen in both primary and secondary</strong> adrenal insufficiency.</p>\n<p>Primary and secondary adrenal insufficiencies can be differentiated biochemically:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Primary adrenal insufficiency</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Secondary adrenal insufficiency</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Serum cortisol after ACTH stimulation: low</td>\n<td>Serum cortisol after ACTH stimulation: low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Serum ACTH: <strong>high</strong></td>\n<td>Serum ACTH: <strong>low</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plasma renin: <strong>high</strong> (minerocorticoid deficiency also present, since adrenal gland itself is not functioning)</td>\n<td>Plasma renin: <strong>normal</strong> (adrenal gland itself is functional and can be regulated by renin-angiotensin system)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>Treatment is with <strong>oral hydrocortisone</strong> 15-25 mg/day in 2-3 divided doses. <strong>Long-acting agents are not preferred</strong> because they cause receptor activation even when the cortisol levels are supposed to be physiologically low in the body. Mineralocorticoid replacement is done with <strong>fludrocortisone</strong> 100-150 μg.</p>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p>Option A: Primary hyperaldosteronism (<strong>Conn syndrome</strong>), is characterized by <strong>excessive</strong> production of <strong>aldosterone</strong> by the adrenal glands. Patients commonly present with <strong>fatigue</strong>, <strong>muscle weakness</strong>, <strong>headaches</strong>, <strong>palpitations</strong>, and <strong>high blood pressure</strong>. <strong>Hypokalemia</strong> can cause muscle cramps, weakness, and even paralysis in severe cases. The diagnosis is suspected based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings of elevated plasma aldosterone and suppressed plasma renin activity.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Vitamin B12 deficiency</strong> can cause <strong>subacute combined degeneration</strong>. Patients present with <strong>sensory ataxia</strong> (involvement of the dorsal column) and UMN type of motor symptoms such as spasticity and positive Babinski sign (involvement of corticospinal tract). Because of coexisting <strong>peripheral neuropathy</strong>, <strong>deep tendon reflexes</strong> can be <strong>absent</strong>. Some patients also develop cortical defects such as dementia. These patients can also have skin hyperpigmentation, but the presence of hyponatremia and low blood pressure makes this unlikely. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Cushing's syndrome</strong> is characterized by clinical features that result from <strong>chronic</strong> exposure to <strong>excess glucocorticoids</strong> that can be due to prolonged exogenous administration of glucocorticoids, excess endogenous cortisol secretion, and ectopic ACTH production. Clinical features include <strong>moon facies</strong>, <strong>purple skin striae</strong>, abnormal masculinization (acne, bruising, enlargement of the clitoris in girls), pubertal developmental delay and <strong>amenorrhea</strong> in girls, <strong>proximal muscle weakness</strong>, <strong>osteoporosis</strong>, <strong>hypertension</strong>, <strong>hyperpigmentation</strong>, <strong>hypokalemic alkalosis</strong>, <strong>hyperglycemia</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of Adrenocortical Insufficiency</h3><p><strong>Primary</strong><strong>&nbsp;adrenal insufficiency:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anatomical destruction of gland</li>\n<li>Autoimmune (Addison's disease)</li>\n<li>Isolated autoimmune adrenalitis (polygenic)</li>\n<li>Infections -&nbsp;HIV, tuberculosis, fungi</li>\n<li>Surgical removal</li>\n<li>Acute hemorrhagic necrosis (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)</li>\n<li>Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis</li>\n<li>Metastatic carcinoma</li>\n<li>Cytotoxic agents &ndash; mitotane</li>\n<li>Enzyme inhibitors &ndash; metyrapone, ketoconazole</li>\n<li>Congenital adrenal hypoplasia</li>\n<li>Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (AIRE1 gene on 21q22)</li>\n<li>Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 2 (polygenic)</li>\n<li>X-linked adrenal hypoplasia (DAX1 gene on Xp21)</li>\n<li>Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD gene on Xq28)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Secondary adrenal insufficiency:</strong></p>\n<p>Hypopituitarism due to hypothalamic or pituitary disease</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Neoplasm</li>\n<li>Infiltration (sarcoidosis)</li>\n<li>Infection (tuberculosis, pyogenic, fungal)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Suppression of HPA axis</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By endogenous steroids from tumor</li>\n<li>By exogenous steroids</li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>The clinical scenario points to a diagnosis of <strong>atrial fibrillation</strong> and the JVP finding seen would be <strong>absent a wave</strong>.</p>\n<p>Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia. There is rapid and irregular atrial activation which is transmitted through the atrioventricular node. The conducted ventricular rate is usually rapid and <strong>irregularly irregular</strong>. It can vary from <strong>110-160</strong> beats/minute. A <strong>pulse deficit</strong> is an important clinical finding associated with the condition. This arises due to preload reduction. </p>\n<p>Symptoms include<strong> palpitations</strong>, fatigue, presyncope, and dyspnea. An ECG shows the<strong> absence</strong> of<strong> P waves</strong>. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/9c5ed9fcd3f249ff978d35cdf111c563x918x523.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>In acute atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability, electrical or chemical <strong>cardioversion</strong> is the first step. The latter is done by intravenous administration of class III antiarrhythmic - <strong>ibutilide</strong>. In a stable patient, <strong>ventricular rate control</strong> is the primary aim. This is done by intravenous or oral administration of <strong>beta-blockers</strong>. <strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong> such as verapamil and diltiazem can also be used. </p>\n<p>If the current episode duration is <strong>&gt;48 hours</strong>, cardioversion can precipitate thromboembolic complications. In such cases, cardioversion should be carried out only after <strong>3 weeks</strong> of anticoagulation. It has to be continued for 4 weeks after cardioversion. Another option is to evaluate the presence of a thrombus in the left atrial appendage. This can be done either by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or high-resolution CT.</p>\n<p>If the duration is &lt;48 hours and there are no high-risk factors, cardioversion can be done. <strong>The CHA2DS2-VASc</strong> scoring system is used to assess stroke risk. </p>\n<p><strong>Warfarin</strong> is recommended in patients with rheumatic<strong> mitral stenosis</strong> or mechanical heart valves who present with atrial fibrillation. In mitral stenosis, thrombi arise frequently from the <strong>dilated left atrium</strong>. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of mitral stenosis is known as nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. <strong>Oral factor Xa inhibitors</strong> such as apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban can be used in such cases. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Rapid x-descent </strong>is seen in <strong>Cardiac tamponade.</strong></p>\n<p><span>Option C: </span><strong>Cannon a wave</strong><span> is seen in </span><strong>atrioventricular dissociation</strong><span> and contraction of the right atria against a closed tricuspid valve.</span></p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Rapid y-descent</strong> is seen in <strong>Constrictive pericarditis</strong> and <strong>isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation.</strong></p>\n<p> </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: JVP waveform and the abnormalities</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/18bbe4a977c84587903e8637a0d9303cx1280x1005.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>1) The <strong>a-wave</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial contraction</strong>.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prominent a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Pulmonary hypertension, right atrial thrombus/ mass, and tricuspid stenosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cannon a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Complete AV block, ventricular tachycardia, and premature atrial/ junctional/ ventricular beats</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Atrial fibrillation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) The <strong>c-wave</strong> corresponds to the <strong>bulging of tricuspid valve</strong> into right atrium during ventricular contraction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) The <strong>x-descent</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial relaxation</strong> during atrial diastole.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent x-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Severe tricuspid regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rapid x-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Cardiac tamponade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) The <strong>v-wave</strong> corresponds to the <strong>venous filling</strong> of right atrium.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dominant v-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Tricuspid regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5) The <strong>y-descent</strong> corresponds to the&nbsp;<strong>passive emptying of the right atrium</strong> into right ventricle.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prolonged y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Tricuspid stenosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rapid y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Constrictive pericarditis and isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Cardiac tamponade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Supraventricular tachycardias</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Supraventricular tachycardias with narrow QRS complex:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Narrow QRS with regular RR interval</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ECG features</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sinus tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td>Normal P wave, normal ECG features except for the rate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Focal atrial tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td>A single type of abnormal p wave morphology is seen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Junctional tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td>No p waves.

It has an <strong>atrial rate </strong>of <strong>400-600/min</strong> and a <strong>ventricular rate</strong> of <strong>100-160/min</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Risk factors</strong> for developing AF include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age</strong>- usually above <strong>60</strong> years of age</li>\n<li><strong>Underlying heart disease</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Hypertension</strong></li>\n<li>Diabetes mellitus</li>\n<li>Obesity</li>\n<li>Sleep apnea</li>\n<li>Post-cardiac surgery</li>\n<li>Inflammatory pericarditis</li>\n<li><strong>Acute alcohol consumptio</strong>n. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features include heart rate typically ranging from <strong>110-160 beats/minute</strong>. It is irregular and rapid. Presyncope and syncope can be seen. Thrombus formation can occur and thromboembolic events can take place.</p>\n<p>Typically, ECG shows an <strong>absent P wave</strong> and<strong> irregular RR intervals</strong>. </p>\n<p>Management is mainly by controlling the <strong>rate</strong> by using drugs like<strong> β blockers</strong> (such as metoprolol) and <strong>calcium channel blockers</strong> (such as diltiazem and verapamil). Reversion to sinus rhythm can be done electrically or using medications. Pharmacological cardioversion can be done using <strong>ibutilide</strong>, <strong>dofetilide</strong> and <strong>amiodarone </strong>(class III antiarryhthmics) or <strong>flecainide </strong>and <strong>propafenone</strong> (class Ic drugs).</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Synchronized cardioversion </strong>is the treatment of choice in<strong> haemodynamically unstable patients.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Atrial fibrillation</strong> predisposes risk for<strong> thrombus </strong>formation<strong>, </strong>therefore appropriate anticoagulation has to be started.<strong> Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) </strong>are<strong> </strong>preferred ove<strong>r </strong>warfarin for anticoagulation<strong>. </strong>However<strong>, warfarin </strong>is the preferred drug if the patient has a<strong> mechanical prosthetic valve, advanced CKD or moderate-severe mitral stenosis.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Intravenous digoxin </strong>can be used to control the<strong> ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation,</strong> especially in patients with<strong> heart failure or</strong> those who are not suitable for beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. However, digoxin is not always the first-line treatment for rate control.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ad6bd76f35344f0591d1cbbe8eaa0445x1280x2221.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8bacdaceda1741cd8c8692cc917d80c7x1280x2207.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: CHA2DS2-VASC scoring for risk of stroke  & need for oral anticoagulation in AF</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Components</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Points</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>C &ndash; Congestive heart failure</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>H - Hypertension</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A &ndash; Age &gt; 75 years</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>D &ndash; Diabetes Mellitus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>S &ndash; Stroke/TIA/TE</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\">VASc-Vascular disease (prior MI, Peripheral Arterial Disease,</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">or aortic plaque)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;A- Age 65&ndash;74 years</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;S- sex category (i.e., female sex)</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>CHADS2 score</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Antithrombotics </strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Aspirin or no antithrombotics</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Aspirin or oral anticoagulant</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&gt;1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Oral anticoagulant</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
