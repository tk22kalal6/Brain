      "solution": "<p>In the given clinical scenario, the therapist has mixed conscious and unconscious feelings towards his patient. This is known as <strong>counter-transference.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Counter-transference</strong> is the positive and <strong>negative feelings/emotions</strong> expressed by healthcare professionals<strong> towards</strong> their <strong>patients</strong>. It&nbsp;is the process of the <strong>physician</strong> <strong>unconsciously displacing</strong> onto the patient patterns of behaviors or emotional reactions as if he/she were a significant figure from earlier in the physician's life. Psychiatrists should be alert to signs of countertransference issues like missed appointments by the psychiatrist, boredom, or sleepiness during a session. Supervision and personal therapy can help&nbsp;the psychiatrist recognize and deal with these issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Transference</strong> is the positive and <strong>negative feelings expressed</strong> by the patients towards the <strong>healthcare professional</strong>. It is the process of the <strong>patient unconsciously displacing</strong> onto individuals patterns of behavior and emotional reactions that originated with significant figures from the past (generally in childhood). This displacement is onto the psychiatrist in a clinical scenario, who is a parent surrogate.&nbsp;The patient may be angry, hostile, demanding, or obedient to an extreme degree because of former relationships and patterns of behaviors. Failure to recognize this can make the psychiatrist react to the patient's behavior like a personal attack.</p>\n<p>These are not defense mechanisms but are commonly encountered during clinical practice or while giving psychotherapy. In an interview, transference and counter-transference are very significant expressions of unconscious processes.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Dissociation</strong> is an immature defense mechanism. In this, involuntary splitting/suppression of mental functions occurs from the rest of the personality in a way that allows the expression of forbidden unconscious impulses without having a sense of responsibility for actions.</p>",

It is an <strong>acute condition</strong> and usually develops within 72 hours after the last drink. It has symptoms of both delirium and alcohol withdrawal.

They are described as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Cognitive learning</strong> includes the domain of <strong>knowledge</strong>. Bloom's taxonomy described six levels of cognitive skills. This was revised to include types of knowledge and cognitive processes. The cognitive processes include remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing,&nbsp;evaluating, and creating.&nbsp;Eg. Solving multiple-choice questions in the NEET PG entrance exam involves the usage of the cognitive domain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Psychomotor learning</strong> includes the domain of <strong>skills</strong>. It includes imitation, manipulation, precision, articulation, and naturalization. Eg. Learning how to insert an IV cannula by observing the residents and nurses during the internship involves the usage of the psychomotor domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Affective learning</strong> includes the domain of <strong>attitude</strong> and<strong> values</strong>. It includes receiving, responding, valuing, organizing, and characterization by value. Eg. Communicating with patients with empathy, responding to their concerns, and interacting with the relatives of patients involves the usage of the affective domain.</p>\n<p>Integration of all these three methods in teaching and learning methodology leads to a better understanding of the subject.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Derailment</strong> is a<strong> formal thought</strong> disorder.</p>\n<p>It is a breakdown in both the logical connection between ideas and the overall sense of being goal-oriented. It is generally identified in <strong>schizophrenic patients</strong> as a <strong>generalized loosening of associations.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, a person with derailment thought disorder might jump from talking about rabbits to the hair on their head to your sweater. They talk in chains of semi-related ideas. Their communication style has a generalized loosening of associations. Their ideas often fall further and further from the topic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Formal thought disorders</strong> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Circumstantiality</strong> is the overinclusion of trivial or irrelevant details that impedes the sense of getting to the point.</li>\n<li><strong>Clang association</strong> is an association of thoughts with the sound of words rather than by their meaning (e.g., through rhyming).</li>\n<li><strong>Derailment</strong> is the breakdown in both the logical connection between ideas and the overall sense of goal-directedness. The words make sentences, but the sentences do not make sense.</li>\n<li><strong>Flight of ideas</strong> is a succession of multiple associations so that thoughts seem to move abruptly from idea to idea, through rapid, pressured speech.</li>\n<li><strong>Neologism</strong> is the invention of new words or phrases or the use of conventional words in idiosyncratic ways.</li>\n<li><strong>Perseveration</strong> is the repetition of out-of-context words, phrases, or ideas.</li>\n<li><strong>Tangentiality</strong> is responding to a question,&nbsp;that is appropriate to the general topic without actually answering the question.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Thought blocking</strong> is a sudden disruption of thought or a break in the flow of ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A -&nbsp;An obsession is a recurrent and intrusive thought, feeling, idea, or sensation.</p>\n<p>Option C - A delusion is defined as a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that firmly sustains despite evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Option D - Thought insertion is a type of delusion where the patient believes that thoughts are not his/her own and have been inserted into his/her mind.</p><p>Controversial: The classification of OCD as a certain form of thought is debatable based on the resource.

During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy/activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms are present to a significant degree:</p>\n<p>1. Increased self-esteem or grandiosity</p>\n<p>2. Decreased need for sleep</p>\n<p>3. <strong>More talkative</strong> than usual or a pressure to keep talking</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Flight of ideas</strong></p>\n<p>5. Distractibility</p>\n<p>6. <strong>Increase in goal-directed activity</strong> or psychomotor agitation</p>\n<p>7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions)</p>\n<p>C. The mood disturbance is severe enough to cause marked social or occupational impairment or to necessitate hospitalization.</p>\n<p>D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.</p>\n<p><br />Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Hypomania</strong> is a distinct period of abnormally and <strong>persistently elevated/irritable mood</strong>, abnormally and persistently increased activity/energy, lasting for <strong>at least 4 days</strong>. It is similar to a manic episode but it is not severe enough to cause impairment in social or occupational functioning. No psychotic features are present.</p>\n<p>Option C -&nbsp;<strong>Cyclothymia</strong>&nbsp;is a mild, <strong>chronic mood disorder</strong> with numerous depressive and hypomanic episodes over the course of at <strong>least 2 years</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Schizomania</strong>&nbsp;is an old term in DSM III, used to describe schizophrenic and manic symptomatology occurring in one episode, classified under&nbsp;<strong>schizoaffective disorder</strong>. Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by <strong>active phase symptoms</strong> of <strong>schizophrenia</strong>, like delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized behavior, or negative symptoms. Additionally, there is a&nbsp;<strong>presence of manic/depressive syndrome</strong> that is not brief relative to the duration of the psychosis. The<strong>&nbsp;</strong>delusions or hallucinations are present for<strong> at least 2 weeks</strong> <strong>without</strong> <strong>coexisting mood symptoms</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Bipolar disorder</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong> Bipolar &amp; related disorders </strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Manic episode</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Symptoms more <strong>severe</strong></span></li>\n<li><span><strong>1 week</strong> unless hospitalized</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Marked impairment</strong> in social or occupational functioning or <strong>hospitalization</strong> necessary</span></li>\n<li><span>May have <strong>psychotic features</strong>; makes episode manic by definition</span></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Hypomanic episode</strong> &nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Symptoms <strong>less severe</strong></span></li>\n<li><span><strong>4 days&nbsp;</strong>to less than 7 days</span></li>\n<li><span>Unequivocal, observable change in functioning from patient's baseline</span></li>\n<li><span>Symptoms not severe enough to cause marked impairment or necessitate hospitalization</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>No psychotic features</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Bipolar I</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Manic episode(s)</strong></span></li>\n<li><span>Depressive episodes common (but not required for diagnosis)</span></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Bipolar II</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Hypomanic episode(s)</strong></span></li>\n<li><span>Major depressive episodes (required for diagnosis)</span></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Cyclothymic disorder</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>At least <strong>2 years</strong> of fluctuating, mild hypomanic &amp; depressive symptoms that </span><br /><span>do not meet criteria for hypomanic episodes or major depressive episodes</span></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Patterns of Mood Disorders</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6ab1892272934b0792b8745017664ccfx1280x6841.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Psychotic disorders</h3><p>Differential diagnosis of DSM-5 psychotic disorders</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Psychotic disorder</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span><strong>Criteria for diagnosis</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Brief psychotic disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Sudden onset and a full return to function</span></p>\n<p><span>Duration: &gt; 1 day and &lt; 1 month</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Schizophreniform disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Same symptoms as schizophrenia and functional decline not required</span></p>\n<p><span>Duration: &gt; 1 month &amp; &lt; 6 months</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Schizophrenia</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Requires functional decline</span></p>\n<p><span>At least 6 months (includes at least 1 month of active symptoms, can include prodromal and residual periods)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Schizoaffective disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>With concurrent mood episode.&nbsp;</span><span>Active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia with at least a 2 weeks of lifetime history of delusions or hallucinations in absence of prominent mood symptoms</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Delusional disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>One or more delusions for &gt; 1 month</span></p>\n<p><span>No other psychotic symptoms and normal functioning apart from the direct impact of delusions</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Shared psychotic disorder (folie a deux)</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Development of delusions in a person who is in a close relationship (ex: spouse, child) with someone who has a delusional disorder (the inducer)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
