      "solution": "The given clinical scenario of perianal itching at night time, thread-like structures in undergarments and stool culture showing a planoconvex egg is suggestive of pinworm or Enterobius vermicularis infection. <br><br>Enterobius vermicularis completes its entire life cycle in the human host. They are oviparous. Man acquires infection by ingesting embryonated eggs containing larvae through contaminated fingers and by autoinfection. <br><br>At night, the gravid female worm comes out through the anus and lays its sticky eggs on the perianal skin. This leads to pruritus, and the patient scratches the affected perianal area. The worm can crawl into the vulva and vagina, causing irritation and a mucoid discharge. It can also cause chronic salpingitis, cervicitis, peritonitis, recurrent urinary tract infections, and appendicitis.<br><br>Since pinworms are rarely released in faeces, faecal examination is not useful in the diagnosis. The NIH swab (National Institutes of Health, USA) consists of a glass rod with a piece of transparent cellophane attached at one end with a rubber band. The cellophane part is used for swabbing by rolling over the perianal area. The cellophane piece is spread over a glass side and examined microscopically. The image given below shows the NIH swab.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0b56e96444d34cb08faad1983497a5c6x600x936.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Another method of demonstrating eggs is the scotch tape method. Here, the tape is firmly pressed against the anal margin, covering all sides, and transferred to a glass slide.

Frequent hand washing, fingernail cleaning, regular bathing, and frequent washing of night clothes and bed linen should be done. Infection can be treated with pyrantel pamoate, albendazole, or mebendazole as single-dose therapy.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Options B and C: Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale (hookworm) infect a person by direct penetration of the skin by filariform larvae. They develop into adult worms in the small intestine. Segmented eggs are passed in faeces, and these develop into filariform larvae in the soil.<br><br>They can cause severe local itching, cutaneous larva migrans, and respiratory symptoms. Adult hookworm disease is characterised by anaemia, epigastric pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, and reddish black stools. Diagnosis is by demonstration of eggs or larvae in faeces. The egg contains a segmented ovum, usually with four or eight blastomeres. They have identical eggs. The life cycle is shown below.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2943adb7c9ed4125a4b9609776f85ad5x965x754.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option D: The Hymenolepis nana eggs have a thin colourless outer membrane and an inner embryophore enclosing the hexacanth oncosphere. The space between two membranes contains yolk granules and thread-like polar filaments arising from two knobs on the embryophore. The eggs are non-bile-stained and float in a saturated salt solution.<br><br>Hymenolepiasis occurs more commonly in children. They are usually asymptomatic. In heavy infections, they present with nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and irritability.

Increased permeability of lymph vessel walls leads to leakage of protein-rich lymph into the tissues.

It is endemic in the USA, in the states bordering the Ohio River valley and the lower Mississippi River. In India, it is reported from the region of West Bengal, along the Ganga River. The fungus inhabits humid and acidic soil that contains a large amount of bird or bat droppings.<br><br>H. capsulatum is transmitted by inhalation of spores (i.e. microconidia) which usually circulate in the air after the contaminated soil is disturbed. After the spores enter the lungs, they are engulfed by the alveolar macrophages and then transform into yeast forms. <br><br>Clinically, the classical histoplasmosis ranges from asymptomatic infection (in immunocompetent people) to life-threatening illness seen in people with low CMI. The various clinical types include:<br><br>* Pulmonary histoplasmosis - Acute form presents with mild flu-like illness, pulmonary infiltrates in the chest X-ray, with hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Chronic cavitary histoplasmosis may be seen in smokers with underlying structural lung disease.<br><br>* Mucocutaneous histoplasmosis - Skin and oral mucosal lesions may develop secondary to pulmonary infection. Oral lesions are particularly seen in Indian patients.<br><br>* Disseminated histoplasmosis - It develops if CMI is very low (e.g. untreated HIV-infected people or following organ transplantation). The common sites affected are the bone marrow, spleen, liver, eyes, and adrenal glands. <br><br>Diagnosis is by direct microscopy. Histopathological staining of the specimens reveals tiny oval yeast cells (2–4 μm size) with narrow-based budding within the macrophages, with an underlying granulomatous response.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/28a1a4b1979844aa9633927f5f3905f2x544x430.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Culture is the gold standard method of diagnosis. Specimens should be inoculated onto media such as SDA, blood agar, and BHI agar in duplicate and incubated simultaneously at 25°C and 37°C. <br><br>* At 25°C, it forms a mycelial phase and produces white to buff brown colonies that consist of two types of conidia or spores - tuberculate macroconidia (with typical thick walls and finger-like projections, which is a characteristic feature) and microconidia( smaller, thinner, and smooth-walled).<br><br>* At 37°C, it gets converted into yeast form (creamy white colonies), which is best developed in special media like Kelley’s media.<br><br>Liposomal amphotericin B is the antifungal agent of choice in acute pulmonary and disseminated histoplasmosis. Itraconazole is recommended for chronic cavitary pulmonary histoplasmosis.<br><br>Other options : <br><br>Option A: Candidiasis is caused by Candida species, which are yeast-like fungi. They exist as yeast and pseudohyphae.<br><br>Option C: Blastomycosis causes North American Blastomycosis/ Chicago disease. Pulmonary involvement is the most common form followed by skin.
