      "solution": "<p><strong>Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO)</strong> is least likely to cause <strong>watering </strong>and<strong> photophobia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Nasolacrimal duct obstruction is the most common disease of the lacrimal system. It usually presents in the first few weeks or months of life as <strong>excessive tearing and ocular discharge</strong>. It mostly occurs due to incomplete canalization of the duct.</p>\n<p>Congenital NLDO mainly results in persistent tearing and sometimes a discharge from the eyes but <strong>not photophobia</strong>, as the light sensitivity is not directly related to this condition.</p>\n<p>Typically, diagnosis is established through a combination of patient history and physical examination. In cases where symptoms are intermittent, the presence of an obstruction can be confirmed using the <strong>fluorescein dye disappearance</strong> test. </p>\n<p>The initial treatment involves performing<strong> nasolacrimal massage</strong>, typically 2-3 times daily, along with cleansing the eyelids using warm water and applying <strong>topical antibiotics</strong>. If it does not resolve after massaging by the age of <strong>6 to 10 months</strong>,<strong> lacrimal duct probing </strong>is done. </p>\n<p>If probing fails, other treatment options include intubation with silastic tubing with or without balloon dilatation of the nasolacrimal duct and <strong>dacryocystorhinostomy.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Congenital <strong>entropion</strong>: This is a condition where the eyelid is turned inward, causing the <strong>eyelashes to rub against the cornea</strong>. This can lead to <strong>irritation, photophobia, and excessive tearing</strong> (lacrimation).</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG)</strong> is caused by impaired aqueous outflow due to a maldeveloped anterior chamber angle. Clinically, the child presents with <strong>lacrimation, photophobia, and blepharospasm</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Congenital distichiasis</strong>: This is a condition where an <strong>extra row of eyelashes</strong> grows from the meibomian glands on the eyelid margin. These extra lashes <strong>can irritate the cornea</strong>, leading to <strong>photophobia and tearing</strong>.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The most common cause of proptosis in middle age is <strong>thyroid eye disease. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Graves ophthalmopathy</strong> is one of the most serious ocular manifestations of Graves disease. Between the ages of 25 and 50, it's the leading cause of <strong>unilateral and bilateral proptosis</strong> in adults. Proptosis, eyelid retraction, restricted myopathy, and perhaps compressive optic neuropathy are clinical manifestations that could potentially be used for diagnosis.</p>\n<p>The mechanism proposed for this is the acute precipitation of a hypothyroid state which leads to an increase in TSH secretion. This leads to stimulation of the r<strong>etro-orbital fibroblasts and adipocytes</strong> which have the receptor for TSH. </p>\n<p>An <strong>abnormal protrusion of the globe</strong> is called proptosis. Exophthalmometry measures protrusion of the apex of the cornea from the outer orbital margin (with the eyes looking straight ahead). An <strong>absolute protrusion of &gt;20 mm </strong>or a difference of &gt;2 mm between the two eyes is labelled as proptosis.</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Cavernous hemangioma</strong> is the most <strong>common primary benign orbital tumor in adults</strong>. They are composed of large, dilated vascular channels; are more infiltrative; frequently involve deep structures; and do not spontaneously regress. On histologic examination, the mass is sharply delineated but unencapsulated with large, cavernous blood-filled vascular spaces, separated by connective tissue stroma.</p>\n<p>Option B: The type of proptosis seen in orbital varix is <strong>non-pulsatile, intermittent, and reducible proptosi</strong>s. On activities such as forward bending or lowering of the head, turning the head forcefully, hyperextension of the neck, and coughing, the varices fill up, causing proptosis, and then, they regress on shifting to a non-dependent position.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Retinoblastoma </strong>is the <strong>most common intraocular malignancy in children</strong>. It is associated with mutations in the RB1 gene at chromosome 13q14.  White pupillary reflex or leukocoria is the most common presenting feature, followed by a squint which is usually convergent. Histopathology of the tumor shows small round cells with large nuclei. Microscopic features includes Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes(highly specific of retinoblastoma), Homer-Wright rosettes, pseudorosettes, and fleurettes formation. Areas of necrosis and calcification can also be seen. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Signs in Grave’s ophthalmopathy</h3><div>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sign</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Feature</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dalrymple's sign</td>\n<td>Retraction of the upper lids</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>von Graefe's sign</td>\n<td>Lid lag, i.e., when the globe is moved downward, the upper lid lags behind</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Griffith Sign</td>\n<td>Lower lid lag on upward gaze</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enroth's sign</td>\n<td>Fullness of the eyelids</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stellwag's sign</td>\n<td>Infrequent blinking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gifford's sign</td>\n<td>Difficulty in eversion of the upper lid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mobius&rsquo; sign</td>\n<td>Convergence weakness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Joffroy&rsquo;s sign</td>\n<td>Lack of wrinkling of the forehead on superior gaze</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jellinek's Sign</td>\n<td>Abnormal pigmentation of the upper lid</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>The image given below shows Dalrymple's sign in the right eye.</p>\n</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0a484751a2e640e7906b3d75f752f5b5x450x224.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",
