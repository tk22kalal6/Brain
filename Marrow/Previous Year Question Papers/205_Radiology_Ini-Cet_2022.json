The most accurate investigation is <strong>video-assisted thoracoscopy</strong> or <strong>laparoscopy</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Operative repair</strong> should be done. Repair should be done via the abdomen in case of a diaphragmatic rupture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Radiographs 2,3,4 are <strong>hemothorax</strong>, <strong>pneumothorax,</strong> and <strong>flail chest</strong> respectively. These conditions are life-threatening. Hence, the diagnosis and management have to be immediate. Rapid insertion of <strong>intercostal chest drains</strong> should be done. They are inserted into the<strong> fifth intercostal space.</strong> The safe landmark is identified as a triangle that lies anterior to the midaxillary line above the nipple, below, and lateral to the pectoralis major muscle.</p>\n<p>The below images show the <strong>triangle of safety</strong> and technique of chest drain insertion.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0c24d74c558545f29e5816d97210592fx600x577.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7054617469f6480bb648a3cd2310cc6dx600x1759.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hemothorax</strong> can occur following<strong> blunt trauma</strong>. It occurs due to bleeding from the intercostal vessels or internal mammary artery secondary to rib fracture. Features include hemorrhagic shock, flat neck veins, unilateral absence of breath sounds, and dullness on percussion. Correction of hypovolemic shock, <strong>intercostal drain insertion,</strong> and intubation are useful in management.</p>\n<p><strong>Pneumothorax</strong>&nbsp;can be open or tension pneumothorax. In tension pneumothorax, the common etiology is penetrating or blunt trauma, and features such as tachypnea, dyspnea, distended neck veins, tracheal deviation, hyper resonance and decreased breath sounds are seen.&nbsp;<strong>Immediate decompression</strong> can be attained by large bore cannula insertion into the second intercostal space on the affected side in the midclavicular line after which a <strong>chest tube</strong> can be placed in the <strong>5th intercostal space</strong> along the anterior axillary line. Chest radiograph shows <strong>mediastinal shift</strong> to the <strong>opposite side</strong> and diaphragmatic depression on the same side.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Flail chest</strong> occurs as a result of blunt trauma and is associated with rib fractures. Clinically, paradoxical movement of the chest can be present. Management includes oxygen administration, analgesia, chest drain, and surgery to stabilize the flail segment. Rib fractures can be seen on chest radiograph.&nbsp;</p>",
