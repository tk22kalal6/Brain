      "solution": "<p>In this clinical scenario, the presence of <strong>reduced SpO2</strong> and <strong>altered mental status</strong> in a patient presenting<strong> within 72 hours</strong> following a <strong>long bone fracture</strong> suggests the diagnosis of a <strong>fat embolism</strong>.</p>\n<p>Fat embolism is caused by the fat globules originating from the <strong>bone marrow</strong>&nbsp;following<strong>&nbsp;the fracture </strong>of <strong>long bones.</strong>&nbsp;Clinical features of fat embolism are usually seen <strong>within 72 hours</strong>. They include&nbsp;<strong>tachycardia, fever, breathlessness</strong>, <strong>petechiae,</strong><strong>&nbsp;confusion,</strong>and<strong> restlessness.&nbsp;Gurd's criteria</strong> is used for the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome.</p>\n<p>There is no specific diagnostic test for fat embolism. However,<strong> urine analysis</strong> to detect <strong>fat globules</strong> and monitoring of blood pO2 levels are conducted.</p>\n<p>The management of fat embolism primarily involves supportive care, including <strong>oxygen therapy </strong>and<strong> prompt stabilization of long-bone fractures.</strong></p>\n<p>Option A: Pulmonary embolism most commonly occurs as a result of thrombi from <strong>deep vein thrombosis</strong> of the leg.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is diagnosed using the <strong>Berlin's criteria</strong>. <strong>All four</strong> of the following conditions must be met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It develops <strong>within 1 week</strong> of clinical insult or worsening respiratory symptoms.</li>\n<li>Chest radiograph shows <strong>bilateral opacities </strong>consistent with pulmonary edema. These opacities are not fully explained by effusions, lobar or lung collapse, or nodules.</li>\n<li>The edema is <strong>not</strong> due to <strong>cardiac failure</strong>, or <strong>fluid overload</strong>.</li>\n<li>There is <strong>impaired oxygenation</strong>.&nbsp;The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to the fraction of inspired oxygen (<strong>PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub></strong>) is <strong>&le; 300 mmHg</strong>&nbsp;as assessed on&nbsp;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option D: Occult pneumothorax is a condition that is not suspected on the basis of the symptoms or plain radiography, but is detected with <strong>CT imaging</strong>. It usually follows a thoracic injury.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Gurd's criteria for diagnosing fat embolism syndrome</h3><div class=\"ng-scope\"><strong>Major criteria</strong></div>\n<div class=\"ng-scope\">\n<ul>\n<li>Petechial rash</li>\n<li>Respiratory symptoms with radiographic changes</li>\n<li>CNS depression.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ng-scope\">\n<div class=\"ng-scope\">\n<p class=\"ng-binding\"><strong>Minor criteria</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tachycardia</li>\n<li>Pyrexia</li>\n<li>Retinal changes (fat or petechiae)</li>\n<li>Renal abnormalities (oliguria, anuria, or lipiduria)</li>\n<li>Acute thrombocytopenia</li>\n<li>Acute decrease in hemoglobin</li>\n<li>Fat globules in sputum</li>\n<li>Increased ESR</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2 major criteria</strong> OR <strong>one major criteria</strong> + <strong>four minor criteria</strong> suggest a diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
