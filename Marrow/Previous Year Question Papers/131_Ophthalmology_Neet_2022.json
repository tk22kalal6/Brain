      "solution": "<p>The diagnosis based on the image given is <strong>pseudoexfoliation syndrome</strong>.</p>\n<p>Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is an <strong>age-related</strong>&nbsp;degenerative disorder, more commonly seen in women. It is marked by the <strong>deposition</strong> of exfoliative material on the <strong>iris</strong>, ciliary region, and<strong> lens capsule</strong>. They appear as flakes on the <strong>anterior</strong> lens capsule and edge of the iris.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The material can get collected in the <strong>anterior chamber angle</strong> and impede the aqueous humor drainage. Patients affected by this condition are at an increased risk of developing open-angle&nbsp;<strong>glaucoma</strong>. Rarely, angle-closure glaucoma can also be seen. Other ocular symptoms include<strong> iris sphincter atrophy</strong>, anisocoria, and heterochromia. Systemic manifestations due to abnormal fibrillary deposition may also be seen.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A - Common <strong>intraocular foreign bodies</strong> include glass particles or metal chips. It can lodge in various sites like the anterior chamber, lens, posterior chamber, and vitreous. This can lead to <strong>cataract</strong> formation, retinal hemorrhages, and tears. Organic foreign bodies can cause <strong>infection</strong>. Iron foreign bodies can cause <strong>siderosis</strong> while copper ones can result in<strong> chalcosis</strong>. An entry wound can be identified with topical fluorescein.&nbsp; In cases of metallic intraocular foreign bodies, <strong>MRI</strong> is <strong>contraindicated</strong>. CT scan can be done instead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/14a18ff42d8847f2890ff147174d341dx720x702.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C - <strong>Ocular trauma</strong> can be a<strong> closed-globe</strong> or <strong>open-globe</strong> injury.

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario, along with the fundoscopy image showing a <strong>macular cherry-red spot, </strong>indicates the most likely diagnosis to be<strong> Tay-Sachs disease. </strong></p>\n<p>Tay-Sachs disease is a <strong>lysosomal storage disease </strong>caused by the deficiency of <strong>β-hexosaminidase</strong>. It can present during <strong>infancy</strong> with macrocephaly, increased startle reaction, gradual <strong>loss</strong> of <strong>motor skills, </strong>and a macular cherry-red spot. Affected children usually die by the age of 10–15 years. </p>\n<p>It is of two types—juvenile-onset and adult-onset. The symptoms of the <strong>juvenile-onset</strong> form include<strong> ataxia</strong> and dementia. <strong>Dysarthria</strong>, lower motor neuron signs, and psychiatric disorders are common in the <strong>adult-onset</strong> type. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Options B - <strong>Hunter disease</strong> (mucopolysaccharidosis II) is an <strong>X-linked disorder</strong> that arises due to the deficiency of iduronate 2-sulfatase. <strong>Short stature</strong>, <strong>joint stiffness</strong>, and intellectual disability are the features.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Hurler syndrome </strong>(mucopolysaccharidosis I) is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> condition that affects multiple organs. Presentation is usually at <strong>6–24 months</strong> with <strong>corneal clouding</strong>, coarse facial features, joint stiffness, and skeletal dysplasia. <strong>Glaucoma</strong>, <strong>retinal degeneration</strong>, and nasal discharge are the other features. The condition is generally fatal.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Gaucher disease</strong> is a glycolipid storage disorder that can present with hepatosplenomegaly, mental retardation, and erosion of long bones. It is caused by the deficiency of <strong>β-glucosidase</strong>. The Gaucher cell has a <strong>wrinkled-paper appearance</strong> due to intracytoplasmic inclusions, which is a characteristic feature.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Important causes of cherry-red spots</h3><ul>\n<li>Commotio retinae</li>\n<li>Central retinal and cilioretinal artery occlusion</li>\n<li>Metabolic storage diseases\n<ul>\n<li>GM1 gangliosidosis</li>\n<li>Mucolipidosis type I (sialidosis)</li>\n<li>GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease)</li>\n<li>Farber disease</li>\n<li>Niemann&ndash;Pick disease</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Retinotoxicity due to specific agents, including quinine, dapsone, gentamicin, carbon monoxide,&nbsp;and methanol</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/28a0aade2cc74ae8b0ca120ea25df7d5x600x448.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Lysosomal storage diseases</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Lysosomal Storage Diseases</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Enzyme-deficient</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Sphingolipidoses</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gaucher disease</td>\n<td>Glucocerebrosidase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tay-Sachs disease</td>\n<td>Hexosaminidase A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fabry disease</td>\n<td>&alpha;-galactosidase A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Krabbe disease</td>\n<td>\n<p>Galactocerebrosidase</p>\n<p>(Galactosylceramidase)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Niemann-Pick disease</td>\n<td>Sphingomyelinase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mucopolysaccharidoses</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hurler syndrome</td>\n<td>&alpha;-L-iduronidase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hunter syndrome</td>\n<td>Iduronate-2-sulfatase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Others:</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pompe disease</td>\n<td>Lysosomal acid&nbsp;&alpha;-1,4- glucosidase</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
