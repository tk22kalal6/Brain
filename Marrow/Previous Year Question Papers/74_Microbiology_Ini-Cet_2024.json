      "solution": "<p>The above clinical scenario and endocervical examination of gram-negative diplococci denote a diagnosis of <em>Neisseria gonorrhoea.</em></p>\n<p><em>Gonorrhoea</em> is a <strong>sexually transmitted disease</strong> where infection occurs due to the adhesion of gonococci to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces with the help of <strong>pili</strong>. By the third day of infection, the cocci have penetrated intracellular spaces and reached subepithelial tissue. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 8 days. The main symptoms are <strong>urethral discharge</strong> and <strong>dysuria</strong>.</p>\n<p>In females : </p>\n<p>The infection begins in the <strong>cervix </strong>uteri and urethra and may spread to the <strong>Bartholin glands</strong>, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. The vaginal mucosa is usually unaffected in adults because the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to cocci infection and also because vaginal secretions have an acidic pH. Rarely peritonitis may develop with perihepatic inflammation <strong>(Fitz Hugh Curtis syndrome</strong>).</p>\n<p>In males : </p>\n<p>The disease starts as <strong>acute urethritis</strong>. This infection has the potential to spread down the urethra and into the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis. Chronic urethritis may lead to <strong>stricture formation</strong>. Infections in the periurethral tissues can lead to abscesses and multiple discharging sinuses <strong>(watercan perineum)</strong>.</p>\n<p>Lab diagnosis:</p>\n<p>The discharge is collected and subjected to Gram's stain which reveals gram‐negative intracellular diplococci within phagocytes. <strong>Stuart's transport medium</strong> is used.

      "solution": "<p><em>Neisseria gonorrhoea </em>endures maximum drug resistance among the given organisms causing sexually transmitted diseases.</p>\n<p>The ability of <em>N. gonorrhoea</em> to change its <strong>antigenic properties</strong> and adapt to different environments has rendered it resistant to the majority of antibiotics. Gonococci develop complete resistance to antibiotics, either through <strong>chromosomal mutations</strong> or by <strong>acquiring R factors</strong>, which are plasmids.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Often <strong>β-Lactamase</strong> producing Gonococci and tetracycline-resistant strains occur together. Hence Penicillin, ampicillin, and tetracycline are no longer reliable for the treatment of gonorrhea and should not be used. </li>\n<li>Changes in<strong> DNA gyrase</strong> and<strong> topoisomerase IV</strong> have been identified as mechanisms contributing to <strong>fluoroquinolone resistance</strong>.</li>\n<li>Mechanisms leading to enhanced drug <strong>efflux pump </strong>and <strong>reduced drug influx</strong> through PorB, collectively contribute to resistance against third-generation cephalosporins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently, the effective first-line treatment of choice for uncomplicated Gonococcal infection remains <strong>Ceftriaxone</strong> (500 mg IM, single dose) plus <strong>Azithromycin</strong> (1 g PO, single dose) .<br /> </p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>A) Syphilis :  The drug of choice for treating syphilis is<strong> benzathine penicillin G</strong>. Penicillin has been the mainstay of treatment for syphilis for many years due to its effectiveness in curing the infection and its relatively low cost.</p>\n<p>c) Chancroid: The drug of choice for treating chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium <em>Haemophilus ducreyi</em>, is <strong>azithromycin</strong> or <strong>ceftriaxone</strong>. These antibiotics are effective in treating chancroid and preventing its complications. The choice between azithromycin and ceftriaxone may depend on factors such as patient allergies, local resistance patterns, and individual patient factors.</p>\n<p>d) Donovanosis : The drug of choice for treating donovanosis, also known as <strong>granuloma inguinale</strong>, is typically azithromycin or doxycycline. Donovanosis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium <em>Klebsiella granulomatis</em>, and prompt treatment is essential to prevent complications and transmission to others.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Sexually transmitted infections</h3><p><strong>Genital herpes</strong>- caused by <strong>herpes simplex virus</strong> (human herpesvirus 1 and 2).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It appears as <strong>blisters</strong> (usually multiple) that lead to ulcer formation on breaking.</li>\n<li>The ulcers are <strong>painful</strong>.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8ba0cafb8f724e8caf99ab7778d022acx630x761.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Granuloma inguinale&nbsp;</strong>/ Donovanosis- caused by&nbsp;<strong>Klebsiella granulomatis</strong>&nbsp;(formerly known as Calymmatobacterium granulomatis).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It usually causes <strong>beefy red genital ulcers</strong> that may bleed on touch.</li>\n<li>The ulcers are usually <strong>painless</strong>.</li>\n<li>Lymphadenopathy is usually absent but subcutaneous granulomas cause <strong>pseudo buboes</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Microscopy shows <strong>Donovan bodies</strong> with closed safety pin appearance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The given images show genital ulcer in granuloma inguinale:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4aaa8224b2e7443e94743e1015a44778x560x358.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Chancroid</strong>/ Soft chancre-&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;<strong>Haemophilus ducreyi</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Causes genital ulcers that are <strong>non indurated</strong> with undermined edges.</li>\n<li>The ulcer is <strong>painful</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple/ Kissing ulcers develop due to autoinoculation from the primary ulcer.</li>\n<li>It usually causes tender unilateral<strong>&nbsp;inguinal buboes</strong>.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Microscopy- School of fish/Railroad track appearance</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/875f994ab0a44d3a8d26f376c6b54874x597x313.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Syphilitic chancre</strong>/ Hard chancre- caused by <strong>Treponema pallidum</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It presents as a <strong>small, button-like, indurated ulcer</strong> that is usually round/oval.</li>\n<li>The ulcer is <strong>painless</strong>.</li>\n<li>Causes <strong>painless lymphadenopathy</strong>.</li>\n<li>Microscopy- Spirochetes seen on dark ground illumination.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/03d21e32213a42c9ab3487da627b053ex336x288.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Lymphogranuloma venereum</strong>- caused by&nbsp;<strong>Chlamydia trachomatis</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It usually presents with a transient single <strong>shallow ulcer</strong> that <strong>heals rapidly</strong> and usually goes unnoticed.</li>\n<li>The secondary stage presents with <strong>tender&nbsp;inguinal buboes</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Groove sign</strong> is seen when the lymph nodes above and below the inguinal ligament are enlarged leading to the appearance of a groove.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The given images show the ulcer and the groove sign seen in LGV:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6faad0dd79004ce4898a0d4ec94391e9x495x711.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/be01c14fe5b34f6fb923eca0f40d42cex253x357.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Gonorrhea</strong>- caused by <strong>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It leads to <strong>purulent inflammation</strong> of the genital mucous membranes.</li>\n<li>It may present as&nbsp;urethritis, cervicitis, epididymo‐orchitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease.</li>\n<li>The usual presentation is <strong>acute urethritis</strong> with complaints of burning dysuria and purulent discharge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The given image shows purulent genital inflammation due to gonorrhea:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f4fd185c143045fe944bb99f1299a4bbx379x412.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Syndromic Management of Sexually Transmitted Infections</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1167210a9cd6434a905a98bc64668d41x1280x2612.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>Partner Management when <strong>asymptomatic</strong> is not required for <strong>Gardenella vaginalis, Candida and Herpes infections</strong>.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/60da7b1257d04ca5938ef3340533e6b9x1280x2974.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

The larva migrates into the lumen of the intestine and passes down to be released into the faeces. The rhabditiform larva may change into a filariform larva while passing through the bowel.</p>\n<p>The filariform larvae in the bowel do not leave the host and become a source of autoinfection as they penetrate the colonic mucosa or perianal skin. The rhabditiform larvae passed in the faeces may undergo two types of development in the soil:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Direct</strong> development: The rhabditiform larva moults twice on reaching the soil to become the infective filariform larva. The<strong> filariform larva</strong> can <strong>penetrate the skin</strong> and enter the circulation.</li>\n<li><strong>Indirect </strong>development: The <strong>rhabditiform </strong>larvae develop into <strong>free-living males </strong>and females in the soil.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option B: <em>Ancyclostoma duodenale</em> are <em><strong>dioecious</strong> </em>parasites, there is no multiplication within the host, and a single infective larva matures into either a male or a female adult to undergo mating through copulation. It typically takes around 6 weeks from the point of infection for the adult worms to reach sexual maturity and initiate egg-laying.</p>\n<p>Option C: <em>Enterobius vermicularis</em> is <strong>dioecious.</strong>The male is usually unseen as it does not migrate from caecum or appendix. It usually dies after mating and is passed in the faeces. The gravid female migrates down the colon to the rectum and a single worm lays from 5000 to 17,000 eggs </p>\n<p>Option D:<em> Trichuris trichuria</em> or the <strong>whipworm</strong> has a distinct male and female parasite and is typically <strong>dioecious</strong>.

Hence, it is also called <strong>malignant tertian</strong> or<strong> pernicious malaria</strong>.

Several rings may be seen within a single erythrocyte. </li>\n<li>Typically, the trophozoites <strong>vanish from the bloodstream </strong>within approximately 24 hours.</li>\n<li>By this time, a strain-specific high molecular weight <strong>antigen</strong> emerges on the surface of infected red cells resembling a <strong>knob-like </strong>projection on the erythrocyte membrane.</li>\n<li>Infected red cells with presenting antigen, exit the bloodstream and stick to the walls of small blood vessels(<strong>cytoadherence</strong>) of <strong>internal organs</strong>, including the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, spleen, intestines, bone marrow, and placenta.</li>\n<li>This adherence leads to the <strong>sequestration</strong> of infected cells in these areas, contributing to severe complications like <strong>cerebral malaria</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sporogonic cycle- Mosquito :</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Gametocytes are taken up by a mosquito when it feeds.

      "solution": "<p>The above clinical scenario, coupled with a history of contact with a rusty iron nail, suggests a diagnosis of tetanus, which is caused by the anaerobic bacterium <strong><em>Clostridium tetani</em></strong>. The toxin responsible for muscle rigidity and lockjaw is <strong>tetanospasmin</strong> produced by <em>Clostridium tetani</em>. It acts by causing presynaptic<strong> inhibition of GABA and glycine</strong> release. </p>\n<p>Tetanospasmin, after secretion by the bacterium is cleaved into two peptides linked by a disulphide bond. The <strong>larger peptide</strong> diffuses to terminals of neurons and migrates by the retrograde axonal transport system to the spinal cord and brainstem. It diffuses to the glycinergic interneurons and GABA secreting neurons there. The <strong>smaller peptide</strong> degrades synaptobrevin and <strong>blocks</strong> the release of the <strong>inhibitory glycine</strong> and <strong>GABA</strong>. This results in hyperreflexia, muscle spasms, and spastic paralysis. Even small amounts of the toxin can be lethal.</p>\n<p>The incubation period of C. tetani ranges from <strong>4-5 days</strong> up to 3 weeks. Muscle spasms usually involve the area of <strong>injury first</strong> and then the muscles of the jaw causing<strong> trismus</strong> or lockjaw. Gradually, other voluntary muscles become involved, resulting in <strong>tonic spasms</strong>. Any external stimulus can precipitate a tetanic generalized muscle spasm. The patient is conscious but may be in pain. Death usually results from <strong>respiratory paralysis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A : Botulinum toxin targets the presynaptic terminals of motor neurons and inhibit the release of acetylcholine. As a result, muscle paralysis occurs, leading to the temporary weakening or cessation of muscle activity in the affected area.</p>\n<p>Option D: The venom of the <strong>black widow spider</strong>, specifically the component α-latrotoxin, has been found to <strong>induce the massive release</strong> of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, <strong>norepinephrine</strong>, dopamine, and others, from presynaptic nerve terminals rather than inhibition of nor-epinephrine.</p>",

CSF examination with multinucleate giant cells with CNS manifestations indicates neonatal meningitis to the DNA virus.</p>\n<p><strong>Painful genital ulcers</strong> are commonly seen in <strong>genital herpes</strong> and <strong>chancroid </strong>due to Hemophilus ducreyi ((ducreyi makes you cry).</p>\n<p>Herpes infection can be caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses.

The most common site of cutaneous lesions is in the face, cheeks, chin, around the mouth and forehead. A<strong> cesarean section</strong> is performed in a case of active genital herpes at the time of labour in order to <strong>prevent neonatal herpes</strong> infection.</p>\n<p>One of the following three disease patterns can be seen in infants infected during delivery or in the postpartum period: (1) disease <strong>limited to the skin</strong>, eyes, or mouth; (2)<strong> encephalitis </strong>with or without skin, eye, and mouth disease; or (3) <strong>disseminated infection</strong> affecting several organs, such as the brain, lungs, liver, heart, and adrenal glands.</p>\n<p>Infants suffering from encephalitis usually exhibit clinical symptoms that point to bacterial meningitis at <strong>8- 17 days </strong>of life. These symptoms include seizures, poor feeding, lethargy, <strong>neck stiffness</strong>, irritability, and <strong>positive Kernig's sign</strong>. When left untreated, HSV encephalitis results in<strong> 50% of infant deaths </strong>and severe neurologic sequelae in the majority of survivors. </p>\n<p><strong>Acyclovir</strong> at a high dose of 60 mg/kg/day, administered intravenously every eight hours, should be the first line of treatment for any infant with a confirmed or suspected neonatal HSV infection.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Coxsackie virus, Enterovirus and VZV are not attributed to painful genital ulcers and hence ruled out.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Comparison of Genital Ulcers</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Genital herpes</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>&nbsp;Syphilitic chancre (Hard chancre)</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Donovanosis/ granuloma inguinale</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Chancroid (soft chancre)</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>LGV</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Incubation period</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>2-7 days</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>10-90 days&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Average: 21days</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>1-12 weeks</span></td>\n<td><span>1-14 days</span></td>\n<td><span>3 days - 6 weeks</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Causative agent</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>HSV-2&gt;HSV-1</span></td>\n<td><em><span>Treponema pallidum</span></em></td>\n<td><em><span>Klebsiella granulomatis</span></em></td>\n<td><em><span>Hemophilus ducreyi</span></em></td>\n<td>\n<p><span><em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em></span><span>&nbsp;serovars L1,L2,L3</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Cluster of vesicles on erythematous base.</span></p>\n<p><span> Painful and pruritic lymphadenopathy</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Single painless ulcer with a clean base and a firm raised border. </span></p>\n<p><span>Painless lymphadenopathy</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Painless papule or nodule erodes into beefy red granulomatous ulcer with rolled edges.</span></p>\n<p><span> No lymphadenopathy, pseudobubos are seen</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Painful ulcer (ducreyi makes you cry).</span></p>\n<p><span>Painful inguinal lymphadenopathy</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Painless genital ulcer.</span></p>\n<p><span>Painful inguinal lymphadenopathy</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Diagnosis&nbsp;</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Tzanck preparation shows multinucleated giant cells, PCR</span></td>\n<td><span>Clinical diagnosis</span></td>\n<td><span>Donovan bodies on biopsy</span></td>\n<td><span>Clinical diagnosis</span></td>\n<td><span>Nucleic acid amplification tests</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Treatment</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Acyclovir/famcyclovir or valacyclovir</span></td>\n<td><span>Penicillin/Ceftriaxone</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Azithromycin/</span><span>Doxycycline</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>Azithromycin/ceftriaxone</span></td>\n<td><span>&nbsp;Doxycycline</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
