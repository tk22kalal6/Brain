      "solution": "In this case, the most appropriate management is calcium and vitamin D supplementation. <br><br>The child with CKD has hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, low vitamin D levels, and clinical signs of renal rickets such as bowing of the legs. The primary problem is reduced activation of vitamin D by the diseased kidneys, which leads to poor calcium absorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Supplementing with calcium directly corrects the hypocalcemia, while giving active forms of vitamin D (calcitriol/alfacalcidol) improves intestinal calcium absorption, suppresses parathyroid overactivity, and helps in bone mineralisation. Together, calcium and vitamin D address the core abnormalities driving the bone disease in CKD.<br><br>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) refers to kidney damage that persists for at least three months, involving structural or functional abnormalities of the kidneys, which may occur with or without a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Disturbances in calcium and phosphate metabolism, impaired renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, chronic acidosis, and secondary hyperparathyroidism can lead to bone complications, collectively known as CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Factors such as poor appetite, malnutrition, and skeletal abnormalities also contribute to impaired growth.<br><br>At the initial stage, management focuses on ensuring adequate nutrition and slowing the progression of kidney failure. Although the kidneys can regulate potassium levels until the later stages, their ability to quickly excrete a potassium load is diminished, so foods high in potassium should be limited. Calcium supplementation is typically provided as calcium carbonate or calcium acetate. Phosphate consumption is reduced by limiting the intake of dairy products. Phosphate binders are given if the patient is not responding to dietary restriction of phosphate (Options A and C). Supplementation with vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid, pyridoxine, and B12, along with vitamin D, is also recommended.<br><br>As the disease advances, addressing complications becomes necessary, and kidney replacement therapy, including hemodialysis or transplantation, may then be required (Option D).",

For radioactive iodine to be taken up by the thyroid, the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) must transport iodine into the gland. If this transport mechanism is defective, the thyroid gland will appear normal anatomically but will not concentrate iodine, leading to absent tracer uptake and hypothyroidism.<br><br>The steps of synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones are shown below:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/522f91b16a1a46b281566314bb6eb53bx1200x1687.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism worldwide, and maternal iodine intake is critical during pregnancy for fetal thyroid function. However, in iodine deficiency, the thyroid gland typically increases its trapping activity, so tracer uptake would be high rather than absent.<br><br>Option C: In thyroid agenesis, the thyroid is absent and the ultrasound would not show a normal gland. Since the gland is present, this is ruled out. Thyroid dysgenesis is the most common cause of permanent congenital hypothyroidism. In one-third of cases of dysgenesis, no thyroid tissue is present, known as thyroid agenesis.<br><br>Option D: Dyshormonogenesis refers to defects in hormone synthesis after iodine is already taken up. Because increased TSH stimulation has a trophic effect on thyroid follicular cells, a goiter is often present. In such cases, the tracer uptake is usually increased, not absent, because the gland tries to compensate.",
