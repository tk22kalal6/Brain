      "solution": "<p>The role of caffeine in the wakefulness in this patient is that <strong>caffeine inhibits adenosine receptors</strong>, thus leading to <strong>awakening.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Caffeine</strong>, a commonly used <strong>stimulant</strong>, plays a significant role in <strong>promoting wakefulness</strong> and <strong>alertness</strong>. It functions primarily as an <strong>antagonist</strong> at <strong>adenosine A2A receptors</strong> in the brain. <strong>Adenosine</strong>, a natural <strong>neuromodulator </strong>which accumulates in the basal forebrain area promotes <strong>sleepiness</strong> and <strong>relaxation</strong> by activating these receptors. By blocking adenosine A2A receptors, caffeine counteracts these sedative effects, thus helping to increase wakefulness and reduce fatigue.</p>\n<p>In addition to its receptor antagonism, caffeine <strong>inhibits cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases</strong>, which leads to <strong>increased</strong> levels of <strong>cyclic AMP</strong> (cAMP) in the brain. This action enhances the release of neurotransmitters such as <strong>norepinephrine (NE)</strong> and <strong>dopamine (DA)</strong>, further contributing to increased neural activity and alertness. Caffeine is <strong>rapidly absorbed</strong> from the digestive tract and crosses the blood-brain barrier easily, affecting brain function soon after consumption.</p>\n<p>Caffeine's stimulating effects can also be influenced by factors such as metabolism, which varies widely among individuals. For instance, <strong>smoking</strong> can <strong>reduce caffeine's half-life</strong>, making it clear from the body faster, while <strong>oral contraceptives</strong> can <strong>prolong </strong>its effects. Therefore, consuming caffeine close to bedtime, as in the case of drinking black coffee an hour before bed, can interfere with sleep by sustaining wakefulness and reducing the ability to fall asleep.</p>",

      "solution": "<p class=\"p1\">The given history suggests the presence of <strong>body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)</strong> in the patient, as she is preoccupied with her appearance and self-perceived flaws, despite being told otherwise by her family. The psychiatrist should start her on <strong>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRI).</strong></p>\n<p>BDD is characterized by <strong>persistent preoccupations</strong> about one or more <strong>perceived defects </strong>or <strong>flaws</strong> in<strong> one’s appearance,</strong> but the defects or flaws are negligible or not even observable to others. In response to their appearance concerns, individuals with BDD demonstrate a range of mental acts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comparing themselves with others</li>\n<li><strong>Checking</strong> in the mirror</li>\n<li>Camouflaging their perceived flaws</li>\n<li>Avoidance- from minor social avoidance to being housebound.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>specific focus </strong>of BDD <strong>on appearance </strong>serves to differentiate it from other conditions characterized by repetitive behaviours.</p>\n<p>The treatment for BDD typically involves a combination of <strong>SSRIs</strong> and <strong>psychotherapy</strong>. SSRIs, such as <strong>fluoxetine</strong> and <strong>clomipramine</strong>, have been shown to reduce symptoms in many patients, helping <strong>alleviate</strong> the <strong>obsessive thoughts</strong> and <strong>anxiety</strong> associated with BDD.</p>\n<p>Psychotherapy, particularly <strong>cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)</strong>, is crucial as it addresses the distorted self-image and underlying emotional issues. CBT helps patients reframe their thoughts about appearance and develop healthier coping strategies.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that while <strong>surgical interventions</strong> may be sought by patients, they are often<strong> ineffective</strong> and can lead to further dissatisfaction and distress. Therefore, focusing on mental health treatment is essential. Regular follow-ups and a supportive therapeutic relationship can significantly enhance the effectiveness of treatment.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Start on atypical antipsychotics:</strong> Antipsychotics are generally not the first-line treatment for BDD. They may be considered in cases with comorbid psychotic symptoms, but this patient does not exhibit hallucinations or delusions.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Give fitness for surgery: </strong>Giving fitness for surgery would be inappropriate and potentially harmful. Surgery is not the solution for BDD, as patients typically remain dissatisfied with the results and continue seeking more surgeries.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Initiate insight-oriented psychotherapy: </strong>While psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is effective for BDD, insight-oriented psychotherapy (focused on understanding unconscious conflicts) is less effective than targeted approaches like CBT in managing this condition.</p>",

The characteristics of children with ADHD, in order of frequency, are</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hyperactivity</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Attention deficit</strong> (short attention span, distractibility)</li>\n<li><strong>Impulsivity</strong> (action before thought, abrupt shifts in activity, lack of organization)</li>\n<li>Memory and thinking deficits</li>\n<li>Specific learning disabilities</li>\n<li>Speech and hearing deficits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to <strong>DSM-5 </strong>criteria, a diagnosis of ADHD requires symptoms to be present <strong>before age 12</strong>, persist for at least <strong>six months</strong>, <strong>negatively impact</strong> social, academic, or occupational activities, and occur in two or more settings. <strong>Pharmacotherapy</strong> is the<strong> first-line treatment</strong>, with CNS stimulants like <strong>methylphenidate</strong> and <strong>amphetamine</strong> salts being the most effective due to their mild side effects. Non-stimulant options include atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine. Additionally, <strong>psychosocial interventions</strong>—such as academic organization skills, parent training, behaviour modification, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and social skills training—are used as adjuncts to medication.</p>\n<p><span>Note: <strong>Conduct disorder</strong> is characterized by a <strong>persistent pattern</strong> of <strong>behaviour</strong> that violates the basic rights of others and <strong>disregards societal rules</strong>. The severity of the behaviours can lead to emergencies, especially if they are alarming to parents.

Rarely, a child may be silent at home but communicate normally at school.</span></p>\n<p><span>Option B: <strong>Separation anxiety disorder</strong> is characterized by <strong>developmentally inappro­priate</strong> and <strong>excessive anxiety</strong> when the patient is separated from their attachment figure.

      "solution": "<p>In the given clinical scenario, the patient presenting with <strong>tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis</strong>, and <strong>dilated pupils </strong>after consuming some drug with a <strong>previous history </strong>of <strong>suicidal tendencies</strong> points towards a diagnosis of <strong>cocaine</strong> toxicity leading to <strong>sympathetic toxidrome</strong>.</p>\n<p>Cocaine is a <strong>CNS stimulant</strong> obtained from coca plants belonging to the family <em>Erythroxylaceae</em>. The route of intake is by <strong>snorting</strong>, IV route and smoking. Tattoos may be made to cover the injection marks.</p>\n<p>It<strong> inhibits</strong> the uptake of <strong>dopamine, norepinephrine</strong>, and <strong>serotonin</strong>.</p>\n<p>At lower doses, it leads to alertness but at higher doses, it produces stereotyped behavior, involuntary actions, and paranoia. There is a <strong>transient euphoria</strong>. Tactile hallucinations (<strong>Magnan's symptom</strong> or <strong>cocaine bugs</strong>) are characteristic. </p>\n<p>There is a dose-dependent <strong>increase in heart rate </strong>and<strong> blood pressure</strong>. It causes <strong>dilation of pupil</strong>s and is associated with chills and perspiration. In severe cases,<strong> intracranial bleeding </strong>due to increased blood pressure, and <strong>myocardial infarction</strong> due to coronary vasospasm can occur. Ultimately, the patient goes into a stage of depression with loss of reflexes, paralysis of muscles, cardiorespiratory failure, and coma.  </p>\n<p>Management -  Administration of activated charcoal and gastric lavage with warm water and potassium permanganate in case of ingestion. <strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> to control heart rate/seizures. <strong>Amyl nitrite</strong> is the<strong> antidote</strong> given via inhalation. <strong>Thiamine 100 mg IV </strong>and <strong>Naloxone 2 mg IV </strong>can also be given.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Chlorpheniramine</strong> is an effective <strong>H1 antagonist</strong> that tends to be mildly sedative, making it suitable for daytime use. A notable number of patients experience side effects involving central nervous system stimulation.</p>\n<p>Option B and C: <strong>Morphine</strong> and <strong>Heroin</strong> are isolated from <strong>opium</strong>. The clinical features include a <strong>euphoric feeling</strong> in the stage of excitement followed by <strong>headache, giddiness,</strong> and a tendency to sleep in the stage of<strong> stupor</strong>. Intoxication is characterized by <strong>bradycardia, hypotension</strong>, <strong>respiratory depression, hypothermia,</strong> and <strong>pinpoint pupils</strong>.
