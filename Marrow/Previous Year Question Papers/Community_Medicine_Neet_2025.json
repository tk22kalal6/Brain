Chi-Square Test<br><br>* The Chi-Square test (χ2) is a non-parametric(non-numeric) test and it is used to test hypotheses in relation to nominal scale data or categorical data.<br><br>* It is a test of proportions and associations.<br><br>* A Chi-square distribution is usually positively skewed but it approaches a normal distribution as its degrees of freedom increases.<br><br>* If the frequency of any of the cells of the categorical table is <5, then Fisher’s exact test is used.",

Usually, such an operation is carried out during the night, known as the census night. Enumerators count the people on this night wherever they are found, based on location at the time of enumeration. The De facto concept is equivalent to taking a snapshot of the population at a reference time point. Since the enumeration is rounded off in a day, it is also called the date system or one-night enumeration system. The De facto method of census was carried out till 1931.<br><br>De jure Method - In this method, every individual in a particular area is personally counted, and the requisite information is obtained. The temporary residents are enumerated at their permanent place of residence. All persons who usually live in a country/territory at a particular reference time-point (usually taken as the middle of a year)  will be counted as the population of the country/territory. The enumeration work is prolonged for two to three weeks, which is known as the enumeration period. This method is also known as the period system, because census taking is confined to a particular period and not confined to a particular date.

This type of bias is called lead-time bias. The lead time bias can overestimate the survival time by the early detection of a disease. <br><br>Lead time is the time gained by screening. It is the time between diagnosis by a screening test and diagnosis by other means. It helps in the early diagnosis and treatment of a disease.<br><br>Lead time bias may arise when survival times are selected as endpoints in screening trials. Early diagnosis can lead to an overestimation of survival times because an early diagnosis through screening does not accurately represent delayed mortality. <br><br>For example, a CT scan of the chest identifies a malignant tumor of the lung earlier than a traditional chest x-ray. However, early treatment does not significantly enhance overall survival in patients with lung cancer. Therefore, any apparent improvement in the 5-year survival rates of patients diagnosed through a CT scan compared to those diagnosed with an X-ray is attributed to lead-time bias. <br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option A: Berksonian bias arises because of the different rates of admission to hospitals for people with different diseases.

A new form of flurosis characterised by genu valgum and osteoporosis of the lower limbs has been reported in some districts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. It is observed among people whose staple is sorghum (jowar) since a diet based on sorghum promotes higher retention of ingested fluoride than do diets based on rice. In such cases, the goal is to reduce fluoride intake, not supplement it.<br><br>Fluorosis occurs when drinking water contains excess amounts of fluorine, in the range of 3-5mg/L. It is endemic to certain parts of India like Andhra Pradesh (Nellore, Prakasam), Telangana (Nalgonda), Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.  Symptoms correspond to levels of fluoride intake.<br><br>* Dental fluorosis (1.5mg/L): Occurs if excess fluoride is ingested during the period of tooth calcification, i.e. in the first 7 years of life. It causes mottling of dental enamel. The appearance of chalky-white, and dull patches on the teeth in the early stages. The white spots progressively turn yellow and then brown-black. The loss of enamel gives a corroded appearance in severe cases. Mottling is best seen on the upper incisors and almost exclusively affects permanent teeth during its period of formation.<br><br>* Skeletal fluorosis (3-6mg/L): Occurs due to the heavy deposition of fluoride in the skeleton. Fluorosis stimulates osteoblastic activity, and fluorapatite crystals are laid down in bone. These are usually resistant to secondary osteoclastic resorption. This leads to calcium retention, osteosclerosis, and osteophytosis. Ossification of ligaments and fascial attachments is characteristic.<br><br>* Crippling fluorosis (>10mg/L): Can lead to permanent disability.<br><br>* Genu valgum with osteoporosis of the lower limbs in people whose staple is sorghum (jowar).

      "solution": "Nalgonda technique is a method used for defluoridation of water, and it requires alum and lime (Image 1 and 4).<br><br>Nalgonda technique was developed by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur for removing fluoride by a chemical treatment. The process used for the defluoridation of water involves the addition of lime and alum followed by, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. This process can be used for domestic and community water supplies.<br><br>The image given below depicts the Nalgonda technique:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/57fef6d588a84b5ab1b408efa84bbf4ex720x537.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Fluorosis occurs when drinking water contains excess amounts of fluorine, in the range of 3-5mg/L. It is endemic to certain parts of India like Andhra Pradesh (Nellore, Prakasam), Telangana (Nalgonda), Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.  Symptoms correspond to levels of fluoride intake.<br><br>* Dental fluorosis (1.5mg/L): Occurs if excess fluoride is ingested during the period of tooth calcification, i.e. in the first 7 years of life. It causes mottling of dental enamel. The appearance of chalky-white, and dull patches on the teeth in the early stages. The white spots progressively turn yellow and then brown-black. The loss of enamel gives a corroded appearance in severe cases. Mottling is best seen on the upper incisors and almost exclusively affects permanent teeth during its period of formation.<br><br>* Skeletal fluorosis (3-6mg/L): Occurs due to the heavy deposition of fluoride in the skeleton. <br><br>* Crippling fluorosis (>10mg/L): Can lead to permanent disability.<br><br>* Genu valgum: Characterised by genu valgum and osteoporosis of the lower limbs and observed among people whose staple is sorghum (jowar). It is a new form of fluorosis reported in some districts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. <br><br>The given image shows skeletal fluorosis (interosseous-membrane-calcification):<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/43b9034b96844bc8a211f82d49ffc4a0x720x1077.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Interventions for Fluorosis:<br><br>* Change the drinking water source with a lower fluoride content (0.5 to 0.8 mg/L). Running surface water contains lower quantities of fluorides than groundwater sources.<br><br>* The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur, developed a technique for removing fluoride by a chemical treatment called the Nalgonda technique.<br><br>* Fluoride supplements should not be prescribed for children who drink fluoridated water.<br><br>* The use of fluoride toothpaste in areas of endemic fluorosis is not recommended for children up to 6 years of age.",
