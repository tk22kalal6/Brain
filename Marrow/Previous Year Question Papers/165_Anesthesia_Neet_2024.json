By maintaining open alveoli, PEEP improves gas exchange, which increases oxygen levels in the blood.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option B: Decreases inspiratory pressure: PEEP can <strong>increase</strong> the overall inspiratory pressure by maintaining pressure in the lungs at the end of expiration.</p>\n<p>Option C: Increases venous return and maintains cardiac output: PEEP can <strong>decrease</strong> venous return due to increased intrathoracic pressure, which may reduce cardiac output.</p>\n<p>Option D: Reduces CO2 in alveoli: PEEP does not directly reduce CO2 in the alveoli. The effect on CO2 depends on ventilation and perfusion matching, not just PEEP alone.</p>",
