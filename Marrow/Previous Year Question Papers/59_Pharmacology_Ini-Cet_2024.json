      "solution": "<p><strong>Dapagliflozin</strong> is known to cause <strong>urinary tract infections</strong>.</p>\n<p>Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose transporter 2 (<strong>SGLT-2</strong>) inhibitor. It acts by inhibiting the SGLT-2 transporter which is present on the proximal segment of the renal tubule and is responsible for the reabsorption of 80-90% of filtered glucose. This results in <strong>glycosuria</strong>. Other SGLT-2 inhibitors include canagliflozin and empagliflozin.</p>\n<p>Apart from their effect on lowering blood glucose levels, SGLT2 inhibitors can cause mild weight loss and reduction in blood pressure. They have also been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with <strong>heart failure</strong>.</p>\n<p>The common side effects include <strong>urinary tract infections</strong> and <strong>genital mycotic infections</strong> due to the high glucose content of the urine. There is a risk of the development of <strong>diabetic ketoacidosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Sitagliptin</strong> is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. Its use is associated with an increased risk of heart failure.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Pioglitazone</strong> is an activator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which is involved in the regulation of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism. Its adverse effects include increased incidence of <strong>heart failure</strong>, <strong>peripheral edema</strong>, weight gain, <strong>macular edema</strong>, and <strong>osteoporosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Glimepiride</strong> belongs to the class of sulfonylureas. It stimulates insulin release by inhibiting the activity of the β cell KATP channel complex. Its side effects include <strong>hypoglycemia</strong> and <strong>weight gain</strong>.</p><p>Note - Recently, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin have been approved as one of the pillars in the management of <strong>heart failure</strong> and <strong>chronic kidney disease</strong> in adults.</p>",

It <strong>accumulates in macrophages</strong> and gets deposited as <strong>needle-shaped crystals</strong> in many tissues including subcutaneous fat. </p>\n<p>Clofazimine is used as a component of multidrug therapy (MDT) for <strong>leprosy</strong>. Because of its <strong>anti-inflammatory</strong> properties, it is valuable in <strong>lepra reactions</strong>. Occasionally, it is used as a component of a combination regimen for extensive drug resistant TB (<strong>XDR-TB</strong>). </p>\n<p>Adverse effects - </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Skin</strong> - The major disadvantage is <strong>reddish-black discoloration</strong> of skin, especially on exposed parts. Discoloration of hair and <strong>body secretions </strong>may also occur. Dryness of the skin, itching and scaling are often troublesome. Acneform eruptions and phototoxicity have been noted. <strong>Conjunctival pigmentation</strong> may create cosmetic problems. </li>\n<li><strong>GI symptoms</strong> - Nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, weight loss and enteritis with intermittent loose stools can occur, particularly when higher doses are used to control lepra reaction. Deposition of clofazimine crystals in the <strong>intestinal submucosa</strong> may produce gastrointestinal symptoms. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clofazimine is to be avoided during early pregnancy and in patients with liver or kidney damage. </p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>Ofloxacin</strong> is a fluroquinolone. As a component of MDT, it has been found to hasten the bacteriological and clinical response, where it is cidal to <em>M.leprae</em>. Its side effects include <strong>nausea</strong>, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. <strong>CNS side effects</strong> like dizziness, anxiety and insomnia are also seen. <strong>Tendinitis</strong> is another adverse effect seen with the use of fluoroquinolones.</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Dapsone </strong>exerts its antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of PABA incorporation into folic acid by <strong>folate synthase</strong>. Apart from being used in leprosy, dapsone is also used for the prophylaxis of <em>T. gondii. </em>The anti-inflammatory effects are the basis for therapy of <strong>dermatitis herpetiformis</strong>, linear immunoglobulin A bullous disease, and relapsing chondritis. Mild <strong>hemolytic anemia</strong> is common, especially in those with <strong>G-6-PD deficiency</strong>. Isolated instances of reversible <strong>peripheral neuropathy</strong>, <strong>drug fever</strong>, hematuria, <strong>pruritus</strong>, psychosis, and a variety of skin rashes have been reported.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Rifampicin</strong> interrupts RNA synthesis by binding to a subunit of mycobacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Apart from being used to treat leprosy, it is used in the management of <strong>tuberculosis</strong>, <strong>brucellosis</strong>, and prophylaxis of <em>Meningococcal</em> meningitis. <strong>Hepatitis</strong> is a major adverse effect. Other side effects include pruritus with rash, <strong>redness </strong>and watering of eyes,<br /><strong>flu-like</strong> symptoms and abdominal cramps. <strong>Urine</strong> and secretions may become <strong>orange-red</strong>.</p>",
