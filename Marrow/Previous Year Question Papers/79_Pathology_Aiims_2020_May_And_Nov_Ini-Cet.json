These cross-linking of the reactive sulphydryl groups in the globin chain of hemoglobin. These are then deposited as inclusions in RBC membranes as Heinz bodies. When these RBCs pass-through spleen, macrophages pluck out these membrane inclusions. The remaining cells are seen as bite cells.

But spherocytes have already lost a part of its membrane, so are relatively full. Hence if they are placed in a hypotonic solution, they absorb more fluid and result in lysis of RBCs. This forms the basis of testing spherocytes in Hereditary spherocytosis or G6PD and is known as osmotic fragility testing.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, placing RBCs in a hypertonic solution may cause them to lose water and shrink in size.
