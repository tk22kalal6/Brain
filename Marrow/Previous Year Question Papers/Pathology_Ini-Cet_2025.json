      "solution": "1, 2, and 3 are the correct statements.<br><br>Free radicals can cause peroxidation of lipids within plasma and organellar membranes, in the presence of O2. Oxidative damage begins when the double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids of membrane lipids are attacked by O2-derived free radicals, particularly by OH. The lipid–free radical interactions yield peroxides, which are themselves unstable and reactive, initiating an autocatalytic chain reaction known as propagation that can result in extensive membrane damage.<br><br>Reactive oxygen species are produced by the rapid assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase, which oxidises reduced NADPH and, in the process, reduces oxygen to superoxide anion. This oxidative reaction is triggered by activating signals accompanying phagocytosis in neutrophils and is called the respiratory burst.<br><br>Superoxide dismutase inactivates free radicals and acts as an antioxidant by converting hydrogen peroxide to oxygen.",

Follicular thyroid cancer is most commonly associated with it.<br><br>Follicular thyroid cancer spreads hematogenously to bone, lungs, liver, and other parts of the body. Hence, it can lead to lytic lesions in the skull.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Hurthle cell thyroid cancer is a variant of Follicular thyroid cancer, but Follicular thyroid cancer has a greater chance of leading to lytic lesions in the skull.<br><br>Option B: Papillary thyroid cancer leads to lymphatic metastasis and doesn't spread to bones hematogenously.<br><br>Option D: Thyroid Lymphoma can lead to lymphatic metastasis and doesn't spread to bones hematogenously.<br><br>Pearl PM2122: Follicular thyroid malignancy<br><br>It is more common in iodine-deficient areas. It is associated with p53, PTEN, PAX/PPAR-gamma, RAS, miRNA (miR-197 and miR-346).<br><br>It commonly presents as solitary thyroid nodules and the mean age of presentation is 50 years. It can also occur in long-standing cases of multinodular goitre.<br><br>FNAC is unable to distinguish between benign and malignant follicular lesions as malignancy is defined by capsular and vascular invasion. Hence, Trucut biopsy is required to confirm malignancy.<br><br>Histological findings:<br><br>* Encapsulated<br><br>* Uniform microfollicles or sheets of cells devoid of colloid<br><br>* Capsular and vascular invasion indicates malignancy<br><br>* Tumour thrombus within middle thyroid/ jugular veins may be seen at the time of surgery<br><br>Vascular (hematogenous) dissemination is common, with metastases to bone, lungs, liver, and elsewhere. The prognosis depends largely on the extent of invasion and stage at presentation.<br><br>Serum thyroglobulin levels are used for monitoring tumour recurrence, as they are undetectable after complete treatment.<br><br>Pearl PM2118: Papillary thyroid carcinoma<br><br>Papillary carcinoma is the most common thyroid carcinoma. It is most common in iodine sufficient areas, children and in those exposed to ionizing radiation. <br><br>The mean age of presentation is 3rd-4th decade and is more common in women than men (2:1). Dysphagia, dysphonia and dyspnea are associated with local invasion.<br><br>It usually presents as a cold nodule on the scan. Histological findings include:<br><br>* Branching papillae <br><br>* Follicles with the fibrovascular stalk<br><br>* Psammoma bodies<br><br>* Nuclear changes- <br><br>* Optically clear - Ground glass or Orphan Annie eye nuclei<br><br>* Pseudo-inclusions<br><br>* Nuclear grooves.<br><br>Lymph node metastasis is common. Lateral aberrant thyroid denotes a cervical lymph node invaded by papillary carcinoma. The most common sites of metastasis : lung > liver > bone > brain.<br><br>It has an excellent prognosis, with a 10-year survival rate in excess of 95%.",

It occurs in the following sequence:<br><br>* Activation of the inflammasome complex<br><br>* Activation of caspase-1<br><br>* Generation of IL-1 - results in fever, inflammation, leukocyte recruitment<br><br>Cytoplasmic innate immune receptors recognize microbial products that entered the infected cells and activate the multiprotein complex called the inflammasome. Inflammasome activates caspase 1 and helps in the release of the biologically activated forms of IL-1. IL-1 is a mediator of inflammation, including leukocyte recruitment and fever. Along with caspase 1, caspases 4 and 5 also induce cell death.<br><br>Pyroptosis differs from apoptosis by the following features:<br><br>* There is cellular swelling<br><br>* There is loss of cell membrane integrity<br><br>* It is associated with inflammation<br><br>* Caspases 1, 4, and 5 are involved<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, distinct pathway of cell death induced by lipid peroxidation. The widespread peroxidation disrupts membrane function, which leads to the loss of plasma membrane permeability and results in cell death resembling necrosis. <br><br>Option B: Apoptosis: The intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic death receptor-initiated pathways converge to activate a caspase cascade that mediates the final phase of apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway activates caspase 9, whereas the extrinsic pathway activates caspases 8 and 10. These caspases then activate caspase 3 and caspase 6. Activated caspases cause DNA degradation and nuclear fragmentation.<br><br>Option C: Necroptosis, as the name suggests, has features similar to necrosis and apoptosis. Like necrosis, it is characterised by loss of ATP, cellular and organelle swelling, the release of lysosomal enzymes, and rupture of the plasma membrane. However, like apoptosis, this is programmed cell death. Ligation of TNFR1 initiates necroptosis. Necroptosis involves two kinases called receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3). This is a caspase-independent programmed cell death.",
