      "solution": "CBNAAT Is the WHO recommended investigation of choice for spinal tuberculosis.<br><br>WHO recommends CBNAAT (GeneXpert) as the investigation of choice for diagnosis of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, especially for CSF, lymph nodes and other tissue specimens. It has the lowest turnaround time (2 hours) among all the diagnostic methods. It is based on real-time PCR technique and simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA and rifampicin resistance (mutations of the rpoB gene). It uses five probes targeting various sequences of rpoB gene. <br><br>In cases of extrapulmonary TB, the demonstration of acid-fast bacilli on the smear is difficult because the bacillary load itself is low. For this reason, CBNAAT is the preferred diagnostic technique for extrapulmonary TB. Traditional methods such as culture and sensitivity take a long time of around 4-6 weeks. Hence, there is a need for a rapid diagnostic test like CBNAAT (Option B).<br><br>Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's spine) is always secondary. The bacteria reach the spine via the haematogenous route, from the lungs or lymph nodes. It spreads via the para-vertebral plexus of veins i.e., Batson's plexus, which has free communication with the visceral plexus of the abdomen, a common site of tuberculosis. Clinical features include pain, stuffiness, swelling (cold abscess), paraplegia or deformity (gibbus). <br><br>The spine is the commonest site of bone and joint tuberculosis. It most commonly involves the dorso-lumbar region. MRI is the radiological investigation of choice. Imaging studies like X-rays or NCCT scans may indicate bony destruction or evidence of abscess but they are not the investigation of choice.  (Option C and D).<br><br>Paradiscal areas are the most common site of vertebral involvement.

      "solution": "In the given clinical scenario, history of a fall on an outstretched hand followed by pain and swelling over the anatomical snuffbox, despite normal X-ray findings, is suggestive of scaphoid fracture. The next step in the management is to apply a thumb spica cast and review after 10-14 days for imaging.<br><br>All the cases of scaphoid fracture with high clinical suspicion with the absence of fracture line on X-ray should be treated with a scaphoid cast for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks repeat imaging is done because up to 30% of patients may have positive follow-up radiographs. Sometimes, the fracture becomes visible at this stage, because of resorption of the fracture ends. If no fracture is seen even at 2 weeks, no further treatment is required. <br><br>A scaphoid fracture is more common in young adults. Commonly, the fracture occurs through the waist of the scaphoid. Clinical features include pain and swelling over the radial aspect of the wrist following a fall on an outstretched hand. On examination, one may be able to elicit tenderness in the scaphoid fossa(anatomical snuff box). X-ray with an oblique view of the wrist is taken in addition to the anteroposterior and lateral views. Sometimes a fracture line is not visible on initial X-rays. If a fracture is strongly suspected, X-rays should be repeated after 2 weeks.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/7a619b14224b4372aa047bbca6630347.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>The affected hand is immobilized in a scaphoid cast for 3-4 months. The scaphoid cast extends from below the elbow to the metacarpal heads including the thumb up to the inter-phalangeal joint. The wrist is maintained in a little dorsiflexion and radial deviation (glass holding position). In widely displaced fractures, open reduction and internal fixation using a special compression screw (Herbert's screw) is required.<br><br>The common complications of scaphoid fracture include:<br><br>* Non-union and delayed union<br><br>* Avascular necrosis<br><br>* Wrist osteoarthritis<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Options B and C: If pain persists but repeat X-rays remain normal, MRI or CT can then be considered. MRI is more sensitive than CT and has a negative predictive value of 100%, but it is expensive and not always readily available. In contrast, initial immobilization with re-evaluation is a safe and cost-effective approach. Urgent CT or MRI should only be considered if an acute diagnosis is absolutely necessary.<br><br>It's important to note that even if an urgent CT confirms a fracture, the patient would still be treated conservatively with thumb spica immobilization. Conversely, if the CT is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, immobilization would still continue with repeat imaging planned later. In other words, CT does not change the initial management, making it an unnecessary early investigation. Furthermore, the primary concern here is a possible scaphoid fracture—not a ligamentous injury. Even if MRI were to reveal a ligamentous injury, the immediate management would still involve immobilization in a thumb spica cast.<br><br>Option D: Discharging the patient with only analgesia is inappropriate because a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture, even with a normal initial X-ray, carries a significant risk of complications such as non-union or avascular necrosis due to the bone’s tenuous blood supply. Without proper immobilization, even a small, undetected fracture can worsen, leading to chronic complications.",
