If a crime is committed during this period, according to the <strong>McNaghten Rule</strong>, the individual could be held accountable for their actions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Sec. 84 IPC deals with the criminal responsibility of insane persons.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>It states that: “Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, because of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to the law”.</strong></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>BNS Section 22: Nothing is an offence done by a person who, at the time of doing it, because of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.</strong></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><strong>McNaughten Rule:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The key principle states that every person is presumed <span class=\"customMeta\" data-dictid=\"fb0ed2081a1692777198f63f30040c\">sane</span> until proven otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>To establish a defence of insanity, it must be proven that the accused, at the time of the act, had a mental disease that prevented them from understanding the nature of the act or recognising it as wrong.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Legal Test of <span class=\"customMeta\" data-dictid=\"f83d4dc2da169277719025e6ff657f\">Insanity</span> (Right or Wrong Test): </strong>A person is not criminally responsible if they did not know the nature of their act or that it was wrong at the time of the crime.
