His teachers reported that he does not listen to their instructions, often talks during class, and rarely completes his school assignments. He does not sit in his seat in the classroom and often cuts in line at the cafeteria. His foster mother reports that he runs around a lot inside the house and refuses to help his sister with chores and errands. He frequently interrupts his foster mother's conversations with others and talks excessively. She has found him trying to climb on the roof on multiple occasions. He was placed in foster care because of neglect by his biological parents 3 years ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Mental status examination shows a neutral affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

He was recently fired from his job as a cashier because of mistakes and absenteeism. He says that he finds it difficult to maintain focus on any task and often feels restless. He admits that he often forgets to pay his bills and often misplaces his cell phone and keys. He has had poor academic performance and dropped out of high school at 15 years of age. He drinks three to four beers on weekends and does not smoke or use illicit drugs. He is sexually active with one male partner and uses condoms inconsistently. His mother has a history of opioid use disorder. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination shows a normal mood and a reactive affect. A diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with a predominantly inattentive presentation is made. The physician explains the implications of the diagnosis, various treatment options, and the adverse effects of each treatment. The patient is concerned about his risk for a substance use disorder given his family history. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?",

His symptoms have generally been well controlled, with improvements noted in his ability to pay attention, to follow instructions, to complete schoolwork on time, and to interact with his peers.\nToday, his mother reports that his academic performance has recently started to decline, with an increasing number of incomplete assignments and lower grades. At home, he has been having trouble sleeping and does not want to play with friends as much as he used to.\nThe boy appears well, and his vital signs are within normal limits. He weighs 37 kg (50th percentile for age) and is 150 cm tall (52nd percentile for age), for a BMI of 16.7 (40th percentile for age). His pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. His ear, nose, and throat examination reveals moist, pink mucous membranes, with a normal oropharynx and normal tympanic membranes. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and his cardiac, neurologic, and musculoskeletal examinations are normal.\nWhat is the most likely reason for this patient's current symptoms?",
