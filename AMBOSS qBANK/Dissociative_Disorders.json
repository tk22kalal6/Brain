      "text": "A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after being found in a confused state at a rest area along an interstate highway in Florida. She is unable to recall her name, address, or any other information regarding her person. She denies being the woman on the Connecticut driver's license found in her wallet.  A telephone call with the police department of her hometown reveals that she had been reported missing three days ago by her husband. When the husband arrives, he reports that his wife has had a great deal of stress at work lately and that before she went missing, she was anxious about telling her boss that she will not meet the deadline for her current project. She has had two major depressive episodes within the past 4 years that were treated with citalopram. She drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends. She does not use illicit drugs. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is oriented only to time and place but not to person. Short-term memory is intact; she does not recognize her husband or recall important life events. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Twice, his roommate encountered the patient timidly huddled up on the floor while “talking to the others” in an unusually high-pitched child-like voice. The patient vigorously denies any memory of the situation. He recently lost his job at the zoo because of his sudden behavioral changes. When he was 3 years old, his father died in a train crash. His mother had obsessive-compulsive disorder and severely punished him whenever he would get something dirty as a child. He does not smoke or take illicit drugs, but drinks several beers every weekend that “help him drown his feelings of not being part of this world”. He has taken multiple psychiatric drugs for depression and anxiety in the past, which did not help improve his symptoms. The patient is meticulously shaved and excessively well-groomed.
