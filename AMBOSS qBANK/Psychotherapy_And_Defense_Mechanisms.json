This nonjudgmental method of counseling communicates acceptance rather than reproach and supports conditions for change. One important aim is to encourage the patient to believe in the possibility of change while also making clear that the change is up to him and that the clinician is there as a partner to help with that change. The goal of the brief intervention is to provide education and foster an alliance that can be used to motivate change.<br><br>Lifestyle changes are difficult to make, and it usually takes a while for patients to muster the energy and commitment to give up an ingrained habit like drinking. This knowledge might induce a clinician to argue more fervently for change, but this approach often backfires. Confronting unhealthy defenses, such as denial, at the outset of the discussion or providing a “simple” referral to treatment could be viewed negatively by the patient.
