In addition, he was suspended for 3 days last month because of disruptive behavior at a school dance. When interviewed privately, he reveals that he was drinking alcohol before he got into an altercation with another student at the dance.\nUpon further questioning, he says that he sometimes has five or six drinks per evening. He answers “yes” to four out of six questions on the CRAFFT questionnaire and also reports that he requires an increasingly higher number of drinks to obtain the same level of intoxication.\nDespite considering himself a “social drinker,” he has started to drink after school as a “pick-me-up” before starting homework. He reports that his best friend has concerns about his drinking but that he himself is not concerned.\nIn addition to counseling this patient about not driving after drinking, which one of the following statements is the best approach for counseling this patient?",

To increase the chances of this conversation being successful, the clinician can incorporate principles of <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=PN0WYg&anker=Z8646c48a45fc958d20550a893b2e835d\" data-learningcard-id=\"PN0WYg\" data-anker=\"Z8646c48a45fc958d20550a893b2e835d\" data-section-id=\"MGWM-50\" data-sememe-id=\"Ctbqfv\">motivational interviewing</a>.<br><br>This nonjudgmental method of counseling communicates acceptance rather than reproach and supports conditions for change.

Clinicians might feel frustrated by these delays and argue even more fervently for change, but this approach often backfires. Confronting unhealthy defenses, such as denial, at the outset of the discussion or providing a “simple” referral to treatment could be viewed negatively by the patient. Threats of negative health consequences are often experienced as argumentative and judgmental and are therefore counterproductive.
