      "text": "High-quality afterschool programming during childhood promotes long-term adult mental health\nBackground\nHigh-quality afterschool programming in children has been found to improve standardized test scores, dropout rates, and college attendance. The APPLE (Afterschool Programming for Psychiatric Long-term Endpoints) study seeks to examine the effect of such programs on long-term adult mental health.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nSocioeconomically disadvantaged children ages 5–10 were recruited for this study. Participants with a history of intellectual/developmental disability or existing psychiatric illness were excluded. Eligible families were identified by screening government social service agencies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and of all qualified families who were invited to participate in free afterschool enrichment activities for their children, 320 children were enrolled. The socioeconomic characteristics of study participants were found to be similar to those of the population being studied.\n160 children were randomly assigned to free afterschool enrichment activities and 160 to a waiting list that served as a control; the parents of 12 children declined participation after their children were randomly assigned to the control group. Of the 83 children participating in the study's 20-year follow-up, 62 were in the treatment group and 21 were in the control group.\nInterventions\nThe intervention involved free afterschool programming for the first three years of the study. The programming lasted three hours per day and was held five days per week, consisting of an hour of creative problem-based math/reading instruction supplemented with two hours of music, art, and athletic group activities. Children in the control group were placed on the waiting list for the intervention.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nData on the incidence of common DSM 5-validated mental health conditions was collected at the study's 20-year follow-up evaluation and confirmed by chart review.\nResults\nTable - Association of major depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder at 20-year follow-up of participants who received afterschool enrichment during childhood*.\n*Adjusted for income and family history of psychiatric illness.\n\n\n\nMajor Depressive Disorder\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n\n\n\nRelative Risk (95% CI) \nP -value\nRelative Risk (95% CI)\nP -value\n\n\nControl\n1.0 [reference]\n--\n1.0 [reference]\n--\n\n\nAfterschool Enrichment\n0.69 (0.59–0.87)\n&lt; 0.001\n0.80 (0.74–0.92)\n0.02\n\n\n\n\n\nBipolar Disorder (I or II) without Psychosis\nAny Psychotic Disorder\n\n\n\nRelative Risk (95% CI)\nP -value\nRelative Risk (95% CI)\nP -value\n\n\nControl\n1.0 [reference]\n-- \n1.0 [reference] \n--\n\n\nAfterschool Enrichment\n0.64 (0.59–1.35)\n0.34\n\n0.84 (0.51–1.23) \n0.22\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study highlights the potential of high-quality afterschool programming during childhood in promoting long-term adult mental health.\nSource of funding: Wisconsin Children's Mental Health Foundation, National Early Childhood Education Coalition\n\nAn 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child examination at a clinic for low-income residents. Although her son's elementary school offers free afterschool programming, her son has not been interested in attending. The son's maternal grandmother has schizophrenia. The mother is inquiring about the benefits of afterschool programming and asks for the physician's input. Based on the study results, which of the following statements best addresses the mother's question?",

      "text": "Predictors of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in HIV-positive adults\nBackground:\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer commonly seen in HIV-positive patients. It is also the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States. Given that the risk profile for DLBCL remains unclear, this study seeks to identify predictors of DLBCL.\nMethods:\nData was obtained via retrospective chart review at a major tertiary academic medical center in California in 2017. A total of 9,820 adults with HIV diagnoses between 2000 and 2002 and subsequently started on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) were identified. Data on demographics and antiretroviral regimen were obtained. The prevalence of DLBCL cases in the cohort, as of 2017, was obtained via chart review. Medication adherence was assessed by analyzing pharmacy claims linked to patient charts and calculating a Medication Possession Rate (MPR), the total amount of time a medication was dispensed to patients divided by treatment period. Patients with a past or present history of cancer preceding HIV diagnosis, as well as missing data on key variables, were excluded from analysis.\nResults:\nThis study included 219 cases (DLBCL) and 7,872 controls (no DLBCL). The average age of patients at the time of diagnosis was 58. Risk factors for DLBCL are shown in the table below with adjustment for covariates.\nTable – Model showing impact of risk factors on DLBCL in HIV-positive patients\n\n\n\nRelative risk (95% CI)\nP-value\n\n\nAge\n\n0.11\n\n\nAge &lt; 55\nReference\n\n\n\nAge ≥ 55\n1.21 (0.96-1.48)\n\n\n\nBiological sex\n\n0.02\n\n\nFemale\nReference\n\n\n\nMale\n1.08 (1.01-1.19)\n\n\n\nIncome (per capita, per year)\n\n0.04\n\n\n&lt; $30,000\nReference\n\n\n\n$30,000–$90,000\n0.87 (0.78-0.99)\n\n\n\n&gt; $90,000\n0.88 (0.79-0.97)\n\n\n\nFamily history of cancer\n\n0.08\n\n\nNo family history\nReference\n\n\n\nFamily history of cancer\n1.35 (0.93-1.43)\n\n\n\ncART adherence (measured via MPR)*\n\n0.03\n\n\nLow\nReference\n\n\n\nHigh\n0.69 (0.62-0.87)\n\n\n\n*Thresholds (low versus high) for MPR are based on established cutoffs in the literature.\nConclusions:\nOur study identified a number of risk factors that significantly contribute to DLBCL risk in HIV-positive adults.\nSource of funding: Not stated\n\nA 63-year-old HIV-positive man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. Four years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV and was started on cART therapy. He tells the physician that he has been having difficulty adhering to his medication regimen. He has been unemployed for the past couple of years and relies on unemployment benefits to cover the costs of daily living. His father died of lymphoma at the age of 60 years. He had recently heard about the results of the study featured in the abstract and wants more information about his risk of developing DLBCL. Based on the study, which of the following is the strongest risk factor for the development of DLBCL in HIV-positive patients with a similar profile as this patient?",

As a measure of the probability that observed results occurred by chance, p-values help determine the statistical significance of a relationship between two variables (e.g., a p-value of 0.05 indicates the probability of seeing the observed results by chance is 5%, assuming the null hypothesis is true). The magnitude of relative risk (not the p-value), however, is a measure of how strongly a risk factor is associated with a given outcome.",

Some of these patients had been scheduled to receive annual abdominal CTs while other patients had not been scheduled for such routine imaging surveillance. The medical student then identified a subgroup of patients who have developed recurrent metastatic disease despite their previous complete clinical response to chemotherapy and surgery. She compared patients who were diagnosed with metastatic cancer during routine follow-up imaging with patients who were diagnosed with metastatic cancer based on clinical symptoms at routine follow-up history and physical exams. She found that the average survival of patients who underwent routine imaging was four months longer than the survival of their peers who were diagnosed based on history and physical exam.

He was concerned that his patients had developed agranulocytosis, a relatively rare but dangerous adverse event associated with clozapine. When the psychiatrist checked the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of both patients, one was 450/mm3, while the other was 700/mm3 (N = 1500/mm3). According to the clozapine REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program, severe neutropenia in clozapine recipients has often been defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/mm3. Changing the cutoff value to 750/mm3 would affect the test performance of ANC with regard to agranulocytosis in which of the following ways?",

The study compared patients who had PTSD with those who did not have PTSD in order to determine if PTSD is associated with worse asthma control. During a follow-up period of 12 months, the researchers found that patients with PTSD had a greater number of hospitalizations for asthma exacerbations (RR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.4–2.5) after adjusting for medical comorbidities, psychiatric comorbidities other than PTSD, and sociodemographic variables. Results are shown:\n\n\n\n\n≥ 1 asthma exacerbation\nNo asthma exacerbations\n\n\nPTSD\n80\n80\n\n\nNo PTSD\n50\n150\n\n\nBased on these results, what proportion of asthma hospitalizations in patients with PTSD could be attributed to PTSD?",

The researcher plots the new test's sensitivity and specificity data on a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The test has the best performance in identifying lung cancer in patients with a serum protein cutoff value of &gt; 50 U/mL, for which the sensitivity of the test is 93% and the specificity is 88%. A fellow PhD research student decides to repeat the study using the same screening test with the same cutoff value in patients aged &lt; 50 years without a history of smoking. In this patient group, significantly fewer patients have lung cancer. Which of the points on the graph best represents the performance of the test in this patient group?",

She states that the package insert of the HIV test shows that of 100 patients who are found to be HIV-positive on PCR, 91 tested positive via the HIV test. Later in the day, a 23-year-old woman with a history of genitourinary chlamydia infection also comes to the urgent care center after testing negative for HIV.

The epidemiologists compared rapid diagnostic test results to seropositivity of viral antigen via PCR in 200 patients. The findings are represented in the following table:\n\n\nTest result\nPCR-confirmed avian influenza\nNo avian influenza\n\n\n\nPositive rapid diagnostic test\n95\n2\n\n\nNegative rapid diagnostic test\n5\n98\n\n\n\nBased on these results, the epidemiologists decide to use the rapid diagnostic test as the initial test in the serial testing strategy.

      "text": "A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of nocturia. He wakes up twice each night to urinate. He has no involuntary leakage of urine and no history of serious illness. He takes no medication. His younger brother was diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 35 years. Rectal examination shows a smooth, symmetrical prostate without nodules. The remainder of the examination and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Bladder ultrasonography discloses a postvoid residual volume of 10 mL (N &lt; 50). The physician offers to discuss the advantages and limitations of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in screening for prostate cancer. He mentions that a serum PSA of 4 ng/mL is generally used as a cutoff value. At this cutoff, the test has a sensitivity of 21% for detecting any prostate cancer and 51% for detecting high-risk prostate cancer, with a specificity of 91%. In patients without urinary retention, hematuria, back pain, or incontinence, the positive predictive value (PPV) for PSA &gt; 4 ng/mL is estimated at 30%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) for PSA ≤ 4 ng/mL at 85%. Based on this information, what is the probability that this patient does not have prostate cancer if his PSA is 4.3 ng/mL?",

Two weeks ago, the patient was treated in the local emergency department where she presented with an altered mental state and dysuria. The medical student had recently read about a study that described a strong relationship between cognitive impairment and UTI hospitalization risk (RR = 1.34, p &lt; 0.001). The attending physician at the medical student's free clinic is also familiar with this study and tells the medical student that the study was conducted in a sample of upper-middle-class Caucasian patients in the Netherlands. The attending states that the results of the study should be interpreted with caution. Which of the following concerns is most likely underlying the attending physician's remarks?",

Yesterday, she saw a program on television about hepatitis E and its potential fulminant course in pregnant women. She feels well. Pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin; immunizations are up-to-date. The physician recently read a paper about a new test for HEV infection. The paper covered a trial that evaluated the efficacy of the new test in 145 pregnant women who presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain, fever, vomiting, and jaundice. The findings of the trial are shown in the table:\n\n\n\nPatients with hepatitis E\nPatients without hepatitis E\n\n\n\nPositive test result\n15\n30\n\n\nNegative test result\n10\n90\n\n\n\nThe physician decides to try out the test in this patient.

ClinicalTrials.gov FJIM 11001110.\nAllocation: Concealed.\nBlinding: Double-blinded.\nFollow-up period: Up to 5 years.\nSetting: 4 veterans care centers in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.\nPatients: 300 patients (mean age 65 ± 5.4 years, 95% men) with chronic kidney disease (stage G3–5; eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and type 2 diabetes receiving a combination regimen with an SGLT-2 inhibitor and metformin. Exclusion criteria were diabetic neuropathy, hemoglobin A1c &gt; 8.5%, and previous kidney transplant. The alpha level was set at 0.05.\nInterventions: Ambogliflozin plus metformin (n = 150) vs. standard SGLT-2 inhibitor plus metformin (n = 150).\nOutcomes: Mean change in eGFR, hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, and BMI; and incidence of hypoglycemia, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular complications (i.e., stroke and myocardial infarction).\nPatient follow-up: 98% (minimum follow-up of 3 years).\nMain results\nThe study found that patients in the ambogliflozin group had a significant improvement in kidney function as measured by eGFR compared to those who received standard combination therapy (mean change from baseline of +2.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. -0.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of diabetic retinopathy was also significantly lower in the ambogliflozin group (7% vs. 12%, RR = 0.6).\nAmbogliflozin vs. standard combination therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes\n\n\nOutcome\nAmbogliflozin combination therapy\nStandard combination therapy\nP-value\n\n\nMean change in eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) ± 2 SD\n+2.3 ± 0.2\n-0.5 ± 0.3\n&lt; 0.001\n\n\nMean change in hemoglobin A1c (%) ± 2 SD \n-0.5 ± 0.3\n-0.2 ± 0.1\n0.1\n\n\nMean change in systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) ± 2 SD \n-5 ± 1\n-3 ± 2\n0.12\n\n\nMean change in BMI (kg/m2) ± 2 SD \n-3 ± 1\n-1 ± 3\n0.5\n\n\nOutcome\nAmbogliflozin combination therapy\nStandard combination therapy\nRelative risk (95% CI)\n\n\nIncidence of hypoglycemia\n10%\n12%\n0.8 (0.5–1.2)\n\n\nIncidence of diabetic retinopathy\n7%\n12%\n0.6 (0.4–0.9)\n\n\nIncidence of cardiovascular complications\n12%\n13%\n0.9 (0.7–1.2)\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this study, ambogliflozin combination therapy was more effective than standard combination therapy in improving long-term kidney function and preventing diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant chronic kidney disease.\nSources of funding: AMBOSS Pharmaceuticals \nStructured abstract based on: Doe J*, Roe J*, et al. Ambogliflozin in Chronic Kidney Disease Study: a randomized controlled trial. Fictional Journal of Internal Medicine. 2023;109:91–111. 11001110\n\nA 68-year-old man with a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician for a follow-up visit. One week ago, he had an ophthalmologist appointment during which he underwent repeat laser photocoagulation for severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Medical history is also notable for diabetic chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and a stroke 3 years ago. He feels well. Current medications include metformin, empagliflozin, enalapril, atorvastatin, and aspirin. Pulse is 79/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 121/83 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show an HbA1c of 6.8%, which is at target, and an eGFR of 53 mL/min/1.73 m2. Urine albumin to creatinine ratio is 30 mg/g. The patient is a retired military physician who is following recent developments in the pharmaceutical market. He considers a switch from empagliflozin to ambogliflozin therapy. Based on the abstract shown, informing this patient of which of the following effects of the new treatment on his condition is most appropriate?",

ClinicalTrials.gov FJIM 11001110.\nAllocation: Concealed.\nBlinding: Double-blinded.\nFollow-up period: Up to 5 years.\nSetting: 4 veterans care centers in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.\nPatients: 300 patients (mean age 65 ± 5.4 years, 95% men) with chronic kidney disease (stage G3–5; eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and type 2 diabetes receiving a combination regimen with an SGLT-2 inhibitor and metformin. Exclusion criteria were diabetic neuropathy, hemoglobin A1c &gt; 8.5%, and previous kidney transplant. The alpha level was set at 0.05.\nInterventions: Ambogliflozin plus metformin (n = 150) vs. standard SGLT-2 inhibitor plus metformin (n = 150).\nOutcomes: Mean change in eGFR, hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, and BMI; and incidence of hypoglycemia, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular complications (i.e., stroke and myocardial infarction).\nPatient follow-up: 98% (minimum follow-up of 3 years).\nMain results\nThe study found that patients in the ambogliflozin group had a significant improvement in kidney function as measured by eGFR compared to those who received standard combination therapy (mean change from baseline of +2.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. -0.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of diabetic retinopathy was also significantly lower in the ambogliflozin group (7% vs. 12%, RR = 0.6).\nAmbogliflozin vs. standard combination therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes\n\n\nOutcome\nAmbogliflozin combination therapy\nStandard combination therapy\nP-value\n\n\nMean change in eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) ± 2 SD\n+2.3 ± 0.2\n-0.5 ± 0.3\n&lt; 0.001\n\n\nMean change in hemoglobin A1c (%) ± 2 SD \n-0.5 ± 0.3\n-0.2 ± 0.1\n0.1\n\n\nMean change in systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) ± 2 SD \n-5 ± 1\n-3 ± 2\n0.12\n\n\nMean change in BMI (kg/m2) ± 2 SD \n-3 ± 1\n-1 ± 3\n0.5\n\n\nOutcome\nAmbogliflozin combination therapy\nStandard combination therapy\nRelative risk (95% CI)\n\n\nIncidence of hypoglycemia\n10%\n12%\n0.8 (0.5–1.2)\n\n\nIncidence of diabetic retinopathy\n7%\n12%\n0.6 (0.4–0.9)\n\n\nIncidence of cardiovascular complications\n12%\n13%\n0.9 (0.7–1.2)\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this study, ambogliflozin combination therapy was more effective than standard combination therapy in improving long-term kidney function and preventing diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant chronic kidney disease.\nSources of funding: AMBOSS Pharmaceuticals \nStructured abstract based on: Doe J*, Roe J*, et al.

ClinicalTrials.gov FJIM 11001110.\nAllocation: Concealed.\nBlinding: Double-blinded.\nFollow-up period: Up to 5 years.\nSetting: 4 veterans care centers in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.\nPatients: 300 patients (mean age 65 ± 5.4 years, 95% men) with chronic kidney disease (stage G3–5; eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and type 2 diabetes receiving a combination regimen with an SGLT-2 inhibitor and metformin. Exclusion criteria were diabetic neuropathy, hemoglobin A1c &gt; 8.5%, and previous kidney transplant. The alpha level was set at 0.05.\nInterventions: Ambogliflozin plus metformin (n = 150) vs. standard SGLT-2 inhibitor plus metformin (n = 150).\nOutcomes: Mean change in eGFR, hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, and BMI; and incidence of hypoglycemia, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular complications (i.e., stroke and myocardial infarction).\nPatient follow-up: 98% (minimum follow-up of 3 years).\nMain results\nThe study found that patients in the ambogliflozin group had a significant improvement in kidney function as measured by eGFR compared to those who received standard combination therapy (mean change from baseline of +2.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. -0.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of diabetic retinopathy was also significantly lower in the ambogliflozin group (7% vs. 12%, RR = 0.6).\nAmbogliflozin vs. standard combination therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes\n\n\nOutcome\nAmbogliflozin combination therapy\nStandard combination therapy\nP-value\n\n\nMean change in eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) ± 2 SD\n+2.3 ± 0.2\n-0.5 ± 0.3\n&lt; 0.001\n\n\nMean change in hemoglobin A1c (%) ± 2 SD \n-0.5 ± 0.3\n-0.2 ± 0.1\n0.1\n\n\nMean change in systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) ± 2 SD \n-5 ± 1\n-3 ± 2\n0.12\n\n\nMean change in BMI (kg/m2) ± 2 SD \n-3 ± 1\n-1 ± 3\n0.5\n\n\nOutcome\nAmbogliflozin combination therapy\nStandard combination therapy\nRelative risk (95% CI)\n\n\nIncidence of hypoglycemia\n10%\n12%\n0.8 (0.5–1.2)\n\n\nIncidence of diabetic retinopathy\n7%\n12%\n0.6 (0.4–0.9)\n\n\nIncidence of cardiovascular complications\n12%\n13%\n0.9 (0.7–1.2)\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this study, ambogliflozin combination therapy was more effective than standard combination therapy in improving long-term kidney function and preventing diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant chronic kidney disease.\nSources of funding: AMBOSS Pharmaceuticals \nStructured abstract based on: Doe J*, Roe J*, et al.

You are considering a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis and recall that a genetic test for HLA-B27 may be helpful in diagnosing this condition. You obtain a family history, which is negative for ankylosing spondylitis, and the patient reports predominantly European ancestry.\nConsulting a reference, you find that (a) 90% of men of European ancestry with ankylosing spondylitis are HLA-B27 positive, and (b) 10% of healthy men of European ancestry (i.e., without ankylosing spondylitis) are HLA-B27 positive.\nGiven this patient’s history and physical examination, you estimate that the patient’s probability of having ankylosing spondylitis (the pretest probability) is 10%.\nWhich one of the following values represents the positive predictive value of HLA-B27 for ankylosing spondylitis in this case?",

She shows you the story and asks for your opinion.\nYou find the paper referenced in the story. It describes a prospective cohort study conducted among 600 women aged ≥30 years: 300 who reported current regular use of tanning beds and 300 who did not. During the 10-year study period, the women completed annual surveys indicating whether they had been diagnosed with skin cancer in the preceding year. At the end of the 10-year period, researchers reported that the relative risk of skin cancer associated with tanning-bed use was 1.63 (95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.36).\nHow can we interpret the estimated risk ratio from this study?",

If, however, the <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=nn07Fg&anker=Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-learningcard-id=\"nn07Fg\" data-anker=\"Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-section-id=\"Dac15a0\" data-sememe-id=\"0saetN\">confidence interval</a> included 1.0 (for example, 0.75–1.2), then that would suggest that an RR value of 1.0 is plausible - and that there may be no real difference in outcomes between the treatment and placebo groups.<br><br>The last piece of information to evaluate when considering an RR estimate is the width of the <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=nn07Fg&anker=Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-learningcard-id=\"nn07Fg\" data-anker=\"Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-section-id=\"Dac15a0\" data-sememe-id=\"0saetN\">confidence interval</a>, which provides information about the <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=ps0LDh&anker=Zc281b3447500bc4fe3f96f8387f64822\" data-learningcard-id=\"ps0LDh\" data-anker=\"Zc281b3447500bc4fe3f96f8387f64822\" data-section-id=\"vfWALk0\" data-sememe-id=\"_Ha5GN\">precision</a> of the estimate. The narrower the <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=nn07Fg&anker=Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-learningcard-id=\"nn07Fg\" data-anker=\"Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-section-id=\"Dac15a0\" data-sememe-id=\"0saetN\">confidence interval</a> is, the more precise the RR estimate is. For example, if the RR estimate is 0.74 and the 95% <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=nn07Fg&anker=Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-learningcard-id=\"nn07Fg\" data-anker=\"Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-section-id=\"Dac15a0\" data-sememe-id=\"0saetN\">confidence interval</a> is 0.37 to 0.99, that would mean that the intervention likely has a protective effect, but the magnitude of that effect could be anywhere from a 1% relative reduction in risk (which would be negligible) to a 63% relative reduction in risk (which would be substantial). If, however, the RR estimate was 0.78 and the 95% <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=nn07Fg&anker=Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-learningcard-id=\"nn07Fg\" data-anker=\"Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-section-id=\"Dac15a0\" data-sememe-id=\"0saetN\">confidence interval</a> was 0.71 to 0.86, that would suggest that the relative reduction in risk is in the range of 14% to 29%.<br><br>In this scenario, the set of results that shows a protective effect (i.e., an RR &lt;1.0 with a <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=nn07Fg&anker=Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-learningcard-id=\"nn07Fg\" data-anker=\"Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-section-id=\"Dac15a0\" data-sememe-id=\"0saetN\">confidence interval</a> that does not include 1.0) with the most <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=ps0LDh&anker=Zc281b3447500bc4fe3f96f8387f64822\" data-learningcard-id=\"ps0LDh\" data-anker=\"Zc281b3447500bc4fe3f96f8387f64822\" data-section-id=\"vfWALk0\" data-sememe-id=\"_Ha5GN\">precision</a> (i.e., the narrowest <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=nn07Fg&anker=Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-learningcard-id=\"nn07Fg\" data-anker=\"Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-section-id=\"Dac15a0\" data-sememe-id=\"0saetN\">confidence interval</a>) is the RR of 0.78 (<a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=nn07Fg&anker=Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-learningcard-id=\"nn07Fg\" data-anker=\"Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-section-id=\"Dac15a0\" data-sememe-id=\"0saetN\">confidence interval</a>, 0.71–0.86).<br><br><span class=\"wichtig\"><b>Key learning point:</b></span> In population <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=nn07Fg&anker=Z7e21c11c217ce6006f45ce249f4615bb\" data-learningcard-id=\"nn07Fg\" data-anker=\"Z7e21c11c217ce6006f45ce249f4615bb\" data-section-id=\"tacXma0\">statistics</a>, as the width of the <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=nn07Fg&anker=Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-learningcard-id=\"nn07Fg\" data-anker=\"Z870204ec2caac44bdaf843af98f0df7a\" data-section-id=\"Dac15a0\" data-sememe-id=\"0saetN\">confidence interval</a> increases, the <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=ps0LDh&anker=Zc281b3447500bc4fe3f96f8387f64822\" data-learningcard-id=\"ps0LDh\" data-anker=\"Zc281b3447500bc4fe3f96f8387f64822\" data-section-id=\"vfWALk0\" data-sememe-id=\"_Ha5GN\">precision</a> of a given measurement decreases.</div>",

The paper referenced in the news story describes a prospective cohort study conducted among 600 women aged ≥ 30 years: 300 reported regular use of tanning beds and 300 did not. During the 10-year study period, the women completed annual surveys indicating whether they had been diagnosed with skin cancer in the preceding year. At the end of the 10 years, researchers reported that the relative risk of skin cancer associated with tanning-bed use was 1.63 (95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.36). Which of the following conclusions about the relative risk reported in this study is most appropriate?",
