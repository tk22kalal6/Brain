Yesterday, the mother noticed that he grabbed his right ear repeatedly and that he “felt a bit hotter than usual.” He is otherwise healthy and has been meeting all of his developmental milestones. He was exclusively breastfed until 6 months of age, when solid foods were introduced to his diet. He usually has a bowel movement 1–3 times per day. He has had no difficulty voiding. His only medication is a vitamin D supplement. His immunizations are up to date. He is at the 40th percentile for height and at the 45th percentile for weight. He is alert and fully oriented. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a crying infant. He is drooling and calms when a plastic toy is put in his mouth. Otoscopic examination shows normal tympanic membranes. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His abdomen is soft and nontender to palpation. His diaper contains soft yellow-brown stool.
