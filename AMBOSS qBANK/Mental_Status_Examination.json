The father reports that his daughter has become increasingly socially withdrawn at college and is receiving poor grades. She has told her father that aliens are trying to infiltrate her mind. She appears anxious. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Mental status examination shows psychomotor agitation. She says, “They landed by the dumpster near my building. The birds flew backward this time, which is a sign. I tried calling my cousin, but the number smelled wrong. That’s why I keep the fridge unplugged.” Which of the following best describes this patient's thought process?",
