      "solution": "<div><h4 style='color: #34d399; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>A) CORRECT:</h4>Reporting the incident to the clinic’s grievance committee or human resources is the most appropriate initial response to workplace sexual harassment. This action ensures formal documentation of the complaint, which is crucial when a supervisor is involved due to the power dynamics. Internal reporting mechanisms are designed to investigate and address such concerns according to policies and standards, ensuring an unbiased evaluation while protecting the employee’s rights. Involving human resources or the grievance committee also triggers institutional accountability and can lead to remedial actions that safeguard both the individual and the broader workforce.<br><br><span class=\"wichtig\"><b>Key learning point: </b></span>Workplace sexual harassment is most commonly perpetrated by coworkers and supervisors due to frequent interactions and power dynamics.</div><div><h4 style='color: #f87171; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>B) INCORRECT:</h4>Minimizing the situation as miscommunication overlooks the seriousness of repeated offensive jokes, especially from a supervisor. This response fails to acknowledge the legitimacy of her distress and the institutional responsibility to investigate potential harassment. Repeated inappropriate behavior is more consistent with workplace harassment than an isolated misunderstanding.</div><div><h4 style='color: #f87171; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>C) INCORRECT:</h4>Consulting an outside attorney may be necessary if internal processes fail, but it is premature as an initial response. Prioritizing internal mechanisms is critical, as many institutions have designated procedures to handle such incidents confidentially. Immediate legal consultation might escalate the issue without allowing the workplace to address and rectify the behavior.</div><div><h4 style='color: #f87171; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>D) INCORRECT:</h4>A direct discussion may seem appealing for resolving minor misunderstandings, but it is inappropriate for repeated offensive sexual jokes, especially involving a supervisor. The power imbalance complicates open dialogue and may increase stress or fear of retaliation. A formal approach aligns with organizational policies and provides structured support and documentation.</div>",
