Her parents report that her teachers are surprised by her academic underperformance because they find her to be “a bright and vivacious student.” Her academic performance has not improved despite extra tutoring at home. Her parents have noticed that she often does not understand what she reads. She has attended elementary school since the age of 6 years and her parents are native English speakers. She has no history of serious illness and receives no medications. She appears well. She is at the 75th percentile for height and weight. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, mood and affect are cheerful and her thought content is normal. Her speech is intelligible and fluent. When asked to read from a children's novel, she reads certain words slowly and often mispronounces them. Motor skills and cognitive abilities are appropriate for age. Visual acuity testing shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

During examination, he undresses and dresses himself independently and draws a person with a head, body, arms, and legs. He can count to ten. His speech is 100% intelligible but his vocabulary is restricted for his age. He pronounces single words clearly and speaks in sentences of 2–3 words without interruptions.

He has been healthy since his last visit, without any hospital admissions or sick visits, but his mother reports that he has been having difficulty at school.\nHe is often disruptive and is sent to the principal’s office on a weekly basis. His teacher has noticed that he seems to have difficulty understanding what she is saying, and she has concerns that his reading skills are far behind those of his classmates. In addition, he has trouble communicating his needs during class. For example, he wanted to use the restroom, but the teacher was not able to understand him, and he ended up urinating in the classroom. During recess, he plays with classmates and is social, but he acts younger than expected for his age.\nOn examination, he appears healthy, is afebrile, and has normal vital signs. He looks you in the eye and smiles. In between the examination and discussion with his mother, he occasionally flaps his arms repetitively. A hearing screen is normal, and he has no history of tongue-tie or other structural abnormalities of his oral cavity.\nWhich one of the following diagnoses is most likely in this case?",

She was last seen at age 9 months, missed her 12-month well-child visit several times, and is behind on her immunizations.\nDuring the interview, the mother states that they are living in a 30-year-old apartment building with her roommate and a dog. She notes that the child drinks about 1.2 liters (40 ounces) of milk per day and 470 mL (16 ounces) of juice from a bottle but “doesn’t want to eat anything.&quot; She denies any recent illness or vomiting but notes that the child does have loose stools intermittently.\nWhen you give the child some crayons to try to entertain her, she drops them on the floor. You notice that she will stand holding onto things but will not take steps or cruise. She asks for “milk” and her “bottle” and points at the door throughout the visit. When her vaccines are administered, she cries, and her mother does not try to console her.\nOn examination, the child makes good eye contact and is interactive. Her weight is at the 10th percentile, down from the 50th percentile at her 9-month visit. Her height and head circumference percentiles are stable between the 50th and 75th percentiles. She has caries in her front teeth, and the frenulum is intact without a tear. She has normal tone and normal reflexes in her upper and lower extremities. She is able to bear weight on both legs but will not pull herself up. She has no rashes or unusual bruising.\nWhat is the most likely cause of this patient's developmental delay?",
