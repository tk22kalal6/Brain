Her pulse is 140/min, respirations are 12/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 76/55 mm Hg. 0.9% saline infusion is begun. A focused assessment with sonography shows blood in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Her hemoglobin concentration is 7.6 g/dL and hematocrit is 22%. The surgeon decides to move the patient to the operating room for an emergency explorative laparotomy. Packed red blood cell transfusion is ordered prior to surgery. A friend of the patient asks for the transfusion to be held as the patient is a Jehovah's Witness. The patient has no advance directive and there is no documentation showing her refusal of blood transfusions. The patient's husband and children cannot be contacted. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

He has nontremor-dominant Parkinson disease that was diagnosed at the age of 68 after developing progressive bradykinesia and rigidity. He lives alone following the death of his wife 2 years ago. The patient's son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren live nearby and help him with daily activities. Current medications include levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone. He appears well. Neurologic examination shows mild hypomimia, bradydiadochokinesia, shortened steps, and mild gait shuffling. During the examination, the patient mentions that he drove himself to his appointment today because he does not want to feel like a burden on his son. The physician is concerned that the patient's illness and medications potentially impair his driving skills.

Previsit laboratory testing reveals an increase in her glycated hemoglobin level from 7.1% to 8.5% (reference range, 4.3–5.6).\nThe patient is independent in all activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). She reports no difficulties obtaining food or medications but notes new challenges with adhering to her medications and recommended diet. When asked about recent life changes, she reports that 6 months ago, she moved in with her 92-year-old mother, who needs complete assistance with IADLs and partial assistance with ADLs such as bathing, dressing, and toileting, particularly overnight.\nDuring the encounter, the patient appears tired. She is screened for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and scores 3 out of 27 (a score ≥5 is positive).\nHer blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg, and her random blood glucose level is 250 mg/dL (reference range, &lt;140). All other vital signs and her physical examination are unremarkable.\nWhat is the most appropriate next step for this patient?",
