      "text": "A 36-year-old internal medicine resident at a teaching hospital notices that the head of her department has frequently been tired and irritable over the past 6 months. The physician in question has been known for his unorthodox teaching methods. His colleagues describe him as misanthropic and eccentric, but a brilliant diagnostician of rare diseases. One year ago, he had a vascular infarction of his right quadriceps femoris muscle while playing golf, and ever since has a limp and uses a cane to walk. He is recently divorced and does not have any children. Over the past 3 months, the resident has observed the physician secretly taking pills on several occasions. During this period, he has also stopped attending rounds and charting. He often meets his patients at odd hours and has a tendency to be absent for a prolonged duration without telling anyone of his whereabouts or answering his phone, which has led to numerous complaints by his colleagues. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action by the resident?",

Since then, he has had an 8-kg (18-lb) weight loss after changing to a vegetarian diet, regular swimming, and physical therapy. The pain worsens when he climbs stairs, which makes it increasingly difficult for him to reach his apartment located on the second floor. Over the last few weeks, he gradually increased the frequency of diclofenac intake but says that even a daily intake does not provide complete pain relief. The surgeon recommends a total hip arthroplasty for the patient. The orthopedic surgeon is a paid consultant and receives royalties from a company that recently developed a new total hip prosthetic system, and suggests using this specific new implant, citing its purportedly superior durability and range of motion based on the company's preliminary data.
