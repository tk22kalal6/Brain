During the visit, she admits to having only two friends on campus, which she attributes to being shy, which she says has been the case for as long as she can remember. She intentionally enrolls in large classes that do not require participation for fear of being criticized. She works part-time as a library shelver and has turned down promotions for a front desk position because she is afraid her coworkers will not like her. She lives alone because she is concerned that others will find her unappealing. The patient turns down invitations to parties to avoid being rejected by new people. She worries that she may not be able to find a boyfriend who thinks she is good enough. The patient most likely has which of the following primary diagnoses?",

He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games.

Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons.

For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon.” Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact.

He was promoted to manager at a sporting goods store 9 months ago and says that since then, his work has been a constant focus of his thoughts. He starts each morning by making a detailed list of tasks to complete throughout the day and frequently revises this list as priorities shift or tasks are completed. He often stays late after the store closes because he has not finished all the tasks on his list in time. He states, “I used to enjoy cooking in the evenings, but now I rarely have time because I’m always staying late; my employees just don’t do things as well as I do so I have to do them myself.” He says that he has always been very orderly. Except for being tired, he feels well and does not report any mood changes. Mental status examination shows no abnormalities. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities.
