      "solution": "<div><h4 style='color: #f87171; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>A) INCORRECT:</h4>Listing potential causes and asking the patient to confirm or deny them provides a structured framework for differential diagnosis. However, it leads with preconceived possibilities, potentially biasing responses and restricting the opportunity to identify the patient's actual concerns. This approach may overlook aspects of her symptom experience or psychosocial factors important for understanding her discomfort.</div><div><h4 style='color: #f87171; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>B) INCORRECT:</h4>Numeric <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=xN0EWg&anker=Zd673a3f7ee36023aab5a267899e984cc\" data-learningcard-id=\"xN0EWg\" data-anker=\"Zd673a3f7ee36023aab5a267899e984cc\" data-section-id=\"NBX-a00\">pain</a> scales <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=xN0EWg&anker=Z57a12017a3074fdfec8ec0e0428c7fc0\" data-learningcard-id=\"xN0EWg\" data-anker=\"Z57a12017a3074fdfec8ec0e0428c7fc0\" data-section-id=\"mBXVY00\">assess pain</a> intensity, useful for tracking changes over time.
