      "text": "An 89-year-old woman has stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer that has been progressing despite multimodal therapy. During the past few days, she has become increasingly dyspneic despite receipt of high-flow oxygen through a face mask. She now presents to a local emergency department in Oregon, where she lives, with severe respiratory distress and severe hypoxemia; respiratory arrest appears imminent. She is unable to respond to questions coherently.\nYou are able to access the patient's outpatient medical record. You verify that 6 months ago, the patient completed a living will and a POLST (portable orders for life-sustaining treatment) form indicating that she does not want to be intubated or placed on any life support if she is terminally ill, and she shared this decision with her primary care provider within the past several weeks. The patient chose not to complete a document appointing a durable power of attorney for health care.\nHer daughter is alarmed: She indicates that she knew nothing about the advance directive or the POLST form and that she has not explicitly discussed end-of-life decision-making with her mother. She requests that “everything be done, including intubation.”\nWhat is the most appropriate response to the daughter’s request?",
