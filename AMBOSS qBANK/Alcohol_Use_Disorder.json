Her most recent menstrual period was last week.\nDuring the interview, she expresses concern that her driver’s license may be suspended for recent traffic violations. She also notes that she was on the honor roll last year but is now getting Cs in school and thinks she may be failing at least one of her courses.\nOn physical examination, her blood pressure is 142/88 mm Hg, her heart rate is 98 beats per minute, her temperature is 37.1°C, and her BMI is 22.5. Her neurologic, cardiac, respiratory, and abdominal examinations are normal. She has a normal speech rate, and her thought pattern is linear and logical.

      "text": "A 17-year-old boy with gastroesophageal reflux disease presents for an annual visit. Interval history reveals that he failed two classes this year and will need to attend summer school for the first time. In addition, he was suspended for 3 days last month because of disruptive behavior at a school dance. When interviewed privately, he reveals that he was drinking alcohol before he got into an altercation with another student at the dance.\nUpon further questioning, he says that he sometimes has five or six drinks per evening. He answers “yes” to four out of six questions on the CRAFFT questionnaire and also reports that he requires an increasingly higher number of drinks to obtain the same level of intoxication.\nDespite considering himself a “social drinker,” he has started to drink after school as a “pick-me-up” before starting homework. He reports that his best friend has concerns about his drinking but that he himself is not concerned.\nIn addition to counseling this patient about not driving after drinking, which one of the following statements is the best approach for counseling this patient?",

To help address this, clinicians should use the <span data-sememe-id=\"11d2fK0\">Screening to Brief Intervention</span> (<span data-sememe-id=\"11d2fK0\">S2BI</span>) tool: https://nida.nih.gov/s2bi/#/ (or something similar) to ask all <span data-sememe-id=\"sT1tHT0\">adolescents</span> at their annual visit how frequently they have used various substances in the past year. If the answer is at least monthly for any substance, a more detailed assessment should be done using a validated tool such as <span data-sememe-id=\"sWdt5K0\">CRAFFT</span> (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Family/Friends, Trouble).<br><br>Once a diagnosis has been obtained, the clinician should decide whether the patient needs to enter a detoxification program right away. In this case, the patient has <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=h80cm3&anker=Z656bccd8ed32449ecfa1b3adb7bdb666\" data-learningcard-id=\"h80cm3\" data-anker=\"Z656bccd8ed32449ecfa1b3adb7bdb666\" data-sememe-id=\"Im0YSg\">alcohol use disorder</a>, and abstaining from all <span data-sememe-id=\"NoW-Xm0\">alcohol</span> use would be best, but he has not expressed a desire to change his drinking, and he is not at immediate risk. Recommending a detoxification program — or other services (such as psychosocial treatment, medication, or mutual help groups) — would therefore be premature. The clinician should make the patient aware of such options but only after a discussion about behavior change.<br><br>During the course of the conversation, the clinician should express concern for the patient’s health and ask <span data-sememe-id=\"0B1ezQ0\">open-ended questions</span> while providing clear information about the advantages of abstaining from <span data-sememe-id=\"NoW-Xm0\">alcohol</span> or working toward that by cutting down. To increase the chances of this conversation being successful, the clinician can incorporate principles of <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=PN0WYg&anker=Z8646c48a45fc958d20550a893b2e835d\" data-learningcard-id=\"PN0WYg\" data-anker=\"Z8646c48a45fc958d20550a893b2e835d\" data-section-id=\"MGWM-50\" data-sememe-id=\"Ctbqfv\">motivational interviewing</a>.<br><br>This nonjudgmental method of counseling communicates acceptance rather than reproach and supports conditions for change. One important aim is to encourage the patient to believe in the possibility of change while also making clear that the change is up to him and that the clinician is there as a partner to help with that change. If an <span data-sememe-id=\"sT1tHT0\">adolescent</span> is at risk of harming themselves, the parents or guardians should be involved as well.<br><br>If the patient decides to try abstinence, the clinician should assess the risk of <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=Jq0szS&anker=Z3dc72be27bb92d840fa7c55851b94a7e\" data-learningcard-id=\"Jq0szS\" data-anker=\"Z3dc72be27bb92d840fa7c55851b94a7e\" data-sememe-id=\"dlboDF\">alcohol withdrawal</a>, including the risk of <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=Jq0szS&anker=Za18ca20c28a5c5457ec778de2f57d9ce\" data-learningcard-id=\"Jq0szS\" data-anker=\"Za18ca20c28a5c5457ec778de2f57d9ce\" data-section-id=\"9i1NFg0\" data-sememe-id=\"iWaJOj\">delirium tremens</a>, and recommend the appropriate <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=1E02u3&anker=Z3f674575d121d52e8b10e463e2e21ea0\" data-learningcard-id=\"1E02u3\" data-anker=\"Z3f674575d121d52e8b10e463e2e21ea0\" data-sememe-id=\"qKWChm0\">level of care</a>.<br><br>Lifestyle changes are difficult to make, and patients usually take some time to muster the energy and commitment needed to give up an ingrained habit like drinking. Clinicians might feel frustrated by these delays and argue even more fervently for change, but this approach often backfires. Confronting unhealthy defenses, such as denial, at the outset of the discussion or providing a “simple” referral to treatment could be viewed negatively by the patient. Threats of negative health consequences are often experienced as argumentative and judgmental and are therefore counterproductive. A better approach is to provide education and foster an alliance that can be used to motivate change.<br><br><span class=\"wichtig\"><b>Key learning point:</b></span> The best intervention for people with <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=h80cm3&anker=Z656bccd8ed32449ecfa1b3adb7bdb666\" data-learningcard-id=\"h80cm3\" data-anker=\"Z656bccd8ed32449ecfa1b3adb7bdb666\" data-sememe-id=\"Im0YSg\">alcohol use disorder</a> who do not recognize their drinking as a problem is to express concern and provide clear advice regarding cutting back and abstinence.<br>\n<img src='https://media-us.amboss.com/media/thumbs/big_61a0a443d6758.jpg' alt='Explanation Image' style='width: 100%; border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 16px;'><div style='margin-top: 16px; border-top: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1); padding-top: 16px;'><h5 style='font-weight: bold; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7); margin-bottom: 8px;'>Image Description:</h5><div style='font-size: 0.9em; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.9); line-height: 1.6;'><p>– Precontemplation stage (*): The individual denies or is unaware there is a problem<br/>– Contemplation stage: The individual is aware there is a problem but not willing to make a change<br/>– Preparation stage: The individual is ready/preparing to make a change<br/>– Action stage: The individual demonstrates a change in behavior<br/>– Maintenance stage: The individual maintains the behavioral changes.
