The child is alert and cooperative but reports his ear feels “stuffed.” Otoscopy shows a smooth, spherical object at the inner end of the cartilaginous canal with an intact tympanic membrane. An initial attempt at removal using alligator forceps results in the marble moving deeper toward the isthmus. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
