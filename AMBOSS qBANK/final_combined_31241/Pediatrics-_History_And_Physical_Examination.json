He can run, open doors, climb onto furniture, and combine three words in a phrase such as “I want milk.” However, he struggles to climb stairs using alternate feet and does not recite his full name. Physical examination is normal.\nWhich of the following best describes this child’s motor and language skills?",

      "solution": "<div><h4 style='color: #34d399; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>A) CORRECT:</h4>By 27 months, children typically run, climb onto furniture, and form simple three-word phrases like 'I want milk.' These skills indicate appropriate gross motor and <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=b40H3T&anker=Ze5c4d7e93247696b1b2005b16990802f\" data-learningcard-id=\"b40H3T\" data-anker=\"Ze5c4d7e93247696b1b2005b16990802f\" data-section-id=\"WuXPJ-\" data-sememe-id=\"jeW_A40\">language development</a>. Alternating feet on stairs and reciting one's full name are milestones expected closer to age 3. The child's abilities align with developmental norms for his age.<br><br><span class=\"wichtig\"><b>Key learning point: </b></span>A 2-year-old child typically can run, open doors, climb onto furniture, and use 3-word sentences, but may not yet know their full name or climb stairs using alternate feet.</div><div><h4 style='color: #f87171; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>B) INCORRECT:</h4>At 27 months, children typically use two- to three-word phrases. Regular production of five-word sentences is expected closer to age 3. The child's language skills, including forming simple phrases, are appropriate for his age.</div><div><h4 style='color: #f87171; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>C) INCORRECT:</h4>Independent stair climbing with alternating feet is a milestone typically achieved closer to age 3. At 27 months, children may begin to use stairs with assistance, but fully coordinated alternating steps are not expected.</div><div><h4 style='color: #f87171; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>D) INCORRECT:</h4>At 27 months, running and climbing onto furniture are typical gross motor milestones. Difficulty with alternating feet on stairs is not unusual at this age, as this skill develops closer to age 3. The child's gross motor skills are appropriate for his age, and specialist evaluation is not warranted.</div>",
