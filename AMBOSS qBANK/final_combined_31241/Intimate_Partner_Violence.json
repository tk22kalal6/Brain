Throughout the interview, the patient makes very little eye contact with the physician. Her husband asks the physician to prescribe “something for her abdominal pain” so that they can return home. Examination of the patient shows mild bruising in the left infraorbital area and a right periorbital hematoma. When asked about her injuries, she quietly states that she fell while walking down the stairwell of her apartment complex. The husband reluctantly leaves the examination room when asked to by the physician. While alone with the physician, the patient admits that her husband is responsible for her injuries. Which of the following immediate responses by the physician is most appropriate?",
