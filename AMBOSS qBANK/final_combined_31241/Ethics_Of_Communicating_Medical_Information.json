He recently returned from a 6-month medical deployment to Indonesia. He appears tired. Physical examination shows nontender, enlarged, palpable cervical lymph nodes. An x-ray of the chest shows right-sided hilar lymphadenopathy. A sputum smear shows acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is made from PCR testing of the sputum. The patient requests that the physician does not inform anyone of this diagnosis because he is worried about losing his job.
