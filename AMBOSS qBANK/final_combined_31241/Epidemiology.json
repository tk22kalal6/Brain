      "text": "High-quality afterschool programming during childhood promotes long-term adult mental health\nBackground\nHigh-quality afterschool programming in children has been found to improve standardized test scores, dropout rates, and college attendance. The APPLE (Afterschool Programming for Psychiatric Long-term Endpoints) study seeks to examine the effect of such programs on long-term adult mental health.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nSocioeconomically disadvantaged children ages 5–10 were recruited for this study. Participants with a history of intellectual/developmental disability or existing psychiatric illness were excluded. Eligible families were identified by screening government social service agencies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and of all qualified families who were invited to participate in free afterschool enrichment activities for their children, 320 children were enrolled. The socioeconomic characteristics of study participants were found to be similar to those of the population being studied.\n160 children were randomly assigned to free afterschool enrichment activities and 160 to a waiting list that served as a control; the parents of 12 children declined participation after their children were randomly assigned to the control group. Of the 83 children participating in the study's 20-year follow-up, 62 were in the treatment group and 21 were in the control group.\nInterventions\nThe intervention involved free afterschool programming for the first three years of the study. The programming lasted three hours per day and was held five days per week, consisting of an hour of creative problem-based math/reading instruction supplemented with two hours of music, art, and athletic group activities. Children in the control group were placed on the waiting list for the intervention.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nData on the incidence of common DSM 5-validated mental health conditions was collected at the study's 20-year follow-up evaluation and confirmed by chart review.\nResults\nTable - Association of major depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder at 20-year follow-up of participants who received afterschool enrichment during childhood*.\n*Adjusted for income and family history of psychiatric illness.\n\n\n\nMajor Depressive Disorder\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n\n\n\nRelative Risk (95% CI) \nP -value\nRelative Risk (95% CI)\nP -value\n\n\nControl\n1.0 [reference]\n--\n1.0 [reference]\n--\n\n\nAfterschool Enrichment\n0.69 (0.59–0.87)\n&lt; 0.001\n0.80 (0.74–0.92)\n0.02\n\n\n\n\n\nBipolar Disorder (I or II) without Psychosis\nAny Psychotic Disorder\n\n\n\nRelative Risk (95% CI)\nP -value\nRelative Risk (95% CI)\nP -value\n\n\nControl\n1.0 [reference]\n-- \n1.0 [reference] \n--\n\n\nAfterschool Enrichment\n0.64 (0.59–1.35)\n0.34\n\n0.84 (0.51–1.23) \n0.22\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study highlights the potential of high-quality afterschool programming during childhood in promoting long-term adult mental health.\nSource of funding: Wisconsin Children's Mental Health Foundation, National Early Childhood Education Coalition\n\nAn 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child examination at a clinic for low-income residents. Although her son's elementary school offers free afterschool programming, her son has not been interested in attending. The son's maternal grandmother has schizophrenia. The mother is inquiring about the benefits of afterschool programming and asks for the physician's input. Based on the study results, which of the following statements best addresses the mother's question?",

      "text": "Predictors of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in HIV-positive adults\nBackground:\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer commonly seen in HIV-positive patients. It is also the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States. Given that the risk profile for DLBCL remains unclear, this study seeks to identify predictors of DLBCL.\nMethods:\nData was obtained via retrospective chart review at a major tertiary academic medical center in California in 2017. A total of 9,820 adults with HIV diagnoses between 2000 and 2002 and subsequently started on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) were identified. Data on demographics and antiretroviral regimen were obtained. The prevalence of DLBCL cases in the cohort, as of 2017, was obtained via chart review. Medication adherence was assessed by analyzing pharmacy claims linked to patient charts and calculating a Medication Possession Rate (MPR), the total amount of time a medication was dispensed to patients divided by treatment period. Patients with a past or present history of cancer preceding HIV diagnosis, as well as missing data on key variables, were excluded from analysis.\nResults:\nThis study included 219 cases (DLBCL) and 7,872 controls (no DLBCL). The average age of patients at the time of diagnosis was 58. Risk factors for DLBCL are shown in the table below with adjustment for covariates.\nTable – Model showing impact of risk factors on DLBCL in HIV-positive patients\n\n\n\nRelative risk (95% CI)\nP-value\n\n\nAge\n\n0.11\n\n\nAge &lt; 55\nReference\n\n\n\nAge ≥ 55\n1.21 (0.96-1.48)\n\n\n\nBiological sex\n\n0.02\n\n\nFemale\nReference\n\n\n\nMale\n1.08 (1.01-1.19)\n\n\n\nIncome (per capita, per year)\n\n0.04\n\n\n&lt; $30,000\nReference\n\n\n\n$30,000–$90,000\n0.87 (0.78-0.99)\n\n\n\n&gt; $90,000\n0.88 (0.79-0.97)\n\n\n\nFamily history of cancer\n\n0.08\n\n\nNo family history\nReference\n\n\n\nFamily history of cancer\n1.35 (0.93-1.43)\n\n\n\ncART adherence (measured via MPR)*\n\n0.03\n\n\nLow\nReference\n\n\n\nHigh\n0.69 (0.62-0.87)\n\n\n\n*Thresholds (low versus high) for MPR are based on established cutoffs in the literature.\nConclusions:\nOur study identified a number of risk factors that significantly contribute to DLBCL risk in HIV-positive adults.\nSource of funding: Not stated\n\nA 63-year-old HIV-positive man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. Four years ago, he was diagnosed with HIV and was started on cART therapy. He tells the physician that he has been having difficulty adhering to his medication regimen. He has been unemployed for the past couple of years and relies on unemployment benefits to cover the costs of daily living. His father died of lymphoma at the age of 60 years. He had recently heard about the results of the study featured in the abstract and wants more information about his risk of developing DLBCL. Based on the study, which of the following is the strongest risk factor for the development of DLBCL in HIV-positive patients with a similar profile as this patient?",

      "text": "Predictors of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in HIV-positive adults\nBackground:\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer commonly seen in HIV-positive patients. It is also the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States. Given that the risk profile for DLBCL remains unclear, this study seeks to identify predictors of DLBCL.\nMethods:\nData were obtained via retrospective chart review at a major tertiary academic medical center in California in 2017. A total of 9,820 adults with HIV diagnoses between 2000 and 2002 and subsequently started on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) were identified. Data on demographics and antiretroviral regimen were obtained. The prevalence of DLBCL cases in the cohort, as of 2017, was obtained via chart review. Medication adherence was assessed by analyzing pharmacy claims linked to patient charts and calculating a Medication Possession Rate (MPR), the total amount of time a medication was dispensed to patients divided by treatment period. Patients with a past or present history of cancer preceding HIV diagnosis, as well as missing data on key variables, were excluded from analysis.\nResults:\nThis study included 219 cases (DLBCL) and 7,872 controls (no DLBCL). The average age of patients at the time of diagnosis was 58. Risk factors for DLBCL are shown in the table below with adjustment for covariates.\nTable – Model showing impact of risk factors on DLBCL in HIV-positive patients\n\n\n\nRelative risk (95% CI)\nP-value\n\n\nAge\n\n0.11\n\n\nAge &lt; 55\nReference\n\n\n\nAge ≥ 55\n1.21 (0.96-1.48)\n\n\n\nBiological sex\n\n0.02\n\n\nFemale\nReference\n\n\n\nMale\n1.08 (1.01-1.19)\n\n\n\nIncome (per capita, per year)\n\n0.04\n\n\n&lt; $30,000\nReference\n\n\n\n$30,000–$90,000\n0.87 (0.78-0.99)\n\n\n\n&gt; $90,000\n0.88 (0.79-0.97)\n\n\n\nFamily history of cancer\n\n0.08\n\n\nNo family history\nReference\n\n\n\nFamily history of cancer\n1.35 (0.93-1.43)\n\n\n\n\ncART adherence (measured via MPR)*\n\n0.03\n\n\nLow\nReference\n\n\n\nHigh\n0.69 (0.62-0.87)\n\n\n\n*Thresholds (low versus high) for MPR are based on established cutoffs in the literature.\nConclusions:\nOur study identified a number of risk factors that significantly contribute to DLBCL risk in HIV-positive adults.\nSource of funding: Not stated\n\nThe authors of the study have decided to conduct a follow-up analysis of their data. They decide to stratify their results by CD4+ T-lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis. Among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01). However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36). Which of the following explains the difference observed between the two strata?",

      "hint": "In the crude analysis, high cART adherence was associated with a decreased risk of developing DLBCL. After stratification of the data for CD4+ cell counts at time of diagnosis, this association is only seen in patients with low CD4+ cell counts, while the association can no longer be found in patients with high CD4+ cell counts. Therefore, the impact of cART adherence appears to be affected by CD4+ cell count.",

The researchers examine the medical records to determine whether the patients who were actively using cocaine were more likely to have developed syphilis over a 6-month period. The study ultimately finds that the rate of syphilis was 30% higher in patients who actively used cocaine compared to patients who had never used cocaine.

The first group was enrolled in a patient navigation program and attended monthly meetings, where they were given regular reminders that their adherence to screening guidelines was being evaluated. The second group did not participate in the patient navigation program. Colonoscopy rates were assessed via chart review and showed that 90% of participants in the first group and 34% of people in the second group adhered to screening guidelines.

Three hundred patients who received TAVR and another 300 patients who received SAVR were followed for 5 years and monitored for cardiovascular symptoms and all-cause mortality. The study found that patients who received TAVR had a higher risk of death at the end of a 5-year follow-up period (HR = 1.21, p &lt; 0.001). Later, the researchers performed a subgroup analysis by adjusting their data for ejection fraction.

At a departmental grand rounds she recently attended, one of the presenters claimed that smokers are only at increased risk for Barrett esophagus in the presence of acid reflux. She decides to design a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between smoking and Barrett esophagus. After comparing 400 smokers to 400 non-smokers identified via chart review, she finds that smokers were at increased risk of Barrett esophagus at the end of a 10-year follow-up period (RR = 1.82, p &lt; 0.001). Among patients with a history of acid reflux, there was no relationship between smoking and Barrett esophagus (p = 0.52). Likewise, no relationship was found between smoking and Barrett esophagus among patients without a history of acid reflux (p = 0.48). The relative risk value of 1.82 in this study is best explained by which of the following?",

The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection.

A total of 125 participants with autism and mean age of 12 years were recruited for the study and took part in weekly social skills training sessions for 3 months. Participants were recruited from support groups in a large US city for parents with autistic children. Parents in the support group were very eager to volunteer for the study, and over 300 children were placed on a waiting list while the study was conducted. At baseline and at the end of the 3-month period, participants were observed during a videotaped social play exercise and scored on a social interaction rating scale by their parents. Social interaction rating scores following the 3-month intervention were more than twice as high as baseline scores (p &lt; 0.001). During exit interviews, one parent commented, &quot;I knew from the start that this program was going to be life-changing for my son!&quot; This sentiment was echoed by a number of other parents.

Three-hundred eligible patients with SMM are randomized to receive 6 cycles of either pomalidomide or a placebo. At the 24-month follow-up, the investigators find that a significant number of patients were not adherent with the treatment assigned or lost to follow-up. Nonetheless, results for the patients who completed the protocol showed that pomalidomide improves progression-free survival. The investigators are worried about potential biases resulting from the significant loss to follow-up and nonadherence in the treatment group. Which of the following is the most appropriate technique to minimize selection bias and provide the most valid estimate of the real effect of pomalidomide on patients with SMM?",

These patients are randomized to receive either the new drug or placebo for a period of one week. The primary endpoint of the trial is the time to resolution of symptoms from the onset of therapy and the secondary endpoint is the splenic volume as measured by ultrasonography one month after initiating therapy. At the end of the study, the mean differences of endpoint measures in each arm are determined and evaluated using t-statistics. For analysis, the investigators decide to exclude patients from both arms who did not adhere to the treatment protocol or dropped out of the study.

The first subgroup receives questionnaires that assess the knowledge transfer of evidence-based medicine. The second subgroup receives questionnaires that explore the strategic approaches for the application of evidence-based medicine in the physicians' clinics. Both questionnaires contain a set of 10 questions. The physicians respond to each question by writing out short answers in a comment field. On day 2 of the conference, the replies to the questionnaires are anonymized and discussed within the subgroups. On day 3, both subgroups present their key takeaways. After the conference, an article with a summary of the findings is published in a national journal and the physicians decide to repeat the conference after 1 year to evaluate for changes over time.

A statistician performs a sample size calculation. Two hundred men between 30 and 50 years of age with central serous chorioretinopathy need to be recruited and randomized to receive either routine care or meditation training with routine care for 6 months. The primary endpoint of the trial is the decrease in subretinal fluid measured with optical coherence tomography after 2, 4, and 6 months. The study protocol is reviewed and approved by an institutional review board. An ophthalmologist unaffiliated with the research group learns about the planned study from an online registry of clinical trials for participant recruitment. She recommends lowering the inclusion criteria for participants to 25 years of age because she recently read an article on the increasing incidence of serous chorioretinopathy in younger men. The research group agrees and decides to adjust the study protocol accordingly.

The efficacy and safety of the new vaccine have been demonstrated in a prior phase 2 trial sponsored by the same company. The researchers are conducting a trial in community hospitals in 350 towns. Each hospital is randomly assigned to administer either the standard vaccine or the new vaccine. All staff, patients, and visitors at each hospital are invited to enroll in the study. The data is collected by nurses who have full insight into the study protocol, including which group the hospital belongs to, and they transfer the data to the evaluating researchers who also have full insight into the protocol. Because they must keep records of potential side effects, the physician assistants administering the vaccines are also informed about which vaccines the participants are given. The participants are not informed about which of the two vaccines they receive. The endpoint is to compare the efficacy of the new vaccine to the standard vaccine and to form a hypothesis about its effect on herd immunity in immunocompromised individuals.

      "text": "A clinical trial is performed to assess the efficacy of a dietary supplement in decreasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Eight hundred white men between 40 and 60 years of age without preexisting illnesses are randomly assigned to receive the dietary supplement or placebo. After following the subjects for 10 years, the results of the trial show no statistically significant difference in the risk of developing T2DM between the subjects receiving the supplement and the group receiving the placebo. One year later, the researchers receive another grant and decide to further analyze the data collected during the trial. They now categorize the participants into 7 groups according to the participants' fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at the beginning of the trial. One group is categorized as FPG &lt; 70 mg/dL; the other study participants are divided into 6 groups according to the following value ranges: 70–74 mg/dL, 75–79 mg/dL, 80–84 mg/dL, 85–89 mg/dL, 90–94 mg/dL, and 95–99 mg/dL. The researchers observe that subjects with an FPG of 95–99 mg/dL who took the supplement had a 4% lower risk of developing T2DM compared to subjects in this category who took the placebo. The result was statistically significant. Which of the following is the most accurate reason for questioning the internal validity of the supplement's efficacy analysis among subjects with an FPG of 95–99 mg/dL?",

He has begun vomiting and has had a fever for the past 4 hours. He is approached about participating in a research study of patients being evaluated for appendicitis, and he consents.\nThe goal of the study is to validate a new “serum protein Y” measurement to diagnose appendicitis. The investigators will recruit patients presenting with abdominal pain and measure their level of “serum protein Y” using point-of-care methodology. The outcome of whether appendicitis was present or not will be established by validation based on experts’ retrospective review of the clinical, laboratory, and imaging data as well as histopathologic examination of the appendix in patients who undergo appendectomy. These data will be used to establish whether the point-of-care test for “serum protein Y” may be useful in diagnosing appendicitis preoperatively.\nThe patient is informed that participating in the study will not provide any benefit to the patient but that the results may benefit future patients.\nDuring the patient’s evaluation, an abdominal CT scan reveals mild thickening of the appendix with signs of surrounding inflammation. He is scheduled for urgent surgical exploration of the appendix. In the meantime, as part of the study protocol, a research assistant obtains a drop of blood with a fingerstick and brings the sample back to the research laboratory (next to the emergency department) where the “serum protein Y” test is done using point-of-care technology. The result returns very low, which the investigators have hypothesized may indicate low risk for appendicitis. The research assistant enters the result into the study database for future analysis. The patient continues to await his surgery.\nAt the current time, who should the research assistant inform about the results of the experimental test?",

Since this diagnosis, the patient has instituted lifestyle changes and has been taking metformin 500 mg twice daily; he developed nausea on higher doses. His most recent glycated hemoglobin level is 6.7% (reference range, 4.3–5.6).\nDuring the visit, he asks about the prognosis of his diabetes. He is specifically concerned about whether his condition might worsen over time and require more-intense interventions, such as insulin therapy.\nIn a search for information to answer the patient’s question, which one of the following study designs would be most likely to yield useful data on the long-term prognosis of a common condition such as type 2 diabetes?",

      "text": "A 38-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and a BMI of 46 is interested in bariatric surgery to help with weight loss and the management of his comorbid conditions. He began gaining significant weight as a young teenager and has since cycled between dieting, weight loss, and rebound weight gain. He asks whether you think bariatric surgery would provide a longer lasting weight-loss solution.\nLooking for answers to his question, you find the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) study, a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study designed to evaluate the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on the health and wellness of patients with severe obesity. LABS researchers enrolled adults with obesity who were about to undergo first-time bariatric surgery (either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB\\] or gastric banding) and followed them over time with serial measurements of outcomes related to weight loss and remission of comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\nThe 7-year outcomes of the study showed that participants had sustained weight loss — as well as a reduced prevalence of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia — compared with baseline. In a subgroup analysis, those who had undergone gastric banding had significantly lower rates of diabetes remission than those who had undergone RYGB.\nWhat is a common limitation with this type of study design?",

He has begun vomiting and has had a fever for the past 4 hours. He is approached about participating in a research study of patients being evaluated for appendicitis, and he and his father consent.\nThe goal of the study is to validate a new “serum protein Y” measurement to diagnose appendicitis. The investigators will recruit patients presenting with abdominal pain and measure their level of “serum protein Y” using point-of-care methodology. The outcome of whether appendicitis was present or not will be established by validation based on experts’ retrospective review of the clinical, laboratory, and imaging data as well as histopathologic examination of the appendix in patients who undergo appendectomy. These data will be used to establish whether the point-of-care test for “serum protein Y” may be useful in diagnosing appendicitis preoperatively.\nThe patient and his father are informed that participating in the study will not provide any benefit to the patient but that the results may benefit future patients.\nDuring the patient’s evaluation, an abdominal CT scan reveals mild thickening of the appendix with signs of surrounding inflammation. He is scheduled for urgent surgical exploration of the appendix. As part of the study protocol, a research assistant obtains a drop of blood with a fingerstick and brings the sample back to the research laboratory (next to the emergency department) where the “serum protein Y” test is done using point-of-care technology. The result returns very low, which the investigators have hypothesized may indicate low risk for appendicitis. The research assistant enters the result into the study database for future analysis.\nAt the current time, who should the research assistant inform about the results of the experimental test?",

      "text": "A 16-year-old boy presents for follow-up shortly after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. He has a long history of obesity, with a current BMI of 45. For the past 3 years, he has engaged in an exercise program and attempted to diet by restricting calories and following various supervised weight-loss programs. Although he lost some weight with these interventions, he quickly regained it. With his new diabetes diagnosis, both he and his parents are increasingly concerned about the effect of his weight on his health. They ask you whether bariatric surgery could provide a longer-lasting weight-loss solution and reverse his diabetes diagnosis.\nIn looking for answers to their question, you find a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study that enrolled adults and adolescents with obesity who were about to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. The participants were followed longitudinally with serial measurements of outcomes related to weight loss and to remission of comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\nThe 5-year outcomes of that trial showed that adolescents seemed to derive similar benefits to adults, with maintenance of weight loss at 5 years.\nWhat is a common limitation with this type of study design?",

      "text": "A clinician working in gastroenterology is interested in the relationship between smoking and the incidence of Barrett esophagus. At a departmental grand rounds she recently attended, one of the presenters claimed that smokers are only at increased risk for Barrett esophagus in the presence of acid reflux. She decides to design a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between smoking and Barrett esophagus. After comparing 400 smokers to 400 non-smokers identified via chart review, she finds that smokers were at increased risk of Barrett esophagus at the end of a 10-year follow-up period (RR = 1.82, p &lt; 0.001). Among patients with a history of acid reflux, there was no relationship between smoking and Barrett esophagus (p = 0.52). Likewise, no relationship was found between smoking and Barrett esophagus among patients without a history of acid reflux (p = 0.48). The relative risk value of 1.82 in this study is best explained by which of the following?",

He is approached about participating in a research study of patients being evaluated for appendicitis, and he consents. The goal of the study is to validate a new point-of-care test measuring “serum protein Y” to diagnose appendicitis in patients presenting with abdominal pain. The outcome of whether appendicitis was present will be established by validation based on experts’ retrospective review of the clinical, laboratory, and imaging data as well as histopathologic examination of the appendix in patients who undergo appendectomy. These data will be used to establish whether the test for “serum protein Y” may be useful in diagnosing appendicitis preoperatively. The patient is informed that participating in the study will not provide any benefit to himself but that the results may benefit future patients. During the patient’s evaluation, an abdominal CT scan reveals mild thickening of the appendix with signs of surrounding inflammation. He is scheduled for urgent surgical exploration of the appendix. As part of the study protocol, a research assistant obtains a drop of blood with a fingerstick. The result of the “serum protein Y” returns very low, which the investigators have hypothesized may indicate low risk for appendicitis. The research assistant enters the result into the study database for future analysis. The patient continues to await his surgery. At the current time, who of the following should the research assistant inform about the results of the experimental test?",

For the past 3 years, he has engaged in an exercise program and attempted to diet by restricting calories and following various supervised weight-loss programs. Although he lost some weight with these interventions, he quickly regained it. With his new diabetes diagnosis, both he and his parents are increasingly concerned about the effect of his weight on his health. They ask the physician whether bariatric surgery could provide a longer-lasting weight-loss solution and reverse his diabetes diagnosis. In looking for answers to their question, the physician finds a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study that enrolled adults and adolescents with obesity who were about to undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The participants were followed longitudinally with serial measurements of outcomes related to weight loss and remission of comorbid conditions. The 5-year outcomes of that trial showed that adolescents seemed to derive similar benefits to adults, with maintenance of weight loss at 5 years. Which of the following is a common limitation with this type of study design?",
