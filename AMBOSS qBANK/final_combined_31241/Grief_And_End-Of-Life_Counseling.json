The symptoms have been occurring since her husband died in a car accident. Before eventually falling asleep, she stays awake for multiple hours and has crying spells.

She has no suicidal ideation. She is alert and oriented. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

She feels well physically but reports difficulty sleeping and feelings of emptiness and sadness since her wife died from breast cancer 6 weeks ago. Sometimes when she thinks of her wife, she suddenly starts crying. The patient says, “I feel bad for not taking proper care of her before she passed. She might have been in pain, and I didn't notice it. I wish I could talk to her on the other side to tell her how much I want to be with her again.” The patient reports that sometimes while falling asleep, she sees her wife sitting next to her bed and smiling at her, but she knows that it is just her imagination. She goes to bed late and always wakes before her alarm, but does not feel tired during the day. She has a good relationship with her son and moved to his home 3 weeks ago because her apartment felt empty without her wife. She enjoys gardening and attends a chess club 3 days per week. On some days, she almost forgets about her wife's death, which makes her feel guilty. She has had a 2-kg (4.4-lb) weight loss over the past month that she attributes to reduced appetite. She denies suicidal ideation. On mental status examination, she has a full range of affect. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

However, such a statement should only be made after appropriate steps have been taken to set up the interview. Not doing so may lead to interruptions, disruption of privacy, failure to establish rapport with the patient, difficulties communicating the gravity and consequences of the situation to the patient, and a setting in which the patient feels uncomfortable and may not receive the opportunity to ask questions. While it may be warranted to deliver serious news over the phone in certain situations (e.g., contacting a <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=7u04s3&anker=Z4202174d5e3b34e2b7b4ffb230604938\" data-learningcard-id=\"7u04s3\" data-anker=\"Z4202174d5e3b34e2b7b4ffb230604938\" data-section-id=\"ZXdZ9o0\" data-sememe-id=\"I3bYPt\">surrogate decision-maker</a> in an emergency setting), it is generally preferable to have such conversations in person.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=UH0bph&anker=Z2d09b0551e56f76f2ad93c45480f25ed\" data-learningcard-id=\"UH0bph\" data-anker=\"Z2d09b0551e56f76f2ad93c45480f25ed\" data-section-id=\"1w123Q0\">Breaking bad news</a> is a complicated and challenging task.
