      "text": "A 76-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for evaluation of progressive cognitive decline and a 1-year history of incontinence. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease 5 years ago. The daughter reports that in the past year, her mother has become nonambulatory, can speak only a few intelligible words, and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. Over the past year, she has had decreased appetite and progressive dysphagia, resulting in a 12-kg (26-lb) weight loss. She has been hospitalized three times for aspiration pneumonia, and her diet now consists only of puréed food. She has no advance directives. The daughter says that she does not want her mother to return to the hospital again, but she is concerned about her ability to continue providing care alone. The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include amlodipine and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. She appears malnourished but well groomed. The patient is oriented only to self. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 0/30, and Functional Assessment Staging Tool scale is 7/7. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, TSH, and vitamin B12 are within the reference ranges. Her serum albumin concentration is 3 g/dL. Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

For the past 2 years, the patient failed to respond to multiple chemotherapy cycles. He was previously independent but now lives with his son and requires assistance with all activities of daily living. His son says that his father's condition “is deteriorating every day” and that he “cannot cope with the stress of taking care of him anymore.” The patient has had progressive loss of mobility and worsening pain for the past 6 months. During this time, he also has had decreased appetite, poor oral intake, and a 15-kg (33-lb) weight loss. He spends most of the day in bed and cannot tolerate walking without aid. Current medications include acetaminophen, oxycodone, and a fentanyl patch. He appears pale and malnourished. He is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination shows marked tenderness along the spine. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows multiple well-demarcated lesions in both lungs and in several vertebrae. The patient has no living will and says he wants to &quot;die in peace.&quot; The physician, son, and the rest of the patient's family agree to start hospice care.

She reports that her mother has been bedridden for the past 3 months and started sleeping in an upright position in the last few days. Two months ago, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed because the patient was unable to feed herself. For the past day, she refuses to drink water or to be fed through the PEG tube. Medications include morphine, magnesium hydroxide, metoclopramide, and dexamethasone. The patient appears cachectic. Pulse is 85/min, respiratory rate is 11/min, and blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. The skin overlying the PEG catheter appears well perfused with no tenderness to palpation and no purulent discharge. Lungs are clear to auscultation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's breathlessness?",

However, he has recently required increasing amounts of as-needed morphine, because of increased pain related to progression of bone metastases.\nHis wife notes that he has been confused “on and off” for the past few days and that he has not been sleeping well. He has been getting up at night and shouting at people who are not there.\nOn physical examination, the patient is alert, oriented only to person, and extremely distractible. The remainder of his physical examination, including vital signs, is normal. There are no neurologic abnormalities aside from the mental status changes already noted and no signs or symptoms of infection.\nThe complete blood count, serum creatinine level, and electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Liver enzyme levels are slightly abnormal but unchanged from 2 months ago.\nWhich one of the following strategies is the most appropriate next step in this patient’s care?",

      "text": "A 62-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer presents for management of bone pain secondary to metastases.\nHistory of Present Illness: The patient has a history of lung cancer, complicated by pulmonary embolism, which is being treated with appropriate chemotherapy. He is tolerating chemotherapy well; his main complaint is severe back pain due to known metastases to the spine.\nHe has received intravenous zoledronic acid and radiation treatment for his bone metastases. Despite these interventions, his bone pain has been worsening for 2 months. He is worried about the amount of pain medication he is taking and says he does not want to “get addicted to painkillers.”\nCurrent Medications: In addition to chemotherapy, the patient is currently receiving:\n\nImmediate-release oxycodone 10 mg every 4 hours as needed\nCelecoxib 200 mg daily\nAcetaminophen 500 mg up to five times daily\nEnoxaparin\n\nThe patient reports that he has required the as-needed oxycodone at the maximal frequency, every 4 hours, throughout the entire day (60 mg per day) to achieve moderate pain control. If he waits more than 4 hours, his pain becomes unbearable. He must set his alarm throughout the night to take his pain medications on schedule.\nReview of Opioid Safety Data: The patient has no significant risk factors for opioid misuse and has not shown any worrisome medication-related behaviors.\nWhich one of the following pain-management strategies is the most appropriate next step for this patient?",

      "text": "An 80-year-old woman with a history of advanced dementia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cigarette smoking (40 pack-years) is found to have an elevated bilirubin level during a routine laboratory workup.\nFive months ago, she was intubated in the intensive care unit after presenting with altered mental status and urosepsis. She subsequently developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and was eventually transferred to a nursing facility for rehabilitation. During the past 3 months, she has lost 13.6 kg.\nOn physical examination, she is bedbound, has scleral icterus, and has tenderness in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant; the liver edge is irregular. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy feeding tube is visible in the epigastrium.\nLaboratory testing yields the following results:\n\n\n\nPatient value\nReference range\n\n\nHemoglobin (g/dL)\n9.1\n12.0–16.0\n\n\nCalcium (mg/dL)\n8.1\n9.0–10.5\n\n\nAlbumin (g/dL)\n2.5\n3.5–5.5\n\n\nCreatinine (mg/dL)\n1.8\n0.6–1.1\n\n\nTotal bilirubin (mg/dL)\n5.0\n0.3–1.0\n\n\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/liter)\n300\n30–120\n\n\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/liter)\n140\n0–35\n\n\nUrinalysis shows 3 white cells per high-power field (reference range, 0–2) and 1+ leukocyte esterase, with no bacteria or nitrites.\nA CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis reveals bulky lymphadenopathy, multiple hepatic lesions suggestive of metastatic disease, and a dilated biliary tree. A chest radiograph shows bilateral pulmonary nodules. A CT-guided biopsy of the upper abdominal mass shows a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.\nWhat is the most appropriate next step in this patient's care?",

On physical examination, he has a rigid abdomen and reports severe aching pain that he rates at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10.\nA CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows a bowel perforation related to toxic megacolon. Laboratory testing reveals a serum lactate level of 9.6 mmol/liter (reference range, 0.6–1.7), a leukocyte count of 34,000 per mm3 (4500–11,000), and a serum creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL (0.8–1.3).\nAfter urgent consultation with a colorectal surgeon, the patient declines surgery, vasopressors, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and asks to take a comfort-focused approach to his care. He has never taken opioids before.\nWhich one of the following strategies is the most appropriate initial choice to manage this patient’s pain?",

He has been taking morphine at home for his cancer pain, but the pain has escalated to the point that his oral opioids are no longer effective. In the emergency department, he reports a pain score of 10 out of 10. He is started on intravenous morphine boluses at a dose that is equianalgesic to his oral regimen and is admitted to the floor.\nOn initial examination, he reports that he has had so much pain during the past week that he has not been able to eat or drink much, and during the past 3 days, he has had some pronounced twitches in his arms and legs. He says the morphine boluses have been only moderately effective for his pain, which he now rates as a 7 out of 10.\nPhysical examination reveals 2-beat myoclonus of the feet and 3+ reflexes of the bilateral brachioradialis sites.\nHis laboratory results demonstrate a serum creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL (baseline, 0.9; reference range, 0.8–1.3).\nWhat is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient’s pain?",

He has a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (35%), asthma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, insomnia, mild dementia, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. This is his third hospital admission in the past 6 months, with previous admissions for acute decompensated heart failure complicated by a sacral pressure injury.\nPhysical examination is remarkable for 1+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. The patient scores a 19 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (a score ≥26 is considered normal). Screening for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method is negative, as is a depression screen.\nLaboratory testing including urinalysis is unremarkable. Radiographs reveal no fractures or injuries.\nThe patient’s family shares that he has been living alone for the past 2 years, since the death of his partner, and that he has had a gradual progressive decline and increasing weakness during that time. He has lost 14 kg during the past 6 months, without any episodes of choking or coughing during meals. He could previously ambulate in the house with a walker but now prefers to use a wheelchair and needs assistance with bathing and dressing. He also started wearing protective underwear because of urinary incontinence, which he attributes to his use of a diuretic medication and difficulty getting to the bathroom in time.\nHe expresses a strong wish to remain in his home and avoid a nursing home stay, even for short-term rehabilitation, stating that his quality of life at home is his top priority. His daughter, who is his health care proxy, lives more than an hour’s drive away and worries that he may not have enough support at home. She asks about care options.\nWhich one of the following recommendations is most appropriate for this patient?",

The daughter reports that her father's condition has been slowly deteriorating over the past 2 months. His seizures have been poorly controlled despite maximal medical therapy. He has had progressive loss of mobility, a decrease in executive function, and worsening pain. The patient has Medicaid insurance. Current medications include high-dose corticosteroids and immediate-release opioid analgesics. The need for increased assistance has been distressing to the family, and they are concerned about the patient's overall comfort. The daughter asks about her father's eligibility for hospice care. Which of the following responses about this model of care is most appropriate?",
