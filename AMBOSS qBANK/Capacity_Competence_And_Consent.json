She has had previous episodes of abdominal pain that lasted for 10–15 minutes and resolved with antacids. She lives with her daughter and grandchildren. She divorced her husband last year. She is alert and oriented. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 134/min, and blood pressure is 101/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is rigid and diffusely tender. Guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Rectal examination shows a collapsed rectum. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun, and a CT scan of the abdomen shows intestinal perforation. The surgeon discusses the need for emergency exploratory laparotomy with the patient, and she agrees to it. Written informed consent is obtained. While in the holding area awaiting transport to the operating room, she calls for the surgeon and informs him that she no longer wants the surgery. He explains the risks of not performing the surgery to her, and she indicates that she understands and is adamant about not proceeding with surgery. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

He has a history of using intravenous heroin but has not used illicit drugs for the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 2-cm soft, lobulated, mobile swelling on the right side of the upper back. The mass slips away from the fingers when its edges are palpated. Healed track marks are present in the bilateral antecubital fossae. The patient is told that the mass on his back is most likely a lipoma, a benign mass consisting of fat tissue that does not require any further treatment. He is aware of the diagnosis and wants the lipoma removed for cosmetic reasons. Four months ago, he had asked another physician to remove it, but the physician refused to perform the procedure since he did not consider it necessary. The patient is counseled regarding the potential benefits and risks of the excision and that there is a chance of recurrence. His parents ask the physician not to perform the excision.

During the past few days, she has become increasingly dyspneic despite receipt of high-flow oxygen through a face mask. She now presents to a local emergency department in Oregon, where she lives, with severe respiratory distress and severe hypoxemia; respiratory arrest appears imminent. She is unable to respond to questions coherently.\nYou are able to access the patient's outpatient medical record. You verify that 6 months ago, the patient completed a living will and a POLST (portable orders for life-sustaining treatment) form indicating that she does not want to be intubated or placed on any life support if she is terminally ill, and she shared this decision with her primary care provider within the past several weeks. The patient chose not to complete a document appointing a durable power of attorney for health care.\nHer daughter is alarmed: She indicates that she knew nothing about the advance directive or the POLST form and that she has not explicitly discussed end-of-life decision-making with her mother. She requests that “everything be done, including intubation.”\nWhat is the most appropriate response to the daughter’s request?",

His daughter, who is his documented health care proxy, says that this lack of follow-up is because he believes regular exercise and a nutritious diet are enough to keep him healthy.\nHis daughter reports that he lives alone and has been increasingly forgetful during the past few years. Although he has not had a formal workup of his cognition because of his consistent desire to avoid the health care system, his daughter has been increasingly taking over his affairs, such as finances and cooking. She states that he is at his cognitive baseline today.\nOn evaluation, he is alert and oriented to self, place, and time. He can follow the conversation and maintain his attention throughout the interview and examination. He recites the months of the year backwards without issue but is unable to complete a Mini-Cog (clock-drawing test and delayed recall of three words).\nHis initial vital signs are notable for a temperature of 37.7°C and an oxygen saturation of 89% while he breathes ambient air. Combination positron emission tomography and CT shows no evidence of a pulmonary embolism but reveals a large, spiculated mass in the right middle lobe, concerning for a malignancy.\nThe patient is evaluated by a consulting pulmonologist who recommends a transbronchial biopsy to better evaluate the mass. When you discuss this recommendation with the patient, he tells you that he does not want the procedure done because he knows the mass is “nothing serious.” He believes that the mass is not cancerous and explains, “I haven’t done anything to give myself cancer.” He says that the mass will go away on its own.

She is alert and oriented. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 134/min, and blood pressure is 101/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is rigid and diffusely tender. Guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Rectal examination shows a collapsed rectum. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun, and a CT scan of the abdomen shows intestinal perforation. The clinician discusses the need for emergency exploratory laparotomy with the patient, and she agrees to it. Written informed consent is obtained. While in the holding area awaiting transport to the operating room, she calls for the clinician and informs him that she no longer wants the surgery. He explains the risks of not performing the surgery to her, and she indicates that she understands and is adamant about not proceeding with surgery.
