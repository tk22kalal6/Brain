Her pulse is 140/min, respirations are 12/min and shallow, and blood pressure is 76/55 mm Hg. 0.9% saline infusion is begun. A focused assessment with sonography shows blood in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Her hemoglobin concentration is 7.6 g/dL and hematocrit is 22%. The surgeon decides to move the patient to the operating room for an emergency explorative laparotomy. Packed red blood cell transfusion is ordered prior to surgery. A friend of the patient asks for the transfusion to be held as the patient is a Jehovah's Witness. The patient has no advance directive and there is no documentation showing her refusal of blood transfusions. The patient's husband and children cannot be contacted. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

Physical examination shows fixed and bilaterally dilated pupils and an open head wound with visible brain matter in the left occipital region. After transfer to the neurocritical care unit, two full neurological examinations and an apnea test are performed and it is determined that no brain stem reflexes are present. The patient is declared brain dead. The attending neurosurgeon speaks to the family and explains the meaning of brain death and that the patient will not recover. His family members say they are hopeful because the patient still moves his fingers when they speak to him or touch his hand. Despite a thorough explanation by the physician that those movements do not mean that the brain is functioning, the family insists on continuing life-supporting measures because they believe he will wake up. There is enough space in the hospital for the patient to continue to remain on life support while the health care team and the family are trying to reach an agreement.

For participating in the study, they would be offered subsidized antenatal care with a health care provider of their choosing, and the subsidy would not be stopped even if they were to withdraw after enrolling.

He spends most of his time alone in his room because he believes he is being followed by the Secret Service. He was fired from his job 3 months ago after threatening a colleague. He appears suspicious of his surroundings and asks the doctor questions about “the security of the hospital&quot;. The patient exhibits a flat affect. During the physical examination, he tells the doctor that he recently bought a gun and says, “It's for protection. I only bought it to prevent people like my neighbor, who works for the Secret Service, from invading my property.” When asked if he plans to kill his neighbor, he replies, “I don't, and I hope I won't have to. He usually tries to enter my house in the mornings, claiming he wants to bring my newspaper.” Which of the following is the most appropriate initial action?",

He has nontremor-dominant Parkinson disease that was diagnosed at the age of 68 after developing progressive bradykinesia and rigidity. He lives alone following the death of his wife 2 years ago. The patient's son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren live nearby and help him with daily activities. Current medications include levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone. He appears well. Neurologic examination shows mild hypomimia, bradydiadochokinesia, shortened steps, and mild gait shuffling. During the examination, the patient mentions that he drove himself to his appointment today because he does not want to feel like a burden on his son. The physician assistant is concerned that the patient's illness and medications potentially impair his driving skills. The patient stresses that he has never had an accident in his life and is a very safe driver. He also states that he has felt isolated since his wife's passing and likes to meet up with old friends at a local bar.
