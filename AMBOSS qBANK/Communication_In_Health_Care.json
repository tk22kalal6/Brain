She was diagnosed with stage III triple-negative invasive breast cancer 5 years ago and underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, modified radical mastectomy, and radiation therapy. She has had no evidence of disease since completing her treatment, but during the past several months, she has experienced weight loss, fatigue, and a progressive dry cough. Results from a recent CT scan are consistent with recurrent metastatic disease.\nBefore you enter the examination room, the patient’s sister approaches you in the hallway and says, “Doctor, please do not give my sister any bad news. It will kill her. If you have any bad news, please tell only me or my brother.” You and the sister then enter the examination room, where the patient and her brother are waiting.\nAfter greeting the patient and discussing her symptoms, what is the most appropriate action?",

Immediate, emotionally charged discussions risk embarrassment and defensiveness rather than reflection. Combining this with a fear-based or punitive tone increases <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=kP0mUT&anker=Z6ed492871b68b31189bcb84adbfe1e96\" data-learningcard-id=\"kP0mUT\" data-anker=\"Z6ed492871b68b31189bcb84adbfe1e96\">anxiety</a>, damages <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=mp0VJS&anker=Zf2d67549c0a218795cdb32a02acc1112\" data-learningcard-id=\"mp0VJS\" data-anker=\"Zf2d67549c0a218795cdb32a02acc1112\" data-section-id=\"Nv1-ZQ0\">psychological safety</a>, and discourages future openness about mistakes.</div><div><h4 style='color: #34d399; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 16px; font-size: 1.125rem;'>B) CORRECT:</h4>Correct — The Ask–Tell–Ask framework structures feedback as a collaborative conversation rather than a one-way critique. The discussion begins with curiosity (“Can you walk me through your reasoning?”), proceeds to sharing observations and rationale (“I noticed the <a href=\"https://www.amboss.com/us/library#xid=pl0LBT&anker=Zf57bff8d5455c72457da0440f636f4bc\" data-learningcard-id=\"pl0LBT\" data-anker=\"Zf57bff8d5455c72457da0440f636f4bc\" data-sememe-id=\"jn0_Gg\">ECG</a> changes were subtle but significant because…”), and ends with reflection and mutual understanding.
