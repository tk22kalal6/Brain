She has had no prenatal care. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, and regular contractions are felt every 2 minutes. The uterus is consistent in size with a 20-week gestation. There is blood on the vulva, introitus, and medial aspect of the thighs. Ultrasound shows complete detachment of the placenta from the uterus. Fetal heart tones are absent. An emergency cesarean delivery is performed. Following the procedure, the patient becomes tearful and distraught. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial response by the physician?",

She recently emigrated from Brazil and is accompanied by her adult daughter, who sometimes interprets for her because the patient has only elementary proficiency in English. The patient's medical history is unknown. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right ankle shows swelling, tenderness to palpation, and a restricted range of movement. The patient is not able to bear any weight on the affected leg. Pulses and sensation are intact over the right foot. An x-ray of the ankle shows an unstable fibular fracture at the level of the syndesmosis. The attending physician decides to admit the patient for surgical treatment and wants to discuss the procedure with her. The patient appears anxious and asks many questions regarding the procedure in Portuguese. The physician has basic proficiency in Portuguese after having spent a semester abroad in Portugal. A professional medical interpreter is not available on-site, but a medical student offers to interpret since she was raised bilingually in English and Portuguese.
