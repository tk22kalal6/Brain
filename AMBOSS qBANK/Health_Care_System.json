She has not been able to walk her dog for the past 6 months because of severe pain that worsens with movement; during the past couple of weeks, she has also had pain without movement at night. Medical history is remarkable for several knee injuries from playing soccer in college. Previous treatment with physical therapy, diclofenac, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections has not provided significant pain relief. She has no other history of serious illness. She is 164 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 74 kg (163 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. Range of motion of the right knee is limited; there is palpable crepitus and moderate swelling. X-ray of the right knee joint shows marked osteophyte formation and irregular joint space narrowing. The surgeon wants to schedule the patient for total knee arthroplasty. She has a health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance plan, and the surgeon is an in-network provider. The patient is concerned about potential out-of-pocket costs for this treatment.

It was his third hospitalization for heart failure in the past 4 months.\nBefore being discharged home from the hospital, he was evaluated by the inpatient geriatric service and a physical therapist. He was found to be independent in his activities of daily living (bathing, toileting, dressing, and grooming). He also cooks his own meals, does his own grocery shopping, and has been responsible for taking his medications. He walks with a cane. He has retired from driving because of poor vision, and his son accompanies him to medical appointments, including today’s visit.\nHe reports no symptoms at today’s visit, and his weight has been stable since discharge. His physical examination is unremarkable, and he appears euvolemic on examination.\nWhich one of the following interventions is best for preventing all-cause hospital readmissions in this patient?",

      "text": "A 34-year-old man presents for follow-up 3 days after an emergency department visit in which he was diagnosed with a deep-vein thrombosis in his left lower extremity. During that visit, he was given the direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) apixaban and then discharged home after a period of observation. No predisposing or reversible risk factors were found.\nToday, he reports that when he went to his local pharmacy to fill the prescription to continue apixaban, he was informed that the drug is not covered by his insurance and would cost $230 per month. He was able to pay for one week’s supply out of pocket and then called his insurance company, which advised him that his policy would only cover DOACs at a high tier, with copays ranging from $200 to $500 per month. The insurer suggested he switch to warfarin, which would be covered with a $5 monthly copay.\nYou advise the patient that he should receive anticoagulation therapy for 3 to 6 months, and you discuss the monitoring requirements and dietary restrictions with warfarin therapy. The patient says that adherence would be difficult for him: he reports traveling a lot for work, which would limit his food options and impede reliable monitoring of his international normalized ratio (INR). His preference is to stay on apixaban because he has tolerated it well and finds it easy to take, but he does not think he can afford to pay any more than $50 per month for this medication.\nWhich one of the following next steps is most appropriate?",
