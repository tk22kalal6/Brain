      "text": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents because of a 10-month history of repeated behavioral problems. Her teachers describe her behavior as uncooperative and disruptive as she persistently refuses to answer questions, insults her teachers, and deliberately distracts her classmates. At home, her parents try to address her frequent violations of curfew but attempts to discuss the issue often result in their daughter losing her temper and screaming at her parents. Her grades have deteriorated over the past year. When listening to music or hanging out with friends, she is calm and pleasant. She has no history of psychiatric illness. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurological examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, she is uncooperative and frequently disrupts the physician’s conversation with the parents. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

His mother recently returned to work 2 weeks ago. She explains that, since then, her son has had a tantrum roughly every other morning, usually when she is getting him dressed or dropping him off at daycare. He cries loudly for about 5 minutes, saying that he does not want to go to daycare while thrashing his arms and legs. According to the daycare staff, he is well-behaved during the day. In the evenings, he has tantrums about twice per week, typically when he is told he must finish his dinner or that it is time for bed. These tantrums have been occurring for about 6 months. The mother is concerned her son may have a behavioral disorder. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the boy's behavior?",

Last week, when his teacher asked him to present his homework in class, he started shouting and cursing and threw a book on the floor. The teacher has reported that similar outbursts occur at least twice weekly for no apparent reason; otherwise, he is usually calm and sits quietly during class. His mother reports that during driving lessons he regularly becomes angry “if other people drive too slowly”, and that has led to him almost losing control of the car. After these episodes, he feels embarrassed and apologizes for his actions. When asked about his behavior in these situations, he says, “I feel a sudden rage inside of me, my mind is racing, and I can feel my heart pounding.” His mother is concerned that he may not be able to get his driver's license if he cannot control himself. He is otherwise healthy, takes no medications, and does not use illicit drugs. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
