As the pregnancy progresses, the placenta usually migrates superiorly (toward the fundus and away from the cervix) because the thicker myometrium in the upper uterine cavity is more vascularized (better placental perfusion) than the thinner lower uterine segment.&nbsp; In addition, as the pregnancy progresses, the lower uterine segment naturally expands and thins, which also increases the distance between the placenta and the internal os of the cervix.</p><br><br><p>In placenta previa (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L91406.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), the placenta either implants abnormally low in the uterus or fails to migrate toward the fundus as the pregnancy progresses, resulting in the placenta partially or completely covering the cervix.<p></p><br><br><p>At later gestational ages, cervical effacement (thinning) and dilation cause shearing forces and injury to the portion of the placenta overlying the internal os of the cervix.&nbsp; This leads to placental injury and bleeding from the intervillous space, causing most of the bleeding to be maternal (rather than fetal) in origin.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Risk factors for placenta previa include conditions that predispose the placenta to implant abnormally low in the uterus and/or conditions that compromise uterine vascularity or structure.</p><br><br><p>The most common risk factor is uterine scarring from a prior uterine surgery (eg, cesarean delivery, uterine myomectomy).&nbsp; The scarring compromises the vascularity of the uterus and predisposes to abnormally low placental implantation.&nbsp; Additional risk factors include prior placenta previa, advanced maternal age, and tobacco use.&nbsp; In addition, multiple gestation (eg, twin pregnancy) is a risk factor due to increased placental surface area.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Placenta previa typically presents in the following ways:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The most common presentation is an <strong>asymptomatic patient</strong> with an <strong>incidental finding</strong> of placenta previa on routine second-trimester ultrasonography (eg, fetal anatomy ultrasonography).</li>\n\t<li>In <strong>symptomatic patients</strong>, placenta previa typically presents as <strong>sudden, painless vaginal bleeding</strong> in the second or third trimester (ie, &gt;20 weeks gestation).&nbsp; The uterus is typically nontender with no associated painful contractions; however, uterine irritability (eg, irregular, nonpainful contractions) may be present.&nbsp; In addition, there is usually no significant fetal distress initially (ie, the fetal heart rate tracing appears normal) because the blood loss is from maternal (not fetal) placental vessels (the intervillous space).&nbsp; However, with significant maternal hemorrhage, fetal heart rate abnormalities may develop later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The primary diagnostic tool used to identify placenta previa is ultrasonography, regardless of clinical presentation.&nbsp; First, transabdominal ultrasonography is performed to visualize the placental position.&nbsp; Then transvaginal ultrasonography is performed to determine the extent of coverage over the cervix.&nbsp; This ranges from a low-lying placenta, in which the placenta edge is close to (but not overlying) the cervix, to complete placenta previa (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44155.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) that extends over the entire internal cervical os.<p></p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>On routine ultrasonography, placenta previa is readily diagnosed, however; it is also commonly associated with other obstetric conditions that can complicate labor and delivery, including vasa previa, velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord, and placenta accreta spectrum.&nbsp; Therefore, ultrasonographic evaluation for these other conditions is also required.</p><br><br><p>In patients with symptomatic bleeding (particularly those without routine obstetric care or prenatal ultrasonography), the differential diagnosis consists of the major causes of antepartum bleeding:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Vasa previa</strong>:&nbsp; presents with painless vaginal bleeding, but because the blood loss is fetal (rather than maternal) in nature, patients have an immediate onset of fetal compromise on fetal heart rate tracing (minimal variability, decelerations, bradycardia).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Placental abruption (abruptio placentae)</strong>:&nbsp; typically presents with painful vaginal bleeding, including painful uterine contractions (often every 1-2 min) and a firm, tender uterus.&nbsp; Most patients have signs of fetal compromise on fetal heart rate tracing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Uterine rupture</strong>:&nbsp; is a cause of vaginal bleeding also associated with prior cesarean delivery.&nbsp; In contrast to placenta previa, patients with uterine rupture have severe abdominal pain followed by decreasing contraction strength.&nbsp; In addition, those with a large uterine rupture can have loss of fetal station on digital cervical examination and potentially palpable fetal parts in the abdomen.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Performing digital cervical examination (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44119.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is contraindicated in any patient with antepartum bleeding in which the location of the placenta is unknown.<p></p><br><br><p>Ultrasonography must be performed first to locate the placenta to rule out both placenta previa and vasa previa because, during digital cervical examination, entrance into the cervical canal can disrupt the placenta and fetal vessels, leading to severe maternal or fetal hemorrhage.</p><br><br><p>If a patient has known or identified placenta previa, speculum examination can be used to verify and quantify vaginal bleeding because it does not require entrance into the cervical canal.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of placenta previa depends on clinical status and is divided into asymptomatic patient care, care of acute bleeding, and management after a bleeding episode.</p><br><br><p>Asymptomatic patients undergo routine obstetric care with pelvic rest (avoidance of sexual intercourse).&nbsp; These patients require follow-up ultrasonography during the third trimester (eg, 28-32 weeks gestation) to determine whether the placenta previa has resolved.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>If the placenta previa resolves, patients can discontinue pelvic rest and can undergo vaginal delivery.</li>\n\t<li>If the placenta previa persists, planned cesarean delivery at 36-37 weeks gestation is required to avoid potential life-threatening bleeding during labor.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In patients who experience acute bleeding, management depends on the severity of bleeding and the maternal-fetal status.</p><br><br><p>There are no treatment options to stop active bleeding from placenta previa; therefore, management is based on weighing between a preterm birth versus maternal morbidity and mortality.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Severe bleeding <em>with</em> maternal-fetal compromise requires immediate stabilization with intravenous fluids and emergency cesarean delivery.&nbsp; In addition, a complete blood count, coagulation studies (eg, PT, PTT, fibrinogen), and typing and cross-matching for possible blood transfusion must be obtained.</li>\n\t<li>Bleeding <em>without</em> associated maternal-fetal compromise requires inpatient management and fetal monitoring (eg, 24-48 hr) until the bleeding stops.&nbsp; In addition to monitoring, magnesium sulfate (&lt;32 weeks gestation) and antenatal corticosteroids (&lt;37 weeks gestation) are typically administered for fetal protection.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Some patients may be discharged from the hospital with expectant management after a bleeding episode; however, hospitalization until delivery may be recommended because timely intervention such as access to emergency cesarean delivery (&lt;20 min from onset of bleeding) significantly decreases the risk for maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality.</li>\n\t\t<li>If the condition of these patients remains stable, cesarean delivery is performed at 36-37 weeks gestation.&nbsp; However, expectant management is stopped and emergency cesarean delivery is performed if the patient develops severe bleeding (particularly at &gt;34 weeks gestation), hemodynamic instability, or signs of fetal compromise.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for placenta previa varies widely based on gestational age, the type of placenta previa, and bleeding symptoms (eg, frequency, severity).&nbsp; The majority (~90%) of patients with a low-lying placenta in early pregnancy (eg, &lt;20 weeks gestation) or an asymptomatic placenta previa have spontaneous resolution and can undergo vaginal delivery.</p><br><br><p>In contrast, patients with unresolved placenta previa (at &gt;32 weeks gestation) or those with episodes of bleeding require cesarean delivery, typically at 36-37 weeks gestation (prior to the onset of labor), to avoid the potential for massive antepartum hemorrhage.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Placenta previa (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/33314.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) occurs when placental tissue covers the cervix, creating the potential for massive antepartum hemorrhage during cervical dilation or uterine contractions.&nbsp; Therefore, labor and vaginal delivery are contraindicated, and cesarean delivery is typically performed at 36-37 weeks gestation.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
