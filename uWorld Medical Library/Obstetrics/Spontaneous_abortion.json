SAB exists on a spectrum and is categorized based on presentation, cervical examination, and ultrasonography findings.&nbsp; The condition is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities, but other factors can also contribute.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The pathogenesis of SAB, a loss of pregnancy at <strong>&lt;20 weeks gestation</strong>, is usually multifactorial, and a specific cause is not always identified.&nbsp; Etiologies include fetal or maternal factors that interfere with normal implantation, embryonic and fetal development, trophoblast growth, and fetal blood supply.</p>\n<h2>Fetal factors</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chromosomal abnormalities</strong> (most common cause, accounting for up to 70% of cases) can cause early disruption of embryonic development.&nbsp; Therefore, they are more likely to be found in SABs at &lt;10 weeks gestation.&nbsp; Trisomies (especially trisomy 16), monosomy X (Turner syndrome), and triploidies are frequently implicated.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Congenital anomalies</strong> or fetal structural defects (eg, anencephaly (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31339.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ))</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Maternal factors</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Prior SAB</strong>:&nbsp;

to assess for anemia and signs of infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Serum β-hCG level</strong>:&nbsp; there are no hCG findings diagnostic for pregnancy loss, but relative findings from serial measurements may be helpful.&nbsp; In a normal pregnancy, hCG is expected to double every 48 hours (minimum rise by 50%).&nbsp; An abnormal rise may suggest a nonviable pregnancy (or a pregnancy located outside the uterine cavity).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Blood type and antibody screen</strong>:&nbsp; to determine Rh status because Rh-negative women may require Rho(D) immunoglobulin to prevent isoimmunization, depending on the gestational age of the SAB.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Ectopic pregnancy</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22774.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

A ruptured ectopic pregnancy may be seen as significant free fluid (ie, blood) on ultrasonography, and patients often have significantly more abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pregnancy of unknown location</strong>:&nbsp; An intrauterine pregnancy is determined definitively by the presence of either a yolk sac (seen around 5-6 weeks gestation) or fetal pole (seen around 6 weeks gestation) within the uterine cavity (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L96454.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; If the ultrasonography is performed too soon after the last menstrual period, the uterus may appear empty.&nbsp; This may occur if the intrauterine pregnancy is too early to detect sonographically, or it may be an early ectopic pregnancy.&nbsp; Serial sonograms and hCG levels ultimately determine the location of the pregnancy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Threatened abortion</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16819.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

This is most often offered to patients with missed abortions in the first trimester.</li>\n\t<li>Medical management involves <strong>misoprostol</strong> (a prostaglandin analog) and <strong>mifepristone</strong> (a progesterone antagonist) to induce expulsion of products of conception.&nbsp; This can be used for missed abortions, stable incomplete abortions, or inevitable abortions.</li>\n\t<li>Surgical management with either suction D&amp;C or manual vacuum aspiration can be used to evacuate the products of conception from the uterus.&nbsp; \"Dilation and evacuation\" refers to the surgical uterine evacuation performed at ≥13 weeks gestation.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with completed abortions do not typically require additional management.</p>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>The products of conception are sent for pathologic examination if a D&amp;C is performed or if the SAB occurs in a healthcare setting (many patients have an SAB at home).&nbsp; The pathology of SAB depends on the gestational age as well as the underlying cause.</p><br><br><p>Tissue passed spontaneously or obtained through D&amp;C after an early miscarriage is known collectively as products of conception (which includes placental and fetal tissue).&nbsp; There may be an empty gestational sac (ie, blighted ovum or anembryonic pregnancy) or a recognizable embryo or fetus (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29065.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>With more advanced gestations, evaluation of the fetus and placenta may reveal findings specific to the cause of the SAB (eg, fetal congenital anomalies, placental abscesses with <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> infection).&nbsp; Histologic examination shows decidual tissue and chorionic villi.</p>\n<h1>Special consideration: septic abortion</h1><br><br><p>A septic abortion is an intrauterine infection that occurs in relation to a spontaneous or induced abortion that can complicate any stage of pregnancy loss (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32488.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Septic abortions typically occur when retained products of conception become infected by ascending vaginal flora (eg, anaerobes, gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci), leading to a <strong>polymicrobial infection</strong>.<p></p><br><br><p>Patients often have <strong>fever</strong>, chills, heavy vaginal bleeding, abdominopelvic pain, and malodorous and <strong>purulent vaginal discharge</strong>.&nbsp; Many patients are hemodynamically unstable (ie, in septic shock):</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Clinical examination shows uterine or cervical motion tenderness and purulent cervical discharge</li>\n\t<li>Ultrasonography varies based on the timing of the pregnancy loss.&nbsp; Most often, remaining products of conception have become infected and necrotic and appear as intrauterine echogenic material.&nbsp; There may be spread of infection beyond the uterine cavity, seen as a tuboovarian abscess or hydrosalpinx.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Septic abortion is a <strong>medical emergency</strong>.&nbsp; Delay in treatment can lead to the spread of infection from the fetus and placenta to the myometrium, which can lead to sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.</p><br><br><p>Therefore, management is with <strong>surgical uterine evacuation</strong> (to remove infected tissue) and <strong>broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics</strong>.&nbsp; In addition, blood cultures and sexually transmitted infection testing are collected to help guide management.&nbsp; Patients who do not improve despite treatment may require hysterectomy, particularly if infection with toxin-producing bacteria (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, group A <em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Clostridioides</em> species) is suspected.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis following a single SAB is generally good, and most women go on to have successful subsequent pregnancies.&nbsp; The prognosis is further improved in women who have previously had a live birth.&nbsp; However, recurrent pregnancy loss (≥2 SABs) requires further evaluation to identify underlying causes (eg, inherited chromosomal abnormalities, uterine anomalies, maternal complications [antiphospholipid syndrome]).</p><br><br><p>Recurrent pregnancy loss is discussed in a separate dedicated article.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>The incidence of SAB is high, and there is no way to prevent all miscarriages.&nbsp; However, optimizing maternal health by optimizing chronic medical conditions (eg, diabetes, hypertension) and limiting negative environmental factors (eg, smoking and alcohol cessation) can lower the incidence for some individuals.&nbsp; In addition, work-up and treatment of known causes of miscarriage (eg, uterine septum, submucosal fibroids) in individuals with recurrent pregnancy loss can reduce further losses.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Spontaneous abortion, or miscarriage, is defined as the loss of a pregnancy at &lt;20 weeks gestation.&nbsp;
