It is thought to occur due to the entry of amniotic fluid into the maternal circulation.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>AFEs occur when amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation through areas of disrupted maternofetal connections, such as endocervical veins or areas of uterine trauma (eg, hysterotomy), and initiates a widespread inflammatory response leading to the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hypoxemic respiratory failure</strong>:&nbsp; Due to significant pulmonary vasoconstriction from proinflammatory mediators and physical obstruction from amniotic fluid debris, leading to severe hypoxia.&nbsp; The resultant profound hypoxia can cause a coma or seizure.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Obstructive shock</strong>:&nbsp; Due to increasing pulmonary arterial resistance, which leads to subsequent right ventricular heart failure and decreased left-sided cardiac output.&nbsp; This is often followed immediately by left ventricular failure and resultant pulmonary edema and cardiovascular collapse.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy</strong> (DIC):&nbsp; Due to amniotic fluid activating both factor VII and platelets, triggering the clotting cascade and causing consumptive coagulopathy, which leads to profuse bleeding from multiple sites (eg, uterine, intravenous line sites).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In and of itself, the entry of amniotic fluid into the maternal circulation is not sufficient to cause AFE because not all patients with documented embolic material in the blood or lung tissue develop clinical manifestations of AFE.&nbsp; Symptoms are thought to occur due to an exaggerated maternal immune response to antigenic material contained in the amniotic fluid (eg, fetal cells, meconium, trophoblastic cells), resulting in an <strong>anaphylaxis-like reaction</strong>.&nbsp; Inflammatory substances (eg, complement factors, cytokines, interleukins) contained in the amniotic fluid itself may also play a role.</p><br><br><p>When AFE occurs prior to delivery, hemodynamic instability causes inadequate uteroplacental perfusion and fetal hypoxemia, which can lead to fetal acidosis and death.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Induction of labor or oxytocin administration.</li>\n\t<li>Uterine rupture.</li>\n\t<li>Placental abruption.</li>\n\t<li>Placenta previa or accreta.</li>\n\t<li>Cesarean delivery or forceps-assisted vaginal delivery.</li>\n\t<li>Advanced maternal age (&gt;35).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Pathologic findings are not specific to AFE but can support the diagnosis.&nbsp; In fatal cases of AFE, histologic examination at autopsy may reveal fetal squamous cells and hair or trophoblastic cells in the maternal lungs, kidneys, and liver.&nbsp; In addition, there may be diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage in the lungs, and microvascular thrombi in multiple organs due to DIC.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>AFE symptoms begin suddenly and progress rapidly, often beginning during labor or delivery or within 30 minutes of placental delivery.&nbsp; Prior to the onset of symptoms, patients may experience an <strong>impending sense of doom</strong>, agitation, or altered mental status.&nbsp; The classic triad includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Respiratory distress</strong>:&nbsp; Sudden dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia.&nbsp; Examination may demonstrate crackles and cyanosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cardiovascular collapse</strong>:&nbsp; Hypotension, tachycardia, heart failure, arrhythmias, shock, and cardiac arrest.&nbsp; Examination may demonstrate a holosystolic murmur due to tricuspid regurgitation, weak pulses, reduced urine output, and cold extremities.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Coagulopathy</strong>:&nbsp; Profuse bleeding from intravenous line sites, the uterus, lacerations, or surgical wounds, leading to severe hemorrhage.&nbsp; In addition, patients often have uterine atony and heavy vaginal bleeding.&nbsp; In AFE, coagulopathy occurs due to DIC prior to significant hemorrhage rather than as a consequence of severe hemorrhage.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>When AFE occurs before delivery, fetal monitoring demonstrates acute fetal decompensation due to fetal hypoxia; characteristic findings include late decelerations (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21083.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), absent variability (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22719.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), and bradycardia (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28513.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Postpartum hemorrhage</strong>:&nbsp; Most often occurs due to uterine atony.&nbsp; Heavy vaginal bleeding is the initial symptom, but it can progress to hemodynamic instability and shock.&nbsp; In contrast to AFE, respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia are not common early in the course of postpartum hemorrhage.&nbsp; Coagulopathy can develop but only after significant blood loss.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Placental abruption</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16466.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

Typically presents with hypotension due to loss of sympathetic response and with dyspnea due to paralysis of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles.&nbsp; There is no associated coagulopathy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Local anesthetic systemic toxicity</strong>:&nbsp; Can rarely occur with epidural analgesia (eg, bupivacaine).&nbsp; When the anesthetic is absorbed into the maternal circulation, it initially blocks inhibitory neural pathways to cause CNS overactivity (eg, perioral numbness, tinnitus), potentially followed by seizure.&nbsp; Patients often develop increased cardiovascular sympathetic activity (eg, hypertension, tachycardia) followed by cardiovascular collapse.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pulmonary embolism</strong> (PE):&nbsp; Can present with sudden-onset dyspnea, oxygen desaturation, and tachycardia during labor or postpartum; significant emboli can lead to hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.&nbsp; DIC and hemorrhage are not common.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anaphylaxis</strong>:&nbsp; Severe allergic or hypersensitivity reactions can occur following medication administration.&nbsp; Anaphylaxis can cause shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypotension, and shock (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19436.png\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), though it is often not as rapidly progressive and catastrophic as AFE and does not cause coagulopathy.&nbsp; The presence of hives, itching, angioedema, or diarrhea suggests anaphylaxis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>AFE is both a <strong>clinical diagnosis</strong> based on the rapid onset of classic symptoms and a <strong>diagnosis of exclusion</strong>.&nbsp; The diagnostic criteria include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Onset during labor or within 30 minutes of placenta delivery.</li>\n\t<li>Sudden-onset cardiorespiratory arrest or the combination of hypotension and clinical respiratory distress.</li>\n\t<li>DIC (evidence of coagulopathy not attributable to dilution due to hemorrhage).</li>\n\t<li>Absence of fever during labor.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because a working clinical diagnosis should be reached immediately given the rapid and catastrophic consequences, response and management begin before the return of laboratory and imaging studies that would ultimately support the diagnosis.</p><br><br><p>Laboratory results:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count:&nbsp; Anemia due to DIC and hemorrhage.</li>\n\t<li>Coagulation studies:&nbsp; Thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen level, prolonged PT, or significant increase in INR.</li>\n\t<li>Arterial blood gas:&nbsp; Significant hypoxemia.&nbsp; Metabolic acidosis can develop with impaired perfusion (eg, persistent hypotension, cardiac arrest).</li>\n\t<li>Cardiac markers:&nbsp; Troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) may be elevated due to pulmonary hypertension and heart failure.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Additional studies:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>X-ray of the chest:&nbsp; Demonstrates diffuse bilateral infiltrates due to pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and alveolar hemorrhage over time.</li>\n\t<li>Echocardiography:&nbsp; Initially demonstrates pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular strain and enlargement.&nbsp; As left ventricular failure develops, echocardiography demonstrates reduced ejection fraction.</li>\n\t<li>ECG:&nbsp; Typically demonstrates sinus tachycardia but may show arrhythmias with clinical deterioration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>AFE requires an interdisciplinary care team involving obstetrics, neonatology, anesthesiology, hematology, and intensive care specialists.&nbsp; Initial management is supportive and requires:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Intubation with mechanical ventilation to correct the hypoxia.</li>\n\t<li>Vasopressors to support blood pressure.</li>\n\t<li>Massive transfusion protocol to correct the DIC.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>When AFE occurs prior to delivery, supportive measures are immediately begun and emergency delivery (most often cesarean) is performed.&nbsp; This not only preserves the life of the fetus but also provides significant maternal benefit during resuscitation because the gravid uterus causes aortocaval compression (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22730.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which reduces venous return and limits blood flow through the abdominal aorta.&nbsp; These obstructions are relieved with delivery, which improves resuscitative success.<p></p><br><br><p>Following management of the acute phase and delivery, patients with AFE are managed in the intensive care setting.&nbsp; Components of ongoing management include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Serial laboratory studies every 4-6 hours to monitor responsiveness to interventions.</li>\n\t<li>Ongoing support with oxygenation and perfusion.&nbsp; Some patients require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or ventricular assist devices.</li>\n\t<li>Further imaging (CT pulmonary angiography, transesophageal echocardiography) as needed to evaluate cardiac function and rule out alternative etiologies (eg, pulmonary embolism).</li>\n\t<li>Monitoring and management of potential complications (eg, pulmonary edema, ARDS, multiorgan failure).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prevention and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>There are no preventive strategies, and the prognosis is grim with a <strong>high maternal mortality rate</strong>.&nbsp; Patients who survive often have severe neurologic injury from prolonged hypoxia and other long-term complications (eg, chronic kidney disease, heart failure).</p><br><br><p>When AFE occurs prior to delivery, there is a <strong>high fetal mortality rate</strong>.&nbsp; Surviving neonates often develop neurologic sequelae (eg, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, cerebral palsy) due to oxygen deprivation in utero.&nbsp; Outcomes are more favorable with a shorter time from the onset of maternal symptoms to delivery.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Amniotic fluid embolism (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/33315.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a rare but life-threatening obstetric emergency that occurs due to an exaggerated maternal response to the entry of amniotic fluid into the maternal circulation.&nbsp; Vasoactive and inflammatory substances lead to massive activation of various pathways, which then leads to the classic presentation of respiratory distress, cardiovascular collapse, and DIC.&nbsp; AFE has a high maternal and fetal mortality rate and requires immediate recognition and aggressive supportive management.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
