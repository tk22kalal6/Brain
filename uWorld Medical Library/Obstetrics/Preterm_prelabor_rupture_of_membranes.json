PPROM affects about 3% of pregnancies and is associated with various maternal and neonatal complications.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The placental membranes arise from the extraembryonic tissues of the zygote and are composed of two layers: the inner amnion (closest to the fetus) and the outer chorion (closest to the endometrium).&nbsp; In early gestation, the layers are distinct, but they soon fuse to form the amniochorionic membranes.&nbsp; The integrity of the membranes is maintained by collagen, laminin, and fibronectin; intact membranes prevent the leakage of amniotic fluid and provide a barrier to protect the fetus from ascending infection from the lower genital tract.</p><br><br><p>The exact pathogenesis of PPROM is multifactorial and is thought to result from a combination of factors that weaken the fetal membranes.&nbsp; Key factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inflammation:&nbsp; Infection and inflammation cause membrane weakening.&nbsp; Inflammatory cytokines and proteolytic enzymes degrade the extracellular matrix of the membranes, leading to rupture.</li>\n\t<li>Mechanical stress:&nbsp; Uterine overdistension (eg, multiple gestation, polyhydramnios) can increase mechanical stress on the membranes, contributing to rupture.</li>\n\t<li>Membrane integrity:&nbsp; Alterations in local matrix metalloproteinase, protease, and collagenase activity modify the collagen structure and content of the membranes, reducing membrane strength and making them more susceptible to rupture.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Prior PPROM</li>\n\t<li>Genitourinary infections (eg, bacterial vaginosis, sexually transmitted infections)</li>\n\t<li>Cervical insufficiency</li>\n\t<li>Uterine overdistension (eg, multiple gestation, polyhydramnios)</li>\n\t<li>Antepartum bleeding (particularly first-trimester bleeding)</li>\n\t<li>Smoking</li>\n\t<li>Abdominal trauma</li>\n\t<li>Low socioeconomic status, which is associated with a higher risk for inadequate prenatal care, poor nutrition, and infection</li>\n\t<li>Uterine procedures (eg, amniocentesis, cerclage)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The primary symptom of PPROM is the <strong>sudden gush or persistent leakage of amniotic fluid</strong> from the vagina at <strong>&lt;37 weeks gestation</strong>.&nbsp; Leakage may be continuous or intermittent, and the fluid is typically clear to slightly yellow.&nbsp; Other symptoms may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increased vaginal discharge</li>\n\t<li>Increased pelvic pressure and/or change in abdominal contour (due to fetal engagement with loss of amniotic fluid)</li>\n\t<li>Uterine contractions, which may be triggered following membrane rupture</li>\n\t<li>Changes in perceived fetal movement due to restricted fetal movements</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Urinary incontinence</strong>:&nbsp; increases during pregnancy and peaks in the third trimester; loss of urine is often mistaken for amniotic fluid leakage.&nbsp; However, urinary incontinence typically occurs in association with increased intraabdominal pressures (eg, cough, exercise) when the bladder is full, and it typically resolves once the bladder is emptied.&nbsp; In contrast, PPROM often causes continuous or intermittent leakage of fluid unrelated to bladder volume.&nbsp; Tests for amniotic fluid rupture are negative (eg, negative nitrazine, lack of ferning), and pH is different [urine pH &lt;6.0, whereas amniotic fluid pH ranges from 7.0 to 7.5].</li>\n\t<li><strong>Physiologic leukorrhea</strong>:&nbsp; increases throughout pregnancy and is white to clear and may be watery, although the volume is typically less than what is observed with ruptured membranes.&nbsp; The diagnosis can be distinguished by physical examination:&nbsp; The pH of discharge is 4.0-4.6, nitrazine is negative, and ferning is absent.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vulvovaginal infections</strong> (eg, bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis):&nbsp; cause increased discharge that may be confused with amniotic fluid.&nbsp; Wet prep microscopy can distinguish ruptured membranes from infectious discharge.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cervical mucus plug discharge</strong>:&nbsp; is a collection of cervical mucus with a stringy, jelly-like consistency that forms in the cervix in early pregnancy to block the ascent of lower genital tract pathogens to prevent intrauterine and fetal infection.&nbsp; The mucus plug is often expelled in late pregnancy and can sometimes be confused with membrane rupture; however, it does not cause persistent leakage of fluid and can usually be distinguished by its appearance and consistency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of PPROM is made with physical examination and laboratory evaluation.&nbsp; The physical examination includes a general assessment of maternal well-being with evaluation for possible signs of intrauterine intraamniotic infection (eg, fever, maternal and/or fetal tachycardia, fundal tenderness).&nbsp; The pelvic examination, performed with a sterile speculum, includes visualization of <strong>pooling fluid in the posterior vaginal fornix</strong> and leakage of fluid from the cervical os, which is suggestive of PPROM.&nbsp; In addition, speculum examination should assess for:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Presence of blood or purulence, which may suggest cervical dilation/placental abruption and intrauterine infection, respectively</li>\n\t<li>Visible cervical dilation, which allows avoidance of digital examination (to decrease infection risk)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Additional diagnostic testing to aid in the diagnosis includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Nitrazine test</strong>:&nbsp; A pH-based test detects basic (higher-pH) vaginal secretions.&nbsp; Because amniotic fluid has a higher pH (7.0-7.5) compared to normal vaginal pH (3.8-4.5), a nitrazine paper/swab turns from yellow to blue in the presence of amniotic fluid.&nbsp; However, the pH can also be elevated if there is blood, semen, soaps, or certain pathogens present, leading to false-positive results.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ferning test</strong>:&nbsp; When amniotic fluid dries, the salt content from the fluid exhibits an arborization (fern-like (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L37334.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )) pattern under microscopy.</li>\n\t<li>AmniSure or ROM Plus:&nbsp; These immunoassay-based tests detect placental alpha microglobulin-1 or other markers specific to amniotic fluid and are often performed when the diagnosis is uncertain.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Ultrasonography can be used to help measure the amniotic fluid index if there is uncertainty.&nbsp; Oligohydramnios (ie, amniotic fluid index of ≤5 cm or maximum vertical pocket &lt;2 cm), combined with symptoms of PPROM, support the diagnosis.&nbsp; In addition, ultrasonography allows the determination of fetal lie and presentation.</p><br><br><p>Patients with PPROM undergo the following laboratory tests and infectious work-ups (screening for asymptomatic infections as a cause of PPROM)</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count, which evaluates for leukocytosis, a marker of infection</li>\n\t<li>Urinalysis and urine culture</li>\n\t<li>Nucleic acid amplification testing of the cervix for <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em></li>\n\t<li>Group B <em>Streptococcus</em> culture (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/33322.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                )</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of PPROM (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29779.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) depends on the gestational age at diagnosis and the presence of complications.<p></p>\n<h2>Previable (&lt;23 weeks gestation)</h2><br><br><p>The earliest gestational age at delivery for potential viability (survivability following delivery) is generally considered 23 weeks gestation.&nbsp; When PPROM is diagnosed before the age of viability, patients are offered outpatient expectant management (observation until fetal viability with planned interventions [eg, glucocorticoids] as long as complications do not arise) or termination of pregnancy via induction of labor or dilation and evacuation.&nbsp; When PPROM occurs after amniocentesis, most patients are expectantly managed because membranes typically \"reseal\" and the prognosis is good.</p>\n<h2>Early preterm (23-34 weeks gestation)</h2><br><br><p>Patients with PPROM &lt;34 weeks gestation are managed inpatient with the following interventions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Prophylactic latency antibiotics</strong> (ampicillin plus azithromycin) are administered to prevent overt intrauterine infection (ie, intraamniotic infection), which can result from progression of the subclinical infection that caused PPROM or from ascent of vaginal bacteria through the ruptured membranes.&nbsp; By preventing overt infection, antibiotics increase the latency period (the time between membrane rupture and delivery), thereby increasing gestational age at delivery and improving neonatal outcomes.<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Ampicillin covers group B <em>Streptococcus</em>, aerobic gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes</li>\n\t\t<li>Azithromycin covers <em>Ureaplasma</em></li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Corticosteroids</strong> (eg, betamethasone) are administered to promote fetal lung maturity and reduce the risk for neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Magnesium sulfate</strong> is administered for fetal neuroprotection (ie, cerebral palsy risk reduction) &lt;32 weeks gestation when there is a high risk for delivery within 24 hours.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antenatal testing</strong> (eg, biophysical profile, nonstress test) allows monitoring of fetal well-being.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Delivery is at 34 weeks gestation</strong> (when risk of maternal complications exceeds neonatal risks associated with preterm delivery) or earlier in the event of complications (eg, placental abruption).</p>\n<h2>Late preterm (34-37 weeks gestation)</h2><br><br><p>At ≥34 weeks gestation, delivery is indicated as the risks for prematurity no longer outweigh the risks for pregnancy prolongation (eg, intraamniotic infection, umbilical cord prolapse, abruptio placentae).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis and complications</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of PPROM is primarily dependent on the gestational age at the time of membrane rupture, gestational age at delivery, and development of any complications.&nbsp; In general, the risk of both maternal and fetal complications is increased when PPROM occurs at an earlier gestational age.&nbsp; In the absence of significant complications, maternal prognosis after PPROM is good, whereas neonatal prognosis significantly varies by gestational age, ranging from a poor long-term prognosis for extremely preterm (&lt;28 weeks gestation) neonates to more favorable outcomes for late preterm (≥34 weeks gestation) neonates.</p>\n<h2>Maternal antepartum complications</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Intraamniotic infection</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/36642.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is also known as clinical chorioamnionitis, intrauterine infection, or intraamniotic infection or inflammation.&nbsp; Prolonged rupture of membranes increases the risk for the ascent of cervicovaginal microorganisms to the uterus, leading to infection of the fetus, amniotic fluid, and membranes.&nbsp; This can cause maternal fever, leukocytosis, maternal and fetal tachycardia, uterine tenderness, and purulent amniotic fluid.&nbsp; Development of infection is a contraindication to further expectant management of PPROM, and treatment is with antibiotics and delivery.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Placental abruption</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/118934.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) may occur in the setting of PPROM when a large decrease in amniotic fluid (eg, amniotic fluid index &lt;5) leads to uterine decompression, which causes maternal decidual vessels to shear, resulting in bleeding and separation of the placenta from the uterus.&nbsp; As the abruption enlarges, patients are at risk for fetal hypoxia (and possible demise) or maternal hemorrhage (and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation).&nbsp; Patients require immediate delivery.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Umbilical cord prolapse</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28030.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), or descent of the umbilical cord past the presenting fetal part (part closest to the maternal pelvis) into the vagina, can occur with PPROM because early-gestation fetuses are highly mobile and not engaged (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L5957.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (ie, at −5 station) in the maternal pelvis.&nbsp; This is an obstetric emergency requiring urgent cesarean delivery because compression of the prolapsed umbilical cord by the fetus can impede blood flow and cause fetal hypoxia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fetal and neonatal complications</h2><br><br><p>Most neonatal complications from PPROM are related to prematurity, and the prognosis is improved when rupture of membranes and delivery occur at later gestational ages.&nbsp; Prematurity-related complications include respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, feeding difficulties, and thermal instability.&nbsp; Musculoskeletal abnormalities (limb contractures) can develop in cases of very early PPROM (&lt;23 weeks) with prolonged oligohydramnios due to restricted fetal movement.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Preventive strategies for PPROM focus on infection screening with early treatment (eg, routine screening for sexually transmitted infections within prenatal care) and optimizing modifiable risk factors (eg, smoking cessation, cervical cerclage placement in eligible candidates).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes is a significant obstetric complication that can lead to preterm delivery.&nbsp; Because of the neonatal morbidity associated with preterm birth, most patients diagnosed with PPROM in the early preterm period are treated with antenatal corticosteroids and antibiotics to prolong the latency period, with delivery at 34 weeks gestation.&nbsp; However, many patients develop complications such as intraamniotic infection, umbilical cord prolapse, or placental abruption that require earlier delivery.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
