The goal of antenatal testing is to prevent intrauterine fetal demise; therefore, routine surveillance is performed in pregnancies complicated by maternal or fetal comorbidities that increase the risk for fetal demise.&nbsp; This testing helps guide pregnancy management and delivery timing in these pregnancies.</p><br><br><p>This article covers key tests used in antepartum fetal surveillance, including nonstress test (NST), biophysical profile (BPP), contraction stress test (CST), umbilical artery Doppler (UAD) ultrasonography, and middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler ultrasonography.</p>\n<h1>Physiology</h1><br><br><p>Fetuses exposed to long-term oxygen or nutrient deprivation typically follow predictable, step-wise physiologic adaptations that can be detected on antenatal testing and allow for intervention.</p><br><br><p>Fetal hypoxia occurs when maternal oxygenation is compromised, maternal perfusion of the placenta is reduced, and/or delivery of oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus is impeded.&nbsp; Over time, fetal hypoxia decreases fetal arterial blood oxygen content (hypoxemia).&nbsp; Without adequate oxygenation, fetal metabolism becomes anaerobic and creates lactic acid, which is not readily excreted or metabolized and results in its retention in tissues and the bloodstream (acidemia).&nbsp; This results in a step-wise progression of adaptations:</p><br><br><ol class=\"article-body-ordered-list\" type=\"1\">\n\t<li>The first adaptation is fetal growth restriction (FGR) as the fetus adapts by decreasing its growth to preserve energy.&nbsp; An asymmetric (head-sparing) growth pattern is common because oxygen is distributed for vital organs (eg, brain) and away from nonvital organs (eg, intestines).&nbsp; This also causes decreased urine production, resulting in oligohydramnios (decreased amniotic fluid).</li>\n\t<li>Continued oxygen deprivation leads to continued attempts at energy conservation, with decreased movement, breathing, and changes in heart rate variability.&nbsp; The changes occur because the cardioregulatory neurons and the fetal breathing center neurons are exquisitely sensitive to oxygen deprivation.</li>\n\t<li>To try to compensate for the prolonged hypoxia, changes are eventually created in the fetal circulatory system, such as blood flow and resistance, to improve blood flow to the brain and placenta.</li>\n\t<li>If hypoxia continues, all of these adaptions cannot overcome the chronic acidosis, and intrauterine fetal demise occurs.</li>\n</ol><br><br><p>Antepartum fetal surveillance can detect these changes and help prevent intrauterine fetal demise.</p>\n<h1>Antenatal testing timing, frequency, and risks</h1><br><br><p>Antenatal testing initiation and frequency are highly variable and dependent on the patient and the comorbid condition that requires additional monitoring.&nbsp; In general, most testing is performed 1 or 2 times per week and begins at 32 weeks gestation, when the fetal nervous system is more mature (and more accurate).&nbsp; In contrast, at earlier gestational ages, there is an increased risk for false-positive results and lower positive predictive values with increasing fetal prematurity.</p><br><br><p>Normal results from these tests are generally reassuring due to their low false-negative rates; however, results must be interpreted within the broader clinical context, with further testing or intervention guided by the overall maternal and fetal condition.&nbsp; Normal antepartum fetal testing results are reassuring because normal testing conveys an approximately 99.8% negative predictive value (stillbirth risk within 1 week).&nbsp; However, false-positive results are common and lead to unnecessary additional evaluations/interventions, including iatrogenic preterm birth.&nbsp; In addition, these tests cannot predict demises related to acute changes in maternal-fetal status, such as acute placental abruption or umbilical cord accidents.</p>\n<h1>Nonstress test</h1><br><br><p>The fetal heart rate varies based on sympathetic and parasympathetic responses to various stimuli, including oxygenation status, blood pressure, and CNS abnormalities.&nbsp; Normally, the fetus has heart rate variability (beat-to-beat fluctuations) and accelerations (increases in heart rate) that suggest normal fetal movement and therefore normal autonomic response from a normal oxygen and acid-base status.</p><br><br><p>The nonstress test (NST) is a noninvasive external Doppler monitor that evaluates the fetal heart rate over 20 minutes and is typically the first test performed in fetuses with concern for inadequate oxygenation.&nbsp; An NST is considered normal (ie, reactive) if all of the following conditions are met (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/46410.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Baseline heart rate of 110-160/min</li>\n\t<li>Moderate heart rate variability (6-25/min)</li>\n\t<li>≥2 accelerations, each peaking ≥15/min above baseline and lasting ≥15 sec (or ≥10/min above baseline and lasting ≥10 sec at &lt;32 weeks gestation)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Fetuses with a reactive NST are considered to have a normal acid-base status and are not at immediate risk for fetal demise.&nbsp; Because of the high negative predictive value of this test, patients can continue routine monitoring as guided by the pregnancy comorbidity.</p><br><br><p>In contrast, an NST is considered abnormal (ie, nonreactive) if any of these conditions are not met (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L46312.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The most concerning cause of a nonreactive NST is fetal hypoxemia and acidemia; however, nonreactive NSTs also occur with benign conditions, such as a fetal sleep cycle and maternal intake of medications (eg, opioids, magnesium sulfate).&nbsp; Therefore, patients with a nonreactive NST typically undergo extensive monitoring (eg, 40-120 min) to better distinguish between these benign versus concerning etiologies.&nbsp; However, NSTs have a high false-positive rate, and patients with a nonreactive NST typically require further evaluation with either a biophysical profile or contraction stress test before determining the need for intervention.<p></p>\n<h1>Biophysical profile</h1><br><br><p>A biophysical profile (BPP) uses ultrasonography to assess distinct fetal parameters and is most often combined with an NST to determine fetal oxygenation and acid-base status (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/41148.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Evaluation during a BPP consists of 4 \"acute\" parameters over a 30-minute examination that reflect current fetal status.&nbsp; These include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Breathing movements (1 episode of rhythmic breathing for ≥30 sec).</li>\n\t<li>Gross body movement (≥3 body or limb movements).</li>\n\t<li>Tone (≥1 episodes of extension and flexion of extremities or spine OR opening and closing a hand).</li>\n\t<li>NST (not required if all other components of the BPP are normal).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition, a \"chronic\" parameter of fetal status is determined by measuring the amniotic fluid volume with either an amniotic fluid index (normal: ≥5 cm) or a single deepest vertical pocket (normal: ≥2 cm).</p><br><br><p>Each BPP component is scored 0 or 2 for a total score of 0-10.&nbsp; Normal scores exclude fetal hypoxemia.&nbsp; In contrast, abnormal scores (particularly ≤4) suggest severe hypoxemia with imminent risk for intrauterine fetal demise; delivery is typically indicated (depending on gestational age).&nbsp; Results and management are typically as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>8-10/10:&nbsp; Normal with no evidence of fetal compromise. Monitoring should be continued as guided by pregnancy complications.</li>\n\t<li>6/10:&nbsp; Equivocal with possible fetal compromise.&nbsp; Delivery is recommended if ≥37 weeks gestation; additional monitoring, including repeat BPP in 24 hours if &lt;37 weeks gestation, is suggested.</li>\n\t<li>4/10:&nbsp; Abnormal with possible fetal compromise.&nbsp; Delivery is typically recommended if ≥32 weeks gestation (and may be recommended at an earlier gestational age).</li>\n\t<li>0-2/10:&nbsp; Abnormal with fetal compromise.&nbsp; Delivery is recommended regardless of gestational age.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Contraction stress test</h1><br><br><p>A contraction stress test (CST) is designed to evaluate the fetal response to the stress of labor (ie, repetitive uterine contractions) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/118228.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Fetal oxygenation is transiently impaired by uterine contractions due to the reduction in fetal blood flow.&nbsp; In normal pregnancies, fetuses can tolerate this intermittent reduction in blood flow with no changes in the fetal heart rate pattern.&nbsp; In contrast, in pregnancies with uteroplacental insufficiency, the intermittent decrease in oxygenation leads to late decelerations in the fetal heart rate pattern.&nbsp; Therefore, a CST is most often used to plan the route of delivery (ie, cesarean or vaginal) by evaluating the tolerance for labor.</p><br><br><p>A CST is performed by inducing ≥3, 40-second contractions (most often through an oxytocin infusion) in a 10-minute period.&nbsp; However, a CST cannot be performed in patients with contraindications to labor and vaginal delivery (eg, placenta previa, previous classical cesarean delivery (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L113331.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).<p></p><br><br><p>A CST is graded in the following manner:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Negative (ie, normal):&nbsp; No late or recurrent variable decelerations occur.</li>\n\t<li>Positive (ie, abnormal):&nbsp; Late decelerations occur with ≥50% of contractions (even if there are &lt;3 contractions in 10 minutes of monitoring).</li>\n\t<li>Equivocal:&nbsp; Recurrent variable decelerations, intermittent late decelerations, or decelerations accompanying contractions last &gt;90 seconds or occur &gt;2 minutes.</li>\n\t<li>Unsatisfactory:&nbsp; &lt;3 contractions lasting for 40 seconds in 10 minutes, unless the test is positive.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>A negative CST does not require additional testing.&nbsp; A positive (abnormal) CST indicates that an intolerance to labor exists and that cesarean delivery is indicated.</p>\n<h1>Umbilical artery Doppler ultrasonography</h1><br><br><p>Umbilical artery Doppler (UAD) ultrasonography is used to evaluate the vascular resistance of blood flow from the fetus to the placenta.&nbsp; It is used primarily in the ongoing surveillance of FGR but also in the evaluation of monochorionic twin pregnancies for twin-twin transfusion syndrome.&nbsp; UADs reflect placental function and are predictive of fetal oxygenation and perinatal morbidity and mortality.</p><br><br><p>Normally, the placenta is characterized by high-perfusion, low-resistance vessels.&nbsp; This leads to forward (toward the fetus) umbilical artery blood flow throughout the entire maternal cardiac cycle (even maternal diastole), which allows for continuous delivery of oxygen and nutrients.&nbsp; However, in pregnancies with uteroplacental insufficiency, arterial resistance compromises blood flow, leading to poor oxygen and nutrient delivery.&nbsp; Progressive arterial resistance is seen and monitored with UADs and generally occurs in a stepwise fashion:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Elevated systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio:&nbsp; With the initial arterial impedance, there is decreased forward flow during diastole compared to systole, resulting in an elevated S/D ratio.</li>\n\t<li>Absent end-diastolic flow (AEDF):&nbsp; As arterial resistance worsens, blood flow is absent through the umbilical artery during maternal diastole.</li>\n\t<li>Reverse end-diastolic flow (rEDF):&nbsp; In the most severe cases, arterial resistance is so high that blood flows in the reverse direction (ie, away from the fetus) during diastole.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The progression of UAD findings mirrors the severity of placental insufficiency and the risk for intrauterine fetal demise.&nbsp; Therefore, UAD imaging is performed weekly to monitor placental function, which guides delivery planning.</p><br><br><p>Twin-twin transfusion syndrome and FGR are reviewed in separate, dedicated articles.</p>\n<h1>Middle cerebral artery Doppler ultrasonography</h1><br><br><p>Middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler ultrasonography is used to screen for and evaluate the severity of fetal anemia, which can develop in cases of Rh alloimmunization, parvovirus B19 infection, or chronic abruption (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L87375.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>The fetal MCA is used to measure peak systolic velocity (PSV) because there is a brain-sparing effect (ie, brain blood flow is preferentially preserved) in fetal hypoxemia.&nbsp; This Doppler assessment distinguishes fetuses that are moderately to severely anemic from those that are not; as fetal hemoglobin levels fall, the velocity through this artery increases.&nbsp; MCA-PSV is reported as multiples of the median (MoM) peak systolic velocity for gestational age.&nbsp; A value &gt;1.5 MoM indicates moderate to severe fetal anemia; in these cases, fetal blood is sampled percutaneously at the umbilical cord for fetal RBC transfusion (through the umbilical vein).</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
