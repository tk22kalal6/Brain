The most common site is the fallopian tube, but it can also occur in other locations such as the ovary, cervix, or abdominal cavity (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29366.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency and a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in early pregnancy.&nbsp; Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevention of internal hemorrhage and death.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Following ovulation, the ovum normally travels along the length of the fallopian tube where it can be fertilized by a sperm.&nbsp; The fertilized ovum continues through the fallopian tube (propelled by tubal cilia), develops into a blastocyst, and then implants on the uterine endometrium.</p><br><br><p>However, migration of the fertilized ovum is occasionally impeded (often due to <strong>impaired tubal function</strong>), resulting in abnormal implantation in the fallopian tube or other extrauterine locations—known as an ectopic pregnancy.&nbsp; The vast majority of ectopic pregnancies occur within the fallopian tube (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22614.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), most often within the ampulla, followed by the isthmus, fimbria, and interstitium (ie, cornual tubal segment).<p></p><br><br><p>After implantation, the early pregnancy develops into a highly vascular mass that draws blood flow from the surrounding tissues to maintain its rapid growth.&nbsp; However, unlike the uterus, which has a thick wall of distensible smooth muscle, the fallopian tube cannot expand as the pregnancy enlarges.&nbsp; This strain on the tube, combined with tissue ischemia (from the redistribution of blood flow from surrounding tissue), places the fallopian tube at risk of rupture and significant hemorrhage.</p><br><br><p>A small number of ectopic pregnancies implant in the interstitial region of the fallopian tube, which is surrounded by myometrium (ie, interstitial or cornual pregnancy).&nbsp; The cornual region receives an abundant blood supply from both the uterine and the ovarian vessels, making rupture of this area particularly dangerous.</p><br><br><p>Other ectopic sites include the ovary, the abdominal cavity (ie, abdominal pregnancy), or within the endocervical canal (ie, cervical pregnancy).&nbsp; Abdominal and ovarian pregnancies may result from direct implantation of a blastocyst in these locations or reimplantation following tubal abortion (ie, expulsion of a tubal ectopic pregnancy through the fimbriated ostium and into the abdominal cavity).&nbsp; Cervical pregnancies may result from an abnormal uterine and cervical environment (eg, intrauterine adhesions following dilation and curettage).</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The risk factors of ectopic pregnancy are all related to impaired fallopian tube function.&nbsp; The most significant risk factors are:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Prior ectopic pregnancy</strong>:&nbsp; due to both the underlying tubal factor that lead to the first ectopic pregnancy and subsequent damage to tube from the ectopic pregnancy</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sexually transmitted infections</strong>:&nbsp; most commonly <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> or <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, which cause direct ciliary damage with ascending infection (ie, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prior tubal surgery</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other risk factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Endometriosis:&nbsp; may cause functional and anatomic abnormalities in the ovaries and fallopian tubes</li>\n\t<li>Infertility and the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF):&nbsp; possibly due to altered ciliary function and/or reduced endometrial receptivity to implantation</li>\n\t<li>Intrauterine device (IUD):&nbsp; while IUDs reduce the overall risk of pregnancy, if conception occurs there is an increased risk of ectopic implantation due to the thinned (progestin-releasing IUD) or cytotoxic (copper-containing IUD) endometrium</li>\n\t<li>Smoking:&nbsp; due to ciliary damage and impaired tubal function</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>The histopathology of ectopic pregnancies varies based on the site of implantation.&nbsp; Because the majority of ectopic pregnancies occur within the fallopian tube, gross examination reveals hemorrhage, necrosis, and possible rupture of the tube.&nbsp; Microscopically, trophoblastic invasion of the fallopian tube with chorionic villi may be seen (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L63591.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The majority of tubal ectopic pregnancies show evidence of chronic salpingitis (infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes) in the surrounding fallopian tube.<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The classic triad of ectopic pregnancy is <strong>amenorrhea</strong> followed by <strong>lower abdominal pain</strong> and <strong>vaginal spotting</strong> in the setting of a <strong>positive pregnancy test</strong>.&nbsp; Presentation at 6-8 weeks gestation is typical and is due to:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Amenorrhea:&nbsp; as a result of the missed menstrual cycle from pregnancy.</li>\n\t<li>Unilateral lower abdominal pain:&nbsp; develops as the fallopian tube becomes increasingly distended.&nbsp; The pain may be described as crampy or sharp; severe abdominal pain may indicate tubal rupture.</li>\n\t<li>Vaginal bleeding:&nbsp; occurs due to sloughing of early decidualized endometrium (the endometrium begins decidualization under the control of progesterone from the corpus luteum).&nbsp; The bleeding is often light spotting (rather than heavy bleeding often seen with spontaneous abortion).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Of note, in women with a history of abnormal uterine bleeding, the amenorrhea followed by light vaginal bleeding can be perceived as their menses, which can delay treatment and increase the risk of tubal rupture.</p>\n<h2>Ruptured ectopic pregnancy</h2><br><br><p>Patients with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy (ie, tubal rupture) typically present with severe abdominal pain, hemodynamic instability (eg, dizziness, hypotension, tachycardia), and shoulder pain (due to referred pain from diaphragmatic irritation by intraperitoneal blood) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L30311.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; On pelvic examination, there may be cervical motion tenderness (due to the presence of intraperitoneal blood), adnexal tenderness, or a palpable adnexal mass.<p></p>\n<h2>Rare presentations</h2><br><br><p>Rare presentations occur to implantation at sites other than the fallopian tube and include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Ovarian ectopic pregnancy</strong>:&nbsp; a similar presentation as tubal ectopic pregnancies, typically distinguished only during surgery.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Interstitial ectopic pregnancy</strong>:&nbsp; the interstitial portion can expand to a greater extent than other portions of the fallopian tube; patients may develop pain at later gestations.&nbsp; In addition, these pregnancies can be difficult to distinguish from intrauterine pregnancies on ultrasonography and are at a higher risk of rupture due to missed diagnosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cervical ectopic pregnancy</strong>:&nbsp; typically present with heavy vaginal bleeding with no significant abdominal pain.&nbsp; Unlike other types of ectopic pregnancies, bleeding into the peritoneal cavity does not occur and can be distinguished from a spontaneous abortion via ultrasonography.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Abdominal ectopic pregnancy</strong>:&nbsp; the pregnancy develops within the abdominal cavity (but outside the uterus).&nbsp; Due to the increased space of the abdomen (compared to the fallopian tube), patients may present at later gestational ages (even in some cases, the late second trimester).&nbsp; Abdominal ectopic pregnancies have the added complication of placental invasion into the peritoneal surfaces and involvement of the omentum, bowel, and other intraabdominal organs, causing potentially significant morbidity and mortality.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Threatened or incomplete abortion</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16818.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; like ectopic pregnancy, threatened and incomplete abortions present with a positive pregnancy test, pelvic pain, and vaginal bleeding.&nbsp; Transvaginal ultrasound can distinguish between these etiologies based on the pregnancy location.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hydatidiform mole</strong>:&nbsp; can cause vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test, and an inability to visualize a normal intrauterine pregnancy (similar to an ectopic pregnancy).&nbsp; However, the β-hCG level is usually significantly elevated (&gt;100,000 mIU/mL) in molar pregnancies and ultrasound shows a classic \"snowstorm\" appearance within the uterine cavity (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45442.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Adnexal pathology</strong>:&nbsp; ovarian torsion (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29661.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (in which an ovary becomes twisted on its ligamentous supports, leading to occlusion of its blood supply), ruptured ovarian cysts, and pelvic inflammatory disease can all present with acute onset of unilateral, severe lower abdominal pain with vaginal bleeding.&nbsp; However, these conditions have a negative pregnancy test.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Non-gynecologic etiologies</strong>:&nbsp; other intraabdominal pathologies (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis, kidney stones) can cause unilateral pelvic pain; however, these usually do not cause vaginal bleeding, and a pregnancy test is negative.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>A definitive diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is made in the following ways:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Sonographic visualization of a gestational sac containing a yolk sac or embryo outside the uterine cavity</li>\n\t<li>Histologic evaluation of a surgical specimen (usually a fallopian tube containing the ectopic pregnancy) demonstrating pregnancy tissue</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>However, early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality due to rupture and hemorrhage.&nbsp; Therefore, a presumptive diagnosis is often made when a patient presents with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, a positive β-hCG level, and an adnexal mass on imaging (and no intrauterine pregnancy).</p>\n<h1>Imaging&nbsp;</h1><br><br><p>For patients with vaginal bleeding and a positive β-hCG level, a transvaginal ultrasound should be performed.&nbsp; There are 3 scenarios with transvaginal ultrasonography in these patients:</p><br><br><ol class=\"article-body-ordered-list\" type=\"1\">\n\t<li>Normally developing pregnancy:&nbsp; may be too small to be seen; alternatively, if a pregnancy is seen within the uterine cavity (ie, threatened abortion), an ectopic pregnancy is ruled out.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Ectopic pregnancy:&nbsp; with imaging findings that include a complex adnexal mass separate from the ovary (± gestational sac) with surrounding vascularity (known as the \"ring of fire\") (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L103415.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Free fluid in the pelvis is suggestive of hemorrhage from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.</li>\n\t<li>Spontaneous abortion:&nbsp; if the uterus appears empty in the setting of pain and bleeding, a complete abortion may have occurred.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol><br><br><p>The interpretation of the transvaginal sonogram is dependent upon the quantitative β-hCG level.&nbsp; A level between &gt;2,500 and 4,000 mIU/mL is the minimum (which correlates to a developing pregnancy size) required for a pregnancy to be seen within the uterus, known as the discriminatory zone.</p><br><br><p>In the setting of unclear imaging findings and low β-hCG levels (ie, a pregnancy of unknown location), a repeat β-hCG level and transvaginal sonogram should be performed every 48 hours (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16263.png\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The trend on β-hCG levels is useful because the level should rise by 50% every 48 hours (and in normal pregnancies, it often doubles every 48 hours).&nbsp; A slower rise or plateauing values suggest an abnormal pregnancy: either an ectopic pregnancy or a spontaneous abortion.<p></p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The treatment of ectopic pregnancy depends on the stability of the patient, the size and location of the ectopic pregnancy, and β-hCG levels.&nbsp; In general, there are 2 options for management: medical and surgical.</p>\n<h2>Medical management&nbsp;</h2><br><br><p>Medical management with <strong>methotrexate</strong>, a folate antagonist that inhibits cell proliferation by interrupting DNA synthesis, is the treatment option for hemodynamically stable patients with an unruptured ectopic pregnancy.</p><br><br><p>However, not every patient is eligible for methotrexate therapy.&nbsp; Contraindications include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Breastfeeding</li>\n\t<li>Hematologic, renal, or hepatic function abnormalities</li>\n\t<li>Pulmonary disease, peptic ulcer disease, or immunodeficiency</li>\n\t<li>Concern for rupture</li>\n\t<li>Coexisting intrauterine pregnancy (ie, heterotopic pregnancy)</li>\n\t<li>Inability to follow up for serial β-hCG levels</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Relative contraindications to methotrexate therapy are conditions that make methotrexate less efficacious (ie, increased risk of treatment failure) and include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>β-hCG level ≥5000 U/L</li>\n\t<li>Fetal cardiac activity</li>\n\t<li>Ectopic mass size ≥3.5 cm</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Methotrexate management requires close surveillance and follow up with serial β-hCG levels to ensure resolution of the ectopic pregnancy.&nbsp; A baseline β-hCG level is drawn on the day that methotrexate is administered (day 1).</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Levels are then drawn on day 4 and day 7; β-hCG levels should drop by at least 15%.&nbsp; They are then followed weekly to resolution.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>If the drop is &lt;15% at any point, a repeat dose of methotrexate is administered.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>If the patient has contraindications of methotrexate therapy or is hemodynamically unstable, surgery is required (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L37026.png\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Surgical management&nbsp;</h2><br><br><p>Patients with hemodynamic instability (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, syncope) require urgent surgical management (most often laparoscopically).&nbsp; Surgical management involves either salpingostomy (incision of the fallopian tube with removal of the pregnancy) or salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for all ectopic pregnancies improves with early diagnosis and treatment.&nbsp; Most women treated for tubal ectopic pregnancies recover without long-term complications.&nbsp; Fertility is often preserved, though the risk of recurrent ectopic pregnancy is increased.&nbsp; In cases of rupture and significant hemorrhage, morbidity and mortality increase.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Prevention of ectopic pregnancy focuses on reducing risk factors:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Prompt treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to prevent PID</li>\n\t<li>Smoking cessation</li>\n\t<li>Careful management of fertility treatments to minimize the risk of ectopic implantation</li>\n\t<li>Use of contraception reduces the overall risk of ectopic pregnancy by preventing conception</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In women with a history of ectopic pregnancy, close monitoring of subsequent pregnancies with early ultrasound and β-hCG measurements is essential for early determination of pregnancy location.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Ectopic pregnancy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32700.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) occurs when a pregnancy implants in an abnormal location (ie, not in the uterine endometrium).&nbsp;
