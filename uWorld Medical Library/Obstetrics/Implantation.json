Successful implantation is essential for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy.&nbsp; This article provides a detailed overview of the implantation process, including its timing, physiologic mechanisms, hormonal influences, and clinical implications.</p>\n<h1>Fertilization and preimplantation development</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Fertilization</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L35658.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Fertilization occurs in the ampulla of the fallopian tube 1-2 days following ovulation.&nbsp; The sperm penetrates the zona pellucida of the ovum, allowing its genetic material to enter, forming a zygote.&nbsp; The zygote is swept through the fallopian tube toward the uterus by ciliary action and peristalsis of the muscularis mucosa.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cleavage</strong>:&nbsp; The zygote undergoes a series of mitotic divisions, creating smaller cells (blastomeres) that eventually reach the 16-32 cell morula stage (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L123093.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The morula enters the uterus 3-4 days following fertilization.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Blastulation</strong>:&nbsp; With the formation of a fluid-filled cavity (the blastocoel), the morula becomes a blastocyst and is composed of an inner cell mass (embryoblast), which becomes the embryo, and the outer cell mass (trophoblast), which becomes the placenta (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L123093.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Implantation</h1><br><br><p>Implantation refers to the process by which an embryo attaches to the uterine wall, invading the uterine endometrium and then the maternal vasculature for placental formation.&nbsp; The optimal timing of implantation is referred to as the \"window for implantation\" and is dependent on endometrial factors.&nbsp; Ideal endometrial conditions occur between days 16 and 22 (in a normal 28-day cycle), when the endometrium has reached peak secretory activity (under the influence of progesterone) and is rich in glycogen and lipids to support the developing embryo.&nbsp; Therefore, implantation most often occurs <strong>6-7 days after fertilization</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25886.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>The most common implantation site is the <strong>upper posterior wall of the uterus</strong>.&nbsp; Aberrant implantation sites result in ectopic pregnancies, which can occur at any site other than within the uterus (eg, fallopian tube, cervix).</p>\n<h1>Stages of implantation</h1><br><br><p>Implantation occurs through a 3-step process: apposition, adhesion, and invasion.</p>\n<h2>Apposition</h2><br><br><p>The blastocyst first \"hatches\" from the zona pellucida to form a loose connection with the endometrium, which occurs through progesterone-induced formation of pinopodes (smooth protrusions of the surface epithelial cells).&nbsp; The pinopodes remove fluid from the uterine cavity, driving contact between the blastocyst and uterine wall.</p>\n<h2>Adhesion</h2><br><br><p>Adhesion involves a collection of adhesion molecules (eg, integrins, laminins) expressed by the decidualized endometrium and the embryo, both of which facilitate strong junctional formations.</p>\n<h2>Invasion</h2><br><br><p>Invasion, also known as <strong>migration</strong>, refers to the trophoblast's intrusion between uterine epithelial cells to reach the basement membrane, which is the critical step in placental formation.&nbsp; The trophoblasts differentiate into 2-cell populations:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Syncytiotrophoblast</strong>:&nbsp; Outer, continuous, multinucleated (ie, no lateral cell walls) layer.&nbsp; These cells secrete hCG, which enters the maternal circulation and maintains the secretion of corpus luteum progesterone.&nbsp; Fluid-filled lacunae develop within this layer, which ultimately becomes the space for maternal blood later in pregnancy (intervillous space).&nbsp; The surface of the syncytiotrophoblasts enlarges and develops into villous structures, later becoming anchoring villi that fix the placenta and embryo to the uterine wall.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cytotrophoblast</strong>:&nbsp; Inner trophoblast layer, which is ultimately responsible for invading uterine spiral arteries to replace maternal endothelium.&nbsp; The result of this process is fundamental uterine vasculature remodeling, transforming high-resistance vessels into low-resistance vessels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Hormonal regulation</h1><h2>Progesterone</h2><br><br><p><strong>Progesterone</strong> is the key hormone initially produced by the <strong>corpus luteum</strong>, which decidualizes the endometrium (ie, prepares it for implantation).&nbsp; Progesterone also suppresses uterine contractions.&nbsp; By approximately 10 weeks gestation, the placenta reaches sufficient functional maturity to produce adequate levels of progesterone autonomously.&nbsp; At this point, a physiologic transition known as the luteal-placental shift occurs, wherein the placenta assumes full endocrine responsibility for progesterone synthesis, rendering the corpus luteum no longer essential for pregnancy maintenance (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59465.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>hCG</h2><br><br><p><strong>hCG</strong> is a pregnancy hormone secreted by <strong>syncytiotrophoblasts</strong>.&nbsp; It prevents corpus luteum degradation, thereby maintaining adequate progesterone production until placental takeover.</p>\n<h1>Clinical significance</h1><h2>Implantation bleeding</h2><br><br><p>Bleeding may occur at the site of implantation and can be seen clinically as vaginal bleeding.&nbsp; It is light in most cases, but there can be a wide range of presentations.&nbsp; In patients with irregular menstrual cycles, implantation bleeding may be confused with menstruation and can cause a discrepancy in the estimated gestational age and due date.</p>\n<h2>Implantation failure</h2><br><br><p>Implantation failure can be a cause of early pregnancy loss, infertility, or pregnancy complications.&nbsp; This may occur due to uterine abnormalities (eg, uterine septum, submucosal leiomyoma), luteal phase defects (ie, insufficient progesterone production to support the developing pregnancy), or lack of integrin expression during adhesion of the embryo to the uterine wall.</p><br><br><p>In addition, abnormal implantation with incomplete maternal vascular remodeling results in inadequate placental perfusion, which leads to preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction later in pregnancy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L63340.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Implantation is a multistep process that consists of apposition, adhesion, and invasion.&nbsp; It requires receptive decidualized endometrial and highly regulated hormonal signaling for success.&nbsp; Abnormalities in implantation can lead to early pregnancy loss, infertility, and late pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
