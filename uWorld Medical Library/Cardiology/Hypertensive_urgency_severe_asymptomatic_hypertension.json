Unlike hypertensive emergency (discussed in a separate article), which necessitates immediate and aggressive treatment to prevent irreversible organ damage, hypertensive urgency can typically be managed with gradual BP reduction over 24-48 hours.&nbsp; Although not immediately life-threatening, hypertensive urgency requires prompt medical attention to prevent progression to hypertensive emergency.</p><h1>Pathophysiology</h1><p>Several factors contribute to elevated BP in hypertensive urgency, though the acute rise in BP seen in hypertensive emergency is absent.</p><h2>Vascular dysfunction</h2><p>Chronic hypertension (present in many patients who experience hypertensive urgency) leads to structural changes in the vasculature, including increased arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction (eg, impaired nitric oxide production).&nbsp; These changes result in an elevated baseline BP that can be further exacerbated by stressors, such as pain or anxiety.</p><h2>Neurohormonal activation</h2><p>The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system play crucial roles in BP regulation.&nbsp; Dysregulation of the RAAS leads to increased sodium and water retention, vasoconstriction, and aldosterone-mediated potassium excretion, all contributing to elevated blood pressure.&nbsp; Increased sympathetic activity can cause vasoconstriction and increased cardiac output, raising blood pressure.</p><h2>Volume overload</h2><p>Excessive sodium intake, renal dysfunction, and nonadherence to diuretics can cause fluid retention, contributing to elevated BP.</p><h1>Risk factors</h1><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Chronic hypertension</strong> (particularly if poorly controlled or untreated):&nbsp; most significant risk factor.</li><li><strong>Medication nonadherence</strong>:&nbsp; either abrupt discontinuation or inconsistent use</li><li><strong>Renal impairment</strong>:&nbsp; chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury can lead to volume overload</li><li><strong>High-sodium diet</strong>:&nbsp; excessive dietary sodium increases fluid retention of fluid, which raises blood volume and cardiac output.&nbsp; Additionally, excess sodium can lead to vascular dysfunction and increased vascular resistance</li><li><strong>Stress and anxiety</strong>:&nbsp; psychological stress can acutely raise BP, especially in individuals with underlying hypertension.</li><li><strong>Secondary hypertension</strong>:&nbsp; from conditions like pheochromocytoma, Cushing syndrome, and hyperaldosteronism (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35223.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li></ul><h1>Clinical presentation</h1><p>Patients with hypertensive urgency typically present with <strong>significantly elevated BP</strong> but <strong>without end-organ damage</strong>.&nbsp; Occasionally, patients may have a mild, throbbing headache (vs severe headache in hypertensive emergency).</p><h1>Diagnosis</h1><p>The diagnosis of hypertensive urgency is based on the detection of markedly elevated BP in the absence of signs or symptoms of acute end-organ damage.&nbsp; It is crucial to differentiate hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency, as the latter requires immediate intervention.</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>BP measurement</strong>:&nbsp; confirm elevated BP readings on multiple occasions</li><li><strong>Assessment of symptoms</strong>:&nbsp; evaluate for any signs or symptoms suggestive of end-organ damage (eg, chest pain, shortness of breath, focal neurological deficits) that would suggest hypertensive emergency.</li><li><strong>Review of medication history</strong>:&nbsp; assess for recent changes or nonadherence in the medication regimen.</li></ul><h1>Laboratory evaluation and imaging</h1><p>While extensive testing is not always necessary in hypertensive urgency, certain testing may be useful to rule out end-organ damage or secondary causes of hypertension (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/38622.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Basic metabolic panel</strong>:&nbsp; to assess renal function and electrolyte levels, particularly if the patient has renal disease or is taking diuretics.</li><li><strong>Urinalysis</strong>:&nbsp; to rule out hematuria, which could indicate renal involvement.</li><li><strong>ECG</strong>:&nbsp; to assess for left ventricular hypertrophy or for ischemic changes (more commonly associated with hypertensive emergency).</li><li><strong>Chest X-ray</strong>:&nbsp; generally not required unless there is suspicion of heart failure or aortic dissection.</li></ul><h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><p>Distinguishing hypertensive urgency from other conditions with similar presentations is critical, as the management strategies differ significantly.</p><h2>Hypertensive emergency</h2><p>Both conditions present with markedly elevated BP.&nbsp; However, hypertensive emergency involves acute end-organ damage (eg, encephalopathy, myocardial infarction, renal failure) and requires immediate BP reduction with intravenous medications.</p><h2>Pheochromocytoma</h2><p>Both may present with episodes of severe hypertension.&nbsp; However, pheochromocytoma is characterized by episodic hypertension accompanied by palpitations, headache, and sweating.</p><h2>Anxiety-induced hypertension</h2><p>Both conditions can present with elevated BP and symptoms such as palpitations and headaches, but anxiety-induced hypertension is typically transient and related to acute stressors.&nbsp; The blood pressure usually normalizes with anxiety resolution and does not require antihypertensives.</p><h2>Substance use disorder</h2><p>Both can present with sudden, severe elevations in blood pressure.&nbsp; The hypertension associated with substance intoxication (eg, cocaine, amphetamines) is due to direct stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and is often accompanied by other signs such as tachycardia, agitation, chest pain, and neurological symptoms.&nbsp; Diagnosis is based on history and toxicology screening.&nbsp; BP will normalize once substance is no longer present.</p><h1>Management</h1><p>The management of hypertensive urgency focuses on the <strong>gradual reduction of BP over 24 to 48 hours</strong> typically using oral antihypertensive medications.&nbsp; Rapid BP reduction is usually not indicated and may be harmful.</p><h2>General principles</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Target BP</strong>:&nbsp; The goal is to lower BP to &lt;160/100 mm Hg over several hours to days, with long-term goals based on individual risk factors and comorbidities.</li><li><strong>Rate of blood pressure reduction</strong>:&nbsp; In most cases, a gradual reduction over several days (rather than several hours) is preferred because it reduces the risk of iatrogenic hypotension, which can cause significant complications (eg, cerebral ischemia, myocardial ischemia, acute kidney injury).&nbsp; Typically, the rate of reduction should not exceed more than 25%-30% over the first 2-4 hr.</li></ul><h2>Medication options</h2><p>Patients who have been previously treated with antihypertensives but were noncompliant can typically be started back on their previous medications.&nbsp; Patients with undiagnosed hypertension should be started on medications based on the risk of persistence of severe hypertension, the likely duration of severe hypertension, and risk of complications with rapid reduction in blood pressure.&nbsp; Many will require multiple agents to control their BP.</p><p>Medication options include the following (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/69278.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</strong><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Captopril</strong>:&nbsp; Rapid onset of action; typically used for acute BP reduction, particulary if the goal is to reduce pressure over several hours.&nbsp; Not typically indicated for long-term use.</li><li><strong>Lisinopril</strong>:&nbsp; Longer-acting, suitable for ongoing BP management.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Amlodipine</strong>:&nbsp; Often used due to its slow onset and sustained effect.</li><li><strong>Nifedipine extended-release</strong>:&nbsp; Provides gradual BP reduction.&nbsp; Immediate-release forms should be avoided due to the risk of precipitous BP drops.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Beta-blockers</strong><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Atenolol</strong>:&nbsp; Useful in patients with coexisting tachycardia or anxiety.</li><li><strong>Metoprolol</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Diuretics</strong><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Hydrochlorothiazide</strong>:&nbsp; Useful in patients with volume overload, though with risk of electrolyte disturbances (eg, hyponatremia).</li><li><strong>Chlorthalidone:</strong>&nbsp; Preferred for its longer duration of action.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Alpha-2 agonists</strong><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Clonidine</strong>:&nbsp; Can be used for rapid BP reduction; typically not used for long-term use due to risk of rebound hypertension when discontinued.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Follow-up</h2><p>Close follow-up is essential to ensure that BP is controlled, medications can be adjusted as needed, and the patient can be monitored for side effects.&nbsp; Patients should be reassessed within a few days to a week, with adjustments to therapy based on their response.</p><h1>Complications</h1><p>While hypertensive urgency itself does not involve acute end-organ damage, the potential for progression to hypertensive emergency remains if not properly managed.&nbsp; Complications can include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Progression to hypertensive emergency</li><li>Chronic hypertension complications (eg, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic kidney disease)</li></ul><h1>Prognosis</h1><p>The prognosis for patients with hypertensive urgency is generally favorable if BP is effectively managed.&nbsp; The key to preventing complications lies in ensuring adequate BP control and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive therapy.&nbsp; Long-term outcomes are largely determined by the patient's ability to maintain BP within target ranges and manage underlying risk factors.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Hypertensive urgency represents a critical point in the management of hypertension, where significant BP elevation occurs without immediate end-organ damage (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/43920.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
