This can lead to life-threatening complications (eg, myocardial infarction [MI]) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L41560.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Several antithrombotic agents have been developed to prevent and treat thromboembolic disease, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel):&nbsp; Prevent formation of the platelet plug.</li>\n\t<li>Anticoagulant agents (eg, warfarin, heparin, dabigatran):&nbsp; Prevent formation of the fibrin mesh by inhibiting various steps in the coagulation cascade (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L4326.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Arterial thromboses are primarily platelet-driven and related to vascular abnormalities (eg, atherosclerosis), in contrast to venous thromboses (eg, deep vein thrombosis), which contain fibrin-rich clots closely related to coagulation abnormalities.&nbsp; Therefore, in general, antiplatelet agents are preferred for arterial thromboses, and anticoagulant agents are preferred for venous thromboses, although some indications may overlap.</p><br><br><p>This article focuses on antiplatelet agents.&nbsp; In general, antithrombotic agents should be avoided if there is significant bleeding (eg, intracerebral hemorrhage) or risk for significant bleeding (eg, invasive procedures).</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Platelets (thrombocytes) are cell fragments that initiate hemostasis following endothelial injury.&nbsp; The first phase of hemostasis (primary hemostasis) generates a platelet plug, as follows (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L41111.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Platelet adhesion</strong> (adherence):&nbsp; Endothelial injury exposes connective tissue that contains von Willebrand factor, a protein that facilitates platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen via glycoprotein Ib (GP1b).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Platelet activation</strong>:&nbsp; Adhesion induces platelet activation, a process in which platelets undergo irreversible conformational changes (ie, taking on a spiky shape) and secrete substances that promote hemostasis, including:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>ADP:&nbsp; Interacts with certain platelet receptors (eg, P2Y12) to cause further platelet activation (including conformational changes to GPIIb/IIa receptors for platelet aggregation).</li>\n\t\t<li>Arachidonic acid:&nbsp; Undergoes conversion to thromboxane A<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> (TXA<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>), a substance that also induces platelet aggregation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L9256.png\" alt=\"Arachidonic acid metabolic pathways\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">Arachidonic acid metabolic pathways</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Platelet aggregation</strong>:&nbsp; GPIIb/IIIa receptors on activated platelets bind fibrinogen, facilitating aggregation of activated platelets to form the platelet plug.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Vascular abnormalities (eg, atherosclerosis) can pathologically trigger platelet activation, leading to thrombosis and subsequent life-threatening cardiovascular events (eg, MI, ischemic stroke).</p>\n<h1>Antiplatelet agents</h1><br><br><p>Because arterial thrombosis is primarily platelet-driven, management typically involves antiplatelet agents.&nbsp; These drugs target specific processes involved in platelet activation or aggregation through 1 of 3 basic mechanisms.</p>\n<h2>Inhibition of ligand formation</h2><br><br><p><strong>Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors</strong> (eg, aspirin, ibuprofen):&nbsp; COX-1 is expressed by platelets and converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.&nbsp; Prostaglandins are subsequently converted to TXA<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>, which induces platelet aggregation, as previously described.&nbsp; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit COX enzymes, thereby reducing platelet aggregation, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Aspirin</strong> irreversibly acetylates/inactivates both COX-1 and COX-2 (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24131.png\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Aspirin has a short half-life and affects only platelets that are already circulating when the drug is administered.&nbsp; However, because affected platelets are irreversibly acetylated, they remain inactivated for the duration of the platelets' lifespan (ie, ~7 days).&nbsp; In addition to platelet inactivation, aspirin can cause:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding:&nbsp; Aspirin may impair platelet aggregation and prostaglandin-dependent GI mucosal protection from gastric acid (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25950.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Low-dose aspirin is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in the risk for upper GI bleeding, and the risk continues to increase as the dose increases.&nbsp; Of note, proton pump inhibitors can reduce the risk for upper GI bleeding in patients taking aspirin.</li>\n\t\t<li>Acute kidney injury (AKI):&nbsp; Aspirin impairs renal vasodilation, leading to reduced renal perfusion and increased risk for AKI (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L47085.jpg\" alt=\"figure 9\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 9</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The risk for AKI increases as the dose increases, particularly in patients with hypovolemia or underlying chronic kidney disease.</li>\n\t\t<li>Anti-inflammatory effects:&nbsp; Aspirin impairs prostaglandin production.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Other NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) reversibly inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 and therefore have less antiplatelet activity compared to aspirin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Inhibition of platelet receptors</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>ADP receptor (P2Y12) inhibitors</strong> (eg, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, ticagrelor):&nbsp; Activated platelets release ADP, which binds receptors on other platelets to induce aggregation.&nbsp; P2Y12 inhibitors prevent ADP from binding the P2Y12 component of the receptors, which reduces ADP-induced expression of GPIIb/IIIa receptors and inhibits platelet aggregation.&nbsp; These drugs generally have a longer half-life than aspirin.</li>\n\t<li><strong>GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors</strong> (eg, tirofiban):&nbsp; During platelet activation, GPIIb/IIIa receptors undergo conformational changes to bind fibrinogen, which is the final common pathway leading to platelet aggregation.&nbsp; GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors block the receptor, preventing fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation.&nbsp; These drugs can be associated with significant thrombocytopenia, which may occur within 24 hours of administration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Interference with intracellular signaling</h2><br><br><p><strong>Cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitors</strong> (eg, cilostazol):&nbsp; Intracellular signaling by cAMP inhibits platelet activation.&nbsp; Phosphodiesterase-3 is responsible for metabolizing cAMP.&nbsp; Certain drugs can inhibit phosphodiesterase-3, allowing cAMP to accumulate and inhibit platelet activation.&nbsp; cAMP also accumulates in vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation.&nbsp; Cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with heart failure because its vasodilatory effects may lead to hypotension and it is associated with increased mortality.</p>\n<h1>Indications</h1><br><br><p>Antiplatelet agents are used both as monotherapy and in combination, depending on the clinical context, as discussed later.&nbsp; Of note, COX inhibitors (eg, aspirin) have other indications related to their anti-inflammatory properties (eg, Kawasaki disease, acute pericarditis):</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Acute coronary syndrome</strong> (eg, MI):&nbsp; Dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin, ADP-receptor inhibitor) is recommended, especially for the prevention of stent thrombosis in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention.&nbsp; In most cases, the ADP-receptor inhibitor is discontinued after 1 year, but aspirin is continued indefinitely.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Secondary prevention of cardiovascular events</strong>:&nbsp; In patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (eg, previous MI, stable angina, peripheral artery disease), long-term antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce the risk for subsequent events (ie, secondary prevention).&nbsp; Aspirin monotherapy is typically preferred; clopidogrel may be recommended for patients unable to take aspirin (eg, aspirin allergy).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack</strong>:&nbsp; Antiplatelet therapy is typically initiated within 24-48 hours of the event (in the absence of contraindications such as active bleeding) to reduce the risk for recurrence.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Peripheral artery disease</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29116.jpg\" alt=\"figure 10\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 10</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; This is an indicator of clinically significant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and antiplatelet therapy is recommended for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events (eg, MI), as described earlier.&nbsp; Cilostazol, which also has vasodilatory effects, may be added if patients have claudication symptoms (eg, pain with walking) related to peripheral artery disease.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors have limited indications but may be considered in certain cases (eg, significant thrombus burden during coronary angiography).</p>\n<h1>Monitoring and reversal</h1><br><br><p>In general, the most common and clinically significant risk associated with antiplatelet therapy is bleeding (eg, mucocutaneous, GI).&nbsp; Risk-benefit assessment is essential, particularly in elderly patients or those with comorbidities.&nbsp; Aside from periodic assessment for bleeding symptoms, routine monitoring during antiplatelet therapy is typically not necessary.&nbsp; Some agents with known associated adverse effects may require additional laboratory assessment (eg, complete blood count to monitor for thrombocytopenia with GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors).</p><br><br><p>Because aspirin has a short half-life, platelet transfusions may be considered for patients who have taken aspirin and subsequently developed active bleeding or needed an invasive procedure.&nbsp; Because the other antiplatelet agents have longer half-lives, multiple platelet transfusions may be required.</p><br><br><p>Very high doses of aspirin can be toxic, resulting in a life-threatening condition hallmarked by impaired oxidative phosphorylation with subsequent respiratory alkalosis and mixed acid-base disturbance.&nbsp; Aspirin use should be limited in children unless specifically indicated (eg, Kawasaki disease) due to the risk for Reye syndrome, a rare but life-threatening toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Antiplatelet agents are essential for the prevention and management of thrombotic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.&nbsp; Clinical use depends on the individual patient's risk for thrombosis versus bleeding, the timing of treatment (acute vs chronic), and the specific indication (eg, acute coronary syndrome, stroke).&nbsp; Dual antiplatelet therapy is common in the acute phase of high-risk conditions, followed by deescalation to monotherapy in long-term management.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
