The resulting venous hypertension leads to a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from cosmetic findings (eg, telangiectasias, varicose veins) to more advanced complications (eg, stasis dermatitis, lipodermatosclerosis, venous leg ulcers).&nbsp; CVI is a prevalent yet frequently underrecognized condition associated with substantial morbidity and a significant impact on patient quality of life.</p>\n<h1>Anatomy</h1><br><br><p>The lower extremity venous system consists of:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Superficial veins</strong>:&nbsp; Drain the skin and subcutaneous tissue.&nbsp; Important superficial veins of the lower extremity include:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Great saphenous vein</strong>:&nbsp; Runs along the medial leg and thigh and drains into the femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Small saphenous vein</strong>:&nbsp; Courses along the posterior calf and drains into the popliteal vein at the saphenopopliteal junction.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Deep veins</strong>:&nbsp; Accompany arteries and carry ~90% of venous return:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Include anterior tibial, posterior tibial, peroneal, popliteal, femoral, and external iliac veins.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Perforating (communicating) veins</strong>:&nbsp; Contain one-way valves directing blood from superficial to deep venous systems.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Venous valves</strong>:&nbsp; Present in both superficial and deep venous systems.&nbsp; Ensure unidirectional flow toward the heart; most numerous in the calf veins (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29406.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Anatomic abnormalities or functional disturbances within the lower extremity venous system can lead to CVI.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>CVI occurs when <strong>venous valves</strong> in the lower extremities become <strong>incompetent</strong>, allowing blood to flow in a retrograde direction.&nbsp; Normally, blood from the superficial veins drains through perforating veins into the deep venous system, where the calf muscle propels blood back to the heart against gravity through unidirectional valves.&nbsp; These valves can fail due to a variety of factors (eg, genetic factors, vein wall dilation, trauma, prior deep vein thrombosis [DVT]).&nbsp; If these valves fail, venous reflux and pooling of blood occur, leading to persistently high venous pressure (ie, venous hypertension).</p><br><br><p>Sustained <strong>venous hypertension</strong> causes capillary distension and endothelial dysfunction, increasing vascular permeability.&nbsp; This allows plasma proteins, macromolecules, and red blood cells (RBCs) to leak into the interstitial space.&nbsp; The extravasation of these elements triggers a local inflammatory response characterized by the activation of leukocytes and the release of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-α and IL-1β).&nbsp; In addition, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) become upregulated, degrading extracellular matrix components, weakening the venous walls, and further compromising valve integrity.&nbsp; Over time, these processes often lead to other associated conditions (eg, varicose veins, stasis dermatitis, lipodermatosclerosis, venous ulcers) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29158.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Associated clinical conditions</h1><br><br><p>Multiple chronic skin and vascular conditions may develop in association with CVI.</p>\n<h2>Varicose veins</h2><br><br><p>Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous superficial veins caused by venous valve incompetence (often from venous hypertension), which leads to blood pooling.&nbsp; Histologically, there is typically vessel dilation, intimal hyperplasia, and fibrosis.&nbsp; There may also be focal thrombosis, calcification, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and valvular leaflet fibrosis or distortion.</p>\n<h2>Stasis dermatitis</h2><br><br><p>Stasis dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition secondary to persistent edema and RBC extravasation.&nbsp; Histology may show perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and hemosiderin-laden macrophages.</p>\n<h2>Lipodermatosclerosis</h2><br><br><p>Lipodermatosclerosis is a progressive fibrosing disorder of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by longstanding venous hypertension.&nbsp; The condition is marked by subcutaneous fibrosis, fat necrosis, and dermal changes (eg, thickened vessels, inflammatory infiltrates, hemosiderin deposition from persistent RBC leakage).</p>\n<h2>Venous ulcers</h2><br><br><p>Venous ulcers are chronic, painful wounds caused by impaired microcirculation and chronic inflammation.&nbsp; These are typically found over the medial malleolus (high venous pressure) and worsen with increased leg dependency.&nbsp; Histopathology typically shows epidermal thinning and ulceration with dermal fibrosis, chronic inflammatory infiltrates, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, dilated capillaries, and characteristic pericapillary fibrin cuffs.</p><br><br><p>Together, these conditions reflect a continuum of changes driven by the chronic venous hypertension and inflammatory processes characteristic of CVI.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Risk factors can be broadly grouped into 3 conceptual categories: structural or mechanical compromise, inflammatory and hormonal influence, and lifestyle and functional contribution.</p>\n<h2>Structural or mechanical compromise</h2><br><br><p>Includes age-related valve degeneration, prior DVT (leading to postthrombotic syndrome), congenital venous malformations, and inherited connective tissue disorders (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).&nbsp; These factors disrupt normal valve function or venous flow.</p>\n<h2>Inflammatory and hormonal influence</h2><br><br><p>Smoking, estrogen exposure (from pregnancy or hormonal contraceptives), and female sex contribute to venous dilation or endothelial dysfunction, increasing venous pressure and valve failure over time.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle and functional contribution</h2><br><br><p>Obesity, prolonged standing or immobility, and sedentary behavior impair the calf muscle and elevate intraabdominal pressure, promoting venous stasis and chronic hypertension.</p><br><br><p>Mitigating modifiable risk factors can slow disease progression and reduce the burden of CVI-related complications (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/105046.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Venous insufficiency presents with a variety of signs and symptoms including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Leg heaviness, aching, or fatigue</strong>:&nbsp;

The initial assessment should focus on history (eg, leg heaviness, aching, worsening with prolonged standing) and risk factors followed by a thorough physical examination to assess for signs of CVI (eg, varicose veins, hyperpigmentation, stasis dermatitis).&nbsp; In many patients, imaging (eg, Duplex ultrasonography) is indicated to further evaluate and/or confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Imaging and laboratory evaluation</h1><h2>Imaging</h2><br><br><p>Imaging is an important component of CVI evaluation.</p><br><br><p><strong>Duplex ultrasonography</strong>:&nbsp; Noninvasive and cost-effective, this is the primary imaging modality for diagnosing and staging CVI.&nbsp; It combines traditional ultrasonography with Doppler flow analysis to provide high-resolution assessment of venous anatomy, compressibility, flow dynamics, and reflux.&nbsp; Indications include diagnostic uncertainty, failed conservative therapy, active or healed venous ulcers, and suspected venous obstruction (eg, DVT).</p><br><br><p><strong>Advanced imaging</strong> (eg, CT/MR venography or catheter-based venography):&nbsp; This is reserved for inconclusive Duplex studies, evaluation of pelvic or iliocaval pathology, or concern for suspected syndromes (eg, May-Thurner).</p><br><br><p>If <strong>arterial disease</strong> is suspected, adjunct noninvasive arterial testing (eg, pulse examination, ankle-brachial index, or arterial Duplex) should be performed.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Routine laboratory tests are typically unnecessary in CVI management, but targeted testing is warranted for suspected thrombophilia, systemic factors impairing ulcer healing (eg, anemia, malnutrition), or investigations into the underlying causes of edema (eg, congestive heart failure, liver disease).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of CVI starts with conservative, noninvasive measures to control symptoms and prevent progression.</p>\n<h2>General conservative measures</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Leg elevation</strong>:&nbsp; Reduces venous pressure and edema by promoting gravitational drainage; minimizes venous stasis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Compression therapy</strong> (≥30 mm Hg stockings or wraps):&nbsp; Improves venous return and provides symptom relief.&nbsp; Compression therapy should be avoided or used with caution in patients with comorbid arterial insufficiency.&nbsp; A vascular assessment (eg, pulse examination, ankle-brachial index) should be performed to evaluate for arterial insufficiency before initiating compression therapy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lifestyle modifications</strong>:&nbsp; Exercise enhances calf muscle function; weight loss decreases mechanical pressure on the venous system; smoking cessation mitigates vascular inflammation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Skin care</strong> (eg, emollients):&nbsp; Maintains the integrity of the skin barrier and reduces the risk of infection and stasis dermatitis.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Diuretics are often prescribed for patients with lower extremity edema; however, they are not recommended in patients with edema caused by CVI.</p>\n<h2>Additional management</h2><br><br><p>In addition to conservative measures, the following treatments may be indicated depending on the specific condition:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Varicose veins</strong>:&nbsp; First-line treatment of varicose veins is endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency or laser).&nbsp; Nonthermal options (mechanochemical ablation, cyanoacrylate adhesive) are alternatives for high-risk patients; sclerotherapy treats small varicosities.&nbsp; Surgery (eg, vein stripping) is reserved for refractory cases.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stasis dermatitis</strong>:&nbsp; Stasis dermatitis is managed with low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroids for inflammation.&nbsp; Wet dressings (saline or dilute acetic acid) help dry exudative lesions, reduce inflammation, and prepare skin for steroids.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lipodermatosclerosis</strong>:&nbsp; Lipodermatosclerosis is treated with topical corticosteroids for localized inflammation.&nbsp; Systemic steroids are generally avoided but may be used short term in severe cases.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Venous ulcers</strong>:&nbsp; Venous ulcer care includes debridement, moist wound maintenance, and infection control.&nbsp; Pharmacologic management includes pentoxifylline (enhances microcirculatory flow and tissue oxygenation) and micronized purified flavonoid fraction [MPFF] (reduces inflammation and venous hypertension) which can speed healing alongside compression.&nbsp; Persistent ulcers with venous reflux may require surgical or endovenous procedures.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Effective management of CVI relies on combining symptom control with targeted interventions based on disease severity.</p>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>Untreated or progressive venous insufficiency can lead to:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Recurrent cellulitis</strong>:&nbsp; Bacterial infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue in CVI-affected limbs is common, facilitated by skin barrier disruption, chronic edema, and local immune dysfunction.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Recurrent ulcers</strong>:&nbsp; Dedicated compression therapy and lifestyle modifications are the most important factors in preventing the recurrence of venous ulcers.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic pain and functional impairment</strong>:&nbsp; Patients with CVI often experience persistent lower extremity discomfort, heaviness, and fatigue that limit ambulation and quality of life.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Superficial thrombophlebitis</strong>:&nbsp; Inflammation and thrombosis of superficial veins can occur secondary to stasis and endothelial injury.&nbsp; The condition presents with localized pain, erythema, and a palpable cord-like vein.</li>\n\t<li><strong>DVT</strong>:&nbsp; Patients with CVI are at an increased risk for DVT due to impaired venous return and stasis.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Early recognition and management of these complications can significantly reduce morbidity and improve quality of life in patients with CVI.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Several conditions can mimic or coexist with CVI.</p>\n<h2>Predominant skin changes</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cellulitis</strong>:&nbsp; Infectious condition that typically presents with acute erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness of the involved extremity.&nbsp; Distinct from CVI, fever and systemic signs of infection are common, and localized symptoms are typically unilateral.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Peripheral arterial disease</strong>:&nbsp; Chronic vascular disorder that can present with ulcers; however, the ulcers typically have a punched-out appearance with distinct borders and pale wound beds and are located over pressure points (eg, toes, lateral malleolus).&nbsp; Other signs of arterial insufficiency (eg, intermittent claudication, diminished or absent peripheral pulses, cool extremities) are usually present.&nbsp; In addition, edema is uncommon.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Contact dermatitis</strong>:&nbsp; Acute, pruritic, erythematous rash that is confined to areas of allergen exposure.&nbsp; It may mimic stasis dermatitis but typically lacks associated edema, hemosiderin pigmentation, or varicosities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Predominant edema</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Lymphedema</strong>:&nbsp; A condition characterized by chronic pitting or nonpitting edema with thickened, fibrotic skin.&nbsp; It typically lacks venous varicosities, hemosiderin pigmentation, or venous ulcers seen in CVI.&nbsp; It commonly involves the dorsum of the foot and may progress to a firm, nonpitting texture.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Congestive heart failure</strong>:&nbsp; Bilateral, dependent lower extremity edema that can occur due to elevated venous pressures from impaired cardiac output and increased hydrostatic pressure in the systemic circulation.&nbsp; Unlike the chronic stasis seen in CVI, systemic signs of volume overload (eg, jugular venous distention, pulmonary crackles) are often present, and the edema typically improves with diuresis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nephrotic syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Generalized, soft, pitting edema that develops due to hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria.&nbsp; In contrast to CVI, the edema often begins periorbitally and progresses to the lower extremities.&nbsp; Venous stasis skin changes, varicosities, and ulceration are typically absent.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Venous obstruction</strong> (eg, DVT, pelvic or iliac vein compression):&nbsp; Acute or chronic unilateral or bilateral lower extremity edema that occurs due to venous obstruction.&nbsp; Unlike CVI, acute venous obstruction often presents with rapid-onset swelling, pain, and tenderness.&nbsp; Chronic venous obstruction may cause stasis changes resembling CVI but typically occurs in the setting of a known thrombotic event or compressive lesion.&nbsp; Duplex ultrasonography can assist in differentiating the two.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Adverse medication reaction</strong>:&nbsp; Bilateral lower extremity edema that can develop with the use of certain medications (eg, calcium channel blockers, gabapentinoids).&nbsp; Unlike CVI, drug-induced edema lacks skin changes (eg, hyperpigmentation, ulceration, varicose veins) and usually resolves with discontinuation of the associated medication.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Venous insufficiency is typically chronic but manageable.&nbsp; With appropriate conservative therapy (eg, compression, lifestyle modifications), symptoms can be controlled and progression slowed.&nbsp; Varicose veins may recur after treatment, especially in patients with persistent risk factors.&nbsp; Repeated treatments are often necessary.&nbsp; Hyperpigmentation and other skin changes (eg, atrophie blanche) associated with CVI are often permanent.&nbsp; Healed venous ulcers have a high recurrence rate without continued compression and tight control of contributing factors (eg, edema).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Venous insufficiency arises from valve incompetence and venous hypertension in the lower extremities.&nbsp; It encompasses a range of clinical features from varicose veins and stasis dermatitis to more severe complications (eg, lipodermatosclerosis, venous ulcers).&nbsp; The diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by Duplex ultrasonography.&nbsp; Management focuses on conservative measures including compression therapy, lifestyle modification, and skin care.&nbsp; When necessary, surgical or endovenous interventions may be required.&nbsp; Although the condition is chronic, effective symptom control and prevention of complications are achievable with consistent care.</p>\n\n            "
