It results from an accelerated rate of the normal impulse generation in the sinoatrial node, usually driven by an increase in sympathetic tone.&nbsp; It is often a normal physiologic response (eg, exercise, excitement) but also occurs in response to underlying pathology (eg, sepsis, pulmonary embolism).&nbsp; Sinus tachycardia in a patient at rest should raise suspicion for an underlying, potentially serious disturbance that requires management.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The sinoatrial node is the normal pacemaker of the heart, rhythmically generating impulses that travel through the cardiac conduction system and drive the coordinated contraction of the atria and ventricles (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L15146.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Under normal conditions (ie, normal sinus rhythm), the sinoatrial node generates impulses at a rate of 60-100/min.&nbsp; Sinus tachycardia is a rapid sinus rhythm, defined as a rate of sinoatrial node impulse generation <strong>&gt;100/min</strong>.<p></p>\n<h2>Increase in sympathetic tone </h2><br><br><p>Sinus tachycardia is usually driven by an increase in sympathetic tone to the heart.&nbsp; The major mechanisms of increased sympathetic tone include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Reflexive baroreceptor response to hypotension (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59557.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )</li>\n\t<li>Peripheral chemoreceptor response to increased metabolic demand in the tissues</li>\n\t<li>Hypothalamus-driven increase in adrenal medullary catecholamine release</li>\n\t<li>Effect of pharmacologic sympathomimetics&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Physiologic sinus tachycardia</h1><h2>Exercise</h2><br><br><p>Sinus tachycardia during exercise is driven by peripheral vasodilation that stimulates the baroreceptor response and by increased metabolic demand in the tissues.</p>\n<h2>Excitement</h2><br><br><p>Sinus tachycardia during periods of excitement is primarily driven by the hypothalamus (eg, fight or flight response).</p>\n<h1>Pathologic sinus tachycardia</h1><h2>Baroreceptor response to hypotension</h2><br><br><p>Sinus tachycardia due to a baroreceptor-mediated response to hypotension can be an important warning sign of early or developing shock.&nbsp; The hypotension may be subtle or clinically undetectable at first as the reflexive tachycardia increases cardiac output and is able to temporarily maintain compensated blood flow.&nbsp; Diagnostic considerations include the typical pathologic causes of hypotension and shock:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Intravascular volume depletion (eg, dehydration, hemorrhage)</li>\n\t<li>Left ventricular failure (eg, heart failure exacerbation, myocardial infarction)</li>\n\t<li>Peripheral vasodilation (eg, sepsis, anaphylaxis)</li>\n\t<li>Obstruction to blood flow (eg, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Increased metabolic demand in the tissues&nbsp; </h2><br><br><p>Peripheral chemoreceptors detect changes in the levels of oxygen and waste products in the blood and can stimulate sinus tachycardia in response.&nbsp; Diagnostic considerations include hypoxemia, hypercapnia, thyrotoxicosis, severe anemia, acute illness/systemic inflammation, fever.</p>\n<h2>Hypothalamus-driven increase in adrenal catecholamines</h2><br><br><p>This can be seen with anxiety or pain.</p>\n<h2>Ectopic catecholamine release or pharmacologic sympathetic stimulation</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pheochromocytoma</li>\n\t<li>Medical (eg, beta-1 agonists such as dobutamine) or recreational sympathomimetics (eg, cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine)</li>\n\t<li>Beta blocker or clonidine withdrawal</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Similarly, reduction in parasympathetic tone (leading to a relative increase in sympathetic tone) can be seen with anticholinergic medications (eg, atropine, tricyclic antidepressants).</p>\n<h2>Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST)</h2><br><br><p>The term \"inappropriate sinus tachycardia\" (IST) is used to describe an uncommon condition that usually affects young healthy women.&nbsp; The sinus tachycardia is likely due to an intrinsic disruption of the autonomic nervous system and workup reveals no identifiable cause.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><h2>Manifestations</h2><br><br><p>The symptomatic presentation of sinus tachycardia is usually driven by the underlying disease process, and the sinus tachycardia itself is typically <strong>asymptomatic</strong> and unnoticed by the patient.&nbsp; IST is a notable exception in which patients almost always have bothersome palpitations.</p><br><br><p>In general, the higher the heart rate in pathologic causes of sinus tachycardia, the more serious the underlying disturbance.</p>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2><br><br><p>Palpation of the radial pulse reveals a regular rhythm with rapid rate.</p>\n<h2>ECG</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Sinus tachycardia demonstrates a <strong>rapid and regular</strong> rhythm with <strong>P waves preceding each QRS</strong> complex (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97076.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Because the atrial conduction originates in the sinus node (like normal), all P waves have normal morphology, and the PR interval and P-P interval are <strong>constant</strong>.&nbsp; The atrial rate matches the ventricular rate and can range from 100/min to up to 180/min at rest.&nbsp; Rates &gt;200/min may be seen with exercise in young and healthy patients.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Sinus tachycardia should be suspected based on clinical presentation and is confirmed by ECG or cardiac monitoring.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>In rare cases where rapid sinus tachycardia may be difficult to differentiate from other types of supraventricular tachycardia, intravenous adenosine administration can help confirm the diagnosis by slowing conduction through the atrioventricular node and revealing the underlying atrial activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Other types of supraventricular tachycardia can present similarly to sinus tachycardia:</p>\n<h2>Atrial tachycardia </h2><br><br><p>Atrial tachycardia is uncommon, but it can closely mimic sinus tachycardia on ECG, demonstrating a rapid and regular rhythm with P waves preceding each QRS complex.&nbsp; The only difference from sinus tachycardia is that the P waves originate from a portion of the atria outside the sinoatrial node and have an abnormal morphology (size and shape).&nbsp; Differentiating atrial tachycardia from sinus tachycardia is important because atrial tachycardia typically requires rate control/antiarrhythmic management rather than management of an underlying disturbance.</p>\n<h2>Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT)</h2><br><br><p>AVNRT (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97079.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and AVRT (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L96104.png\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) demonstrate rapid and regular QRS complexes.&nbsp; The atria undergo retrograde depolarization either simultaneously with the ventricles or just after the ventricles, resulting in inverted P waves buried in the QRS complex (and not visible) or visible just after the QRS complex (visible P waves just after the QRS complex are more typical of AVRT).&nbsp; The ventricular rate can range from approximately 140/min to 220/min.<p></p>\n<h2>Atrial fibrillation and flutter</h2><br><br><p>Atrial fibrillation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L96996.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) demonstrates irregular R-R intervals and no organized P waves (fibrillation waves may be present).&nbsp; Atrial flutter (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L103392.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) can have R-R intervals that are variable or constant (ie, may appear regular).&nbsp; Characteristic flutter waves are present in the inferior ECG leads.<p></p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Because pathologic sinus tachycardia represents a response to an underlying disturbance, management primarily involves identification and treatment of the underlying cause.&nbsp; Examples of appropriate treatment of sinus tachycardia include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Intravenous normal saline for sinus tachycardia due to volume depletion</li>\n\t<li>Bronchodilators and glucocorticoids for sinus tachycardia due to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</li>\n\t<li>Intravenous normal saline and antibiotics for sinus tachycardia due to sepsis</li>\n\t<li>Pain medication for sinus tachycardia due to uncontrolled pain</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Pharmacologic slowing of sinus tachycardia (eg, with beta blockers) is rarely appropriate in the acute setting.&nbsp; Sinus tachycardia due to myocardial infarction is a notable exception as a reduction in heart rate decreases myocardial oxygen demand and may reduce infarct size.</p><br><br><p>Synchronized cardioversion is <strong>never</strong> appropriate for sinus tachycardia because an accelerated sinus rhythm is already present.&nbsp; Severe hypotension in a patient with sinus tachycardia is not due to the sinus tachycardia itself but is due to a separate disturbance that requires management.</p><br><br><p>Rarely, pharmacologic slowing of sinus tachycardia is indicated when workup fails to reveal an identifiable underlying cause (eg, IST).&nbsp; Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) are first-line therapy in this setting and can help prevent tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in patients with unexplained, sustained sinus tachycardia.</p>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>Sinus tachycardia that is sustained for a prolonged period (eg, weeks or more) creates risk for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of pathologic sinus tachycardia is primarily dependent on the underlying disturbance.&nbsp; Prompt recognition and management of a pathologic cause of sinus tachycardia is crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Sinus tachycardia results from an accelerated rate of the normal impulse generation in the sinoatrial node, usually driven by an increase in sympathetic tone.&nbsp; It is frequently a normal physiologic response, but it also occurs in response to underlying pathology.&nbsp; Sinus tachycardia in a patient at rest should raise suspicion for an underlying, potentially serious disturbance that requires management.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
