Pathologic causes of bradycardia can lead to signs and symptoms of low cardiac output or, in severe cases, sudden cardiac arrest.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><h2>Sinoatrial node</h2><br><br><p>The sinoatrial node is the normal pacemaker of the heart, rhythmically generating impulses that travel through the conduction system and drive the coordinated contraction of the atria and ventricles.&nbsp; Normally, the sinoatrial node spontaneously generates impulses at a rate of 60-100/min, with the rate of impulse generation determined by the balance of parasympathetic and sympathetic input.&nbsp; Slow generation of sinoatrial node impulses usually occurs due to enhanced parasympathetic tone, pharmacologic effects, or sinus node dysfunction.</p>\n<h2>Other intrinsic pacemaker cells</h2><br><br><p>If the sinoatrial node begins to fail, more distal parts of the conduction system also have an intrinsic pacemaker that can spontaneously generate impulses, but at a slower rate (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L69192.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; When these more distal pacemaker cells (eg, in the atrioventricular [AV] junction) do not receive a timely impulse from the sinoatrial node, they become the primary pacemaker of the heart, maintaining a slower rate of ventricular contraction<p></p><br><br><p>The AV node relays electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, and AV node dysfunction can contribute to bradycardia.&nbsp; Like the sinoatrial node, the AV node conduction rate is subject to pharmacologic effects and increases in parasympathetic tone.&nbsp; Ischemia and age-related cellular degeneration can also cause AV node dysfunction.</p>\n<h1>Causes of bradycardia</h1><h2>Physiologic</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Endurance training:&nbsp; Physiologic adaptations to high-intensity endurance training allow for increased stroke volume.&nbsp; Resting vagal tone is increased because this increased stroke volume makes it possible for a lower heart rate to maintain adequate resting cardiac output.</li>\n\t<li>Sleep:&nbsp; Increased vagal tone during sleep can lead to physiologic bradycardia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pathophysiologic</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Sinus node dysfunction (ie, <strong>sick sinus syndrome</strong>) from age-related fibrosis of the sinoatrial node can lead to impaired impulse generation.&nbsp; Less commonly, age-related fibrosis and calcification of the AV node, His bundle, and bundle branches can lead to AV block and cause or contribute to bradycardia.</li>\n\t<li>Acute myocardial infarction of the inferior wall, usually due to occlusion of the right coronary artery, is commonly complicated by bradycardia.&nbsp; The bradycardia likely results primarily from ischemia affecting the sinoatrial and AV nodes (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L41036.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), possibly with some contribution of enhanced parasympathetic tone and adenosine secretion triggered by infarction of myocardial tissue.</li>\n\t<li>Sleep disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea) can lead to prolonged apneas associated with hypoxemia.&nbsp; These cause increased parasympathetic tone that can induce sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, and AV block.</li>\n\t<li>Elevated intracranial pressure (eg, intracranial hemorrhage, brain tumor) leads to reflex bradycardia due to an increase in parasympathetic tone (Cushing reflex).</li>\n\t<li>Infections such as Lyme carditis (<em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>) can disrupt AV node conduction and cause bradycardia.&nbsp; Infective endocarditis can be complicated by a perivalvular abscess causing AV block.</li>\n\t<li>Infiltrative disease (eg, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis) can disrupt AV node conduction and cause bradycardia.</li>\n\t<li>Hypothyroidism can cause bradycardia likely due to a direct effect of inadequate thyroid hormone on the sinoatrial node and reduced metabolic demand in the tissues.</li>\n\t<li>Anorexia nervosa is associated with bradycardia primarily resulting from reduced metabolic demand and elevated parasympathetic tone.</li>\n\t<li>Hypothermia decreases the rate of sinoatrial node impulse conduction independent of parasympathetic tone.</li>\n\t<li>Prolonged hypoxemia can cause sinoatrial node ischemia and resulting bradycardia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pharmacologic agents usually cause bradycardia via a relative increase in parasympathetic stimulus to both the sinoatrial node and AV node.&nbsp; Common responsible agents include:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</li>\n\t\t<li>Beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers</li>\n\t\t<li>Digoxin</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Sedatives (eg, opioids, benzodiazepines) can cause bradycardia via CNS depression.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Mild bradycardia is typically asymptomatic.&nbsp; Patients with a ventricular rate &lt;50/min may present with symptoms of reduced cardiac output:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Dyspnea</li>\n\t<li>Angina</li>\n\t<li>Lightheadedness</li>\n\t<li>Syncope</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2><br><br><p>Palpation of the radial pulse reveals a slow rate.&nbsp; The rhythm is usually regular but may be irregular in patients with sinus pauses or second-degree AV block.</p>\n<h1>ECG:&nbsp; Impaired sinoatrial conduction </h1><br><br><p>The P wave on ECG is created by depolarization of the atria, which normally originates in the sinoatrial node.&nbsp; Therefore, impaired sinoatrial conduction is evidenced on ECG by reduced frequency of sinus P waves.</p>\n<h2>Sinus bradycardia and sinus pause/arrest</h2><br><br><p>Sinus bradycardia demonstrates a slow and regular rhythm with normally shaped P waves preceding each QRS complex (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L96810.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; When sinus node dysfunction is present, other findings that can be seen with sinus bradycardia include the following:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A sinus pause occurs when the sinoatrial node impulse generation is later than expected (based on the underlying sinus rhythm), and a P wave is delayed (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L96388.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Sinus arrest is a prolonged sinus pause that is so delayed that an intrinsic pacemaker below the sinoatrial node (usually in the AV junction) generates its own beat.&nbsp; The P wave is dropped (does not occur) and a junctional QRS complex occurs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Junctional escape rhythm</h2><br><br><p>With complete sinus node failure (continuous sinus arrest), an intrinsic pacemaker further down the conduction system becomes the primary pacemaker for the heart.&nbsp; ECG demonstrates no sinus P waves and typically a junctional escape rhythm, with the intrinsic pacemaker of the AV node generating impulses after failing to receive an impulse from the sinoatrial node (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L87463.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>ECG:&nbsp; Atrioventricular node blocks </h1><br><br><p>The PR interval on ECG is mostly representative of conduction through the AV node.&nbsp; Therefore, AV nodal block is recognized by alterations in the PR interval:</p>\n<h2>First-degree AV block </h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>First-degree AV block (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L90027.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) results from slowed conduction through the AV node and manifests on ECG as a <strong>prolonged PR interval &gt;0.2 sec</strong>.&nbsp;
