For most causes of RCM, ventricular wall stiffening occurs in the absence of wall thickening (normal ventricular wall thickness); however, RCM due to infiltrative disease, particularly amyloidosis, often demonstrates significant wall thickening.</p><br><br><p>The restricted RV filling in RCM creates specific physical examination findings, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Prominent y descent</strong> of the jugular venous pulse (JVP) waveform (because all filling must occur in early diastole)</li>\n\t<li>Positive <strong>Kussmaul</strong> sign (absence of the expected fall in JVP during inspiration)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These findings are also seen in constrictive pericarditis (described later) because there is similar impairment of RV diastolic filling.</p>\n<h1>Causes</h1><h2>Infiltrative disease</h2><br><br><p>Infiltrative disease involving the heart is likely the most common cause of RCM.&nbsp;

RCM is often challenging to differentiate from constrictive pericarditis because the clinical presentation of both conditions is primarily driven by restricted ventricular filling (especially RV filling).<p></p>\n<h2>Similarities and differences</h2><br><br><p>Given the restricted ventricular filling, shared features of RCM and constrictive pericarditis include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Prominent signs of right-sided heart failure</li>\n\t<li>Hepatojugular reflux</li>\n\t<li>Kussmaul sign</li>\n\t<li>Rapid y descent of the JVP waveform (Friedreich sign)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>History is often helpful in differentiating RCM from constrictive pericarditis:&nbsp; RCM is associated with infiltrative conditions (eg, sarcoidosis), whereas constrictive pericarditis classically occurs in the setting of recurrent pericarditis, recent cardiac surgery, or tuberculosis (eg, persistent cardiac inflammation leading to thickening and fibrosis).&nbsp; However, the utility of history can be limited in part because the conditions share some common etiologies (eg, mediastinal radiation).</p><br><br><p>Additional features useful in differentiating RCM and constrictive pericarditis are shown (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/120177.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pericardial knock</strong> is a <em>high-</em>frequency sound during early diastole that is thought to be caused by a sudden stop in ventricular filling due to restricted expansion of the pericardium.&nbsp; It is <strong>specific for constrictive pericarditis</strong> and does not typically occur in RCM.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pericardial calcification</strong> is common with constrictive pericarditis but is not expected with RCM.&nbsp; Pericardial calcification is best visualized with CT imaging, but it can also be evident on chest x-ray or cardiac MRI.&nbsp; Because the pericardium adheres to the myocardium in constrictive pericarditis, normal sliding of the pericardium over the myocardium, which can be visualized with specialized MRI techniques, can also help differentiate RCM from constrictive pericarditis.</li>\n\t<li>Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is released from the ventricular myocardium in response to ventricular stretch.&nbsp; Serum BNP level is usually elevated in RCM but normal in constrictive pericarditis because cardiac expansion is restricted by the stiffened pericardium and the ventricular myocardium is not stretched.</li>\n\t<li>An S3 is a <em>low</em>-frequency sound created by the abrupt deceleration of blood flow during the rapid filling phase of early diastole and is generally indicative of elevated cardiac filling pressures.&nbsp; An S3 is common in RCM but is rarely present in constrictive pericarditis.</li>\n\t<li>Ventricular interdependence describes a state in which the LV and RV must compete for limited space during diastolic filling, such that the filling of one ventricle is limited at the expense of the filling of the other.&nbsp; It occurs in conditions in which ventricular expansion is externally restricted (eg, constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade); it does not occur in RCM as there is no external restriction and LV and RV filling remain independent of one another.&nbsp; Ventricular interdependence is indicated by respirophasic shifting of the interventricular septum on echocardiography.&nbsp; Inspiration increases venous return to the RV; in constrictive pericarditis, RV expansion is rigidly restricted at the lateral walls and the septum is forced to shift leftward into the LV to increase RV volume and accommodate the increased venous return.&nbsp; Respirophasic shifting of the interventricular septum confirms constrictive pericarditis (vs RCM).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Management implications</h2><br><br><p>Differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from RCM is crucial because management of the 2 conditions is entirely different.&nbsp; Management of constrictive pericarditis typically involves pericardiectomy, which provides no benefit for RCM; details of RCM management are presented in the upcoming section.</p>\n<h1>Other differential diagnosis of RCM</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hypertensive heart disease and HFpEF:&nbsp;

Therefore, treatment is aimed at symptom control and management of the underlying cause of RCM.</p>\n<h2>Symptom control</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Diuretics (eg, furosemide) improve volume overload in RCM.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>The use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (ie, angiotensin blocker-neprilysin inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers), beta blockers (eg, metoprolol), mineralocorticoid antagonists (eg, spironolactone), and SGLT-2 inhibitors (eg, empagliflozin) is not indicated.&nbsp; These medications are typically avoided unless warranted for a separate indication (eg, diabetes mellitus).&nbsp; In general, vasodilators must be used with caution in RCM because they can further impair diastolic filling and precipitate hypotension.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Medical therapy targeted at the underlying cause of RCM</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for cardiac amyloidosis due to AL, or chemotherapy (eg, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide) for patients not eligible for HCT</li>\n\t<li>Transthyretin protein stabilizers (eg, tafamidis) for cardiac amyloidosis due to ATTR</li>\n\t<li>Glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive agents (eg, mycophenolate) for cardiac sarcoidosis</li>\n\t<li>Phlebotomy or iron chelation therapy for RCM due to hemochromatosis</li>\n\t<li>Cardiac transplantation as the definitive treatment for end-stage heart failure due to RCM</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Atrial fibrillation is common in RCM due to restricted ventricular diastolic filling causing atrial dilation and stretching.</li>\n\t<li>Conduction system disturbances, especially atrioventricular block, are common with RCM.&nbsp;

Patients awaiting cardiac transplantation for RCM have the highest mortality rate relative to those with other causes of end-stage heart failure, perhaps owing to the limited availability of goal-directed medical therapies for RCM.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Restrictive cardiomyopathy is the least common type of cardiomyopathy, characteristically involving stiffened (and sometimes thickened) ventricular walls that lead to diastolic dysfunction and heart failure.&nbsp; Common causes include infiltrative disease (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), mediastinal radiation therapy, and inherited familial disease.&nbsp; Differentiation from similarly presenting conditions, namely constrictive pericarditis, is crucial in the diagnosis.&nbsp; Although restrictive cardiomyopathy causes heart failure in the setting of a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, it is generally considered a separate entity from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and the treatment differs.&nbsp; In general, management of restrictive cardiomyopathy is challenging and the prognosis is poor.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
