It can be caused by structural abnormalities of the mitral valve apparatus itself (primary MR) or from left ventricular dysfunction that impairs valve closure despite a structurally normal valve (secondary or functional MR).&nbsp; Severe MR causes substantial hemodynamic disruption that leads to heart failure.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The mitral valve is composed of an anterior leaflet and a posterior leaflet, each supported by chordae tendineae attached to a papillary muscle.&nbsp; MR most commonly results from disruption of one or more of these 4 components (<strong>primary MR</strong>) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44759.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Less commonly, a separate disease process (eg, ischemic heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy) causes left ventricular dysfunction that leads to impaired mitral valve closure despite normal valve structure (<strong>secondary MR</strong>).<p></p><br><br><p>MR usually develops gradually (chronic MR), but an abrupt insult to the mitral valve (eg, chordae tendineae rupture) can cause acute MR.&nbsp; In MR of any cause, a portion of blood that is normally ejected into the aorta during systole instead flows back into the left atrium, increasing left atrial volume and pressure.&nbsp; Left ventricular volume is also increased because during diastole the left ventricle must fill with the increased left atrial blood volume (both normal left atrial volume from the pulmonary circulation and the regurgitant blood volume).&nbsp; The hemodynamic consequences of MR depend on the acuity of the valve regurgitation.</p>\n<h2>Chronic MR</h2><br><br><p>In chronic MR, the left atrium and left ventricle have time to adapt to the gradual increase in left-sided blood volume.&nbsp; The left atrium increases compliance and enlarges to accommodate the increased blood volume with a relatively minor increase in pressure.&nbsp; Similarly, the left ventricle undergoes eccentric hypertrophy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13550.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) to increase compliance and accommodate the volume overload.&nbsp; The eccentric hypertrophy also allows for a compensatory increase in stroke volume to help maintain forward blood flow: because a portion of stroke volume flows backward into the left atrium during systole, the total stroke volume must increase to maintain adequate forward blood flow into the aorta (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L117251.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Eccentric hypertrophy and other compensatory mechanisms (eg, sympathetic activation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation) are temporarily able to maintain increased stroke volume and adequate forward blood flow at the expense of increased left ventricular wall stress.&nbsp; However, eventually the compensatory mechanisms become overwhelmed and contractile dysfunction develops, progressing to decompensated heart failure (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L40799.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Acute MR</h2><br><br><p>In acute MR, the left atrium and left ventricle do not have time to adapt to abrupt valvular regurgitation and left-sided volume overload, and decompensated heart failure and often cardiogenic shock rapidly develop.</p>\n<h1>Etiologies</h1><h2>Chronic primary MR</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Degenerative mitral valve disease is the most common cause of chronic primary MR in medical resource–rich countries.&nbsp; <strong>Myxomatous degeneration</strong>, which typically manifests as mitral valve prolapse, involves mucopolysaccharide deposition and collagen disruption that results in thickening and redundancy of the mitral valve leaflets and impaired valve closure.&nbsp; It can occur as an isolated valvular process or in association with syndromic connective tissue disease (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rheumatic heart disease</strong> most commonly causes mitral stenosis, but it can also cause MR.&nbsp; It is a rare cause of MR in medical resource–rich countries, but a common cause of MR in medical resource–limited countries.&nbsp; Rheumatic MR tends to present 1-2 decades earlier in life than does rheumatic mitral stenosis, often affecting patients age &lt;30.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infective endocarditis</strong>:&nbsp; MR is a common sequela of infective endocarditis, often persisting after antibiotic treatment.</li>\n\t<li>Congenital defects:&nbsp; A leaflet defect causing MR is often seen with congenital endocardial cushion defects, including septum primum atrial septal defect and complete atrioventricular canal defect.&nbsp; These defects carry a common association with Down syndrome.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Chronic secondary MR</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Chronic secondary MR most often occurs as a complication of <strong>chronic heart failure</strong> that is due to a nonvalvular disease process (eg, ischemic heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy).&nbsp; The left ventricular dilation that develops with heart failure causes lateral displacement of the papillary muscles and enlargement of the mitral valve annulus, leading to impaired valve closure despite an intrinsically normal mitral valve (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/52401.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Acute MR</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Papillary muscle rupture</strong> (or displacement) is a potential mechanical complication of inferior wall myocardial infarction that can lead to acute MR.</li>\n\t<li>Spontaneous <strong>chordae tendineae rupture</strong> can complicate mitral valve prolapse and lead to acute MR.</li>\n\t<li>Infective endocarditis:&nbsp; Rapidly progressive mitral valve endocarditis (eg, due to <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>) can precipitate acute MR.</li>\n\t<li>Iatrogenic mitral valve injury:&nbsp; Failed repair of mitral stenosis (eg, failed commissurotomy) and other intracardiac procedures can damage the mitral valve leaflets to impair valve closure and cause acute MR.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Histopathology of MR due to myxomatous degeneration typically shows valve thickening and distorted structure with proteoglycan accumulation.&nbsp; Rheumatic MR may demonstrate evidence of active inflammation (eg, lymphocyte infiltration) or postinflammatory damage (eg, collagen deposition, fibrosis).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><h2>Manifestations&nbsp;</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chronic MR:</strong>&nbsp; Patients with mild or moderate chronic MR are <strong>asymptomatic</strong>.&nbsp; The compensated period of severe MR can last for years before the following symptoms of heart failure develop:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Dyspnea on exertion</strong> usually develops first, resulting from inability to adequately increase stroke volume during exercise.&nbsp; As left ventricular contractile dysfunction occurs, patients begin to experience orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea due to pulmonary edema, followed by signs and symptoms of right-sided heart failure (eg, jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Atrial fibrillation</strong> is common with chronic severe MR due to left atrial stretching and enlargement.&nbsp; It can precipitate heart failure symptoms in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic and is often responsible for the initial symptomatic presentation of chronic severe MR.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acute MR:</strong>&nbsp; Acute MR presents with <strong>rapidly developing decompensated heart failure</strong> (eg, pulmonary edema) and often cardiogenic <strong>shock</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The characteristic murmur of MR is <strong>holosystolic</strong> and best heard at the cardiac <strong>apex</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/75357.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In MR due to mitral valve prolapse, there is typically a midsystolic click followed by a mid-to-late systolic murmur of MR (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/72337.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In acute MR, the murmur is often faint or absent because of the minimal pressure gradient between the left ventricle and left atrium (left atrial pressure rapidly increases and equalizes with left ventricular pressure).</li>\n\t<li>S1 is typically soft due to impaired mitral valve closure.</li>\n\t<li>An S3 (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/76843.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is typically heard due to left ventricular volume overload.&nbsp;

On echocardiography, the diagnosis is made based on the presence of a regurgitant jet from the left ventricle to the left atrium.&nbsp; Regurgitation of ≥50% of stroke volume&nbsp;indicates severe MR.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Mitral stenosis</strong> can present similarly to MR with pulmonary edema and other signs and symptoms of heart failure.&nbsp; However, mitral stenosis is recognized by a rumbling diastolic murmur with presystolic accentuation.&nbsp; In addition, the left ventricle is not subjected to volume or pressure overload in mitral stenosis, so no left ventricular hypertrophy is expected (eg, normal point of maximal impulse).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Aortic regurgitation</strong> can present similarly to MR with eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy and signs and symptoms of heart failure.&nbsp; However, aortic regurgitation is recognized by a decrescendo diastolic murmur.&nbsp; In addition, aortic regurgitation demonstrates a characteristic hyperdynamic circulation (eg, bounding pulses, widened pulse pressure) caused by increased stroke volume.&nbsp; Although stroke volume is increased in chronic MR, hyperdynamic circulation does not occur because a large portion of the stroke volume regurgitates into the left atrium rather than passing into the aorta and systemic circulation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tricuspid regurgitation</strong> causes a holosystolic murmur similar to that of MR.&nbsp; However, the murmur is best heard at the left lower sternal border and, like most right-sided murmurs, increases in intensity with inspiration.&nbsp; Severe tricuspid regurgitation can cause right-sided heart failure but would not cause pulmonary edema.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nonvalvular left ventricular failure</strong> (eg, ischemic heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy) commonly causes secondary MR, which must be differentiated from primary MR in order to guide appropriate management.&nbsp; Secondary MR is usually mild to moderate (rarely severe), and echocardiography reveals a normal mitral valve apparatus with left ventricular dilation or hypokinesis responsible for the inadequate valve closure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><h2>Chronic primary MR</h2><br><br><p>Surgical mitral valve repair or replacement is the definitive treatment for chronic primary MR.&nbsp; Whenever possible, <strong>mitral valve repair</strong> is favored over replacement because replacement makes use of a prosthetic valve that often requires lifelong anticoagulation (in the case of a mechanical prosthetic valve) and also increases the risk of other complications (eg, infective endocarditis).&nbsp; Occasionally, a percutaneous mitral valve clip procedure may provide adequate mitral valve repair without requiring surgery.</p><br><br><p>The timing of surgery for chronic primary MR can be challenging because once a patient develops heart failure symptoms, irreversible left ventricular contractile dysfunction is often already present.&nbsp; Therefore, periodic echocardiography is needed to monitor for progression of MR and for the onset of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.&nbsp; The goal of echocardiography surveillance is to optimize the timing of surgery such that patients are able to use their native valve as long as possible yet undergo surgery early enough to prevent irreversible left ventricular dysfunction.</p><br><br><p>In asymptomatic patients with severe chronic primary MR, clinical follow-up with echocardiography surveillance is recommended every 6 months to a year.&nbsp; Surgical valve repair or replacement is recommended based on the following criteria:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Chronic severe MR causing any symptoms</li>\n\t<li>Chronic severe MR with left ventricular dilation or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 30%-60% (regardless of symptoms)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The relatively high upper limit of the LVEF criterion is because the expected LVEF in severe MR is substantially higher than normal given that a large portion of the ejection fraction regurgitates through the low resistance pathway to the left atrium (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45803.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Once LVEF reaches ≤60%, contractile dysfunction has likely begun.<p></p><br><br><p>In patients with chronic severe MR with a high likelihood of successful valve repair (rather than replacement), valve surgery should also be considered based on the following criteria:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Asymptomatic with LVEF &gt;60% (preemptive valve repair)</li>\n\t<li>Symptomatic with LVEF &lt;30% (these patients usually have irreversible left ventricular contractile dysfunction but may occasionally benefit from valve surgery)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The benefit of <strong>medical therapy</strong> for chronic severe MR is limited, but it can be useful while symptomatic patients await surgery or in patients who are not surgical candidates.&nbsp; Therapies include diuretics (eg, furosemide) to improve volume overload; arterial vasodilators (eg, ACE inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium blockers), which reduce systemic vascular resistance, allowing a higher percentage of stroke volume to eject into the aorta (rather than regurgitate into the left atrium); and other goal-directed therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (eg, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers).</p>\n<h2>Chronic secondary MR</h2><br><br><p>Surgery is rarely indicated for secondary MR, and management is aimed at <strong>addressing the underlying cause</strong> of the MR (eg, medical management of dilated cardiomyopathy).&nbsp; A transcatheter mitral valve clip is sometimes helpful in patients with persistent symptoms of chronic secondary MR despite optimal medical therapy.</p>\n<h2>Acute MR</h2><br><br><p>Acute MR typically requires <strong>emergency surgical valve repair</strong> or replacement.&nbsp; Arterial vasodilators or other means of afterload reduction (eg, aortic balloon pump) can be a helpful temporizing measure prior to emergency surgery.</p>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is the most common complication of chronic MR.&nbsp; If valve surgery is delayed for too long, left ventricular dysfunction is permanent and LVEF does not recover.</li>\n\t<li>Without emergency surgical intervention, acute MR can lead to cardiogenic shock that can rapidly progress to cardiac arrest.</li>\n\t<li>Atrial fibrillation is common with chronic MR.&nbsp; It can precipitate heart failure symptoms and also increases thromboembolic risk.</li>\n\t<li>Left-sided heart failure from chronic severe MR can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (group 2 pulmonary hypertension) and right-sided heart failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Untreated chronic severe MR is eventually fatal.&nbsp; However, the prognosis is good for patients who undergo timely and successful valve surgery.&nbsp; The long-term prognosis is slightly better for patients who undergo successful valve repair rather than replacement (eg, lower thromboembolic risk, lower endocarditis risk), which highlights the importance of timely mitral valve repair whenever possible.&nbsp; Acute MR is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality because it causes a critical clinical condition that requires emergency valve surgery.&nbsp; However, the prognosis can be favorable with successful emergency valve surgery.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Mitral regurgitation results from impaired closure of the mitral valve leaflets, leading to backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole.&nbsp; It can be caused by disruption of the mitral valve itself (primary mitral regurgitation) or by left ventricular dysfunction that impairs valve closure despite a normal valve (secondary or functional mitral regurgitation).&nbsp; The hemodynamic consequences depend on the acuity of the valve regurgitation.&nbsp; In chronic mitral regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and compensatory eccentric hypertrophy allow for accommodation of left-sided volume overload, and a compensatory increase in stroke volume can temporarily maintain adequate forward blood flow.&nbsp; In acute mitral regurgitation, the left atrium and left ventricle do not have time to adapt to the left-sided volume overload and decompensated heart failure rapidly develops.&nbsp; Mitral valve surgery is the definitive therapy for severe primary mitral regurgitation; valve repair is favored over valve replacement whenever possible.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
