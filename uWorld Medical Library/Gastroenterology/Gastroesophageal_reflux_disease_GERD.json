This allows regurgitation of acidic gastric contents into the esophagus, leading to inflammation, erosion, and ulceration.&nbsp; Conditions that decrease esophageal peristalsis further increase exposure of the esophageal mucosa to regurgitated acid.</p><h1>Risk factors </h1><p>Major risk factors for GERD include the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Decreased LES tone</strong>:&nbsp; smoking, excessive alcohol intake, certain medications (eg, nitrates, calcium channel blockers)</li><li><strong>Abnormal LES structure</strong>:&nbsp; hiatal hernia</li><li><strong>Increased intra-abdominal pressure</strong>:&nbsp; obesity, pregnancy, overeating</li><li><strong>Decreased gastric motility</strong>:&nbsp; gastroparesis, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists</li></ul><h1>Pathology </h1><p>Based on endoscopic findings, GERD can be classified into erosive esophagitis (ie, visible breaks in mucosa) and nonerosive reflux disease (ie, no obvious mucosal injury).&nbsp; These changes reflect how chronic exposure to gastric acid can lead to inflammation, erosion, and ulceration of the esophageal mucosa.&nbsp; Many patients do not have gross endoscopic abnormalities, but microscopic changes may be present.&nbsp; Histopathologic findings are largely nonspecific and commonly include neutrophilic or eosinophilic infiltrates, basal cell hyperplasia, and elongation of papillae.</p><h1>Clinical presentation and diagnosis </h1><p>Common symptoms of GERD include burning epigastric and retrosternal pain (heartburn), regurgitation of gastric acid into the hypopharynx and mouth (acid brash), and odynophagia.&nbsp; Extraesophageal manifestations can include cough, hoarseness, and wheezing.&nbsp; Symptoms are often worse at night or when recumbent.</p><p>GERD is diagnosed clinically based on <strong>classical symptoms</strong> (burning and/or regurgitation), and empiric therapy is often started.&nbsp; Endoscopy is indicated in patients who have alarm features or fail empiric therapy.&nbsp; <strong>Alarm symptom</strong>s include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Dysphagia/odynophagia</li><li>New onset of dyspepsia age ≥60</li><li>Unexplained weight loss</li><li>Iron deficiency</li><li>Gastrointestinal bleeding</li><li>Persistent vomiting</li></ul><p>Endoscopy may also be considered in patients who have had multiple risk factors for Barrett esophagus (intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus), including patients with longstanding GERD symptoms (eg, &gt;5 years).</p><h1>Management </h1><p>Management of GERD aims to alleviate symptoms, heal mucosal damage, and prevent complications.&nbsp; Strategies include lifestyle modifications (eg, weight loss, dietary changes), pharmacotherapy (eg, antacids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine-2 receptor antagonists), and, in refractory cases, surgical intervention (eg, Nissen fundoplication (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84686.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).<p></p><p>The choice of medical therapy depends on the severity of symptoms (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13232.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Mild and infrequent symptoms</strong> (ie, &lt;2 days a week) can be treated with <strong>as-needed antacids</strong> (eg, calcium carbonate), which directly neutralize gastric acid, or <strong>twice-daily H2 receptor antagonists</strong>, which decrease acid secretion by blocking the H2 receptor on gastric parietal cells.</li><li><strong>Severe or frequent symptoms</strong> (ie, ≥2 days/week) are best treated with <strong>daily proton pump inhibitor</strong> (PPI) therapy, which irreversibly inhibits the hydrogen-potassium ATPase pump to provide the greatest amount of acid suppression.&nbsp; When GERD has had an inadequate response to H2RAs, a trial of PPI therapy should be attempted to enhance symptom control.</li></ul><p>PPIs should be started at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to satisfactorily alleviate symptoms.&nbsp; Patients who have persistent symptoms on once daily PPI therapy should be trialed on twice-daily PPI therapy.&nbsp; Those who fail empiric therapy should receive further workup with upper endoscopy (to rule out alternative diagnoses) and esophageal pH monitoring (to confirm reflux and quantify reflux amount and patterns).</p><h1>Complications </h1><p>In addition to esophagitis, complications of GERD include esophageal strictures, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma.</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Esophageal stricture</strong>:&nbsp; is due to reparative collagen deposition in response to esophageal mucosal damage caused by acidic gastric contents.&nbsp; It can cause mechanical obstruction in patients with GERD, leading to symptoms of esophageal dysphagia, characterized by normal initiation of a swallow (eg, no choking, coughing) followed by a sensation that food \"sticks\" within the chest.&nbsp; Imaging reveals generally symmetric, concentric narrowing in the distal esophagus.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Barrett esophagus</strong>:&nbsp; is the metaplastic replacement of normal stratified squamous epithelium with columnar epithelium (that normally lines the intestines) in response to chronic gastric acid exposure in the lower esophagus (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L63109.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; It increases the risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma; therefore, endoscopic screening (with biopsy based on suspicious findings) should be considered for patients with multiple risk factors (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/91971.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Barrett esophagus accompanied by dysplasia could indicate an even higher risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma.&nbsp; In general, Barrett esophagus should be treated with PPI therapy to prevent cancer and control reflux symptoms.&nbsp; Depending on the degree of dysplasia, further endoscopic surveillance versus eradication therapy may be necessary.</li><li><strong>Esophageal adenocarcinoma</strong>:&nbsp; Most cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma arise in the distal esophagus in the setting of Barrett esophagus.&nbsp; Although the metaplastic columnar cells of Barrett esophagus are better suited to handle the presence of acid in the distal esophagus, they are also much more likely to become dysplastic and undergo malignant transformation into esophageal adenocarcinoma.&nbsp; (In contrast, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus arises anywhere in the esophagus—including the proximal and mid esophagus—in patients with risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use.)&nbsp; Manifestations of esophageal cancer include persistent burning chest pain, progressive solid-food dysphagia, mechanical obstruction, and significant weight loss.</li></ul><p>Extraesophageal complications include respiratory complications (eg, asthma exacerbation, laryngitis, aspiration pneumonia) and dental erosions.</p><h1>Differential diagnosis </h1><p>The differential diagnosis of GERD includes gastrointestinal and cardiopulmonary conditions:</p><h2>Gastrointestinal</h2><p><strong>Esophagitis</strong></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Infectious and pill esophagitis:&nbsp; Both infectious and pill esophagitis may manifest with symptoms such as odynophagia, retrosternal discomfort, and dysphagia.&nbsp; However, infectious esophagitis, commonly caused by herpes simplex virus, <em>Candida</em> species, or cytomegalovirus, may exhibit additional signs such as oral thrush or herpetic lesions; pill esophagitis, often triggered by medication ingestion, may present with acute-onset symptoms following recent medication use, along with endoscopic findings of mucosal erosions or ulcerations correlating with the pill's location.</li><li>Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE):&nbsp; EoE is a chronic immune-mediated disorder characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of the esophagus.&nbsp; It often presents in young patients.&nbsp; Symptoms include dysphagia, food impaction, and reflux-like symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation.&nbsp; Symptoms of EoE usually do not improve with PPI therapy.&nbsp; Endoscopic evaluation with biopsy is necessary to diagnose EoE and differentiate it from GERD.</li></ul><p><strong>Esophageal motility disorders</strong></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Conditions such as achalasia, esophageal spasm, and ineffective esophageal motility can manifest with dysphagia, chest pain, and regurgitation, mimicking GERD symptoms.&nbsp; Differentiating these disorders from GERD often requires additional tests such as esophageal manometry and barium swallow studies.&nbsp; Achalasia (inadequate relaxation of the LES) typically manifests with progressive dysphagia to both solids and liquids; barium swallow typically shows a bird-beak pattern at the LES.&nbsp; Diffuse esophageal spasm presents with intermittent or progressive dysphagia, often accompanied by chest pain, with esophageal manometry revealing simultaneous, high-amplitude contractions in the distal esophagus.</li></ul><p><strong>Peptic ulcer disease</strong> (PUD)</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Peptic ulcers, particularly gastric and duodenal ulcers, primarily cause epigastric pain (particularly related to food) and fullness.&nbsp; Reflux symptoms may occur but are not necessarily related to PUD.&nbsp; GERD-induced erosive esophageal disease with development of esophageal ulcers is often marked by a worsening of baseline GERD symptoms and the development of odynophagia (painful swallowing).</li></ul><h2>Cardiac</h2><p>Cardiac conditions such as angina or myocardial infarction can present with chest pain that may be mistaken for GERD-related symptoms.&nbsp; Risk factors, clinical presentation, and diagnostic tests such as ECG and cardiac enzymes help differentiate cardiac causes from GERD.</p><h2>Respiratory</h2><p>Conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and upper respiratory tract infections can present with cough, wheezing, and chest tightness, overlapping with GERD symptoms.&nbsp; Clinical history, physical examination, and pulmonary function tests aid in distinguishing respiratory conditions from GERD.</p><h1>Prognosis </h1><p>With appropriate management and lifestyle modifications, the prognosis of GERD is generally favorable.&nbsp; However, patients with complications such as Barrett esophagus require close monitoring due to the increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.</p><h1>Special considerations </h1><h2>Gastroesophageal reflux vs GERD in infants</h2><p>Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), or spit-up, is common and normal in the majority of infants as they have a relatively relaxed lower esophageal sphincter.&nbsp; The esophagus is also shorter and the stomach is smaller compared with that of older children.&nbsp; Breast milk and formula are easily regurgitated up the esophagus and out the mouth.</p><p>GER typically presents at age &lt;6 months (with peak symptoms at age 4 months), improves around age 6 months (when the infant can sit unsupported), and resolves by age 1 year as the sphincter matures.&nbsp; Characteristic findings include frequent (up to 30 times/day) episodes of effortless emesis (ie, spit-up).&nbsp; However, the episodes do not cause injury, weight loss, or other complications.&nbsp; Infants are commonly described as \"happy spitters,\" and GER is colloquially referred to as \"a laundry problem, not a medical problem.\"</p><p>Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination.&nbsp; Treatment consists of education and supportive measures.&nbsp; Parents should be advised to give frequent, small-volume feeds; hold the infant upright for 20-30 minutes after feeds; and place the infant prone when awake.</p><p>GER is distinguished clinically from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which causes complications such as weight loss, feeding refusal, respiratory complications (eg, aspiration), Sandifer syndrome (intermittent opisthotonic posturing), and significant pain with back-arching and irritability during feeds.&nbsp; Thickened feeds (eg, adding oatmeal) and antacid therapy (eg, PPI) are the first steps in management of GERD.&nbsp; More generally, features that raise suspicion for a <strong>diagnosis other than physiologic GER</strong> in an infant include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Signs/symptoms of gastrointestinal disease:&nbsp; age of onset &gt;6 months, poor weight gain, bilious or forceful emesis, bloody stools</li><li>Signs/symptoms of neurologic disease:&nbsp; micro- or macrocephaly, abnormal tone, seizures</li></ul><h2>GERD in pregnancy</h2><p>During pregnancy, physiologic changes (eg, decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone due to estrogen/progesterone) commonly cause GERD symptoms to develop or become exacerbated.&nbsp; Because treatment may pose problems given drug safety concerns, a step-up approach is used (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L36030.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><p>Initial management of GERD is with <strong>lifestyle and dietary modifications</strong> such as elevating the head during sleep, avoiding acidic foods (eg, citrus, coffee), avoiding eating &lt;3 hours prior to bedtime, and avoiding alcohol and tobacco.&nbsp; GERD symptoms that are unresponsive to lifestyle modifications are treated with <strong>antacids</strong> (eg, calcium carbonate, magnesium-containing compounds); Alka-Seltzer and similar aspirin-containing drugs should be avoided due to concerns of adverse fetal effects.&nbsp; Symptoms that persist are treated with <strong>sucralfate</strong> and, if still unresponsive, with acid-reducing agents such as histamine-2 receptor antagonists (eg, famotidine).&nbsp; PPIs are probably safe, although data are more limited.</p><p>GERD typically improves or resolves in the postpartum period, but recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is likely.</p><h1>Summary </h1><p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32162.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a chronic condition characterized by the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, leading to mucosal injury and a variety of symptoms.&nbsp;
