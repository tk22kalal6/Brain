The ventral pancreatic bud gives rise to the uncinate process of the pancreatic head and the main pancreatic duct (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26302.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The dorsal pancreatic bud gives rise to the remainder of the pancreatic head as well as the tail and body.<p></p><br><br><p>Normally, the ventral pancreatic bud rotates behind the duodenum and fuses with the dorsal pancreatic bud by the 8th week of gestation.&nbsp; Annular pancreas develops when the ventral pancreatic bud fails to rotate completely (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L1416.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), resulting in a partial or complete ring of pancreatic tissue that encircles the second portion of the duodenum, thereby causing varying degrees of obstruction.&nbsp; Histologically, the annular pancreas comprises normal pancreatic tissue, including both exocrine and endocrine components.<p></p><br><br><p>Although the exact causes are not well defined, there is a higher incidence of annular pancreas in individuals with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and other congenital anomalies involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (eg, duodenal atresia, Meckel diverticulum).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The majority of patients with annular pancreas are <strong>asymptomatic</strong>.&nbsp; However, in some patients, the circumferential pancreatic tissue can compress the duodenal lumen, causing obstruction that can be either proximal (<strong>nonbilious emesis</strong>) or distal (<strong>bilious emesis</strong>) to the major duodenal papilla (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12359.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Annular pancreas can also obstruct pancreatic drainage, causing pancreatitis.<p></p><br><br><p>Of note, the age at symptom onset varies depending on the severity of obstruction; complete obstruction often presents shortly after birth, similar to duodenal atresia.&nbsp; Partial obstruction may present in adulthood with nonspecific symptoms (eg, chronic abdominal pain, postprandial fullness, nausea).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>In patients with suspected annular pancreas, diagnostic evaluation includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Abdominal radiography</strong> may show a double bubble sign with trapped air in the stomach and proximal duodenum;

Pancreatic enzyme levels may be elevated if pancreatitis is present.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for annular pancreas includes other congenital anomalies that may cause duodenal obstruction, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pyloric stenosis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14564.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; classically presents in infancy with projectile, nonbilious (obstruction typically occurs proximal to the major duodenal papilla) emesis and a palpable olive-shaped mass on examination.&nbsp; Because the obstruction is at the level of the pylorus, there is no double bubble sign.&nbsp; Abdominal ultrasonography reveals a thickened and elongated pylorus.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Duodenal atresia</strong>:&nbsp; is a congenital defect in which a segment of the duodenal lumen is completely obstructed; patients classically have feeding intolerance, bilious emesis, and mild abdominal distension.&nbsp; Similar to annular pancreas, imaging reveals a double bubble sign with trapped air in the stomach and proximal duodenum.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Midgut malrotation with volvulus</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29144.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

However, because the pancreatic buds fuse normally, there is no duodenal obstruction.&nbsp; Patients are usually asymptomatic, but some may develop recurrent pancreatitis.<p></p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>In patients who have signs of duodenal obstruction, management involves surgical intervention to bypass the obstructing tissue.&nbsp; This can be accomplished via the following procedures:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Duodenoduodenostomy</strong> (most common surgical procedure) creates a bypass around the obstruction to the distal duodenum.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Duodenojejunostomy</strong> or <strong>gastrojejunostomy</strong> creates a bypass to the jejunum (more commonly performed in adults).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Resection of the obstructing pancreatic tissue is generally avoided due to the risk for complications (eg, pancreatitis, fistula formation).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Annular pancreas is a rare congenital anomaly in which a ring of pancreatic tissue encircles the duodenum.&nbsp;
