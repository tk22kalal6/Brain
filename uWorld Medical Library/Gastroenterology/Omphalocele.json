The midgut then rotates counterclockwise before returning to the abdominal cavity by 12 weeks gestation.<p></p><br><br><p>Omphaloceles occur when the midgut fails to return to the abdominal cavity, resulting in abdominal viscera contained within a membranous sac composed of peritoneum and amnion at the umbilicus.</p><br><br><p>Omphaloceles have been associated with maternal risk factors, including extremes of maternal age (age &gt;40 or &lt;20), smoking, alcohol use, and obesity.</p><br><br><p>In addition, omphaloceles are associated with certain genetic conditions including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L81485.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )</li>\n\t<li>Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)</li>\n\t<li>Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Omphaloceles are typically detected during routine prenatal ultrasound after 12 weeks gestation.&nbsp;

The defect may vary in size and contents (eg, intestines, liver, stomach).<p></p><br><br><p>Omphaloceles may be <strong>associated with other structural anomalies</strong> (eg, intestinal malrotation, cardiac defects, renal anomalies, pulmonary hypoplasia), suggesting an underlying genetic condition (eg, Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome) that warrants further testing.&nbsp; Omphaloceles may also be associated with fetal growth restriction and polyhydramnios.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Omphaloceles are often diagnosed upon visualization of a midline abdominal wall mass with the umbilical cord at the apex on routine prenatal ultrasound.&nbsp; Additionally, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is produced by the fetal liver and gastrointestinal tract and absorbed into maternal circulation; therefore, <strong>maternal serum AFP is often elevated</strong> in cases of omphalocele (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/33869.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Following diagnosis of an omphalocele, further evaluation may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Imaging (eg, fetal echocardiogram) to assess for associated structural anomalies</li>\n\t<li>Laboratory testing (eg, microarray) for associated genetic conditions</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for omphalocele includes the following abdominal wall defects (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/86976.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Gastroschisis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21940.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; characterized by a full-thickness (ie, involving all layers of the abdominal wall) defect lateral to the umbilical cord site.&nbsp; As a result, abdominal contents eviscerate through this opening.&nbsp; Gastroschisis and omphalocele can be distinguished by the following:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Umbilicus involvement</strong>:&nbsp; In gastroschisis, the abdominal wall defect is lateral to the umbilicus; therefore the umbilicus is unaffected and remains intact.&nbsp; In omphalocele, the defect involves the umbilicus.&nbsp;</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Peritoneal membrane sac involvement</strong>:&nbsp; Becasue gastroschisis involves a full-thickness abdominal wall defect, the abdominal viscera herniates into the amniotic cavity without a covering membrane.&nbsp; In omphaloceles, the herniated abdominal viscera are covered by a peritoneal membrane.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Extraintestinal anomalies</strong>:&nbsp; Gastroschisis tends to occur in isolation.&nbsp; Omphaloceles are more likely to be associated with structural anomalies involving other organ systems (eg, cardiovascular, renal).&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Umbilical hernia</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21551.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; a benign, reducible protrusion of bowel through a fascial opening at the umbilical ring.&nbsp; Although umbilical hernias are also midline, they are covered by skin, in contrast to omphaloceles.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Intrapartum management of omphaloceles includes close monitoring for fetal growth restriction via serial ultrasounds.&nbsp; Unless otherwise indicated, term vaginal delivery is preferred, as there is no advantage to preterm delivery.&nbsp; Cesarean delivery may be considered if the omphalocele is large.</p><br><br><p>Following delivery, immediate management is focused on stabilization, including addressing any associated structural anomalies.&nbsp; Care must be taken to avoid clamping the umbilical sac containing intestines.&nbsp; Additional management of omphaloceles after delivery includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Covering the defect in gauze soaked in warm sterile saline</li>\n\t<li>Placement of the lower half of the infant's body in a sterile plastic bag to minimize insensible heat and fluid losses</li>\n\t<li>Insertion of an orogastric or nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach</li>\n\t<li>Stabilization of the airway</li>\n\t<li>Initiation of intravenous fluids</li>\n\t<li>Administration of empiric intravenous antibiotics that cover vaginal flora (eg, ampicillin, gentamicin) to reduce the risk of infection</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Definitive treatment is surgical (ie, return of herniated bowel to abdominal cavity and closure of the abdominal wall defect).&nbsp; Surgical repair is typically performed in a staged manner, with gradual reduction of the herniated bowel into the abdominal cavity, followed by closure.&nbsp; The timing and approach to surgery depend on the size of the defect, the contents of the hernia sac, and the presence of associated anomalies.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for infants with omphalocele depends on the size of the defect, the presence of associated anomalies, and the effectiveness of surgical management.&nbsp; While many infants with isolated omphaloceles have a favorable outcome following surgical repair, those with complex omphalocele (eg, liver involvement) or significant associated anomalies (eg, pulmonary hypoplasia) have a poorer prognosis.</p><br><br><p>The recurrence risk of an isolated omphalocele in future pregnancies is low; those associated with genetic conditions (eg, Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome) have a greater risk of recurrence.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>An omphalocele is a congenital abdominal wall defect characterized by herniation of abdominal viscera through an opening at the base of the umbilical cord; the herniated viscera is contained within a membranous sac with the umbilical cord at the apex.&nbsp; The defect is typically diagnosed prenatally, and management is supportive (eg, close prenatal monitoring, limiting heat loss after birth) until definitive surgical repair can be performed.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
