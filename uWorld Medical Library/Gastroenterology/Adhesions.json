They can tether normally separate anatomic structures, leading to restricted mobility, and frequently involve the bowel and adnexa.&nbsp; Many cases are asymptomatic, although adhesions can cause abdominal or pelvic pain, bowel obstruction, infertility, and surgical complications.</p><br><br><p>This article focuses on adhesions involving the peritoneal cavity.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Much of the pelvic and abdominal cavities and their organs are covered by peritoneum (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L32011.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which is composed of a layer of mesothelial cells and an underlying layer of connective tissue.&nbsp; The peritoneum secretes peritoneal fluid, provides lubrication to minimize friction between adjacent organs, and limits the spread of infectious or malignant processes.&nbsp; The peritoneum is subject to injury from trauma (eg, during surgery) or inflammation, and, as the peritoneum heals, it can scar, leading to fibrinous bridges between adjacent tissues.<p></p><br><br><p>During the normal healing response, peritoneal trauma causes a localized release of cytokines and other mediators.&nbsp; This invokes an inflammatory response and triggers the coagulation cascade, which further activates the inflammatory response.&nbsp; These lead to fibrin deposition at the site of injury, followed by macrophage recruitment of mesothelial cells to reepithelialize and repair the peritoneum.&nbsp; Enzymes then break down the fibrin matrix and the degradation products are absorbed, leaving behind the reepithelialized peritoneal surface.</p><br><br><p>Adhesions result from incomplete fibrinolysis during peritoneal wound healing, leading to a persistent fibrin scaffold.&nbsp; Fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition can then lead to permanent fibrous bands that may become vascularized.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Traumatic or inflammatory processes that induce injury to peritoneal surfaces increase the risk for adhesions.&nbsp; These include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Surgery</strong>:&nbsp; Surgery can interfere with fibrinolysis via thermal injury, ischemia, and the presence of blood, bacteria, or foreign bodies (eg, suture, implants).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Peritonitis</strong>:&nbsp; Peritonitis is secondary to infection, perforation, or chemical irritation (eg, ruptured appendicitis, bowel perforation, ruptured dermoid cyst, fistula, abscess).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Endometriosis</strong>:&nbsp; Implants of endometrial glands and stroma can occur throughout the peritoneal cavity and can induce adhesion formation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16637.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease</strong>:&nbsp; The ascent of lower genital tract microorganisms to the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries leads to adhesions that most often affect the adnexa, but may also involve the bowel and the liver capsule (ie, Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Malignancy</strong>:&nbsp; Cancer and its treatments (surgery, radiation therapy, intraperitoneal chemotherapy) can cause scarring and obliteration of the peritoneum.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Many adhesions are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during surgery for other indications.&nbsp; Physical examination findings may be normal or nonspecific (eg, vague abdominal tenderness).&nbsp; Symptoms can develop immediately after the inciting event or may not be present until years afterward.&nbsp; Symptomatic presentations include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chronic abdominal or pelvic pain</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Female infertility</strong>:&nbsp; Adhesions can interfere with ovum transport to or within the fallopian tube due to tubal distortion or occlusion, leading to infertility or ectopic pregnancy.&nbsp; Peritubal adhesions can also cause hydrosalpinx, a condition in which a blocked fallopian tube becomes distended by trapped fluid.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Surgical complications</strong>:&nbsp; Adhesions can cause increased operative blood loss; inability to complete surgery laparoscopically; increased complexity and duration of surgery; injury to the bowel, bladder, or ureters; and delayed postoperative return of bowel function.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bowel obstruction</strong>:&nbsp; Mechanical compression of the large or small bowel by intraabdominal adhesions can lead to complete or partial obstruction of the flow of bowel contents through the lumen.&nbsp; Patients have crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, cessation of passage of flatus or stool, abdominal distension, and signs of dehydration (eg, tachycardia, reduced urine output).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>A presumptive diagnosis of adhesions is made based on the presence of classic symptoms in patients with a history of intraabdominal or pelvic surgery or other inflammatory process.&nbsp; The diagnosis is confirmed by direct visualization of adhesions during surgery, although surgery is rarely indicated solely to confirm the diagnosis.</p><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies are generally not necessary but can be used to rule out other conditions or complications or for pre-operative planning.&nbsp; Commonly used modalities include x-ray, CT scan, MRI, and ultrasonography of the pelvis.&nbsp; Although adhesions are not directly visible on imaging, some radiologic findings can suggest their presence:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Focal peritoneal thickening and enhancement.</li>\n\t<li>Asymmetric bowel wall thickening.</li>\n\t<li>Matted bowel:&nbsp; Clustered segments of bowel due to adhesions tethering bowel loops together.</li>\n\t<li>Fixed position:&nbsp; Unchanged location of bowel segments over serial imaging studies due to restricted movement.</li>\n\t<li>Beak sign:&nbsp; Sudden change in the size of the bowel lumen.</li>\n\t<li>Fat-bridging sign:&nbsp; Cords of mesenteric fat connecting two areas of peritoneum.</li>\n\t<li>Whirl sign:&nbsp; Twisting of the mesentery.</li>\n\t<li>Signs of bowel obstruction:&nbsp; <strong>Air-fluid levels</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45367.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), <strong>transition point</strong> (ie, dilation of bowel proximal to the obstruction and collapsed bowel distal to the obstruction), closed loop obstruction (ie, a C-shaped loop of dilated bowel with tapered ends) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44858.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>No treatment is necessary for most patients with asymptomatic adhesions.&nbsp; For symptomatic patients, conservative measures such as oral analgesics may be used to manage chronic pain.&nbsp; However, the only definitive treatment is surgical <strong>lysis of adhesions</strong>.&nbsp; Possible indications for surgery include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Persistent chronic abdominal or pelvic pain</strong>:&nbsp; Management is typically reserved for cases of severe chronic pain due to low success rates and high likelihood of reformation of adhesions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infertility</strong>:&nbsp; Lysis of adnexal adhesions may improve conception rates, and surgical removal of hydrosalpinx via salpingectomy can improve success rates with in vitro fertilization.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bowel obstruction</strong>:&nbsp; Surgery is reserved for cases unresponsive to several days of conservative management (eg, nasogastric decompression, bowel rest).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Complicated bowel obstruction</strong>:&nbsp; Perforation, ischemia, or necrosis occurs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for adhesions is highly variable.&nbsp; Many patients remain asymptomatic for life, whereas others have chronic pain despite surgical treatment.&nbsp; Recurrent adhesion formation is common after surgery.&nbsp; Patients who experience bowel obstruction due to adhesions also have a high rate of recurrent obstructive episodes.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Although surgery is not always avoidable, some surgical techniques can help prevent the formation of adhesions.&nbsp; This includes using minimally invasive (ie, laparoscopic) surgery when possible, minimizing the use of foreign bodies (eg, excess suture), using adhesion barrier materials, and promoting postoperative bowel motility (movement of bowel limits prolonged contact between healing surface, reducing the risk for adhesion formation).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Adhesions are fibrous bands that develop between tissues following surgery or other inflammatory processes in the abdomen or pelvis.&nbsp; Adhesion formation occurs due to inadequate fibrinolysis and excessive fibroblast proliferation during the peritoneal healing process.&nbsp; Although many adhesions are asymptomatic, they can cause conditions such as bowel obstruction, infertility, or chronic pain.&nbsp; The diagnosis is clinical and often inferred from imaging findings or surgical history.&nbsp; Management depends on symptom severity, ranging from observation to surgical adhesiolysis.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
