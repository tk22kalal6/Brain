Physical examination and growth parameters are typically normal, but colic often causes significant parental distress, and management focuses on caregiver support.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology</h1><br><br><p>Colic affects 10%-40% of infants globally, with higher proportions in resource-rich regions.&nbsp; Factors associated with a higher incidence of colic include maternal smoking during pregnancy and maternal anxiety or depression.&nbsp; There is no difference in incidence between male and female or breastfed and formula-fed infants.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The cause of colic is unknown but likely multifactorial and related to gastrointestinal and psychosocial factors.&nbsp; Potential gastrointestinal contributors include immature gut motility and digestion, excess intestinal gas (eg, swallowing of air during feeds or crying), and altered gut microbiota.&nbsp; Psychosocial factors include parental stress and anxiety affecting the perception of and response to crying, as well as infant hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Colic manifests with <strong>excessive crying</strong> ≥3 hours/day for ≥3 days/week in an <strong>otherwise healthy infant age &lt;3 months</strong>; onset is most commonly in infants age 2-3 weeks.&nbsp; Crying generally occurs around the same time of the day (usually the evening), and parents often have difficulty consoling the infant during this time.&nbsp; The crying often causes significant parental frustration and anxiety.</p><br><br><p>Episodes are often described as paroxysmal with a distinct beginning and endpoint of fussiness, and caregivers often report a louder, higher-pitched quality of crying compared to consolable periods at other times of day.&nbsp; Some infants may have associated stiffening of the arms, drawing up of the legs, and arching of the back.</p><br><br><p>Physical examination and growth parameters are normal, reflecting appropriate growth in weight, length, and head circumference.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Colic is a <strong>diagnosis of exclusion</strong> and must be differentiated from underlying medical conditions.&nbsp; These conditions are usually associated with a variable crying pattern, history beyond crying (eg, fever, emesis, bloody stools, poor weight gain), or abnormal examination findings (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/57060.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</strong>:&nbsp;

holding, rocking, or swaddling the baby; and minimizing environmental stimuli (eg, dark room, white noise).&nbsp; The use of swings, carriers, and strollers can also be calming and allows parents to rest from active soothing.</li>\n\t<li>Adjustment of feeding techniques (eg, upright position in bottle-fed babies, frequent burping) to help reduce air swallowing.</li>\n\t<li>Education regarding the natural course of colic, which is benign and self-limited, while encouraging the expansion of support networks (eg, lactation guidance) and screening for postpartum depression and anxiety.&nbsp; Direct acknowledgment of caregiver frustration and exhaustion also provides support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Colic is a diagnosis of exclusion characterized by crying for no apparent reason for ≥3 hours/day for ≥3 days/week in an otherwise healthy infant age &lt;3 months.&nbsp; Management includes parental reassurance and support with review of soothing techniques.&nbsp; The natural course of colic is spontaneous resolution by age 4 months.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
