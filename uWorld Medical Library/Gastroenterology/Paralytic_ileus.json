It typically occurs after abdominal surgery but may also be associated with medications, trauma, and serious medical conditions (eg, sepsis).&nbsp; Diminished peristalsis leads to the accumulation of gas and fluid in the bowel, causing abdominal distension, discomfort, nausea, and hypoactive/absent bowel sounds.&nbsp; Abdominal imaging typically reveals uniformly dilated, gas-filled loops of small and large bowel.&nbsp; Management is conservative and includes bowel rest.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Paralytic ileus involves the reduction or complete cessation of intestinal peristalsis, which limits the forward propulsion of intestinal contents and leads to bowel dilation.&nbsp; It is a <strong>functional obstruction</strong> that occurs in the absence of any anatomic or mechanical blockage (eg, mass, adhesions).&nbsp; The condition may be triggered by:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Surgery, especially abdominal or pelvic surgery (most common cause)</li>\n\t<li>Trauma, particularly involving the abdomen</li>\n\t<li>Intraabdominal inflammation (eg, peritonitis, pancreatitis, abscess, appendicitis)</li>\n\t<li>Use of opioid analgesics or other medications that reduce intestinal motility (eg, anticholinergics)</li>\n\t<li>Electrolyte imbalances (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)</li>\n\t<li>Postoperative or intraoperative retroperitoneal/abdominal hemorrhage</li>\n\t<li>Intestinal ischemia</li>\n\t<li>Severe systemic infections (eg, sepsis)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Paralytic ileus results from dysfunction of the neuroimmune systems that regulate gastrointestinal motility.&nbsp; The mechanism by which paralytic ileus occurs is complex and likely involves a combination of:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inflammation:&nbsp; Intestinal irritation or manipulation (eg, during surgery) initiates an inflammatory cascade, which involves the release of antiperistaltic agents (eg, cytokines) and inhibitory neurotransmitters that alter smooth muscle function and decrease motility.</li>\n\t<li>Neural reflexes:&nbsp; Noxious stimuli increase inhibitory sympathetic output from the autonomic nervous system to the gut, decreasing intestinal smooth muscle activity.</li>\n\t<li>Pharmacologic effects:&nbsp; Medications that decrease peristalsis and slow intestinal motility (eg, opioids) can lead to or exacerbate paralytic ileus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Paralytic ileus affects all segments of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to <strong>dilation of the small and large intestines</strong> due to gas and fluid accumulation.&nbsp; The bowel walls may appear edematous and inflamed, with reduced or absent peristaltic activity.&nbsp; Unlike mechanical obstruction, in paralytic ileus, there is no physical blockage or transition point (ie, bowel dilation proximal to mechanical obstruction with collapsed bowel distally).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with paralytic ileus typically present with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Diffuse, mild abdominal pain, often described as discomfort (rarely severe)</li>\n\t<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>\n\t<li>Inability to tolerate oral intake</li>\n\t<li>Absence of flatus and bowel movements</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Characteristic examination findings include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hypoactive or absent bowel sounds</li>\n\t<li>Mildly tender or nontender on abdominal palpation</li>\n\t<li>Abdominal distension</li>\n\t<li>Possible dehydration and electrolyte imbalances due to poor oral intake (in severe cases)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Small bowel obstruction</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L8670.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; is a mechanical blockage often caused by a hernia, a tumor, or postsurgical adhesions.&nbsp; Symptoms include abdominal distension and nausea/vomiting, but abdominal pain is severe, and bowel sounds are typically hyperactive (not hypoactive).&nbsp;

to assess for anemia (eg, postoperative bleeding), inflammation, or infection (eg, abscess)</li>\n\t<li>Electrolyte panel (to detect imbalances (eg, hypokalemia) that may exacerbate bowel dysmotility), renal function tests, liver function tests, and lipase</li>\n\t<li>Blood glucose:&nbsp; to detect long-standing diabetes mellitus that can cause gastroparesis, increasing the risk for postoperative ileus</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Imaging studies</h1><br><br><p>Abdominal x-ray is typically the first imaging modality used to evaluate for paralytic ileus, but a CT scan of the abdomen provides more detailed images to rule out mechanical obstruction (if unclear on x-ray) and to identify other inflammatory conditions that may contribute to paralytic ileus.</p><br><br><p>Characteristic imaging findings of paralytic ileus include (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L112634.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Uniformly dilated loops of bowel</strong> in the small and large intestines (due to generalized bowel paralysis)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Air in the distal colon and rectum</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>No transition zone</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>No air-fluid levels</strong></li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In contrast, patients with small bowel obstruction have proximal bowel dilation with a discrete point of transition to collapsed distal bowels.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Postoperative ileus typically self-resolves as bowel motility gradually returns;
