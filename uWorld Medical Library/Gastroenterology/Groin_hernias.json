This can occur due to a congenital abnormality or an acquired disruption in the fibromuscular integrity of the abdominal wall and fascia.&nbsp; Risk factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Advanced age:&nbsp; likely due to increased laxity of connective tissues/muscles with age</li>\n\t<li>Increased intraabdominal pressure:&nbsp; straining (eg, constipation or heavy lifting), pregnancy, chronic cough (eg, COPD), and obesity</li>\n\t<li>Previous surgery:&nbsp; abdominal surgeries can weaken areas of the abdominal wall</li>\n\t<li>Collagen vascular diseases (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)</li>\n\t<li>Patent processus vaginalis:&nbsp; during embryonic development, the testes pass from the abdomen through the inguinal canal into the scrotum via a protrusion in the parietal peritoneum called the processus vaginalis.&nbsp; Failure of normal obliteration of this structure creates a passageway for herniation of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Anatomy</h1><br><br><p>Important anatomic structures associated with groin hernias include (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L1435.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inguinal canal:&nbsp;

However, the hernia sac and its contents (eg, bowel, omentum) occasionally become trapped (ie, incarcerated) outside the abdominal cavity.&nbsp; This leads to inflammation and edema that, when prolonged, can result in compromised venous outflow, reduced arterial inflow, and eventual necrosis of sac contents (ie, strangulation).</p>\n<h2>Uncomplicated hernias </h2><br><br><p>Uncomplicated hernias have the following clinical characteristics:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Groin bulge:&nbsp; most common symptom.&nbsp;\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Soft and easily reducible bulge above the inguinal ligament (inguinal hernia) or below the inguinal ligament (femoral hernia)</li>\n\t\t<li>Bulge may increase in size with standing/straining and decrease when lying down</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Groin discomfort or mild pain:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Typically worsens with activity, lifting, or prolonged standing</li>\n\t\t<li>Pain is related to constriction at the neck of the hernia sac with compression of sac contents</li>\n\t\t<li>Pain may radiate into the scrotum or down the leg</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Complicated hernias </h2><br><br><p>Complicated hernias have the following clinical characteristics:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Incarcerated hernia</strong> (nonreducible)<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Inability to reduce hernia back into the intraabdominal space</li>\n\t\t<li>Moderate to severe persistent pain</li>\n\t\t<li>Firm, tender bulge in the groin</li>\n\t\t<li>May lead to bowel obstruction with symptoms of abdominal distension/pain and vomiting</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Strangulated hernia</strong> (ischemic necrosis of incarcerated hernia sac contents)\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Exquisitely tender on palpation</li>\n\t\t<li>Erythema of the overlying skin (may also appear dusky)</li>\n\t\t<li>Possibly systemic symptoms (eg, fever, hypotension) if necrotic tissue leaks outside hernia sac</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of inguinal or femoral hernias is primarily clinical, as they can often be visualized or palpated on physical examination.&nbsp; However, a reducible hernia may not be evident on initial inspection/palpation (eg, while supine).&nbsp; Patients should be examined while standing and while performing a Valsalva maneuver (eg, cough); this can help push hernia contents through the abdominal wall defect, making it easier to identify.</p><br><br><p>The inguinal canal can be examined directly in male patients by invaginating the scrotal skin and placing a finger through the superficial inguinal ring into the inguinal canal.&nbsp; This maneuver is not possible in women, making the diagnosis of inguinal hernias more challenging.</p><br><br><p>If the diagnosis is unclear after examination, then imaging (eg, ultrasound, abdominal CT scan) should be obtained.&nbsp; Ultrasound is often utilized first due to the ease of evaluation, but CT imaging provides better detail to differentiate the hernia type and assess for complications such as strangulation or bowel obstruction.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hydrocele</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24839.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; a fluid collection in the scrotum that typically causes diffuse scrotal swelling without pain.&nbsp; Upon pen light transillumination, light will pass through the scrotum containing a hydrocele but not a solid mass (eg, hernia).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Varicocele</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19256.jpg\" alt=\"figure 9\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 9</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; characterized by distension of the pampiniform plexus within the spermatic cord.&nbsp; Patients may experience dull aching discomfort and heaviness in the scrotum, but a mass of tortuous, dilated veins (\"bag of worms\") can be palpated on examination.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Testicular torsion</strong>:&nbsp; typically causes sudden onset of severe scrotal pain and swelling.&nbsp; The cremasteric reflex is typically absent, testicular lie is often abnormal, and testicular blood flow is decreased or absent on ultrasound examination.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lymphadenopathy</strong>:&nbsp; enlarged inguinal lymph nodes may cause swelling and pain in the groin, but lymphadenopathy is often associated with acute infection and typically resolve spontaneously.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Femoral artery aneurysm</strong>:&nbsp; can cause a mass in the femoral region, but a palpable pulsation will be present on examination.&nbsp; Diagnosis can be confirmed with imaging.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory tests are not required for the diagnosis of groin hernias but may be used to identify systemic complications (eg, sepsis, acidosis) or in preparation for surgical hernia repair.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count:&nbsp; leukocytosis may suggest inflammatory response or acute infection, especially in cases of strangulated hernia</li>\n\t<li>Complete metabolic panel:&nbsp; assess acid base status, renal function, and electrolytes, particularly if surgical intervention is planned</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Imaging</h1><br><br><p>The following imaging modalities may be utilized when evaluating groin hernias:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Ultrasound:&nbsp; first-line imaging when evaluating a groin mass</li>\n\t<li>CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis:&nbsp; provides a more detailed evaluation of the groin area; is better at differentiating femoral and inguinal hernias and evaluating for complications (eg, incarceration with bowel obstruction, strangulation)</li>\n\t<li>MRI:&nbsp; used selectively for complex cases or when other imaging modalities are inconclusive</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Definitive management of a groin hernia is surgical repair.&nbsp; Closure of the abdominal wall defect is typically accomplished with mesh placement, though sutures may be used if the area is contaminated or infected.&nbsp; However, the necessity and timeline of surgical intervention can vary based on the clinical scenario.</p>\n<h2>Uncomplicated groin hernias </h2><br><br><p>Uncomplicated groin hernias may be observed or electively repaired:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Observation (without surgery) is reasonable for patients with asymptomatic, easily reducible inguinal hernias and in pregnant patients with asymptomatic hernia, as elective repair is contraindicated until after delivery.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Nonemergent surgical repair is indicated for:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Symptomatic hernias (eg, groin pain, requiring frequent reduction)</li>\n\t\t<li>All femoral hernias (due to high risk of incarceration)</li>\n\t\t<li>Asymptomatic patients who desire repair&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Complicated groin hernias </h2><br><br><p>Complicated groin hernias require urgent or emergent surgery:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Incarcerated hernias</strong>:&nbsp; urgent surgical repair to prevent progression to bowel obstruction or strangulation</li>\n\t<li><strong>Strangulated hernias</strong>:&nbsp; patients require antibiotics and emergent surgery.&nbsp; It is important to note that no attempt at reduction should be made due to the risk of introducing necrotic bowel into the abdominal cavity and causing peritonitis.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for groin hernias is generally good with appropriate management.&nbsp; Surgical repair typically results in relief of symptoms and a low recurrence rate.&nbsp; Complications such as incarceration or strangulation can occur, necessitating prompt surgical intervention to avoid serious outcomes.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Groin hernias (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/98897.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are a common condition involving the herniation of intraabdominal contents through a weakened abdominal wall.&nbsp; Clinical manifestations include a soft bulge in the groin area that worsens with increased abdominal pressure (eg, straining).&nbsp; Hernias above the inguinal ligament are inguinal hernias (direct and indirect); femoral hernias are found below the inguinal ligament, occur mostly in older women, and have a high risk of complications.&nbsp; Uncomplicated hernias may be monitored or electively repaired, but incarceration or strangulation require prompt surgical intervention.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
