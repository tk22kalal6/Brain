These defects may be congenital but are more commonly acquired, often due to chronic elevations in intraabdominal pressure (eg, obesity) or structural disruption from prior abdominal surgery (ie, incisional hernias).&nbsp; Patients typically present with a visible or palpable bulge in the anterior abdomen and may report mild discomfort, although many remain asymptomatic.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>A hernia is the abnormal protrusion of the intraabdominal contents through a <strong>weakness or defect in the muscular or fascial layers of the abdominal wall</strong>.&nbsp; The anterior abdominal wall, composed of muscles (eg, rectus abdominis, oblique muscles) and fascial structures (eg, linea alba, aponeuroses), maintains the structural integrity of the abdominal cavity by containing and supporting intraabdominal organs under normal pressure loads (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13492.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Weakening or disruption of these components may result from repetitive mechanical stress (eg, obesity, chronic straining), connective tissue disorders, aging, or prior surgical incisions.&nbsp; As support deteriorates, the wall becomes less able to resist pressure, permitting visceral protrusion and hernia formation.&nbsp; The resulting hernia sac typically contains peritoneum and may also include omentum or bowel, depending on the defect's size and location.</p><br><br><p>Serious complications can occur when bowel enters the hernia sac and becomes incarcerated (ie, nonreducible) or strangulated (ie, ischemic).&nbsp; If not treated, these can result in bowel obstruction, necrosis, perforation, and sepsis.&nbsp; Smaller hernia defects are associated with a higher risk for incarceration and strangulation because a narrow opening increases the likelihood of bowel entrapment.</p><br><br><p>The main types of ventral hernias include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Epigastric hernias</strong>:&nbsp; These occur at the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus and arise from a congenitally weakened linea alba.&nbsp; This defect is often exacerbated by repeated diaphragmatic contractions (eg, coughing) and mechanical strain.&nbsp; Epigastric hernias are most common in male patients age 20-50, who engage in strenuous physical activity or have chronic lung disease, obesity, or diabetes mellitus.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Umbilical hernias</strong>:&nbsp; Umbilical hernias are located at or near the umbilical ring and are often acquired due to chronically increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, obesity, ascites, pregnancy).&nbsp; Umbilical hernias are more prevalent in female patients and frequently coexist with rectus abdominis diastasis (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L47564.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The hernia sac commonly contains omentum or preperitoneal fat and, less often, bowel.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Spigelian hernias</strong> (rare):&nbsp; These hernias arise through a defect in the spigelian aponeurosis between the rectus abdominis and linea semilunaris, near the arcuate line (imaginary horizontal line midway between the umbilicus and pubic symphysis).&nbsp; The hernia sac remains deep to the external oblique aponeurosis, often obscuring detection.&nbsp; Patients may have localized pain or lower lateral abdominal swelling; imaging is typically required for diagnosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Incisional hernias</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/50309.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Incisional hernias develop at the site of a previous abdominal incision and reflect a failure of fascial tissues to heal and regain tensile strength.&nbsp; This may occur due to postoperative wound infection, high-tension fascial closure, diabetes mellitus, or poor nutritional status.&nbsp; Incisional hernias are the most common type of acquired ventral hernia and are frequent complications following laparotomy, particularly involving midline incisions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Parastomal hernias</strong>:&nbsp; These hernias form adjacent to the stoma site (eg, colostomy) and are caused by a weakening of the fascial defect intentionally created for the stoma.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Several factors increase the risk for ventral hernias:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Obesity.</li>\n\t<li>Chronic cough (eg, pulmonary disease) or chronic straining (eg, constipation).</li>\n\t<li>Previous abdominal surgery.</li>\n\t<li>Poor surgical wound healing (due to diabetes mellitus, smoking, malnutrition, surgical site infection, inadequate fascial closure).</li>\n\t<li>Aging (natural muscle and tissue degeneration).</li>\n\t<li>Connective tissue disorders.</li>\n\t<li>Congenital defects.</li>\n\t<li>Pregnancy and childbirth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Uncomplicated ventral hernias typically present with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Reducible bulge</strong>:&nbsp; Visible or palpable mass in the anterior abdominal wall that enlarges with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, Valsalva maneuver, coughing, standing) and typically reduces when supine or with gentle pressure (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24028.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fascial defect</strong>:&nbsp; Palpable defect in the fascia that may be present on physical examination.&nbsp; The examination should be performed with the patient both standing and supine.</li>\n\t<li>Discomfort:&nbsp; Asymptomatic or mild, dull pain.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Complicated ventral hernias typically present with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Incarceration</strong>:&nbsp; The hernia sac cannot be reduced through the fascial defect, and the area is often firm and tender to palpation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Strangulation</strong>:&nbsp; Vascular compromise of herniated contents results in significant pain, overlying skin erythema, and systemic symptoms (eg, fever).&nbsp; Signs of peritonitis (eg, guarding, rebound tenderness) may be present in severe cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Rectus abdominis diastasis</strong>:&nbsp; Rectus abdominis diastasis is characterized by a midline bulge between the rectus muscles due to weakening of the linea alba.&nbsp; Unlike a true hernia, there is no fascial defect; therefore, an abnormality is not palpable while supine.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lipoma of the abdominal wall</strong>:&nbsp; A subcutaneous lipoma is a soft tissue tumor that presents as a soft, mobile abdominal mass.&nbsp; However, lipomas are not typically located at the midline and do not enlarge with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, Valsalva maneuver).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rectus sheath hematoma</strong>:&nbsp; This hematoma presents as a painful abdominal mass that is usually associated with acute trauma or anticoagulant use.&nbsp; Hematomas do not change with the Valsalva maneuver or straining and may be associated with bruising or ecchymosis over the abdominal wall.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Abdominal wall abscess</strong>:&nbsp; An abdominal wall abscess manifests as a warm, erythematous, fluctuant, and tender mass on the abdominal wall; purulent drainage may also be observed.&nbsp; An abscess often develops gradually over several days and is associated with systemic signs (eg, fever, leukocytosis).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of ventral hernia is often clinical, based on palpating a fascial defect and/or hernia sac on physical examination.&nbsp; However, small hernias or hernias in patients with obesity may be difficult to palpate; imaging (eg, CT scan) is often used in equivocal cases or when complications (eg, strangulation) are suspected.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Laboratory tests are not diagnostic but may assist in evaluating complications or in assessing the patient's readiness for surgical repair.&nbsp; These include a complete blood count (ie, leukocytosis in infection), metabolic panel, serum lactate level (ie, elevated levels suggest ischemia), and possible coagulation studies.</p>\n<h2>Imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>When physical examination is inconclusive or complications are suspected, imaging modalities may be used for further evaluation.&nbsp; <strong>CT scan of the abdomen</strong> is the modality of choice for evaluating ventral hernias because it rapidly provides details on hernia size and location, sac contents, and complications (eg, incarceration, strangulation) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L55712.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Ultrasonography allows for dynamic hernia assessment during the Valsalva maneuver and position changes and may help detect small or occult hernias without radiation exposure.&nbsp; MRI is used occasionally when CT scan is contraindicated (eg, pregnancy); it allows for better soft tissue resolution and can delineate hernia contents and complications.<p></p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of ventral hernias depends on symptom severity and patient risk factors.&nbsp; Patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic hernias may be treated conservatively (nonoperatively), especially if they are poor surgical candidates or prefer to avoid surgery.&nbsp; Elective repair is an option for definitive treatment if the patient develops bothersome symptoms or decides to pursue surgery.&nbsp; Conservative management requires that the patient be educated about the warning signs of complications (eg, irreducible, painful hernia) and to seek care immediately if these develop.</p><br><br><p><strong>Surgery</strong> is the definitive treatment for ventral hernias, which is when the condition is symptomatic (eg, pain, progressive enlargement).&nbsp; Urgent surgical repair is required in cases of incarceration or strangulation to prevent obstruction, ischemia, and necrosis.</p><br><br><p>The goal of surgical repair is to achieve tension-free closure of the defect, often using mesh to reinforce the abdominal wall.&nbsp; Open repair is preferred for large or complex hernias, whereas laparoscopic and robotic-assisted techniques offer minimally invasive options with shorter recovery times and are increasingly used, especially for complex reconstructions.&nbsp; Postoperatively, patients are advised to avoid heavy lifting and to gradually resume activity over several weeks to prevent recurrence.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Without treatment, there is an increased risk for progressive hernia enlargement, ongoing discomfort, and serious complications such as strangulation.&nbsp; Many patients who undergo surgical repair have good outcomes.&nbsp; Rates of recurrence have declined significantly with the use of mesh.&nbsp; Although uncommon, complications from surgery include mesh infection, seroma formation, and inadvertent bowel injury.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Prevention of ventral hernias involves lowering intraabdominal pressure (eg, weight loss, avoidance of chronic straining or coughing).&nbsp; Incisional hernia prevention focuses on optimizing preoperative conditions (eg, smoking cessation, proper nutrition), using proper surgical technique to avoid excess tension on the wound, and following meticulous sterile technique to avoid infection.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Ventral hernias are protrusions of intraabdominal contents through a defect in the abdominal wall, typically resulting from weakening of the musculofascial structures that normally support the abdominal cavity.&nbsp; Common etiologies include increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, obesity, chronic straining) and impaired fascial healing following surgery.&nbsp; This hernia usually presents as a bulge in the anterior abdomen and may be asymptomatic or cause mild discomfort.&nbsp; Potential complications include incarceration and strangulation.&nbsp; The diagnosis is primarily clinical and is supported by imaging.&nbsp; Surgical repair, often with mesh reinforcement, is the standard treatment for closing the defect and restoring abdominal wall integrity.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
