Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) can be the first indication of liver injury or dysfunction, often before clinical symptoms appear.&nbsp; Elevated LFTs may result from benign or severe hepatobiliary conditions.&nbsp; Commonly measured tests include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Liver enzymes:&nbsp; Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and lactate dehydrogenase</li>\n\t<li>Synthetic function tests:&nbsp; Serum albumin and prothrombin time (PT) (also named international normalized ratio [INR])</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>A systematic approach based on the pattern of injury is helpful in the evaluation of elevated LFTs.</p>\n<h1>Patterns of liver injury</h1><br><br><p>Elevated LFTs typically follow 1 of 3 patterns of liver injury depending on the predominant structures involved (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84182.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p>\n<h2>Cholestatic pattern</h2><br><br><p>Predominant elevation in <strong>bilirubin</strong>, <strong>alkaline phosphatase</strong>, and <strong>GGT</strong> reflect bile flow disruption from mechanical blockage or disrupted bile transport.</p>\n<h2>Hepatocellular pattern</h2><br><br><p>Predominant elevations in <strong>ALT</strong> and <strong>AST</strong> reflect hepatocyte damage.</p>\n<h2>Mixed pattern</h2><br><br><p>This includes concurrent elevations of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and GGT, indicating abnormalities in both hepatocyte and biliary function (eg, cholangiocytes, small bile ducts).</p>\n<h1>Cholestatic pattern</h1><br><br><p>Cholestatic injury involves a predominant elevation in alkaline phosphatase, often accompanied by elevated direct bilirubin, due to biliary obstruction (extrahepatic or intrahepatic) or disruption of bile transport.</p>\n<h2>Etiologies</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Biliary obstruction</strong>:&nbsp; Biliary stasis is commonly due to mechanical blockage of large bile ducts.&nbsp; Causes include choledocholithiasis (ie, gallstones in the common bile duct), tumors (eg, involving the pancreatic head), strictures (eg, primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC] (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108549.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), and liver flukes such as <em>Clonorchis sinensis</em>).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Disruption of bile transport</strong>:&nbsp; Bile flow can be impaired due to dysfunction within the biliary system at multiple levels, including bile canaliculi (containing bile transporters), cholangiocytes, or small intrahepatic ducts.&nbsp; Certain drugs can impair bile secretion or damage cholangiocytes; anabolic steroids directly affect bile canalicular membrane transporters, whereas antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin-clavulanate) and certain herbal supplements may induce immune-mediated or idiosyncratic cholangiocyte injury.&nbsp; Small intrahepatic bile ducts can be damaged due to autoimmune destruction (eg, primary biliary cholangitis [PBC] (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26814.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )) or infiltrative disease (eg, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis).&nbsp; Hormonal fluctuations, as in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, can also affect bile acid transport and cause a cholestatic pattern.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because cholestasis can arise from a wide range of etiologies, initial clinical reasoning often begins with the more common and easily identifiable causes (eg, mechanical obstruction) and then proceeds to other considerations (eg, drug-induced cholestasis, infiltrative disease, autoimmune disease).</p>\n<h2>History</h2><br><br><p>The history should focus on the probability of gallstones (eg, biliary colic), malignancy (eg, weight loss, smoking history), drug-induced cholestasis (eg, recent new medications or supplements), autoimmune disease (eg, family history), and current pregnancy.</p>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2><br><br><p>Findings may include jaundice and pruritus, which is common in cholestatic injury (due to bilirubin accumulation).&nbsp; Right upper quadrant tenderness suggests gallstone-related disease or acute cholangitis.&nbsp; Hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy can be seen in infiltrative diseases.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory and imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>If an elevated alkaline phosphatase is suspected to be of nonhepatic origin (vs bone origin, as levels can be elevated during bone remodeling), an elevated <strong>serum GGT</strong> can help confirm a hepatic source (because GGT is not present in bone).&nbsp; Once a cholestatic pattern is established, the first step in evaluation is <strong>abdominal ultrasonography</strong>, a simple and low-resource study that can quickly inform the probability of intra- versus extrahepatic disease:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Extrahepatic cholestasis</strong> typically manifests with a <strong>dilated</strong> common bile duct and gallbladder due to distal obstruction (eg, pancreatic head tumor, choledocholithiasis, PSC) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L109273.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intrahepatic cholestasis</strong> is suggested by a normal-sized common bile duct and gallbladder; hepatomegaly may be seen.&nbsp; Causes include autoimmune or infiltrative disorders (eg, PBC, sarcoidosis).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Ultrasonographic findings guide subsequent work-up.&nbsp; For example, next steps for suspected extrahepatic obstruction include MR cholangiography (highly sensitive for biliary tree disorders) or CT scan of the abdomen (highly sensitive for pancreatic malignancy) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L113014.png\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In contrast, suspected intrahepatic cholestasis warrants laboratory tests to screen for autoimmune or systemic disease—in particular antimitochondrial antibodies, which are highly sensitive and specific for PBC (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L113016.png\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; If the diagnosis is unclear after extensive evaluation, a liver biopsy can be considered.<p></p>\n<h1>Hepatocellular pattern</h1><br><br><p>Hepatocellular injury is characterized by disproportionate elevations in ALT and AST due to damage to <strong>hepatocytes</strong>, the primary functional cells of the liver.&nbsp; This injury can result from direct toxic insults, inflammation, or metabolic stress, leading to hepatocyte death, cell membrane disruption, and enzyme leakage into the bloodstream.&nbsp; Hepatocyte damage occurs through the following mechanisms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Direct cellular toxicity</strong>:&nbsp; Substances such as acetaminophen, alcohol, or certain herbal supplements can cause hepatocyte injury through direct cytotoxicity.&nbsp; For instance, acetaminophen overdose depletes glutathione, leading to oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury.&nbsp; Toxins (eg, mushroom poisoning) directly disrupt hepatocyte function, often causing severe injury.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inflammation-mediated injury</strong>:&nbsp; Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A-E) triggers immune responses that lead to hepatocyte lysis, either through direct viral cytopathic effects or immune-mediated destruction.&nbsp; In autoimmune hepatitis, autoreactive T cells and antibodies target hepatocytes, resulting in chronic inflammation and hepatocyte damage.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Metabolic stress</strong>:&nbsp; Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is characterized by excessive lipid accumulation within hepatocytes (steatosis), causing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventual hepatocyte death.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ischemic injury (\"shock liver\")</strong>:&nbsp; Hepatocytes are highly susceptible to hypoperfusion and hypoxia, leading to ischemic necrosis and marked AST/ALT elevations, often in the setting of hemodynamic instability.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Accumulation disorders</strong>:&nbsp; Iron overload (hemochromatosis) and copper overload (Wilson disease) lead to hepatocyte oxidative damage and mitochondrial toxicity, respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>History</h2><br><br><p>Patients with a hepatocellular pattern of injury should be assessed for:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Drug exposures:&nbsp; Prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and toxins (eg, mushrooms)</li>\n\t<li>Alcohol use:&nbsp; Significant ingestion is defined as &gt;140 g/week for women and &gt;210 g/week for men over a sustained period (≥2 years).&nbsp; An AST:ALT ratio ≥2:1 is suggestive of alcohol-associated liver disease.</li>\n\t<li>Risk factors for viral hepatitis:&nbsp; Intravenous drug use, unprotected sex, travel to endemic areas, and blood transfusions prior to 1992</li>\n\t<li>Family history:&nbsp; Hemochromatosis and Wilson disease</li>\n\t<li>Associated conditions:&nbsp; Diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and autoimmune diseases</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2><br><br><p>Palpation of the abdomen, particularly the right upper quadrant, is important as this tenderness can suggest acute hepatitis.&nbsp; The physical examination should also focus on identifying specific signs that indicate these underlying disorders:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cirrhosis (eg, palmar erythema, spider angiomas)</li>\n\t<li>Heart failure (eg, elevated jugular venous pressures)</li>\n\t<li>MASLD (eg, truncal obesity)</li>\n\t<li>Malignancy (eg, lymphadenopathy)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Laboratory studies</h2><br><br><p><strong>Mild-to-moderate ALT/AST elevation</strong> (&lt;15x the upper limit of normal) typically suggests a chronic liver condition but can also be seen acutely.&nbsp; Etiologies include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Chronic viral hepatitis:&nbsp; Infections with hepatitis B, C, or D</li>\n\t<li>Medications and toxins:&nbsp; Acetaminophen overdose, idiosyncratic drug reactions, and herbal supplements</li>\n\t<li>Alcohol-associated liver disease:&nbsp; Chronic alcohol intake leading to steatosis (\"fatty liver\"), alcoholic hepatitis, and potentially cirrhosis</li>\n\t<li>MASLD:&nbsp; A diagnosis of exclusion, supported by markers of metabolic syndrome (eg, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia)</li>\n\t<li>Other conditions:&nbsp; Congestive hepatopathy (ie, right-heart failure), autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis (ie, iron overload), and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (ie, misfolded liver protein)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Severe ALT/AST elevation</strong> (&gt;15x the upper limit of normal) is usually seen in acute hepatitis.&nbsp; Etiologies include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Acetaminophen toxicity:&nbsp; Overdose or accumulation leading to direct hepatocyte death</li>\n\t<li>Acute viral hepatitis:&nbsp; Hepatitis A-E, herpes simplex virus, or varicella zoster virus</li>\n\t<li>Idiosyncratic drug reactions:&nbsp; Unpredictable, immune-mediated, or toxic responses to medications</li>\n\t<li>Toxin exposure, including mushroom poisoning:&nbsp; <em>Amanita phalloides</em> (\"death cap\") and other toxins (leading to fulminant hepatic failure)</li>\n\t<li>Alcohol-associated hepatitis:&nbsp; Characterized by significant hepatocyte injury and inflammation and distinguished from lesser LFT elevations seen in chronic alcohol use by the presence of elevated INR, bilirubin, and clinical findings consistent with acute liver dysfunction (eg, jaundice, coagulopathy)</li>\n\t<li>Ischemic hepatitis:&nbsp; Due to hypoperfusion and hypoxia following severe hypotension</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Massive elevations (&gt;5,000 U/L)</strong> usually reflect ischemia or drug-induced injury.&nbsp; Certain conditions can range in severity and cause either mild-to-moderate or severe ALT/AST elevations, including autoimmune hepatitis and Wilson disease (ie, copper accumulation).</p><br><br><p>Further laboratory studies that can help determine the underlying cause include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Viral serologies:&nbsp;

Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, thyroid function tests, and celiac disease screening</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Synthetic function</h2><br><br><p>Synthetic function refers to the liver's capacity to produce proteins (eg, albumin, clotting factors).&nbsp; Impairment of synthetic function reflects significant liver dysfunction, particularly in advanced chronic liver disease or acute liver failure.&nbsp; Key markers of synthetic function include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Serum albumin</strong>:&nbsp; Albumin is a protein synthesized exclusively by the liver.&nbsp; Low levels suggest chronic liver disease (eg, cirrhosis) or systemic conditions (eg, malnutrition, nephrotic syndrome).&nbsp; Given that albumin has a long half-life (~20 days), hypoalbuminemia is typically seen in chronic processes rather than acute liver injury.&nbsp; Prealbumin, also called transthyretin (transports thyroxin and retinol), is not the precursor of albumin; its name comes from its deposition before albumin during electrophoresis.&nbsp; Unlike albumin, prealbumin has a much shorter half-life (~2 days), making it a useful marker for detecting more acute changes in protein synthesis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>PT/INR</strong>:&nbsp; The liver synthesizes most clotting factors (factors I, II, V, VII, IX, and X).&nbsp; An elevated INR indicates impaired production of these factors (ie, coagulopathy).&nbsp; Unlike albumin, INR can quickly reflect acute changes in liver synthetic function due to the short half-life of clotting factors.&nbsp; INR elevation is a critical indicator of liver dysfunction and portends a poor prognosis, particularly in conditions like acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with elevated INR and low albumin should be evaluated for acute liver failure and chronic liver disease (eg, cirrhosis).&nbsp; Persistently high INR in acute liver failure, despite appropriate medical management, may indicate the need for liver transplantation.</p>\n<h1>Mixed pattern</h1><br><br><p>Mixed injury involves concurrent damage to hepatocytes and the biliary system (eg, cholangiocytes), resulting in elevations of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and GGT.&nbsp; Many of the conditions described for hepatocellular and cholestatic injury can present with a mixed pattern, particularly when severe (eg, infiltrative diseases, drug-induced liver injury).&nbsp; Calculating the <strong>R value</strong> can help confirm mixed injury:</p><br><br><p>R value = (ALТ ÷ upper limit of normal ALT)&nbsp; /&nbsp; (alkaline phosphatase&nbsp; ÷&nbsp; upper limit of normal alkaline phosphatase)</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>R ≥ 5:&nbsp; Hepatocellular injury</li>\n\t<li>R ≤ 2:&nbsp; Cholestatic injury</li>\n\t<li>R between 2 and 5:&nbsp; Mixed pattern</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Special considerations</h1><br><br><p>Isolated elevations in bilirubin and GGT usually do not require an exhaustive liver work-up unless there are other abnormalities.</p>\n<h2>Isolated hyperbilirubinemia</h2><br><br><p>Elevated bilirubin levels with normal aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase may indicate isolated hyperbilirubinemia.&nbsp; Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can result from hemolysis, Gilbert syndrome (a benign condition caused by reduced enzyme activity for bilirubin conjugation), or Crigler-Najjar syndrome (a rare genetic disorder with severely impaired bilirubin conjugation).&nbsp; Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia may be due to Dubin-Johnson syndrome (defective hepatocyte excretion of bilirubin) or Rotor syndrome (impaired hepatic reuptake of bilirubin).&nbsp; These conditions are discussed in separate articles (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24741.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Isolated GGT elevation</h2><br><br><p>Isolated GGT elevation can occur in conditions such as pancreatic disease, myocardial infarction, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic alcohol use due to increased oxidative stress, tissue damage, or enzyme induction.&nbsp; Certain medications (eg, phenytoin, barbiturates) elevate GGT through hepatic enzyme induction.&nbsp; While isolated GGT elevation without other liver enzyme abnormalities does not typically warrant extensive evaluation, it can confirm the hepatic origin of an elevated alkaline phosphatase or support suspicion of alcohol-related liver disease when the AST: ALT ratio exceeds 2:1.</p>\n<h2>Isolated AST elevation</h2><br><br><p>An isolated elevation in AST with a relatively normal ALT can occur in conditions involving muscle breakdown (eg, rhabdomyolysis, early myocardial infarction) because AST is also present in striated muscle (eg, skeletal, cardiac).&nbsp; In these cases, significantly elevated serum creatine kinase confirms the muscle origin, and an extensive liver evaluation is usually unnecessary.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Elevated liver function tests often precede symptoms, indicating early hepatic injury or dysfunction.&nbsp; Determining whether the pattern is cholestatic or hepatocellular is the first step in refining the differential diagnosis.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cholestatic injury, indicated by higher alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, reflects impaired bile flow due to intrahepatic conditions (eg, primary biliary cholangitis, drug-induced cholestasis) or extrahepatic obstructions (eg, choledocholithiasis, malignancies, primary sclerosing cholangitis).&nbsp; Imaging (eg, ultrasonography, MR cholangiography) differentiates intrahepatic from extrahepatic obstruction.</li>\n\t<li>Hepatocellular injury, marked by disproportionate ALT and AST elevations, often stems from chronic viral hepatitis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, alcohol-associated liver disease, or inherited and autoimmune disorders.&nbsp; More severe ALT/AST elevations suggest acute insults from ischemia, toxins, or drug-induced hepatotoxicity.&nbsp; Additional studies, including viral serologies, medication review, autoimmune markers, and iron/copper studies, help clarify etiologies.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Mixed patterns can also occur.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
