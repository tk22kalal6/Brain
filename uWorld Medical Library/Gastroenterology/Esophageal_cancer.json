Globally, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains the main histologic subtype, especially in Asia and Africa, whereas adenocarcinoma predominates in countries in the Western hemisphere.&nbsp; These differences reflect varying risk factors:&nbsp; In adenocarcinoma-predominant regions, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and dietary habits play a role, whereas tobacco, alcohol, and hot beverages predominate in SCC-predominant regions.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Esophageal cancer develops through a progression from normal epithelium to dysplasia and, ultimately, invasive malignancy.&nbsp; The main subtypes—SCC and adenocarcinoma—arise via distinct pathways, tend to occur in different regions of the esophagus, and have unique risk factors (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/40386.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Squamous cell carcinoma</h2><br><br><p>SCC originates from the native stratified squamous epithelium, usually in the proximal or middle third of the esophagus.&nbsp; Chronic irritation and inflammation underlie its pathogenesis.&nbsp; Common insults include tobacco smoking, heavy alcohol use, ingestion of very hot beverages, ingestion of N-nitroso compounds (eg, cured meats), and underlying esophageal conditions (eg, achalasia).&nbsp; Over time, repeated injury leads to squamous dysplasia and eventual malignant transformation.</p>\n<h2>Adenocarcinoma</h2><br><br><p>Adenocarcinoma typically arises in the lower third of the esophagus, often from Barrett esophagus, a condition in which chronic GERD leads to replacement of the normal squamous lining by intestinal-type columnar epithelium (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/91971.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L63109.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (discussed in a separate article).&nbsp; This metaplastic change increases the risk for dysplasia and eventual malignant transformation.&nbsp; Risk factors such as obesity (predisposes to acid reflux), and consumption of nitrate-rich, processed foods further promote Barrett changes and adenocarcinoma development.&nbsp; Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have a slight protective effect.<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation and diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Although SCC and adenocarcinoma arise from distinct pathogenic mechanisms and have different risk factor profiles, their clinical presentations overlap significantly.&nbsp; Both subtypes often present late in the disease course with similar symptom patterns, making symptom-based differentiation unreliable.&nbsp; Symptoms include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Progressive dysphagia:&nbsp; Progressive dysphagia typically starts with solids and eventually involves softer foods and liquids as the tumor narrows the lumen.</li>\n\t<li>Weight loss:&nbsp; Loss of weight is often substantial and involuntary, reflecting both mechanical obstruction and tumor-associated metabolic changes.</li>\n\t<li>Retrosternal discomfort or pain:&nbsp; Persistent burning, chest pain, or discomfort may mimic chronic GERD.</li>\n\t<li>Lymph node metastasis:&nbsp; SCC typically involves the mediastinal lymph nodes (eg, upper thoracic and paratracheal nodes), whereas adenocarcinoma more often spreads to the abdominal lymph nodes (eg, gastric and celiac nodes).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients age &gt;50 and those with alarm features—such as gastrointestinal bleeding (overt or occult), persistent vomiting, or rapidly worsening dysphagia—warrant immediate endoscopic evaluation.&nbsp; In the absence of alarm symptoms, barium swallow or esophageal manometry may be considered in some patients (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97783.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Upper endoscopy with biopsy allows direct visualization of suspicious lesions and histologic examination to distinguish between subtypes:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>SCC:&nbsp; Pathologic results are characterized by nests or sheets of atypical squamous cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, distinct cell borders, keratin pearls, and intercellular bridges (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L67574.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Adenocarcinoma:&nbsp; Findings include irregularly shaped, malignant glandular structures composed of dysplastic, mucin-producing cells (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L66469.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Staging</h1><br><br><p>Accurate staging is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment strategy.&nbsp; The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system defines the depth of tumor invasion (T stage), the presence and extent of regional lymph node involvement (N stage), and the presence of distant metastases (M stage).&nbsp; Staging modalities include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS):&nbsp; The combination of endoscopy and ultrasonography provides a detailed assessment of tumor depth (T stage) and nearby lymph nodes.&nbsp; EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration can confirm nodal metastases.</li>\n\t<li>CT scan and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan:&nbsp; Contrast-enhanced CT scans and integrated PET/CT imaging identify metastatic disease not visible on endoscopy alone.&nbsp; PET/CT imaging often detects distant metastases, preventing unnecessary surgery.</li>\n\t<li>Bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy (for upper lesions):&nbsp; In tumors at or above the carina, evaluation of the airways helps rule out invasion into the tracheobronchial tree.&nbsp; For cervical SCCs, flexible laryngoscopy is performed to exclude synchronous head and neck cancers.</li>\n\t<li>Laparoscopy (for distal/gastroesophageal junction [GEJ] lesions):&nbsp; In some patients with distal esophageal or GEJ adenocarcinomas, diagnostic laparoscopy may detect peritoneal metastases missed by imaging.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Treatment depends on histology, stage, and patient fitness.&nbsp; Tailored approaches using biologically targeted therapies and immunotherapies are evolving, particularly for adenocarcinoma.&nbsp; Differences in genomic alterations between SCC and adenocarcinomas may guide future targeted treatments.</p>\n<h2>Localized or early-stage disease</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Endoscopic resection (for very early tumors):&nbsp; Early, superficial cancers confined to the mucosa may be amenable to curative endoscopic resection.</li>\n\t<li>Surgical resection:&nbsp; Esophagectomy remains a primary curative option for more advanced, localized disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Locally advanced disease</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy:&nbsp; Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is administered before surgery to shrink tumors and improve resectability.</li>\n\t<li>Definitive chemoradiotherapy:&nbsp; For patients who are not surgical candidates, combined therapy may provide local control and palliation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Metastatic or advanced disease</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Palliative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy:&nbsp; Extends survival modestly and improves quality of life.</li>\n\t<li>Endoscopic stenting:&nbsp; Relieves obstruction to improve swallowing and nutrition.</li>\n\t<li>Supportive and nutritional care:&nbsp; Essential to maintain quality of life.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis and screening</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis in esophageal cancer correlates closely with the stage at diagnosis; early detection and intervention improve outcomes, whereas advanced disease is associated with poor survival.&nbsp; No universal screening programs exist for the general population due to low incidence and cost-effectiveness concerns, but certain high-risk groups may benefit from surveillance.&nbsp; Patients with long-standing GERD, Barrett esophagus, and additional risk factors (eg, obesity, smoking, age &gt;50) may undergo periodic endoscopy to identify dysplasia or early-stage adenocarcinoma.&nbsp; In regions with a high incidence of SCC, targeted surveillance strategies are sometimes considered, although protocols vary.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Esophageal cancer is most commonly either squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma.&nbsp; SCC is associated with smoking, alcohol, and thermal injury, whereas adenocarcinoma often arises from Barrett esophagus due to long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).&nbsp; Patients typically present with progressive solid-food dysphagia, weight loss, and sometimes retrosternal discomfort.&nbsp; Diagnosis requires endoscopy with biopsy, and staging uses endoscopic ultrasonography and imaging.&nbsp; Treatment depends on stage and may involve endoscopic therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.&nbsp; The prognosis worsens with more advanced disease, and prevention focuses on addressing risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and GERD.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
