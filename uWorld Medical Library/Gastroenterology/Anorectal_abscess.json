Severe pain in the anal or rectal area is the main presenting symptom.&nbsp; Anorectal abscesses vary in complexity based on their anatomic location (eg, perianal vs perirectal) but all require prompt incision and drainage to prevent further spread of infection and systemic illness.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The anal canal contains approximately 8-10 anal glands that are located within crypts at the dentate line.&nbsp; The majority of anorectal abscesses arise when debris overlying the crypt causes obstruction and subsequent bacterial overgrowth within the gland.&nbsp; Infection leads to subcutaneous inflammation and, eventually, the formation of a pus-filled abscess.&nbsp; Superficial abscesses in the perianal soft tissues are most common.&nbsp; However, infection can track deep into the perirectal spaces resulting in an intersphincteric, supralevator, or ischiorectal abscess (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85567.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Due to high levels of bacteria in the area, an abscess can form relatively quickly following gland obstruction.&nbsp; Enteric organisms that are typically involved include <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Enterococcus</em>, <em>Fusobacteria</em>, and <em>Bacteroides</em>.</p><br><br><p>A small percentage of abscesses are unrelated to crypt obstruction and are caused by other conditions such as trauma, immunosuppression, or inflammatory bowel disease.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Obstruction of anal crypts</strong>:&nbsp; main risk factor, causes 90% of anorectal abscesses</li>\n\t<li><strong>History of anorectal abscess or fistula</strong>:&nbsp; fistula connects anus/rectum to overlying skin and contributes to the spread of anorectal infection</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease</strong> (eg, Crohn disease):&nbsp;

swollen anal veins that originate above the dentate line and can prolapse into the anal canal.&nbsp; They may be palpable as fluctuant masses on rectal examination but are most often associated with painless rectal bleeding and leakage of stool.</li>\n\t<li><strong>External hemorrhoids</strong>:&nbsp; swollen anal veins that originate below the dentate line and cause itching, anal fullness, and exquisite pain when thrombosed.&nbsp; They typically appear as dusky or purple perianal masses.&nbsp; Fluctuance and fever are not expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anal fissure</strong>:&nbsp; a tear in the anal mucosa, typically caused by passing hard stool and characterized by severe anal pain (especially during defecation or rectal examination) and bright red rectal bleeding.&nbsp; Fissures are visible on examination as superficial, longitudinal lacerations in the anal mucosa.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anorectal fistulas</strong>:&nbsp; an abnormal tract that forms between the anal canal and the skin surface.&nbsp; Symptoms may include intermittent, not constant, perianal pain and persistent anal discharge, often lasting weeks or months.&nbsp; External openings or sinuses may be visible and/or palpable on physical examination.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pilonidal abscess</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108668.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; an abscess that forms within the natal cleft (superior groove between the buttocks), typically as a result of hair follicle blockage and subsequent infection.&nbsp; Pain, erythema, and swelling are localized to the natal cleft and do not involve the anorectal area.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>An anorectal abscess should be considered in any patient with anal or rectal pain.&nbsp; Physical examination may provide clues to the diagnosis and location of the abscess.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A superficial, fluctuant mass at the anal orifice is consistent with a perianal abscess.</li><br><br>\t<li>A normal external anal examination and a fluctuant mass inside the rectum are concerning for a deeper perirectal abscess.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Although simple perianal abscesses can typically be diagnosed on physical examination, most deeper abscesses require imaging (eg, CT scan) to confirm the diagnosis and determine the location and extent of infection.</p>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count (CBC) to assess for leukocytosis, which is nonspecific but suggests systemic inflammation or infection</li>\n\t<li>Blood glucose levels in diabetic patients to evaluate glycemic control</li>\n\t<li>Culture and sensitivity of abscess drainage, if available, to guide antibiotic therapy</li>\n\t<li>Blood cultures and sensitivity if signs of systemic illness (eg, fever, tachycardia) are present</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Imaging</h1><br><br><p>Imaging studies help confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the extent of infection when a deep or complex abscess is suspected.&nbsp; Possible imaging modalities include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>CT scan with IV contrast</strong> is typically the modality of choice because it is easily accessible with short acquisition time and reliably identifies abscesses.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Endoanal ultrasonography</strong> can detect abscess cavities, but image quality is operator dependent and the test is often painful for patients.</li>\n\t<li><strong>MRI</strong> provides detailed images of anorectal abnormalities, but the time to acquire images is long and immediate access to MRI may be limited.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The treatment of anorectal abscess is prompt <strong>incision and drainage</strong> to evacuate pus and minimize further spread of infection.&nbsp; The method of drainage varies based on abscess location and clinical complexity.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Perianal abscess:&nbsp; Immunocompetent patients without systemic illness can typically be drained under local anesthesia.&nbsp; However, patients with large or recurrent perianal abscesses, immunocompromise, or Crohn disease should be evaluated for surgical drainage in the operating room.</li><br><br>\t<li>Perirectal abscess:&nbsp; tend to be more complex, and patients are typically admitted to the hospital for surgical drainage in the operating room.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Adjunctive treatments:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Antibiotic therapy is usually not necessary after abscess drainage except in the following circumstances:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Extensive cellulitis of surrounding skin</li>\n\t\t<li>Severe systemic illness (eg, sepsis)</li>\n\t\t<li>Immunocompromise</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pain management with oral analgesics (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or topical anesthetics (eg, lidocaine gel) and sitz baths or warm compresses to promote drainage and alleviate discomfort.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Although mortality from anorectal abscess is low, there is a significant risk of morbidity.&nbsp; Approximately 50% of patients with anorectal abscesses develop chronic anal fistula, a tunnel between the anus or rectum and the skin that causes persistent anal drainage and increased risk of recurrent abscess.&nbsp; Surgery is necessary to repair the fistula in most cases.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Anorectal abscess (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/97611.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is characterized by a collection of pus in the perianal or perirectal area.&nbsp; The most common symptom is anorectal pain that may be associated with fever and malaise.&nbsp; There are two categories of anorectal abscess, perianal and perirectal, which differ in their presentation, complexity, and management.&nbsp; A perianal abscess is an erythematous, fluctuant mass at the anal verge that is often drained in the outpatient setting.&nbsp; A deeper perirectal abscess may cause a fluctuant mass within the rectum and typically requires imaging and surgical drainage in the operating room.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
