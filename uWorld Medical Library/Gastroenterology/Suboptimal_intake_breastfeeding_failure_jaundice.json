Neonates typically have jaundice, excessive weight loss, and other signs of dehydration (eg, poor urine output).&nbsp; This is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be differentiated from other forms of neonatal jaundice.</p>\n<h1>Bilirubin metabolism</h1><br><br><p>Bilirubin is a product of red blood cell (RBC) catabolism and can be toxic in excess.&nbsp; It is metabolized by the liver and excreted primarily via the gastrointestinal tract, as follows (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16306.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Bilirubin conjugation</strong>:&nbsp; Bilirubin binds albumin for transport to the liver, wherebilirubin is metabolized in hepatocytes.&nbsp; In older children and in adults, bilirubin is conjugated by uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase and actively transported into bile.&nbsp; Neonates have physiologically lower levels of UDP glucuronosyltransferase activity (due to liver immaturity) and higher RBC turnover (due to shorter fetal RBC lifespan), leading to limited hepatic bilirubin conjugation and elevated unconjugated bilirubin.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bilirubin excretion</strong>:&nbsp; Beyond the neonatal period, most conjugated bilirubin is converted by intestinal bacteria into urobilinogen, which is then excreted in stool.&nbsp; Because neonates have minimal amounts of gut bacteria, most conjugated bilirubin is deconjugated by the endogenous enzyme beta-glucuronidase and reenters the bloodstream via enterohepatic circulation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Suboptimal intake (breastfeeding failure) jaundice is due to <strong>inadequate breast milk or formula intake</strong> in the first week of life that leads to decreased intestinal motility and delayed passage of stool.&nbsp; This results in <strong>decreased bilirubin elimination</strong>, allowing for more unconjugated bilirubin to be reabsorbed from the gut via enterohepatic circulation.&nbsp; An increase in total serum bilirubin levels results in jaundice.&nbsp; Insufficient feeding can develop due to any of the following:</p><br><br><p><strong>Maternal factors</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Delayed breast milk production.</li>\n\t<li>Infrequent feeding (eg, &lt;8 times/day).</li>\n\t<li>Ineffective feeding due to breast complications (eg, engorgement, cracked nipples, mastitis).</li>\n\t<li>Lack of breastfeeding support or formula mixing/administration education.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Neonate factors</strong> (more common in premature or small-for-gestational-age neonates)</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Poor latch or suck coordination.</li>\n\t<li>Increased sleepiness or fatigue.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Neonates with suboptimal intake (breastfeeding failure) <strong>jaundice are seen in the first week of life</strong> with yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes that typically follows a cephalocaudal progression.&nbsp; It starts at the head and eyes (scleral icterus) and spreads downward toward the trunk and extremities as serum bilirubin levels increase.</p><br><br><p>Jaundice is usually accompanied by <strong>excessive weight loss</strong> (≥10% from birth weight) and <strong>signs of dehydration</strong>, such as decreased urine output; the number of voids is fewer than expected, which should normally correlate to the day of life in the first week (eg, 1 void on day 1, 2 voids on day 2, and so forth).&nbsp; In addition, neonates may appear less vigorous due to dehydration and inadequate caloric intake.&nbsp; In cases of severe dehydration, findings can include a sunken fontanelle, reduced skin turgor, lethargy, increased heart rate, and delayed capillary refill.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Suboptimal intake (breastfeeding failure) jaundice is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be differentiated from other forms of neonatal jaundice.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Physiologic newborn jaundice</strong>:&nbsp; Decreased UDP glucuronosyltransferase activity and intestinal bacteria in neonates result in a physiologic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice that peak on days 3-5 of life and resolve by age 2 weeks.&nbsp; Physiologic newborn jaundice is not associated with dehydration.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Alloimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn</strong>:&nbsp; With either ABO or Rh incompatibility between the fetus and mother, antibodies can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis in the fetus.&nbsp; Increased RBC destruction results in elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels within 24 hours after birth; other laboratory evidence of hemolysis (eg, anemia, positive direct antiglobulin test) would be present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Breast milk jaundice</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/40363.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Beta-glucuronidase in breast milk can increase enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin in breastfed neonates, leading to jaundice after the first week of life.&nbsp; These neonates are otherwise healthy and well-hydrated.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Crigler-Najjar syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; This inherited disorder causes significantly reduced or absent UDP glucuronosyltransferase activity.&nbsp; Patients typically are seen in the first few days of life with markedly elevated serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin and jaundice that are present even in the setting of adequate feeding and hydration.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Biliary atresia</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L18877.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Progressive fibrotic obstruction of the biliary tree results in impaired biliary secretion (ie, cholestasis) and jaundice starting at age 2-8 weeks.&nbsp; However, pale stools and dark urine occur at age 2-8 weeks.&nbsp; Laboratory evaluation shows an increase in conjugated bilirubin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Evaluation and diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Neonates with moderate to severe jaundice (eg, extending below the chest) warrant measurement of indirect and direct bilirubin.&nbsp; Any features suggestive of an alternate etiology of jaundice, such as direct hyperbilirubinemia or a history of ABO incompatibility, warrant additional testing, including a hepatic function panel, complete blood count, and reticulocyte count.&nbsp; Evaluation of patients with severe dehydration may be more extensive (eg, basic metabolic panel, lumbar puncture) when assessing for electrolyte derangements and serious bacterial infections, which may present nonspecifically in neonates (eg, lethargy, poor feeding).</p><br><br><p>A diagnosis of suboptimal intake (breastfeeding failure) jaundice can be made in a neonate with <strong>indirect hyperbilirubinemia</strong>, <strong>excessive weight loss</strong>, and <strong>other signs of dehydration</strong> (eg, poor urine output) that develop during the first week of life and are not due to another identifiable cause.&nbsp; The remainder of liver function testing, including direct bilirubin level, and complete blood count are normal.&nbsp; In patients with severe dehydration, electrolyte assessment and renal function may have findings consistent with those of hypovolemia (eg, hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, prerenal azotemia).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of suboptimal intake (breastfeeding failure) jaundice focuses on maintaining adequate hydration and nutrition and promoting bilirubin excretion.</p><br><br><p>For vigorous neonates with infrequent feeding or for mothers with feeding concerns due to lack of breastfeeding support, lactation <strong>support and education regarding feeding</strong> is first-line management.&nbsp; Neonates typically require 8-12 feeds a day (every 2-3 hr) for the first few weeks of life.&nbsp; Lactation support can assist with an effective latch and transfer of breast milk.&nbsp; In cases of insufficient breast milk supply, formula supplementation may be required.&nbsp; Breastfeeding should be encouraged at the beginning of each feed to continue the stimulation of breast milk production.&nbsp; With increased fluid intake and stooling, more bilirubin is eliminated as fecal urobilinogen, and less intestinal bilirubin is reabsorbed in the enterohepatic circulation.&nbsp; Neonates are closely monitored (every 1-2 days) to ensure that urine output and weight increase appropriately.</p><br><br><p>In patients with severe dehydration or hypernatremia, inpatient admission for intravenous fluids may be required.&nbsp; In addition, those with bilirubin levels above the threshold for initiating phototherapy require inpatient admission for treatment and monitoring of hyperbilirubinemia (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24585.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>With early and appropriate feeding and monitoring, the prognosis for neonates with suboptimal intake (breastfeeding failure) jaundice is excellent, and the jaundice is expected to resolve without long-term complications.</p><br><br><p>In severe and untreated cases, very high levels of unconjugated bilirubin can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause bilirubin neurologic dysfunction, which may be irreversible.&nbsp; In addition, delayed diagnosis of severe dehydration can result in life-threatening organ damage (ie, hypovolemic shock) or electrolyte imbalances (eg, hypernatremia).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Suboptimal intake (breastfeeding failure) jaundice manifests as unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and dehydration due to insufficient oral intake during the first week of life.&nbsp; Decreased elimination leads to inadequate bilirubin excretion and increased enterohepatic circulation.&nbsp; Management includes increased oral intake and close monitoring until adequate rehydration and improvement of jaundice are achieved.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
