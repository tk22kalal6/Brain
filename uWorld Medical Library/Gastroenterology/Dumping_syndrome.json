These changes result in the rapid emptying of hypertonic gastric contents into the small intestine, which provokes a combination of postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramping) and vasomotor symptoms (eg, palpitations, diaphoresis).</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Normally, food moves through the stomach slowly, ensuring proper digestion.&nbsp; The pyloric sphincter serves as a barrier and allows only small, properly digested food particles to move to the small intestine.&nbsp; Surgical removal or bypass of the pyloric sphincter allows hyperosmolar, partially digested contents to enter the small intestine too rapidly, triggering a cascade of abnormal physiologic responses.</p><br><br><p>Dumping syndrome is categorized as either early or late, based on the timing and etiology of postprandial symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Early dumping syndrome</h2><br><br><p>Early dumping syndrome occurs within <strong>10-30 minutes</strong> of eating and results from the sudden delivery of hypertonic gastric contents into the small bowel.&nbsp; This creates a strong osmotic gradient, rapidly drawing fluid from the intravascular space into the intestinal lumen, leading to intestinal distension and hypovolemia.&nbsp; In response, the body activates autonomic (primarily sympathetic) reflexes and releases vasoactive peptides (eg, serotonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide), which contribute to the characteristic vasomotor symptoms, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Excessive intestinal fluid</strong>:&nbsp; Produces abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and bloating.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Autonomic/vasomotor hyperactivity</strong>:&nbsp; Results in flushing, diaphoresis, dizziness, and palpitations.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intravascular volume depletion</strong>:&nbsp; Leads to hypotension and tachycardia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Late dumping syndrome</h2><br><br><p>Late dumping syndrome (<strong>postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia</strong>) typically occurs <strong>2-3 hours</strong> after eating a carbohydrate-rich meal.&nbsp; Rapid delivery of glucose-rich gastric contents to the small intestine causes a spike in blood sugar, followed by an <strong>exaggerated insulin response</strong>.&nbsp; Patients develop <strong>reactive hypoglycemia</strong>, with symptoms including diaphoresis, tremors, palpitations, confusion, dizziness, weakness, and occasional syncope.&nbsp; This condition often occurs months to years after a bariatric/gastric surgery.</p>\n<h1>Etiology</h1><br><br><p>Dumping syndrome is often a sequelae of bariatric/gastric surgeries that alter normal gastrointestinal anatomy and motility:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Bariatric surgery:&nbsp; Gastric bypass (eg, Roux-en-Y (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L50770.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).</li>\n\t<li>Subtotal or total gastrectomy.</li>\n\t<li>Fundoplication.</li>\n\t<li>Pyloroplasty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</strong>:&nbsp; Can occur after surgical creation of a blind intestinal loop that promotes bacterial colonization.&nbsp; It manifests with diarrhea, bloating, nausea, and abdominal cramps.&nbsp; A postprandial onset of symptoms and vasomotor hyperactivity (eg, diaphoresis) are not typical.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Carcinoid syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Caused by serotonin-secreting tumors and characterized by spontaneous episodes of intense cutaneous flushing (sometimes associated with tachycardia and hypotension) and persistent watery diarrhea.&nbsp; Symptoms are not typically triggered by meals, and abdominal cramping and vomiting are not characteristic.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</strong>:&nbsp; Marked by abdominal discomfort and altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or both).&nbsp; However, this chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder occurs without prior surgery.&nbsp; In addition, symptoms are not solely post prandial, and autonomic symptoms (eg, tachycardia) are not expected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of dumping syndrome is <strong>primarily clinical</strong>, based on characteristic postprandial symptoms and a history of bariatric and/or gastric surgery.&nbsp; However, additional testing may be useful when the diagnosis is uncertain:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Gastric emptying study (gastric scintigraphy):&nbsp; Serial images track the movement of radiolabeled food at 1, 2, and 4 hours postmeal to determine the percentage of gastric contents emptied over time.&nbsp; Accelerated emptying supports the diagnosis of dumping syndrome.</li>\n\t<li>Oral glucose challenge test:&nbsp; Glucose load (eg, 50 g) is administered orally after 10 hours of fasting.&nbsp; Heart rate elevation of ≥10/min in the first hour is highly specific for early dumping syndrome.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Most cases of dumping syndrome can be managed successfully with the following dietary modifications:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Consume small, frequent meals, and eat slowly.</li>\n\t<li>Avoid simple sugars.</li>\n\t<li>Increase fiber and protein intake.</li>\n\t<li>Drink fluids between, rather than during, meals.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with refractory symptoms may benefit from a trial of pharmacologic therapy:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Octreotide:&nbsp; Somatostatin analogue that slows gastric emptying and reduces gastrointestinal hormone release.</li>\n\t<li>Acarbose:&nbsp; Slows carbohydrate breakdown and absorption in the intestine and helps prevent late dumping.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Surgical intervention (eg, pyloric reconstruction) is rarely needed and reserved only for patients with recalcitrant symptoms despite conservative management.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>With dietary management (± medication), most patients experience significant symptom relief, and symptoms of dumping syndrome usually diminish over time.</p>\n<h1>Summary&nbsp;</h1><br><br><p>Dumping syndrome (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/127062.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is caused by an accelerated rate of gastric emptying, most commonly following bariatric or gastric surgery.&nbsp; It occurs in 2 distinct forms:&nbsp; early and late.&nbsp; Early dumping syndrome typically arises within 10-30 minutes of eating and presents with gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, bloating, cramping) along with vasomotor symptoms (eg, flushing, diaphoresis).&nbsp; In contrast, late dumping syndrome occurs 2-3 hours postprandially and is characterized by hypoglycemic symptoms such as tremors, confusion, and fatigue.&nbsp; The diagnosis is primarily clinical, and symptoms are often managed effectively through dietary modifications.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
