The constantly elevated systemic levels of estrogen exert negative feedback on both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, which inhibits the release of gonadotropins (LH, FSH).&nbsp; This suppression prevents the midcycle LH surge required for ovulation.</li>\n\t<li>Cervical mucus thickening:&nbsp; due to the progestin component; the increased cervical mucus viscosity prevents sperm passage.</li>\n\t<li>Endometrial changes:&nbsp; The progestin component thins the endometrial lining, making it less suitable for implantation (this mechanism is also utilized for the management of patients with heavy menses).</li>\n\t<li>Decreased fallopian tube peristalsis:&nbsp; due to the progestin component; the decreased peristalsis limits oocyte transport and helps prevent fertilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Efficacy</h2><br><br><p>With perfect use (taken at the same time every day without missing any doses), OCPs are &gt;99% effective; but with typical use (including missing doses or taking at inconsistent times), they are 91% effective.</p><br><br><p>The efficacy of OCPs can be influenced by factors such as gastrointestinal disturbances (eg, vomiting or diarrhea) and interactions with other medications (eg, antibiotics, anticonvulsants) that increase liver microsomal enzyme activity.</p>\n<h2>Adverse effects</h2><br><br><p>While OCPs are generally well tolerated, the elevated systemic estrogen levels they cause can lead to a range of adverse effects (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/34862.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><p><strong>Common adverse effects</strong> (most common during the first few months of use)</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Nausea, bloating</li>\n\t<li>Breast tenderness</li>\n\t<li>Headaches</li>\n\t<li>Breakthrough bleeding</li>\n\t<li>Mood changes</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Serious adverse effects</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Venous thromboembolism (VTE):&nbsp;

provide predictable menstrual periods with decreased menstrual bleeding and decreased symptoms of dysmenorrhea (eg, bloating, cramping).</li>\n\t<li>Treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)</li>\n\t<li>Management of benign gynecologic conditions</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS):&nbsp; treats irregular menses, hirsutism, and acne (due to estrogen component increasing sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG], which reduces serum androgen levels).</li>\n\t<li>Endometriosis:&nbsp; can reduce pain and the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus.</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Reduces the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer:&nbsp; due to inhibition of ovulation and thinning the endometrium.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Special considerations</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>In postpartum patients, OCPs should not be started until &gt;21 days after delivery to mitigate the risk of VTE.&nbsp; In addition, in women who are breastfeeding, OCPs should not be started until at least 6 weeks postpartum due to possible impact on breastmilk production.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Progesterone-only contraceptive pills</h1><br><br><p>Progesterone-only contraceptive pills (POPs), also known as \"mini pills,\" are a form of hormonal contraception that are particularly useful for women who cannot take estrogen-containing contraceptives.</p>\n<h2>Mechanism of action</h2><br><br><p>POPs prevent pregnancy primarily through increasing the viscosity of cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to penetrate and reach the egg.&nbsp; This mechanism has a relatively short duration of action (&lt;20 hours), followed by a rapid return to fertility.</p><br><br><p>Compared to other forms of high-dose progestin or combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives, POPs are not reliable at inhibiting ovulation.</p>\n<h2>Efficacy</h2><br><br><p>POPs are effective when taken correctly, with an efficacy of approximately 98% with perfect use.&nbsp; However, for most patients, typical use has an efficacy of approximately 91%; this is due to the short duration of action of the pill, inconsistent administration schedule, and missed doses.&nbsp; In addition, the efficacy of POPs can be influenced by factors such as gastrointestinal disturbances (eg, vomiting, diarrhea) and interactions with other medications (eg, anticonvulsants, antibiotics).</p>\n<h2>Adverse effects</h2><br><br><p>POPs are generally well tolerated, but adverse effects include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Irregular menstrual bleeding (eg, spotting, breakthrough bleeding, or amenorrhea)</li>\n\t<li>Acne</li>\n\t<li>Mood changes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><p>Certain medical conditions and risk factors contraindicate the use of POPs:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pregnancy</li>\n\t<li>Active liver disease</li>\n\t<li>Current or past breast cancer</li>\n\t<li>Prior stroke or ischemic heart disease</li>\n\t<li>Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding</li>\n\t<li>History of malabsorptive bariatric surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Special considerations</h2><br><br><p>POPs are particularly suitable for certain populations:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Postpartum patients:&nbsp; can be initiated immediately postpartum and can be used in breastfeeding women because they do not affect milk production and have no adverse effects on the infant.</li>\n\t<li>Women with contraindications to estrogen</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>However, because POPs have such a short duration of action, they should be given only to patients who can take a daily pill with consistent timing (same time every day).&nbsp; Patients who cannot take a daily pill or have irregular schedules should be counseled on another form of contraception.</p>\n<h1>Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscular injection</h1><br><br><p>The depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) intramuscular (IM) injection is a long-acting progestin-only contraceptive method (commonly known as Depo-Provera) that is administered every 3 months.</p>\n<h2>Mechanism of action</h2><br><br><p>The depot medroxyprogesterone IM injection prevents pregnancy through several mechanisms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inhibiting ovulation (primary mechanism):&nbsp; inhibits the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, which decreases secretion of gonadotropins (LH,FSH), and prevents the midcycle LH surge needed for ovulation.</li>\n\t<li>Thickening of cervical mucus:&nbsp; increases the viscosity of cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to penetrate and reach the egg.</li>\n\t<li>Endometrial changes:&nbsp; thins the endometrial lining, making it less suitable for implantation of a fertilized egg.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Efficacy</h2><br><br><p>With the depot medroxyprogesterone IM injection, perfect use is approximately 99% effective and typical use is approximately 94% effective; this discrepancy is due to potential treatment delays in receiving the injection every 3 months (eg, missed appointments).</p>\n<h2>Adverse effects</h2><br><br><p>Although depot medroxyprogesterone IM injection is generally well tolerated, it can cause a range of adverse effects:</p><br><br><p><strong>Common adverse effects</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Irregular menstrual bleeding (eg, spotting, breakthrough bleeding), with approximately 50% of patients developing amenorrhea after a year</li>\n\t<li>Weight gain (high-dose progesterone stimulates appetite)</li>\n\t<li>Fatigue, nausea</li>\n\t<li>Injection site reaction</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Serious adverse effects</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Decreased bone mineral density:&nbsp; Long-term use of DMPA can reduce bone mineral density; however, it is generally reversible after discontinuation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><p>Certain medical conditions and risk factors are contraindications to the use of DMPA, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pregnancy</li>\n\t<li>Current or past breast cancer</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition to these contraindications, patients with the following conditions should be counseled on the risks of DMPA use:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Active liver disease</li>\n\t<li>Current or past breast cancer</li>\n\t<li>Ischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis</li>\n\t<li>Severe hypertension</li>\n\t<li>Diabetes mellitus with vascular complications</li>\n\t<li>Osteoporosis or significant risk factors (eg, chronic systemic glucocorticoid use) due to the risk of decreased bone mineral density with long-term use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Noncontraceptive benefits</h2><br><br><p>In addition to its use for pregnancy prevention, DMPA is used for a variety of gynecologic conditions due it commonly causing amenorrhea.&nbsp; Commonly treated conditions include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Abnormal uterine bleeding (particularly with concomitant iron deficiency anemia)</li>\n\t<li>Endometriosis</li>\n\t<li>Patients with cognitive impairment or decreased mobility that makes menstrual hygiene difficult to maintain</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Special considerations</h2><br><br><p>Medroxyprogesterone IM injection is particularly suitable for certain populations:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Postpartum patients:&nbsp; can be initiated immediately postpartum and can be used in breastfeeding women because it does not affect milk production and has no adverse effects on the infant.</li>\n\t<li>Women with contraindications to estrogen</li>\n\t<li>Women seeking long-term contraception</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In contrast, DMPA may not be appropriate for the following patient populations:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Patients who desire fertility within a year of starting contraception:&nbsp; After stopping DMPA, there can be a delay in the return to normal ovulatory cycles and fertility, often taking several months to a year.</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Patients who may have difficulty maintaining routine healthcare appointments (eg, unreliable transportation, inability to take time off work).&nbsp; DMPA injections are required every 3 months, and delays in injection increase the risk of pregnancy.</li>\n\t<li>Patients with osteoporosis or significant risk factors for low bone density (eg, chronic systemic glucocorticoid use):&nbsp; due to the risk of decreased bone mineral density with long-term DMPA use.&nbsp; If this is the best contraceptive option, these patients should be counseled on regular exercise, vitamin D and calcium supplementation, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Progestin-releasing subdermal implant</h1><br><br><p>The progestin subdermal implant (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25373.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a highly effective, long-acting, reversible contraceptive that provides extended protection against pregnancy.&nbsp; It involves the insertion of a small, flexible rod containing progestin under the skin of the upper arm.<p></p>\n<h2>Mechanism of action</h2><br><br><p>The progestin subdermal implant prevents pregnancy through 2 main mechanisms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Thickening of cervical mucus and decreased tubal mobility:&nbsp; Progestin increases the viscosity of cervical mucus, creating a barrier that impedes sperm penetration and motility.&nbsp; In addition, progestin decreases fallopian tube mobility; the combination of these mechanisms decreases the ability of sperm to fertilize the egg.</li>\n\t<li>Inhibiting ovulation:&nbsp; the continuous release of progestin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, preventing the midcycle surge of LH necessary for ovulation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Efficacy</h2><br><br><p>The progestin subdermal implant is one of the most effective contraceptive methods available, with perfect and typical use having a &gt;99% effectiveness rate (because once placed, it is not user dependent).&nbsp;

However, barrier contraception has the greatest typical use failure rate (approximately 80% efficacy), which is&nbsp; due to a variety of factors:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>For condoms, this is dependent on the condom being used correctly with every act of intercourse (ie, consistent use), with correct application and no breakage or slippage.</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>For cervical caps:&nbsp; These must be inserted before intercourse and left in place for up to 48 hours, with no movement of the device.</li>\n\t<li>For diaphragms:&nbsp; These must be inserted before intercourse and left in place for 6-24 hours after intercourse.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The efficacy of all forms of barrier contraception is improved with concomitant use of spermicides.&nbsp; Patients should be instructed to apply spermicide to the device before application/insertion and use additional spermicide with each act of intercourse.</p>\n<h2>Adverse effects</h2><br><br><p>Male condoms are generally safe and well tolerated, but they can cause some adverse effects, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Allergic reaction to latex:&nbsp; Latex is the most common material used in condoms; symptoms of allergic reaction can include itching, redness, and swelling.&nbsp; Nonlatex options (eg, polyurethane, polyisoprene) are available for those with latex allergies.</li>\n\t<li>Reduced sensation during intercourse:&nbsp; This can affect sexual satisfaction and decrease use rate.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The cervical cap and diaphragm are also typically safe, but adverse effects can include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Vaginal irritation</li>\n\t<li>Urinary tract infections:&nbsp; particularly with diaphragm use, as the device may exert pressure on the urethra.</li>\n\t<li>Toxic shock syndrome:&nbsp; Although rare, there is a risk of toxic shock syndrome if the device is left in place for &gt;24 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><p>Male condoms are safe for most people, but an absolute contraindication to use is:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Latex allergy:&nbsp; Individuals with a confirmed latex allergy should avoid latex condoms and use non-latex alternatives such as polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Risk factors that contraindicate the use of the cervical cap and diaphragm include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Allergy to spermicide or the device components</li>\n\t<li>History of toxic shock syndrome</li>\n\t<li>Frequent urinary tract infection</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Special considerations</h2><br><br><p>Because the cervical cap and diaphragm are reusable, and because there is risk of toxic shock syndrome, the devices must be cleaned and properly sanitized after each use.</p>\n<h1>Permanent contraception:&nbsp; bilateral tubal ligation and vasectomy </h1><br><br><p>Patients who desire permanent sterilization can undergo either bilateral tubal ligation or have their partner undergo vasectomy.&nbsp; In both procedures, patients require extensive counseling on the permanence of the procedure and the risk of regret, particularly in young and/or nulliparous patients.</p>\n<h2>Mechanism of action and efficacy </h2><br><br><p>In a bilateral tubal ligation, the fallopian tubes are either fully removed, have a section removed, or have a section occluded with either a surgical clip or via electrosurgical desiccation (ie, burning the tube to create an occlusion from the damaged tissue).&nbsp; Patients are typically recommended to avoid intercourse for several weeks, which is likely due to a combination of postsurgical recovery in addition to time needed for procedure permanence.</p><br><br><p>In a vasectomy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10120.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), the vas deferens is transected bilaterally to block the transport of new sperm.&nbsp; A vasectomy has no effect on existing sperm distal to the transection; a patient can still have viable sperm in the distal vas deferens for up to 3 months and at least 20 ejaculations following vasectomy.&nbsp; Sexual intercourse can typically be resumed within a week following the procedure, but pregnancy is still possible due to residual sperm in the ejaculate.&nbsp; Therefore, patients require serial semen analysis until azoospermia is confirmed, until which point they should use an additional form of contraception.<p></p>\n<h2>Special considerations </h2><br><br><p>Permanent sterilization should not be performed in patients unsure about future fertility.&nbsp; Though there are reversal procedures, the success rates of these procedures are small and decrease with time.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
