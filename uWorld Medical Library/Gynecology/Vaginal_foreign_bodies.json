In children, this may occur accidentally or in association with abuse.&nbsp; In adults, it may be related to sexual activity, forgotten tampons, vaginal devices, or surgical materials.</p><br><br><p>A retained foreign body can lead to chronic irritation of the vaginal mucosa, causing inflammation, infection, and discharge.&nbsp; Over time, a foreign body may erode into adjacent structures such as the bladder or rectum, potentially forming fistulas.&nbsp; Chronic retention increases the risk for secondary infections, ulceration, granulation tissue formation, and, rarely, systemic infection.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The symptoms of a retained vaginal foreign body vary based on the object's size, composition, duration of retention, and whether infection is present.&nbsp; Some cases may be asymptomatic, especially early on, whereas others may present with significant discomfort or complications.</p><br><br><p>Initial symptoms may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Malodorous vaginal discharge</strong> that is often <strong>profuse, purulent</strong>, or blood-stained (most common).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vaginal bleeding</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Vaginal pruritus.</li>\n\t<li>Dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>If left undetected for a prolonged period, a retained foreign body may lead to:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Vaginal ulceration.</li>\n\t<li>Fistula formation.</li>\n\t<li>Vaginal stenosis or scarring.</li>\n\t<li>Systemic infection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of a vaginal foreign body is primarily clinical, based on history and physical examination.&nbsp; However, a history of insertion of an object into the vagina is not always available, particularly in children or in patients with cognitive impairment.&nbsp; In children, a knee-chest or frog-leg position during physical examination is recommended; speculum examination should not be performed because it can result in significant discomfort and trauma due to the narrow vaginal introitus.&nbsp; In adults, a speculum examination usually identifies the foreign object.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation is <u>not</u> usually necessary for diagnosis, but it can be helpful if infection, trauma, or other complications are suspected.&nbsp; This can include wet mount microscopy, urinalysis, and cultures (eg, vaginal, blood).Imaging (eg, pelvic x-ray, MRI, CT scan) may be required if the foreign body is not easily visualized or if there is concern for complications (eg, abscess, fistula formation).</p><br><br><p>In rare cases, vaginoscopy (ie, the use of a small-diameter endoscope to evaluate the vaginal canal) may be used for direct visualization and removal.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Vulvovaginitis</strong>:&nbsp; Malodorous vaginal discharge may be present.&nbsp; Vaginal foreign bodies may cause vulvovaginitis, and a foreign body should be suspected if the vulvovaginitis does not resolve with standard treatment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Trauma or irritation</strong>:&nbsp; Accidental trauma (eg, straddle injury, scratching), sexual abuse, or irritant contact dermatitis (eg, soaps, bubble baths, perfumed products) may cause vaginal discomfort, discharge, and irritation that present similarly to a retained vaginal foreign body.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vaginal neoplasm</strong>:&nbsp; Rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) is a rare vaginal tumor in young girls.&nbsp; The tumor often presents as a polypoid structure causing vaginal bleeding and a protruding mass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cervical or vaginal polyps</strong>:&nbsp; These may lead to bleeding or blood-stained discharge as well as the sensation of something in the vagina.&nbsp; In cases where there is associated inflammation, polyps may also cause persistent or malodorous vaginal discharge.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Urethral prolapse</strong>:&nbsp; This can present as vaginal bleeding in prepubescent girls.&nbsp; The circular red or purple mass at the urethral opening may be mistaken for a foreign body and may cause discomfort due to the exposed mucosa.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management involves the removal of the foreign body; however, the mechanism of removal depends on the ability to visualize the object, the type of foreign body, and patient comfort.&nbsp; Small, easily visualized objects in both children and adults can typically be removed in the office.&nbsp; Patients with a suspected foreign body that cannot be visualized or is associated with severe complications (eg, button battery causing burns) require an <strong>examination under anesthesia</strong> (eg, vaginoscopy) and foreign body removal.&nbsp; Patient anxiety or lack of cooperation may also prohibit visualization, requiring examination under anesthesia.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis after removal of a vaginal foreign body is excellent in most cases because symptoms usually resolve rapidly once the object is removed.&nbsp; However, delays in diagnosis or removal can lead to complications such as vaginal ulcers, fistula formation, or systemic infection.</p><br><br><p>The most concerning complication is <strong>toxic shock syndrome</strong> (TSS), a rare but potentially life-threatening complication that can occur with a retained vaginal foreign body (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31755.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; TSS is caused by the release of bacterial exotoxins that bind directly to class II major histocompatibility complexes (bypassing normal intracellular antigen processing), and activate T cells indiscriminately, leading to a massive release of inflammatory cytokines.&nbsp; Clinical features include fever, shock (eg, hypotension, tachycardia), a diffuse macular rash, and multiorgan failure.&nbsp; Treatment is with aggressive intravenous fluids (and sometimes vasopressors), removal of the retained foreign body, surgical debridement (in the setting of wound infection), and antibiotics.<p></p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Vaginal foreign bodies are objects that become lodged in the vaginal canal, either intentionally or unintentionally.&nbsp;
