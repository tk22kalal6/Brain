Although most cases are benign, a thorough evaluation is required to establish the etiology and rule out malignancy.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The breast is composed of glandular tissue (lobules and ducts) surrounded by adipose and connective tissue (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27070.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Breast milk is made in the lobules and then drained by mammary ducts, which converge into the lactiferous sinuses beneath the nipple.&nbsp; The lobules and ducts are lined with epithelial cells that respond to hormonal and local stimuli.&nbsp; Nonlactation discharge from the nipple also arises from this glandular tissue and may involve single or multiple ducts.&nbsp; Nipple discharge that is not related to lactation is broadly categorized as physiologic (ie, benign) or pathologic (ie, concerning for malignancy).<p></p>\n<h2>Physiologic nipple discharge</h2><br><br><p>Physiologic nipple discharge (also known as galactorrhea) is a <strong>bilateral, multiductal, nonbloody discharge</strong> with a normal breast examination.&nbsp; It is not related to lactation and is <strong>most often due to a systemic cause</strong> (rather than the breast itself).&nbsp; Causes of physiologic discharge include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Nipple stimulation.</li>\n\t<li>Hyperprolactinemia (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/108698.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Elevated levels of prolactin stimulate breast glandular tissue, producing nipple discharge.&nbsp; High prolactin levels can occur due to chest wall injury (eg, burns, herpes zoster), pituitary or hypothalamic disease (infiltrative disorders, prolactinoma), medications (eg, antipsychotics), hypothyroidism, or renal disease (due to reduced clearance of prolactin).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pathologic nipple discharge</h2><br><br><p>Pathologic nipple discharge is <strong>unilateral, often uniductal, and varies in color</strong> (bloody is most concerning for malignancy).&nbsp; It is <strong>due to an abnormal process within the breast</strong>, which may be benign or malignant.</p><br><br><p>Lactation (breast milk secretion) is covered in detail in a separate review article.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation and assessment</h1><br><br><p>Nipple discharge may be spontaneous or provoked (ie, elicited with breast manipulation).&nbsp;

Ultrasonography is often performed in addition to mammography because it is useful for evaluation of mammary ducts, differentiating between cystic and solid lesions, and identifying lesions that may be missed on mammography (eg, lesions that are small, intraductal, or lack calcifications).</li>\n\t<li>Age ≥40:&nbsp; Mammography and ultrasonography are both used due to the increased likelihood of malignancy with increasing age.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Breast MRI is used when mammography and ultrasonography findings are negative in patients with pathologic nipple discharge.</p><br><br><p>Galactography and ductoscopy are less commonly used imaging modalities because they are technically challenging; therefore, they are used only when other imaging techniques fail to identify a cause.</p><br><br><p>Abnormalities detected on imaging are further evaluated by <strong>core needle biopsy</strong> to establish a histologic diagnosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28494.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Cytology of nipple discharge is not routinely performed because it has poor sensitivity and specificity and cannot localize breast lesions.<p></p>\n<h1>Management</h1><h2>Physiologic nipple discharge</h2><br><br><p>Patients with normal endocrine testing require no additional management other than routine breast screening.&nbsp; Premenopausal women can have transient, idiopathic galactorrhea that is benign and typically self-resolves.&nbsp; Education is often provided about avoiding nipple stimulation (eg, excessive self-examination, sexual stimulation).</p><br><br><p>Hyperprolactinemia is addressed in detail in a separate article.</p>\n<h2>Pathologic nipple discharge</h2><br><br><p>Management of pathologic nipple discharge depends on the underlying cause:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Intraductal papilloma (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28466.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; This is a benign papillary projection lined by epithelial and myoepithelial cells.
