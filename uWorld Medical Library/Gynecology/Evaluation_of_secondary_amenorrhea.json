There are various etiologies of secondary amenorrhea that are evaluated in a systematic manner.</p><p>This article focuses on causes and basic evaluation of secondary amenorrhea; additional information of the various etiologies can be found in separate articles.</p><h1>Causes</h1><h2>Pregnancy</h2><p>Pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea and should be evaluated for all patients of reproductive age regardless if they are on contraception or claim to not be sexually active.</p><h2>Hypothalamic causes</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24459.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li>Hypothalamic tumors.</li><li>Systemic illnesses.</li></ul><p>In hypothalamic disorders, impaired gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion causes inappropriate FSH and LH secretion from the anterior pituitary gland, which then leads to underproduction of estrogen and progesterone by the ovaries and results in a failure to menstruate.</p><h2>Pituitary causes</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Prolactin disorders (eg, hyperprolactinemia, pituitary adenomas) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L83702.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li>Thyroid disorders (both hypothyroidism and hyperthryoidism) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45228.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li>Sheehan syndrome (postpartum pituitary infarction).</li></ul><p>Prolactin and thyroid disorders affect secretion of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary gland, as both increase the release of prolactin and thereby reduce GnRH release from the hypothalamus and FSH and LH secretion from the pituitary.&nbsp; In Sheehan syndrome, damage and infarction of the anterior pituitary causes low FSH and LH levels with the resultant low estrogen and progesterone.</p><h2>Ovarian causes</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/57293.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li>Primary ovarian insufficiency (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31997.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li>Ovarian tumors (eg, Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors).</li></ul><p>In PCOS and some ovarian tumors, the lack of ovulation does not trigger the endometrial shedding required for menstruation.&nbsp; In primary ovarian insufficiency, direct failure of the ovary to release estrogen does not allow for endometrial thickening or subsequent shedding for menstruation.</p><h2>Uterine causes</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Intrauterine adhesions (ie, Asherman syndrome (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L43267.png\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).</li><li>Cervical stenosis.</li></ul><p>In cases of intrauterine adhesions, scar tissue forms and replaces the normal endometrium; therefore, the endometrium does not proliferate or shed, resulting in amenorrhea.&nbsp; Cervical stenosis, which can occur with loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP) or cold knife cone, can lead to an outflow tract obstruction and amenorrhea.</p><h1>Evaluation</h1><h2>History</h2><p>The cause of secondary amenorrhea can usually be divided into subcategories based on history and physical examination.</p><p>In addition to menstrual history, specifics in the patient's history that can help in diagnosis include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Signs of testosterone excess:&nbsp; Hirsutism, acne, or previously irregular menses may indicate PCOS, ovarian or adrenal tumors, or adrenal disease (ie, nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia).</li><li>Signs of estrogen deficiency:&nbsp; Hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or decreased libido may indicate primary ovarian insufficiency.</li><li>Review of symptoms:&nbsp; Stress, changes in weight, or changes in diet or exercise may indicate a hypothalamic cause.&nbsp; Headaches, visual field deficits, or galactorrhea may indicate a pituitary cause.</li><li>Medical history:&nbsp; Endocrine disorders (eg, thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia) or other systemic illnesses (eg, Cushing disease, Celiac disease).</li><li>Obstetric history:&nbsp; Postpartum hemorrhage may indicate a hypothalamic or uterine cause; endometritis may indicate a uterine cause.</li><li>Family history:&nbsp; May suggest an ovarian cause (eg, primary ovarian insufficiency, fragile X premutation).</li></ul><h2>Physical examination</h2><p>The physical examination should evaluate for signs of hyperandrogenism, estrogen deficiency, underlying endocrine disorder, and systemic illnesses.</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>General examination:&nbsp; BMI ≥30kg/m<font size=\"2\"><sup>2</sup></font> may indicate PCOS; BMI &lt;18.5kg/m<font size=\"2\"><sup>2</sup></font> is suggestive of a hypothalamic cause (eg, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea) or systemic illness (eg, Celiac disease).</li><li>Skin examination:&nbsp; Hirsutism, acne, stria, or acanthosis nigricans suggest PCOS, an endocrine disorder (eg, Cushing disease), or systemic illness (eg, diabetes mellitus).</li><li>Breast examination:&nbsp; Galactorrhea suggests a pituitary disorder.</li><li>Pelvic examination:&nbsp; Vulvovaginal atrophy suggests primary ovarian insufficiency, and a stenotic cervix suggests primary ovarian insufficiency or cervical stenosis.</li></ul><h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><p>The first step in the evaluation of secondary amenorrhea is a <strong>pregnancy test</strong>, as the most common cause is pregnancy.&nbsp; If a pregnancy test is negative, evaluation is with serum levels of the following (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/U2542.png\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>FSH level</strong>:&nbsp; A low FSH level suggests a hypothalamic or pituitary cause; a high FSH level suggests primary ovarian insufficiency.</li><li><strong>Prolactin level</strong></li><li><strong>TSH level</strong></li></ul><p>In some patients, additional testing can include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Serum <strong>testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels</strong>:&nbsp; If signs of hyperandrogenism exist, evaluate for PCOS and androgen-secreting ovarian or adrenal tumors.&nbsp; A <strong>17-hydroxyprogesterone level</strong> is also included if there is concern for nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</li><li>Serum <strong>estradiol levels</strong>:&nbsp; Can be used in conjunction with FSH levels to help determine some etiologies, particularly when FSH levels are normal (such as PCOS).</li></ul><h2>Progestin withdrawal test</h2><p>In patients with secondary amenorrhea but a relatively normal initial laboratory evaluation, the progesterone withdrawal test can be used to assess the effect of estrogen on the uterine endometrium (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/98054.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In this test, progesterone is administered for several days and then discontinued.<p></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Bleeding after progesterone withdrawal confirms ovarian estrogen production, because estrogen normally stimulates endometrial proliferation and thickening, and progesterone normally maintains the endometrium (eg, supporting implantation).&nbsp; Therefore, withdrawal of progesterone leads to shedding of the endometrium (mimicking menstrual bleeding).&nbsp; Secondary amenorrhea despite the presence of estrogen is most commonly due to PCOS, in which elevated estrogen levels cause a relatively normal FSH level but do not allow for ovulation due to an imbalanced FSH/LH ratio.</li><li>The absence of withdrawal bleeding suggests either no endometrial proliferation due to hypoestrogenism (with an inappropriately normal FSH [eg, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea]) or structural abnormalities (eg, intrauterine adhesions, cervical stenosis).</li></ul><h2>Imaging</h2><p>Imaging is not always necessary but should be guided based on the suspected underlying etiology of amenorrhea.&nbsp; For example, a transvaginal ultrasound allows for assessment of ovarian morphology (ie, polycystic ovaries) if PCOS is suspected.&nbsp; Ultrasonography can also help assess the thickness of the endometrial lining thickness, which can reflect estrogen levels (ie, a thickened endometrium means normal or high serum estrogen levels).&nbsp; In cases of a suspected prolactinoma or other hypothalamic/pituitary disease, MRI of the brain is necessary.</p><h1>Management</h1><p>The goals of the management of secondary amenorrhea are to correct the underlying cause, restore fertility (if possible), and prevent complications associated with the underlying disease.&nbsp; Therefore, management is tailored to the etiology.</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Hypothalmic causes</strong>:&nbsp; Treatment is aimed at the underlying etiology and can include lifestyle modifications, weight correction, nutritional support, stress reduction, and treatment optimization of the underlying systemic illness.</li><li><strong>Pituitary causes</strong>:&nbsp; Treatment of the underlying prolactin or thyroid disorder typically resolves the amenorrhea.&nbsp; Patients with Sheehan syndrome require hormone replacement therapy.</li><li><strong>Ovarian causes</strong>:&nbsp; Treatment is based on estrogen levels.&nbsp; Patients with low estrogen levels (eg, primary ovarian insufficiency) require hormone replacement therapy; those with high estrogen levels (eg, PCOS) require hormonal contraception (eg, oral contraceptive pills, progestin-releasing intrauterine device) for endometrial cancer prevention.</li><li><strong>Uterine causes</strong>:&nbsp; Typically require surgical management with lysis of intrauterine adhesions or removal of scarred cervical tissue.</li></ul><p>More detailed management of these specific etiologies are discussed is separate dedicated articles.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for ≥3 months in women with previously regular menses OR ≥6 months in women with previously irregular menses.&nbsp; The most common cause of secondary amenorrhea is pregnancy; therefore, initial evaluation is with a pregnancy test.&nbsp; If negative, patients should undergo a systematic evalution for other causes of amenorrhea from hypothalamic, pituitary, ovarian, and uterine etiologies.</p></div>\n            "
