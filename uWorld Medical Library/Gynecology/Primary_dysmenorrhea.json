Patients with primary dysmenorrhea have increased endometrial prostaglandin production, which causes uterine hypercontractility, hypertonicity, vasoconstriction, and resultant ischemia.&nbsp; This causes the pain symptoms associated with the onset of menses.&nbsp; The local release of inflammatory mediators and prostaglandins also affects the gastrointestinal system, resulting in associated diarrhea, nausea, and bloating.</p><br><br><p>Several factors can increase the likelihood of developing primary dysmenorrhea.&nbsp; These include adolescence (the most common gynecologic issue in this population), tobacco use, and stress.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with primary dysmenorrhea typically have the following classic symptoms:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Cramping, midline lower abdominal pain that begins 1-2 days prior to menses and stops 1-2 days after the onset of menses (due to uterine hypercontractility and hypertonicity)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Pain that can radiate to the lower back and thighs</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Systemic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (due to prostaglandin-induced stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract)</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea is mainly clinical and is based on history alone.&nbsp; Patients who have a classic history of cramping, midline lower abdominal pain that begins 1-2 days prior to menses, with relief 1-2 days after the onset of menses, do <u>not</u> require a physical examination.&nbsp; If a physical examination is performed, it is generally normal.</p><br><br><p>However, patients with any of the following clinical features should be evaluated for secondary causes of dysmenorrhea (eg, endometriosis, adenomyosis, uterine anomaly):</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Symptom onset at age &gt;25</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Unilateral (nonmidline) pelvic pain</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>No systemic symptoms (eg, fatigue, nausea) during menses</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Abnormal uterine bleeding (eg, intermenstrual bleeding, postcoital spotting)</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with a possible secondary cause of dysmenorrhea require a physical examination and pelvic ultrasonography.&nbsp; Additional testing (eg, nucleic acid amplification testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia) is dependent on risk factors and physical examination findings.</p>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation and imaging</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory tests are generally not necessary for the diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea.&nbsp; However, they may be considered if secondary causes are suspected:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Complete blood count</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Urine pregnancy test</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Nucleic acid amplification testing for infectious etiologies (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>FSH, TSH, and prolactin levels if symptoms are associated with abnormal uterine bleeding</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Imaging studies, most commonly pelvic ultrasonography, are not routinely required but may be indicated to rule out secondary causes of dysmenorrhea.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of primary dysmenorrhea is based on the degree of pain (determined by the effect on daily activities) and focuses on symptom relief.</p><br><br><p>Patients with mild symptoms often do not require treatment.&nbsp; However, if patients would like pain relief, first-line treatment is with the following:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Nonpharmacologic methods</strong>:&nbsp; Heat application, regular physical exercise, and stress-management techniques often help relieve pain.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</strong> (NSAIDs):&nbsp; NSAIDs reduce prostaglandin levels and alleviate pain.&nbsp; They should be started 1-2 days prior to the onset of menses (when symptoms start) and continued until the pain resolves.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In patients who also desire contraception, treatment is with:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Oral contraceptive pills</strong> (OCPs):&nbsp; OCPs reduce endometrial prostaglandin production by inhibiting both ovulation (eg, preventing pregnancy) and endometrial decidualization, leading to decreased menstrual blood loss, prostaglandin production, inflammation, and dysmenorrhea symptoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for primary dysmenorrhea is generally good.&nbsp; Symptoms typically improve with age, especially after childbirth.&nbsp; Both NSAIDs and OCPs are effective for symptom control and improve the patient's quality of life.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Primary dysmenorrhea (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35624.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a common gynecologic condition characterized by painful pelvic cramping that begins 1-2 days before the onset of menses and then resolves several days after the onset of bleeding.&nbsp;
