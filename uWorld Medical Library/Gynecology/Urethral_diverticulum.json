The persistent infection, inflammation, and increased tissue tension in the area can cause development of the diverticulum and a tender anterior vaginal wall mass.&nbsp; The diverticulum may collect urine and debris, resulting in purulent discharge, dysuria, or postvoid dribbling.</p><br><br><p>Other possible causes include recurrent urinary tract infections (because chronic inflammation can weaken the urethral wall), pelvic floor trauma or surgery (eg, vaginal delivery), and recurrent obstruction (eg, urethral stone).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with a urethral diverticulum (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L32317.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) may have a range of symptoms, but the classic triad of symptoms includes:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Dysuria</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Dyspareunia</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Postvoid dribbling</strong> (due to urine trapping in the diverticulum)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other symptoms include recurrent urinary tract infection, urinary incontinence, and a palpable, tender mass in the anterior vaginal wall with or without a purulent, bloody discharge.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis, laboratory evaluation, and imaging</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of a urethral diverticulum is confirmed with <strong>pelvic MRI</strong> (gold standard) in patients suspected of having urethral diverticulum.&nbsp; Prior to imaging, other etiologies for the clinical presentation should be excluded by performing the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Physical examination</strong>:&nbsp; Most urethral diverticula form on the posterior aspect of the urethra, which can be felt as a tender, anterior vaginal wall mass.&nbsp; When the diverticulum is palpated, a purulent or bloody discharge may be expressed through the urethra.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Urinalysis</strong>:&nbsp; used to evaluate for malignancy and urinary tract infection.&nbsp; Patients with a urethral diverticulum can have leukocytes and blood on urinalysis (due to inflammation and collection of debris).&nbsp; Those with a positive urinalysis require urine culture.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Urine culture</strong>:&nbsp; performed to rule out urinary tract infection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Several conditions may mimic urethral diverticula, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Urinary tract infections</strong>:&nbsp; can present with dysuria, incontinence, and postvoid dribbling, but patients do not have an anterior vaginal wall mass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cystocele</strong> (anterior vaginal wall prolapse):&nbsp; often presents with vaginal pressure and incomplete bladder emptying (due to loss of anterior vaginal wall support).&nbsp; Patients have a large vaginal mass (due to herniation of bladder into vagina) that increases with the Valsalva maneuver, not a discrete tender mass that produces purulent fluid through the urethra with palpation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Interstitial cystitis</strong>:&nbsp; typically presents with pain with bladder filling that is relieved by voiding.&nbsp; There is typically no postvoid dribbling or anterior vaginal wall mass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Urethral stricture</strong>:&nbsp; narrowing of the urethra; can cause dysuria, dyspareunia, and recurrent urinary tract infections, but patients typically do not have an anterior vaginal wall mass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vesicovaginal fistula</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29721.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; typically presents with constant, rather than intermittent, leakage of urine due to continuous drainage of the bladder into the vagina.&nbsp; In addition, there is no associated anterior vaginal wall mass.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>In patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, management is conservative, with antibiotic prophylaxis against urinary tract infections.&nbsp; In most cases, however, treatment is surgical with removal of the diverticulum (<strong>diverticulectomy</strong>).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for patients with a urethral diverticulum is generally favorable, especially with appropriate surgical intervention.&nbsp; Recurrence rates are low, but patients should be monitored for potential complications, including urethral stricture formation, urinary incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract infections.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>A urethral diverticulum (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32437.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a localized outpouching of the urethral mucosa through the muscular wall of the urethra.&nbsp;
