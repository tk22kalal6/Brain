Ovarian masses can arise from each of these ovarian tissues due to various processes, including hormonal stimulation, infection/inflammation, and neoplasias.</p><br><br><p>Ovarian masses are common gynecologic findings that can be discovered incidentally on imaging or during the evaluation of pelvic pain, bloating, or menstrual irregularities.&nbsp; Most masses are benign, but their evaluation requires a systematic approach to differentiate between functional cysts, benign tumors, and ovarian cancer.</p>\n<h1>Common ovarian masses</h1><h2>Benign ovarian masses</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Functional cysts</strong>:&nbsp; Hormonal variations within the menstrual cycle lead to the growth and development of an ovarian follicle in preparation for ovulation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16436.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Following ovulation, the continued growth and distension of this follicle can lead to fluid-filled follicular or corpus luteum cysts.&nbsp; Functional cysts usually resolve by the next menstrual cycle.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pregnancy-related ovarian masses</strong>:&nbsp; hCG stimulation (eg, normal pregnancy, multifetal pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease, ovarian hyperstimulation) can lead to the development of <strong>theca-lutein cysts</strong> (multiseptated ovarian cysts) or <strong>luteomas</strong> (solid ovarian masses).&nbsp; These masses tend to be bilateral and can secrete androgens, causing maternal hirsutism or virilization.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Endometriomas</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16637.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Ectopic endometrial tissue can implant on the ovary and bleed, creating cysts filled with thick, dark fluid (chocolate cysts) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28864.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tuboovarian abscesses</strong>:&nbsp; These typically occur as a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease and appear as complex adnexal masses, typically associated with fever and adnexal and cervical motion tenderness.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Serous or mucinous cystadenomas</strong>:&nbsp; These benign neoplasias arise from the ovarian surface epithelium; they are typically thin-walled cysts that can grow very large.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mature cystic teratomas (dermoid cysts)</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L7022.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; These benign tumors are composed of various cell types, including ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal elements; grossly may contain hair, teeth, and sebaceous material.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ovarian fibromas</strong>:&nbsp; These are solid, benign tumors are composed of fibroblasts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Malignant ovarian masses</h2><br><br><p>Malignant ovarian masses are classified by the type of tissue from which they arise (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L40934.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Epithelial ovarian cancers</strong>:&nbsp; Include various histologic subtypes (eg, serous, mucinous, clear cell, endometrioid).&nbsp; The most common type of ovarian cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer tends to occur in older women and is often diagnosed at advanced stages.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Germ cell tumors</strong>:&nbsp; Include immature teratomas, dysgerminomas, and yolk sac tumors; they tend to occur in women age &lt;30.&nbsp; Elevated tumor markers include hCG, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sex cord–stromal tumors</strong>:&nbsp; Include granulosa cell tumors and Sertoli-Leydig tumors.&nbsp; Granulosa tumors cause symptoms of estrogen excess (eg, precocious puberty, abnormal uterine bleeding).&nbsp; Sertoli-Leydig tumors cause symptoms of androgen excess (eg, clitoromegaly, hirsutism, deepening of the voice).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Metastases</strong>:&nbsp; Involve the spread of malignant cells to the ovary from a different primary cancer (eg, gastrointestinal tract [Krukenberg tumor], breast).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Risk factors for benign ovarian masses include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Reproductive age.</li>\n\t<li>Ovulation induction or ovarian hyperstimulation.</li>\n\t<li>Tamoxifen use.</li>\n\t<li>Use of an intrauterine device or contraceptive implant.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Risk factors for malignant ovarian masses include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Postmenopausal age.</li>\n\t<li>Hereditary cancer syndromes (eg, <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutations, Lynch syndrome).</li>\n\t<li>Family history of ovarian cancer.</li>\n\t<li>Endometriosis (increased risk for endometrioid and clear cell ovarian cancers).</li>\n\t<li>Nulliparity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Ovarian masses are often asymptomatic because the abdominopelvic cavity conceals masses arising from the relatively free-floating ovaries.&nbsp; Therefore, symptoms may not be present until the mass reaches a certain size or is discovered incidentally on examination or imaging.&nbsp; When symptoms are present, they may include pelvic/abdominal pain (unilateral), pelvic pressure, abdominal bloating or distension, dyspareunia, or bladder/bowel symptoms (eg, urinary frequency, constipation) from mass effect.</p><br><br><p>Acute onset of severe pain with nausea and/or vomiting is concerning for ovarian torsion (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29661.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), a surgical emergency in which the ovary twists on its ligamentous support, occluding its blood flow.<p></p><br><br><p>Early satiety, bloating, and unintentional weight loss are concerning for malignancy.</p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><h2>Step 1:&nbsp; Clinical assessment</h2><br><br><p>The evaluation of an ovarian mass begins with a history, physical examination, and urine pregnancy test.&nbsp; History should focus on:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Onset, duration, and progression of symptoms (eg, pelvic pain, pressure).</li>\n\t<li>Associated symptoms (eg, bowel/bladder symptoms, menstrual irregularities, nausea/vomiting, fever/chills, weight loss).</li>\n\t<li>Menstrual history (eg, regularity/irregularity, pain with menstruation, use of hormonal contraceptives).</li>\n\t<li>Sexual activity (eg, new partners, number of lifetime partners), prior sexually transmitted infections, barrier contraception use.</li>\n\t<li>Family history of malignancy.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Physical examination includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Abdominal examination:&nbsp; Evaluate for signs of peritonitis (eg, guarding, rebound tenderness) and abdominal distension/ascites (eg, fluid wave).</li>\n\t<li>Pelvic examination:&nbsp; Evaluate the cervix for cervical motion tenderness and abnormal vaginal discharge.&nbsp; Bimanual examination helps elucidate mass size, location, consistency, mobility, and tenderness.&nbsp; A rectovaginal examination should also be performed to evaluate for nodularity, which is suggestive of malignancy.</li>\n\t<li>Evaluation of lymph nodes and signs of metastatic disease:&nbsp; Inguinal nodes, as well as the skin around the umbilicus (eg, Sister Mary Joseph nodule indicates advanced metastatic disease), should be assessed.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>A urine pregnancy test immediately excludes ectopic pregnancy or corpus luteum cyst as a cause of the ovarian mass.</p>\n<h2>Step 2:&nbsp; Imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>The primary imaging modality used to evaluate ovarian masses is <strong>transvaginal ultrasonography</strong>, which characterizes the ovarian mass and adjacent structures (eg, uterus, peritoneal fluid, adjacent bowel).&nbsp; Doppler ultrasonography is often used to assess blood flow to bilateral ovaries.</p><br><br><p>Certain ovarian masses have characteristic features that can lead to a presumptive diagnosis:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Teratoma (dermoid cyst) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L71169.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; May have a variety of appearances and components, including hyperechoic lines (hair), acoustic shadowing, and calcifications (teeth).</li>\n\t<li>Follicular cyst:&nbsp; Thin-walled unilocular cyst with anechoic fluid.</li>\n\t<li>Endometrioma (ie, chocolate cyst) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L119603.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Chocolate cyst with a homogeneous ground-glass appearance.</li>\n\t<li>Hemorrhagic cyst (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/U117413.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Complex cyst containing anechoic fluid with lace-like reticular echoes.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Ultrasonography identifies the need for immediate surgical intervention (eg, torsion [ie, no blood flow], hemoperitoneum).&nbsp; It also characterizes masses as likely benign or concerning for malignancy based on the following features:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Benign features:&nbsp; Simple, thin-walled, mobile.</li>\n\t<li>Malignant features:&nbsp; Thick septations, solid components, immobile, internal vascularity.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>If ultrasonography is inconclusive, an MRI can be used for further characterization.&nbsp; In patients with suspected ovarian cancer, CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis is used to evaluate for metastases (eg, omental caking, enlarged pelvic/paraaortic lymph nodes, pleural effusions).</p>\n<h2>Step 3:&nbsp; Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Histologic diagnosis is the only way to definitively diagnose an ovarian mass.&nbsp; However, because ovarian cancers have the potential to seed the peritoneal cavity (increasing their cancer stage), biopsies are not performed.&nbsp; Therefore, for ovarian masses without clear, characteristic features on ultrasonography, laboratory evaluation further classifies the mass as either benign or malignant:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>An hCG screen is always performed in women with ovarian masses to rule out pregnancy-related masses (eg, ectopic pregnancy).</li>\n\t<li>Complete blood count may be performed to assess for anemia or infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tumor markers</strong> can be increased in some ovarian malignancies, and screening may be indicated depending on patient age, symptoms, and imaging findings:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Cancer antigen (CA-125):&nbsp; Nonspecific marker for epithelial ovarian cancers (however, also elevated in benign conditions [eg, endometriosis, pregnancy]).</li>\n\t\t<li>AFP, LDH, and quantitative hCG:&nbsp; Elevated in germ cell tumors.</li>\n\t\t<li>Inhibin and estradiol:&nbsp; Elevated in granulosa cell tumors.</li>\n\t\t<li>Testosterone:&nbsp; Elevated in Sertoli-Leydig tumors.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of an ovarian mass depends on the degree of suspicion of malignancy.</p>\n<h2>Likely benign masses</h2><br><br><p>Observation is preferred for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ovarian masses that are likely benign.&nbsp; Size dictates management for simple cysts:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>&lt;3-5 cm:&nbsp; No further imaging.</li>\n\t<li>&lt;5 cm:&nbsp; Surveillance (ie, repeat imaging in several months to ensure stability/resolution).</li>\n\t<li>&gt;5 cm:&nbsp; Ovarian teratomas or endometriomas are typically surgically removed because they are unlikely to resolve, and they increase the risk for torsion or rupture.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>For patients with acute presentations (eg, torsion, rupture), surgical management is indicated with ovarian cystectomy (premenopausal) or oophorectomy (postmenopausal).&nbsp; Tuboovarian abscesses are managed with intravenous antibiotics and may require image-guided drainage.</p>\n<h2>Indeterminate masses</h2><br><br><p>Indeterminate ovarian masses are often managed with surgery because the prognosis of ovarian cancer is poor unless it is detected and treated early; some patients may elect for surveillance with repeat ultrasonography.&nbsp; Factors that should prompt surgery include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Masses &gt;10 cm (especially in postmenopausal patients).</li>\n\t<li>Symptoms of ovarian cancer (eg, weight loss, bloating, early satiety).</li>\n\t<li>Findings suspicious for a germ cell or sex cord–stromal tumor.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>After removal of the mass, histologic evaluation determines whether it is benign or malignant and therefore whether it dictates additional management.</p>\n<h2>Masses suspicious for malignancy</h2><br><br><p>Patients with a high risk for ovarian cancer (eg, hereditary cancer syndrome, ascites, evidence of metastasis, elevated CA-125, characteristic findings on ultrasonography) should undergo surgery by a gynecologic oncologist.&nbsp; Patients with advanced disease require exploratory laparotomy with tumor debulking followed by chemotherapy.</p><br><br><p>Details about ovarian cancer can be found in a separate dedicated article.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Ovarian masses are a common clinical finding and may cause symptoms such as pelvic pain or pressure.&nbsp; The ultimate goal of the evaluation is to determine the risk for malignancy and reduce the rate of complications (eg, rupture, torsion).&nbsp; Transvaginal ultrasonography is the primary diagnostic tool, and tumor markers can aid in risk assessment.&nbsp; Management is dependent on the likelihood of malignancy.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
