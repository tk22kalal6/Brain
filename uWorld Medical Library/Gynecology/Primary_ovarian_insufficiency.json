POI typically presents with abnormal uterine bleeding or amenorrhea, infertility, and symptoms of estrogen deficiency similar to those experienced during menopause.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Ovarian function (ie, hormone production, ovulation) requires functioning ovarian follicles.&nbsp; Ovarian follicles naturally undergo depletion with increasing age.&nbsp; In most women, they are completely depleted by age 51, the average age of menopause.</p><br><br><p>Patients with POI lose ovarian function sooner (ie, <strong>age &lt;40</strong>); the most common pathogenesis is the accelerated depletion of primordial follicles (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28056.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In most patients, the cause of accelerated follicle depletion is idiopathic; however, several risk factors and underlying causes have been identified, including:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Prior ovarian surgery, chemotherapy, or pelvic radiation (ie, damage to follicles)</li>\n\t<li>Genetic abnormalities\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Turner syndrome (45,X) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L41042.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )</li>\n\t\t<li>Fragile X syndrome premutation</li>\n\t\t<li>Other X chromosome abnormalities</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Family history of POI</li>\n\t<li>Autoimmune oophoritis (ie, lymphocytic infiltration of theca cells)</li>\n\t<li>Personal or family history of autoimmune disorders (eg, autoimmune thyroid disease, autoimmune adrenal insufficiency)</li>\n\t<li>Galactosemia, likely due to toxic effects of galactose metabolites on the ovaries</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Once all follicles are depleted, the ovary no longer ovulates or produces estrogens, inhibin, or androgens.&nbsp; This hypogonadism leads to abnormal uterine bleeding or amenorrhea, infertility, and signs of estrogen deficiency (eg, vaginal dryness).&nbsp; The loss of estrogen and inhibin production (ie, loss of negative feedback control on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian [HPO] axis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24345.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )) causes an increase in GnRH, FSH, and LH characteristic of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The presenting symptoms of POI are similar to those of menopause:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Menstrual irregularities</strong> (eg, abnormal uterine bleeding, amenorrhea), which may not be identified until hormonal contraception is discontinued (due to masking of the irregularities)</li>\n\t<li>Symptoms of <strong>estrogen deficiency</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L81987.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Vasomotor symptoms: hot flashes, flushing, night sweats</li>\n\t\t<li>Genitourinary symptoms: vaginal dryness (ie, atrophic vaginitis), dyspareunia</li>\n\t\t<li>Sexual dysfunction and decreased libido</li>\n\t\t<li>CNS symptoms: sleep disturbances, fatigue, difficulty concentrating</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infertility</strong> (anovulation due to follicle depletion)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Some patients with POI have intermittent ovarian function and occasional ovulatory menstrual cycles;

Otherwise, the examination is typically normal unless another related condition is present (eg, Turner syndrome [eg, short stature, shield chest], Hashimoto thyroiditis [eg, goiter], autoimmune adrenal insufficiency [eg, increased skin pigmentation, orthostatic hypotension]).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>All patients presenting with new-onset menstrual irregularities require a standardized evaluation, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pregnancy test</li>\n\t<li>Serum FSH level</li>\n\t<li>Serum TSH and prolactin levels (because thyroid disorders and prolactinemia are common causes of irregular menses)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>POI can be definitively diagnosed in patients with <strong>menstrual irregularities</strong> (eg, abnormal uterine bleeding, amenorrhea) and <strong>elevated serum FSH</strong> in the postmenopausal range.&nbsp; A low serum estradiol also supports the diagnosis.&nbsp; Imaging (eg, pelvic ultrasonography) is not required for diagnosis, although it is commonly performed in the evaluation of amenorrhea and infertility.&nbsp; Patients typically have unremarkable findings, but those with autoimmune oophoritis may have enlarged, cystic ovaries.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for POI includes other causes of menstrual irregularities (eg, abnormal uterine bleeding, secondary amenorrhea).</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea</strong>:&nbsp; causes menstrual irregularities and estrogen deficiency.&nbsp; However, FSH is low (ie, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hyperprolactinemia</strong>:&nbsp; can cause amenorrhea, but prolactin is elevated and FSH levels are low because prolactin inhibits hypothalamic GnRH production.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Thyroid disease</strong>:&nbsp; hypothyroidism can cause menstrual irregularities; however, TSH is high, FSH is low, and with no signs of estrogen deficiency.&nbsp; FSH is low because low T3/T4 increases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates prolactin production.&nbsp; Prolactin inhibits GnRH production, leading to low FSH.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Asherman syndrome</strong> (ie, intrauterine adhesions):&nbsp; can cause menstrual irregularities and infertility, but estrogen and FSH levels are normal.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sheehan syndrome</strong> (ie, pituitary ischemia):&nbsp; can cause amenorrhea, but patients typically have low FSH and low levels of other pituitary hormones (ie, panhypopituitarism).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</strong>:&nbsp; can cause menstrual irregularities and anovulatory infertility; however, estrogen and FSH levels are usually normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Once POI is diagnosed, multiple issues must be addressed, including:</p>\n<h2>Treatment for hypogonadism</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Estrogen therapy</strong> is recommended unless there is an absolute contraindication (eg, venous thromboembolism).&nbsp;
