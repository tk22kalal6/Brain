A thorough history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing determine the cause and guide management.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Vaginal discharge can be either physiologic or indicative of a pathologic process.</p><br><br><p>Physiologic leukorrhea is normal vaginal discharge that occurs due to fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone levels (ie, from menarche to menopause).&nbsp; Leukorrhea is odorless and composed of endocervical secretions, vaginal epithelial cells, and vaginal transudate that may be white, clear, or slightly yellow.&nbsp; The consistency (watery vs mucoid) and quantity of discharge vary over the course of the menstrual cycle (ovulation) and with pregnancy.</p><br><br><p>Nonphysiologic discharge occurs due to pathologic processes that can involve infections (most common), inflammatory conditions (increased transudate or vaginal secretions), or malignancy (blood-tinged discharge with cervical or endometrial cancer).</p>\n<h1>Evaluation</h1><h2>History</h2><br><br><p>Many etiologies of vaginal discharge cause characteristic symptoms or findings.&nbsp; Therefore, a presumptive diagnosis is often made based on the history and physical examination.</p><br><br><p>The history should focus on:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Appearance of discharge (eg, thick and clumpy vs thin and watery).</li>\n\t<li>Associated symptoms (eg, odor, dysuria, pruritus, swelling, pelvic or vaginal pain).</li>\n\t<li>Sexual history (eg, new partners, use of barrier contraception).</li>\n\t<li>Use of vaginal products (eg, douches, feminine washes, creams, powders).</li>\n\t<li>Medication use (eg, oral contraceptives, recent antibiotics).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Significant symptoms associated with vaginal discharge may suggest a specific etiology:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pruritus predominant:&nbsp; Vulvovaginal candidiasis.</li>\n\t<li>Odor predominant:&nbsp; Bacterial vaginosis.</li>\n\t<li>Dyspareunia predominant:&nbsp; Acute cervicitis.</li>\n\t<li>Odor or appearance of feces or urine:&nbsp; Fistula.</li>\n\t<li>Symptoms of estrogen deficiency (eg, hot flashes, vaginal dryness):&nbsp; Atrophic vaginitis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inspection of the vulva for erythema, edema, erosions, and lesions.</li>\n\t<li>Speculum examination to assess discharge characteristics (eg, bloody, mucopurulent) and the appearance of the cervix (eg, punctate lesions) and check for the presence of a foreign body (eg, retained tampon) or fistula.</li>\n\t<li>Bimanual examination to assess for cervical motion tenderness (a sign of pelvic infection) or pelvic masses.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The speculum and internal vaginal examinations are usually deferred in children, who are instead examined in a frog-leg or knee-chest position to aid visualization.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Laboratory testing of the vaginal discharge is typically performed to aid in diagnosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21422.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; A sample of discharge is collected with a cotton swab and spread onto a slide and pH paper.&nbsp; Components of testing include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>pH testing</strong>:&nbsp; The normal pH of physiologic discharge in reproductive-age women is 3.8-4.5.&nbsp; The pH is normal with vulvovaginal candidiasis but elevated (&gt;4.5) with bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis.&nbsp; Noninfectious causes of vaginal discharge (eg, atrophic vaginitis) and the presence of other body fluids (eg, blood, semen, amniotic fluid) can also lead to elevations in pH.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Whiff test</strong>:&nbsp; A notable fishy (ie, amine) odor following the application of potassium hydroxide (KOH) to a slide coated with vaginal discharge is characteristic of bacterial vaginosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Wet mount microscopy</strong>:&nbsp; Direct microscopic visualization of discharge with both saline and KOH (improves visualization of yeast).&nbsp; Classic findings of select conditions include:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Bacterial vaginosis:&nbsp; Clue cells (vaginal epithelial cells with a stipulated border due to adherent coccobacilli) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99296.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t\t<li>Trichomoniasis:&nbsp; Motile trichomonads (flagellated protozoans that move around the visual field) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L53528.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t\t<li>Vulvovaginal candidiasis:&nbsp; Pseudohyphae and budding yeast.</li>\n\t\t<li>Vaginal atrophy:&nbsp; Increased parabasal epithelial cells (ie, small, immature epithelial cells with increased nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio).</li>\n\t\t<li>Cervicitis:&nbsp; Increased polymorphonuclear cells.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Nucleic acid amplification testing</strong> (NAAT):&nbsp; Used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis, as well as <em>Candida</em>, <em>Trichomonas</em>, chlamydia, or gonorrhea infection.&nbsp; NAAT has greater sensitivity compared to microscopy and should be performed in sexually active individuals with vaginal discharge, even if the initial evaluation is negative.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Vaginal or vulvar culture is typically performed only to identify specific <em>Candida</em> species in patients with treatment-resistant vulvovaginal candidiasis.&nbsp; Patients with vulvovaginal or cervical lesions may require biopsy of the lesion to be submitted for pathologic review (eg, for cervical cancer).</p>\n<h1>Etiologies</h1><br><br><p>The causes of pathologic vaginal discharge are categorized as infectious (more common, frequent in reproductive-age women) and noninfectious (less common, can occur at any age but are often seen in prepubertal girls and perimenopausal or postmenopausal women).</p>\n<h2>Infectious etiologies</h2><br><br><p>Lactobacilli are part of the normal vaginal flora in estrogenized women.&nbsp; Lactobacilli produce lactic acid from the glycogen within vaginal epithelial cells, resulting in an acidic environment (pH 3.8-4.5) that helps suppress the growth of pathogenic organisms.&nbsp; However, alterations in the vaginal flora (decrease in lactobacilli) can lead to the overgrowth of other normally occurring species, creating pathologic vaginal discharge.&nbsp; Conditions include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Bacterial vaginosis</strong>:&nbsp; The most common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge.&nbsp; Bacterial vaginosis occurs when there is an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria (eg, <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em>).&nbsp; The increase in anaerobic bacteria causes an increase in vaginal pH (&gt;4.5), amine production, and vaginal epithelial cell exfoliation, leading to the characteristic fishy odor and increased vaginal discharge.&nbsp; Microscopy shows clue cells.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vulvovaginal candidiasis</strong>:&nbsp; <em>Candida</em> species are part of the normal vaginal flora; however, alterations in immune function or in the balance of the vaginal microbiome allow for excessive <em>Candida</em> proliferation and cause symptomatic infection.&nbsp; On examination, the vulva and introitus may be erythematous and edematous, and plaques of thick, clumpy, cottage cheese–like discharge may be adherent to the vaginal walls (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31218.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Microscopy shows pseudohyphae and budding yeast.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Trichomoniasis</strong>:&nbsp; <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>, a sexually transmitted flagellated protozoan, produces a frothy, yellow-green, malodorous discharge that may be accompanied by vaginal irritation, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia.&nbsp; Examination may show vaginal erythema, a \"strawberry\" cervix (punctate hemorrhages that give the cervix a red, stippled appearance), and an elevated (&gt;4.5) vaginal pH.&nbsp; Microscopy shows motile trichomonads.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acute cervicitis</strong>:&nbsp; Most cases of acute cervicitis are due to <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> or <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> infection.&nbsp; Patients may have mucopurulent discharge, intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding, and dyspareunia.&nbsp; On examination, discharge is visualized at the endocervical canal, and the cervix may appear inflamed and friable (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22227.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Microscopy shows numerous polymorphonuclear cells.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Prepubertal girls may have vaginal discharge and vulvar itching due to infections from different organisms (eg, respiratory and enteric flora from autoinoculation, enterobiasis [ie, pinworms]).</p>\n<h2>Noninfectious etiologies</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Foreign body</strong>:&nbsp; The presence of a foreign body (eg, forgotten tampon, toilet paper) within the vagina is a common cause of abrupt-onset vaginal discharge in adults and children.&nbsp; The discharge is typically green or yellow and may be accompanied by light vaginal spotting and odor.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Atrophic vaginitis</strong>:&nbsp; Low-estrogen states (childhood, menopause, lactation) can cause a thin, watery discharge that may be clear, white, or yellow.&nbsp; The discharge is generally not accompanied by significant pain, but there may be mild vulvar pruritus.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (DIV)/contact dermatitis</strong>:&nbsp; DIV is a chronic condition with frequent relapses characterized by copious vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and vaginal irritation.&nbsp; The vulva often appears normal, but vaginal erythema and erosions may be present.&nbsp; Chronic hypersensitivity (ie, contact dermatitis) can develop from mechanical or chemical irritants (eg, perfumes, soaps) can cause pruritus and occasional discharge that resembles infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fistula</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29721.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L51572.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; An abnormal communicating path between the vagina and the bladder, urethra, or rectum can cause the drainage of urine, feces, or malodorous discharge from the vagina.&nbsp; Fistulas should be suspected in patients with prior pelvic or vaginal surgery, radiation, Crohn disease, or obstetric lacerations.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Malignancy</strong>:&nbsp; Both cervical and endometrial cancer can cause abnormal bloody or necrotic discharge.&nbsp; In cases of cervical cancer, there is often associated postcoital bleeding and possibly a fungating or eroding cervical mass (particularly with advanced disease).&nbsp; In endometrial cancer, there is typically also abnormal uterine bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Vaginal discharge due to specific etiologies typically improves with appropriate treatment (eg, antimicrobials for infectious causes, vaginal estrogen therapy for atrophic vaginitis, topical corticosteroids for lichen planus), although recurrences are common.&nbsp; Details about the treatment of each condition are discussed in separate dedicated articles.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Vaginal discharge is a common gynecologic issue that may represent normal physiologic discharge (leukorrhea) or be a symptom of a pathologic process such as infection or inflammation.&nbsp; The evaluation of vaginal discharge requires careful history taking, physical examination, and laboratory testing.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
