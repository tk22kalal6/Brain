It is characterized by significant vulvar discomfort (eg, pruritus, burning) and white, atrophic plaques that can progress to scarring and altered vulvar architecture.</p>\n\t<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>The exact pathogenesis of lichen sclerosus is multifactorial but poorly understood.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>The most understood contributing factor is estrogen deficiency because lichen sclerosus most commonly occurs during periods with physiologic low-estrogen levels (eg, prepuberty, postmenopause).&nbsp; Additional factors, such as genetics and autoimmune mechanisms, may contribute to the development of lichen sclerosus, but the exact mechanisms are unknown.&nbsp; Therefore, risk factors include:</p>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Prepubertal or postmenopausal age (bimodal distribution due to physiologic low-estrogen levels)</li>\n\t\t<li>Autoimmune disorder (eg, thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo)</li>\n\t\t<li>Family history</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t\n\t<p>As a result of these factors, the vulva thins and atrophies, creating hypopigmented and sclerotic plaques that increase skin sensitivity and lead to intense pruritus and burning.&nbsp; With chronic trauma (eg, itching, rubbing), secondary mild lichenification (thickening) occurs and edema develops.</p>\n\t<h1>Clinical presentation</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>Because lichen sclerosus is a chronic and progressive inflammatory skin condition, its clinical presentation and symptomatology vary based on the duration of the disease.</p>\n\t<h2>Early disease</h2>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Symptoms:&nbsp; The most common symptom is <strong>vulvar pruritus</strong> that is worse at night, often interfering with sleep.&nbsp; Other common symptoms include pain, dyspareunia, and painful defecation (due to fissuring in the perianal area).&nbsp; In prepubertal patients, constipation is a common and often the presenting symptom.</li>\n\t\t<li>Physical examination:&nbsp; The vulvar architecture remains intact in early disease; findings include sclerotic plaques with <strong>thin, white, wrinkled skin</strong>, referred to as cigarette-paper lesions.&nbsp; Lesion size varies from small, isolated areas to involvement of the entire vulva and perianal region.&nbsp; Because lichen sclerosus often spares the vagina, a classic <strong>keyhole sign</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16393.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) may be present.&nbsp; Chronic pruritus can lead to erosions, bleeding, and ulceration superimposed on the white plaques.&nbsp; Perianal thickening and anal fissures are common.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<h2>Late disease</h2>\n\t\n\t<p>As vulvar lichen sclerosus progresses, scarring and loss of the vulvar architecture can develop, which alters the predominant symptoms and clinical findings.</p>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Symptoms due to changes in the vulvar architecture:&nbsp; <strong>Dyspareunia</strong> develops as the introitus contracts and scars and the clitoral hood fuses over the clitoris.&nbsp; Pain with defecation and constipation develop as sclerosus progresses around the anus.&nbsp; In severe cases, urinary symptoms (eg, dysuria, nocturia, urinary obstruction) can develop due to complete midline fusion of the labia.</li>\n\t\t<li>Physical examination:&nbsp; Normal anatomy is lost as the sclerotic plaques cause fusion (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L50760.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) of the labia minus to the labia majus and clitoral hood retraction.&nbsp; At the end stages, the vulva is pale and featureless with complete midline fusion.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<h1>Diagnosis</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>A clinical examination with characteristic features is often sufficient for diagnosis.&nbsp; However, lichen sclerosus is associated with a risk for <strong>vulvar squamous cell carcinoma</strong>, and a punch biopsy is often performed to rule out malignancy.&nbsp; A punch biopsy is also recommended in patients with atypical-appearing lesions (ie, nonhealing ulcers), those whose lesions present at an atypical age (ie, reproductive age), or those who experience initial treatment failure.</p>\n\t<h1>Pathology</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>Histopathologic examination (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L115586.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) of vulvar lichen sclerosus biopsy shows:<p></p>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Epidermal changes such as thinning of the epidermis, hyperkeratosis (increased thickness of the stratum corneum due to chronic irritation), and loss of the rete ridges (characteristic of lichen sclerosus)</li>\n\t\t<li>Dermal changes such as homogenization of collagen in the upper dermis, edema, and a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate (due to chronic inflammation)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia or vulvar cancer</strong>:&nbsp; most often presents as a small, isolated lesion on the labia majora (eg, nonhealing ulcer, fleshy/nodular mass).&nbsp; In contrast, vulvar lichen sclerosus involves large areas of the vulva and presents as sclerotic plaques with atrophic changes.&nbsp; Because of the association between lichen sclerosus and cancer, vulvar punch biopsies are often performed to evaluate for cancer.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Lichen planus</strong>:&nbsp; can present with similar pruritic or painful vulvar lesions; however, patients also typically have pruritic, purple/pink, polygonal papules and plaques overlayed with white striae (Wickham striae).&nbsp; In addition, the histopathology of lichen planus (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L76059.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) includes sawtooth rete ridges (as opposed to a loss of rete ridges in lichen sclerosus) and scattered, eosinophilic colloid (Civatte) bodies.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Genitourinary syndrome of menopause</strong> (GSM):&nbsp; can present with thinning of the vulvar skin and labial adhesions, which can lead to dyspareunia.&nbsp; However, GSM also has loss of vaginal rugae and elasticity, whereas lichen sclerosus spares vaginal involvement.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Vitiligo</strong>:&nbsp; depigmented patches can occur on the vulva; however, atrophic changes and pruritus are not seen in these areas.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Psoriasis</strong>:&nbsp; typically presents with pruritic, well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scales.&nbsp; Patients often have additional lesions elsewhere on the body.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<h1>Management</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>Because vulvar lichen sclerosus is a progressive disease that can cause severe dysfunction and disfigurement, all patients—including asymptomatic and prepubertal patients—require treatment.&nbsp; The goals of treatment are to resolve signs (eg, fissures, lichenification) and symptoms (eg, pruritus, pain) of active disease, prevent disease progression, and, possibly, reduce the risk for vulvar malignancy.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>First-line treatment is with <strong>superpotent topical corticosteroids</strong> (eg, clobetasol propionate).&nbsp; Patients are typically prescribed an initial high-dose treatment protocol followed by a maintenance regimen of various dosing strengths based on symptom control.&nbsp; Patients should also use topical emollients and lubricants to maintain skin hydration and help dyspareunia.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Most symptoms improve after treatment with topical corticosteroids, but patients who continue to have symptoms can be treated with intralesional corticosteroids, a calcineurin inhibitor, or possible surgery.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Patients require routine follow-up to monitor for treatment efficacy, adverse effects, and potential malignant transformation.</p>\n\t<h1>Prognosis</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>Vulvar lichen sclerosus is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by relapses and periods of remission; therefore, patients require chronic treatment.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Patients also have an increased risk for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (~5% lifelong risk) that requires regular monitoring, particularly in those who do not have symptom improvement with treatment.&nbsp; However, patients may have a slightly decreased risk for malignancy when active disease is controlled.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Because of progressive scarring and loss of normal vulvar architecture, patients often have pain with sexual intercourse or abstain from it and require treatment to improve their sexual function and quality of life.</p>\n\t<h1>Summary</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>Vulvar lichen sclerosus is a chronic and progressive inflammatory skin condition characterized by significant vulvar discomfort (eg, pruritus, burning) and white, atrophic plaques that can progress to scarring and altered vulvar architecture.&nbsp; Treatment is with topical corticosteroids.</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\n            "
