This condition most commonly occurs in prepubertal girls (peak incidence at age 2-3) and postmenopausal women due to a combination of low estrogen levels and local irritation or inflammation.&nbsp; Although often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, labial adhesions can sometimes lead to urinary or vaginal symptoms.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The cause of labial adhesions is not fully understood, but the underlying mechanism likely involves <strong>low estrogen levels</strong>, resulting in thin and delicate genital tissues that are more susceptible to microtrauma followed by local inflammation or irritation that denudes the epithelial surface.&nbsp; As the inflamed and injured tissues attempt to heal, the lack of lubrication (also caused by low estrogen levels) results in the formation of a thin fibrous bridge of tissue between the labia minora, leading the tissues to fuse (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44582.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Inflammatory cells may be present in the early stages, but fully developed adhesions often show minimal inflammation.<p></p><br><br><p>Risk factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Age</strong>:&nbsp; Labial adhesions most commonly occur in prepubertal girls age 3 months to 6 years (with peak incidence at age 2-3 years) and in postmenopausal women.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Local inflammation or irritation</strong>:&nbsp; Poor hygiene, diaper rash, vulvovaginitis, or exposure to irritants (eg, soaps, detergents) increases the presence of inflamed and fragile tissue that is more likely to develop epithelial trauma and breakdown.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dermatologic conditions</strong>:&nbsp; Disorders such as eczema or lichen sclerosus can promote inflammation and increase vulnerability to adhesions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Genital trauma</strong>:&nbsp; Straddle injury, female genital mutilation, and sexual abuse trigger the healing pathway that allows adhesions to form.</li><br><br>\t<li><strong>Infection</strong>: <em>Candida albicans</em>, group A <em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae,</em> and herpes simplex virus trigger an inflammatory response and healing process that can lead to unintended tissue fusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Labial adhesions can be partial (involving only a small portion of the labia) or complete (with a small orifice for urine to exit).&nbsp; <strong>Partial adhesions</strong> are often <strong>asymptomatic</strong> and discovered incidentally during routine examinations.&nbsp; However, some patients may develop symptoms such as pain or pruritus, which can lead to secondary excoriations and exacerbate adhesion development.&nbsp; <strong>Complete adhesions</strong> are more likely to result in symptoms because <strong>involvement near the urethral meatus</strong> may impact urination.&nbsp; Symptoms may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Difficulty urinating or urinary dribbling after voiding.</li>\n\t<li>Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).</li>\n\t<li>Recurrent vaginal infections.</li>\n\t<li>Vulvar pruritus (likely due to the underlying inflammatory cause of adhesions rather than the adhesions themselves).</li>\n\t<li>A visible, thin membrane or fusion of the labia minora with possible obstruction of the vagina.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Labial adhesion is a clinical diagnosis based on pelvic examination, which reveals partial or complete <strong>fusion of the labia minora at the midline</strong>, often extending from the posterior fourchette toward the clitoris.&nbsp; There is usually a small opening remaining for urine flow.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Laboratory tests are not typically required unless there is suspicion for UTI or another underlying infection.&nbsp; Urinalysis and urine culture may be indicated if urinary symptoms are present.&nbsp; Swabs to assess for bacterial vaginosis or yeast may be taken if vulvovaginitis is suspected.&nbsp; Skin cultures may be collected if there is significant inflammation, discharge, or concern for secondary infection, although this is rare.</p><br><br><p>Imaging is generally unnecessary.&nbsp; However, in cases where there is suspicion for an underlying structural anomaly or concern for severe urinary obstruction, pelvic ultrasonography may be performed to assess for urinary retention or congenital anomalies.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Imperforate hymen</strong>:&nbsp; Appears as a bulging membrane at the vaginal opening, often in adolescents with primary amenorrhea and cyclic pain.&nbsp; There is no fusion of the labia, and obstruction is at the hymenal level.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cloacal malformation</strong>:&nbsp; Presents as a single perineal opening due to abnormal fusion of the urinary, genital, and gastrointestinal tracts.&nbsp; This is generally diagnosed in the neonatal period.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lichen sclerosus</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16392.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Causes white, atrophic patches and possible scarring or fusion.&nbsp; This chronic inflammatory skin condition can mimic or cause labial adhesions but typically involves pruritus and skin changes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dermatitis</strong>:&nbsp; Manifests with redness, irritation, or swelling caused by soaps, diapers, or poor hygiene.&nbsp; May lead to secondary adhesions, but the primary concern is inflammation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Candida vulvovaginitis</strong>:&nbsp; Presents with a beefy-red rash on the vulva as well as vaginal pruritis and discharge.&nbsp; Although patients with repeat candida infections are prone to labial adhesions, candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with a rash and vaginal discharge, which are uncommon in isolated labial adhesions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Urethral prolapse</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L46745.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Presents in prepubertal girls or postmenopausal women with inflamed, friable tissue in a donut shape at the urethral meatus due to hypoestrogenic shape.&nbsp; The labia are not involved.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Labial hypertrophy</strong>:&nbsp; Involves the enlargement of the labia minora, which is typically symmetric and could be mistaken for abnormal fusion.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sexual abuse</strong>:&nbsp; May cause vulvar lacerations that resemble adhesions during healing, especially if bilateral (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35906.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management depends on the severity of symptoms and the degree of adhesion.</p><br><br><p>In <strong>asymptomatic</strong> cases, <strong>no treatment</strong> is necessary if only a small portion of the labia is involved and the adhesions are not affecting the urine stream.&nbsp; This is because the vast majority of these cases resolve spontaneously (particularly in prepubertal girls with increased estrogen production at puberty).&nbsp; In asymptomatic cases, genital hygiene, use of barrier ointments (eg, petroleum jelly), and avoidance of irritants (eg, bubble baths, wipes, perfumed soaps, tight-fitting clothes) are recommended.</p><br><br><p>For labial adhesions that cause extensive labial fusion (ie, <strong>complete adhesions</strong>) or <strong>urinary symptoms</strong> (eg, diversion of the urinary stream, recurrent UTIs, vaginal pain or discharge), first-line treatment involves the application of <strong>topical estrogen therapy</strong> (eg, conjugated estrogen or estradiol) to the adhesion line for several weeks.&nbsp; Adverse effects can include temporary estrogenic effects (eg, breast budding, mild pigmentation) that are usually reversible after stopping treatment.&nbsp; Surgical separation, although rarely required, is indicated in severe cases with urinary obstruction or when topical therapy fails.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for labial adhesion is excellent.&nbsp; Most cases resolve with topical estrogen therapy, and complications are rare.&nbsp; However, recurrence is common, occurring in an estimated 10%-15% of cases, especially if the underlying irritants or hypoestrogenic states persist.&nbsp; Recurrences are usually mild and respond to treatment.</p><br><br><p>Permanent scarring or functional impairments are rare.&nbsp; Long-term complications such as infertility or sexual dysfunction are not associated with simple labial adhesions.&nbsp; The prognosis is improved with early recognition, mild or partial adhesions, and hygiene practices.&nbsp; In contrast, the prognosis is worse with recurrent UTIs, underlying inflammatory dermatosis, inadequate hygiene, and continued exposure to irritants.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Although not all cases of labial adhesions can be prevented (especially because low estrogen levels are normal in young girls and postmenopausal women), certain practices can reduce the risk by minimizing irritation and inflammation in the vulvar area.</p><br><br><p>Preventive strategies include maintaining perineal hygiene (eg, cleaning the genital area with only warm water only or mild soaps, avoiding overwashing or scrubbing the vulva, wiping front to back to prevent fecal contamination), avoiding irritants such as bubble baths and harsh soaps, and wearing cotton underwear and breathable, nonrestrictive clothing.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Labial adhesion is a common, benign condition in which the labia minora fuse together either partially or completely.&nbsp; It typically affects prepubertal girls and postmenopausal women, often due to a combination of low estrogen levels and local irritation or inflammation.&nbsp; Most cases are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, although some may present with urinary symptoms or visible fusion of the labia minora.&nbsp; Diagnosis is clinical, and management options range from observation to topical estrogen therapy or, rarely, surgical separation.&nbsp; Most labial adhesions resolve spontaneously or with minimal treatment, though recurrence is common if maintenance care is not performed.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
