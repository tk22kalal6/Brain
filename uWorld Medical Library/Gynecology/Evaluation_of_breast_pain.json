A systematic approach to history-taking, clinical examination, and diagnostic evaluation differentiates benign from malignant causes and guides management.</p><br><br><p>Breast pain is broadly classified into:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cyclic breast pain</strong>:&nbsp; The most common type of breast pain.&nbsp; Pain originates in the breast and varies throughout the menstrual cycle.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Noncyclic breast pain</strong>:&nbsp; Pain originates in the breast but does not have a temporal correlation to the menstrual cycle.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Extramammary (referred) pain</strong>:&nbsp; Pain originates outside the breast but is perceived as breast pain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The underlying mechanisms of breast pain vary depending on the etiology.</p>\n<h2>Cyclic breast pain</h2><br><br><p>Cyclic breast pain is due to <strong>hormonal fluctuations</strong> that occur with the menstrual cycle (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16436.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The <strong>late luteal phase</strong> is associated with a rise in progesterone (stimulates breast stromal tissue) and estrogen (stimulates glandular elements in the breast (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27070.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).&nbsp; These hormonal changes lead to ductal and stromal proliferation, fluid retention, and <strong>breast tenderness</strong> in the days immediately prior to the <strong>onset of menstruation</strong>.<p></p>\n<h2>Noncyclic breast pain</h2><br><br><p>Noncyclic breast pain is usually due to <strong>local factors in the breast</strong>, including inflammation, tissue trauma, fluid retention, noncyclic hormonal conditions, structural lesions, and mechanical stress.&nbsp; Various etiologies include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hormonal conditions:&nbsp; Pregnancy, hormone replacement therapy, hormonal contraceptives.</li>\n\t<li>Benign lesions of the breast:&nbsp;

Possible etiologies include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Chest wall:&nbsp; Overuse, injury, or inflammation of pectoralis major and minor muscles; costochondritis; chest wall irritation (eg, herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia) or trauma.</li>\n\t<li>Neurologic:&nbsp; Irritation of the intercostal nerve (which innervates the breasts), cervical radiculopathy.</li>\n\t<li>Lung:&nbsp; Respiratory infection, pulmonary embolism.</li>\n\t<li>Cardiac: Ischemic heart disease (particularly left-sided breast pain), pericarditis.</li>\n\t<li>Gastrointestinal tract:&nbsp; Gastroesophageal reflux, gallbladder disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><h2>Cyclic breast pain</h2><br><br><p>Cyclic breast pain usually causes <strong>bilateral, diffuse breast pain</strong> that may be worse in the upper outer quadrants.&nbsp; Onset <strong>occurs monthly</strong> in the week immediately prior to menses, and pain usually resolves with menstruation.&nbsp; It may be accompanied by other symptoms of the late luteal phase, such as bloating, fatigue, irritability, and mood swings.</p>\n<h2>Noncyclic breast pain</h2><br><br><p>Noncyclic breast pain can be sharp, burning, or aching.&nbsp; It may affect <strong>one or both breasts</strong> and can be <strong>diffuse or focal</strong>.&nbsp; The pain may be constant or intermittent, but it does <em>not</em> correlate with the menstrual cycle.&nbsp; Depending on the etiology, patients may report additional symptoms such as a breast mass, nipple discharge, or changes to the appearance of the breast.</p>\n<h2>Extramammary pain</h2><br><br><p>Extramammary pain is more likely to be <strong>unilateral</strong> than bilateral, and the pain can be dull or sharp and intermittent or constant.&nbsp; Pain that is due to nerve irritation or injury is frequently burning in quality.&nbsp; Depending on the etiology, pain is often worse during certain activities (eg, eating, deep breathing, movement, exertion) and is frequently <strong>accompanied by pain in other locations</strong> (eg, sternum, abdomen, back, neck).</p>\n<h1>Clinical assessment</h1><br><br><p>A thorough history should be obtained, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Characteristics of breast pain:&nbsp; Location, quality, duration, relation to menstrual cycle, precipitating or exacerbating factors.</li>\n\t<li>Associated symptoms:&nbsp; Breast mass, nipple discharge, fever, pain in other locations.</li>\n\t<li>History of breast or chest wall trauma or surgery.</li>\n\t<li>Gynecologic and obstetric history:&nbsp; Menstrual cycle, pregnancy, lactation.</li>\n\t<li>Medication use.</li>\n\t<li>Family history of malignancy.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>A physical examination should also be performed:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cardiac, respiratory, and abdominal examination may reveal signs of extramammary causes of breast pain, including:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Herpes zoster:&nbsp; Dermatomal rash.</li>\n\t\t<li>Costochondritis:&nbsp; Tenderness to palpation of costochondral junctions.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pericarditis:&nbsp; Pericardial friction rub on auscultation.</li>\n\t\t<li>Respiratory infection:&nbsp; Rales, rhonchi, egophony, dullness to percussion.</li>\n\t\t<li>Muscular chest wall pain:&nbsp; Reproducible pain with activation or palpation of the involved muscle.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Breast examination (inspection and palpation) is used to evaluate for:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Breast symmetry.</li>\n\t\t<li>Signs of infection:&nbsp; Erythema, induration, and warmth.</li>\n\t\t<li>Potential signs of malignancy:&nbsp; Nipple retraction, peau d'orange (thickened skin with dimpling, resembling the skin of an orange), ulceration, bloody nipple discharge, and axillary lymphadenopathy.</li>\n\t\t<li>Palpation for breast masses, tenderness, or fluctuance and localized tenderness.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Evaluation</h1><h2>Cyclic breast pain</h2><br><br><p>No further evaluation is necessary when the clinical assessment is consistent with cyclic breast pain and there are no abnormal findings on physical examination.&nbsp; Depending on patient age, risk factors for malignancy, and preferences, breast imaging can be considered for further reassurance.</p>\n<h2>Noncyclic breast pain</h2><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation is not typically required for most cases of mastalgia; however, β-hCG testing may be considered to rule out breast pain related to pregnancy, and TSH and prolactin levels should be obtained in patients with galactorrhea (bilateral milky nipple discharge).&nbsp; Except for breast pain that is clearly due to pregnancy or complications of lactation, <strong>breast imaging (mammography or ultrasonography)</strong> is indicated for patients with <strong>noncyclical, unilateral, or focal breast pain</strong> or in any patient with concerning findings on breast examination.&nbsp; The choice of imaging depends on patient age:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Age &lt;30</strong>:&nbsp; Breast ultrasonography is usually used for first-line assessment because younger patients tend to have higher breast density (limiting visualization of some masses on mammography) and lower risk for malignancy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Age 30-40</strong>:&nbsp; Either mammography or breast ultrasonography may be a first-line modality, depending on patient factors and suspected diagnosis.&nbsp; Often, both are performed because the studies are complementary.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Age ≥40</strong>:&nbsp; Mammography is performed first, but ultrasonography is often performed for further evaluation.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>When imaging findings are equivocal or concerning for possible malignancy, core needle biopsy is performed to establish a histologic diagnosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28494.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Extramammary pain</h2><br><br><p>Further evaluation may include chest or abdominal imaging and ECG, as well as other tests, as directed by the suspected etiology.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><h2>Cyclic breast pain</h2><br><br><p>First-line management is <strong>reassurance</strong> and lifestyle modifications, including wearing well-fitted, supportive bras.&nbsp; Using evening primrose oil and limiting caffeine intake may have some benefit.</p><br><br><p>Pain management typically begins with <strong>nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</strong> (oral or topical).&nbsp; Second-line medications may be indicated when significant pain persists despite several months of treatment with first-line medications, but use is limited by adverse effects.&nbsp; These include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Danazol:&nbsp; A synthetic androgen.&nbsp; Adverse effects include hirsutism, acne, breast atrophy, menstrual irregularities, and hot flashes.</li>\n\t<li>Tamoxifen:&nbsp; A selective estrogen receptor modulator.&nbsp; Adverse effects include hot flashes and menstrual irregularities, as well as increased risk for venous thromboembolism, stroke, and endometrial cancer.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In some patients, symptoms of cyclic breast pain may improve with oral contraceptive pills due to manipulation of the menstrual cycle (and decreased hormonal fluctuations).&nbsp; Most cases of cyclic breast pain respond to conservative management and analgesics, and the symptoms often spontaneously resolve after several months.&nbsp; The symptoms may wax and wane over the reproductive years and tend to resolve with menopause.</p>\n<h2>Noncyclic breast pain</h2><br><br><p>The same conservative measures and pain management options used for cyclic breast pain may help with noncyclic breast pain.&nbsp; Additional interventions depend on the etiology:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hormonal conditions:&nbsp; Consider stopping or adjusting the dose or formulation of hormonal medications (oral contraceptive pills, hormone replacement therapy) that may be contributing to pain.</li>\n\t<li>Benign breast lesions:&nbsp; Many benign lesions can be managed with observation.&nbsp; Surgical excision can be performed for symptomatic masses such as fibroadenomas.&nbsp; Cysts can be drained through fine-needle aspiration (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28493.jpg\" alt=\"figure 9\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 9</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Malignant breast lesions:&nbsp; Treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormonal therapy, depending on stage and tumor characteristics.</li>\n\t<li>Breast infections:&nbsp; Mastitis is treated with antibiotics, and abscesses typically require aspiration or incision and drainage.</li>\n\t<li>Lactation-related pain:&nbsp; Pain may improve with proper breastfeeding technique and interventions such as the use of nipple shields and gentle massage to promote opening of clogged ducts.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The prognosis is excellent for benign, treatable etiologies of noncyclic breast pain (eg, mastitis, breast cyst, fibroadenoma).&nbsp; Noncyclic breast pain not found to have a specific etiology frequently resolves spontaneously or with hormonal changes such as pregnancy or menopause.&nbsp; The estimated risk for cancer is &lt;1% in patients with noncyclic breast pain who have a normal examination and imaging results.</p>\n<h2>Extramammary pain</h2><br><br><p>Most cases of extramammary pain due to chest wall pain can be managed conservatively with oral analgesics.&nbsp; Breast pain due to lung, cardiac, gastrointestinal, or neurologic pathology may improve with treatment of the underlying cause.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>The initial evaluation of breast pain involves a history and breast examination to determine the risk for malignancy and the most likely source of the pain.&nbsp; Cyclic breast pain typically occurs in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle due to hormonal fluctuations; it is a benign condition that often self-resolves over time.&nbsp; Noncyclic breast pain can occur due to various types of breast pathology and is usually evaluated with breast imaging.&nbsp; Extramammary pain occurs due to pathology in surrounding tissues or organs (eg, pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, or neurologic etiologies).&nbsp; Most benign causes of breast pain can be managed with reassurance and analgesics, with further intervention reserved for persistent, focal, or concerning symptoms.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
