It can affect women of all ages and can be due to both structural and nonstructural causes.</p><br><br><p>This article focuses on causes and basic evaluation of AUB; additional information on the various etiologies can be found in additional articles.</p>\n<h1>Terminology</h1><br><br><p>The menstrual cycle has a set of parameters that help define normal menses.&nbsp; Patients typically have menstrual bleeding every 24-38 days, &lt;8 days of bleeding, and blood loss that does not interfere with daily activities (classically defined as &lt;80 mL of blood).</p><br><br><p>Patients with AUB have:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Irregular menstrual blood loss volume</strong>:&nbsp; either heavy or light bleeding</li>\n\t<li><strong>Irregular timing</strong>:&nbsp; absent, infrequent, or frequent menstrual cycles (eg, amenorrhea, menstrual cycles &lt;24 or &gt;38 days)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Irregular duration</strong>:&nbsp; usually prolonged (&gt;8 days of bleeding)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intermenstrual bleeding</strong>:&nbsp; regular menses plus bleeding between menstrual cycles (eg, postcoital bleeding)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Causes</h1><br><br><p>Causes of AUB can be categorized into structural and nonstructural factors, which are classified using the PALM-COEIN system.</p>\n<h2>Structural causes: PALM</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>P</strong>olyp:&nbsp; endometrial or cervical polyps; typically causes intermenstrual bleeding</li>\n\t<li><strong>A</strong>denomyosis:&nbsp; endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium; causes painful, heavy menses</li>\n\t<li><strong>L</strong>eiomyoma (fibroids):&nbsp; benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterine myometrium; causes heavy, prolonged bleeding</li>\n\t<li><strong>M</strong>alignancy and hyperplasia (endometrial hyperplasia/cancer):&nbsp; uncontrolled endometrial proliferation; causes irregular and/or heavy bleeding</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nonstructural causes: COEIN</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>C</strong>oagulopathy (eg, von Willebrand disease, thrombocytopenia):&nbsp; results in heavy bleeding</li>\n\t<li><strong>O</strong>vulatory dysfunction:&nbsp; anovulation or irregular ovulation (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS], thyroid disorder, hypothalamic amenorrhea); causes amenorrhea or irregular menses</li>\n\t<li><strong>E</strong>ndometrial:&nbsp; disorders that affect the endometrial lining (eg, endometritis, intrauterine adhesions); causes irregular bleeding</li>\n\t<li><strong>I</strong>atrogenic:&nbsp; medications that can cause abnormal bleeding (eg, contraceptive pills or devices, anticoagulants)</li>\n\t<li><strong>N</strong>ot yet classified:&nbsp; causes that do not fit into the previous categories</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Evaluation</h1><h2>History</h2><br><br><p>AUB can usually be further divided into subcategories based on history and physical examination.&nbsp; In addition to menstrual history, findings in the patient's medical history can help in the diagnosis, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Medical history:&nbsp; underlying medical conditions, surgeries, and medications</li>\n\t<li>Obstetric history:&nbsp; causes of AUB that also cause pregnancy complications such as preterm labor, recurrent pregnancy loss, and postpartum hemorrhage</li>\n\t<li>Family history:&nbsp; evaluation for bleeding disorders and genetic mutations that increase the risk for malignancy (eg, Lynch syndrome)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2><br><br><p>Physical examination should evaluate for signs of anemia, thyroid disease, and hyperandrogenism.&nbsp; Pelvic examination should confirm that the bleeding is uterine in origin.&nbsp; The uterus should be palpated for size, contour, tenderness, and mobility.&nbsp; The adnexa should be palpated for masses and tenderness.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>An irregular uterine contour or enlarged uterus suggests uterine leiomyoma.</li>\n\t<li>A tender, boggy uterus suggests adenomyosis.</li>\n\t<li>A tender, immobile uterus suggests endometriosis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Basic laboratory evaluation of all patients with AUB includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pregnancy test</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Complete blood count</strong> to quantify blood loss and evaluate for anemia</li>\n\t<li><strong>Serum TSH, FSH, and prolactin levels</strong> to evaluate for hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis abnormalities, which cause anovulation</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In some patients, additional testing can include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Coagulation studies if a bleeding disorder is suspected</li>\n\t<li>Serum testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels if no signs of hyperandrogenism are present</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Imaging</h2><br><br><p>In all gynecologic conditions, the most common imaging modality is transvaginal ultrasonography, which can evaluate the endometrium, myometrium, and adnexa for structural abnormalities.&nbsp; In some patients with suspected pathology in the uterine cavity, sonohysterography (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L81433.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), in which the uterine cavity is filled with a saline infusion, is used to better visualize intrauterine structures (eg, endometrial polyp, leiomyoma).<p></p>\n<h1>Biopsy</h1><br><br><p>An endometrial biopsy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/108252.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is not indicated in all cases of AUB, but it is performed in patients with suspected endometrial hyperplasia and/or cancer.&nbsp;
