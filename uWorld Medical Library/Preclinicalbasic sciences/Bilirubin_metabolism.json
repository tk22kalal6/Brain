Bilirubin metabolism is a multistep process that is essential for maintaining normal physiologic levels and preventing toxic accumulation of bilirubin.</p>\n<h1>Bilirubin metabolism</h1><br><br><p>Bilirubin production and metabolism involve production, metabolism, and excretion.</p>\n<h2>Bilirubin production</h2><br><br><p>Approximately 80% of bilirubin is a by-product of hemoglobin metabolism in senescent red blood cells.&nbsp; The remaining 20% is a by-product of the metabolism of other heme-containing proteins (eg, myoglobin).&nbsp; The first step in bilirubin formation is the conversion of heme to biliverdin by the enzyme heme oxygenase.&nbsp; Next, biliverdin is reduced to unconjugated bilirubin (indirect bilirubin) by the enzyme biliverdin reductase.&nbsp; Because unconjugated bilirubin is lipophilic, it is not water-soluble and must bind albumin for transport to the liver.</p>\n<h2>Bilirubin metabolism</h2><br><br><p>Within the liver, bilirubin is conjugated to glucuronic acid by the hepatic enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, making it water-soluble (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16306.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Conjugated bilirubin is transported into the biliary tract for secretion into the small intestine as bile.<p></p>\n<h2>Bilirubin excretion</h2><br><br><p>Once conjugated, bilirubin is water-soluble and cannot be reabsorbed through the lipid membrane of the intestinal epithelium.&nbsp; Instead, conjugated bilirubin remains in the intestinal lumen, where it is reduced to urobilinogen by intestinal bacteria.&nbsp; Most urobilinogen is further processed for excretion in the stool; however, some urobilinogen is reabsorbed and reenters the circulation, where it can be transported to the liver (ie, enterohepatic circulation) or kidneys (for excretion in urine).</p>\n<h1>Disorders of bilirubin metabolism</h1><br><br><p>Any disruption in bilirubin metabolism can lead to bilirubin accumulation in the serum (hyperbilirubinemia).&nbsp; Hyperbilirubinemia typically manifests as jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes) and can be confirmed with laboratory evaluation (eg, total serum bilirubin level &gt;1 mg/dL).&nbsp; If hyperbilirubinemia is present, identifying the predominant type of bilirubin (eg, conjugated or unconjugated) in the plasma is generally the first step in identifying the underlying cause (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13480.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</h2><br><br><p>Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is characterized by a serum conjugated (direct) bilirubin level &lt;1 mg/dL or &lt;20% of total serum bilirubin and can occur due to:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Excessive bilirubin production (eg, hemolysis, blood extravasation into tissues leading to destruction by tissue macrophages).</li>\n\t<li>Impaired hepatic bilirubin uptake:&nbsp; Occurs due to impaired hepatic blood flow (eg, congestive heart failure, portosystemic shunt) or use of medications that may compete with bilirubin for hepatic uptake (eg, rifampin).</li>\n\t<li>Impaired bilirubin conjugation:&nbsp; Occurs due to impaired UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity, as follows:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Crigler-Najjar syndrome:&nbsp; Rare autosomal recessive disorder in which a mutation within the coding sequence of the gene for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase leads to reduced enzyme activity.&nbsp; Complete loss of enzyme activity (eg, Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1) can lead to severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia within the first few days of birth that can cause permanent neurologic deficits.</li>\n\t\t<li>Gilbert syndrome:&nbsp; Benign autosomal recessive disorder in which a mutation in the promoter sequence of the gene for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase results in mildly reduced enzyme levels.&nbsp; This typically presents in adolescence with episodic jaundice triggered by stress.&nbsp; Patients are generally asymptomatic between episodes.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia</h2><br><br><p>Conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia is characterized by a serum conjugated (direct)&nbsp; bilirubin level &gt;1 mg/dL or &gt;20% of total serum bilirubin and can occur due to any disruption in bilirubin metabolism after conjugation in the liver.&nbsp; Additional laboratory testing (eg, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase) is often necessary to determine the underlying cause, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Impaired transport of conjugated bilirubin into (ie, enterohepatic circulation) or out of (eg, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome) the liver:&nbsp; These conditions are characterized by normal AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase levels.</li>\n\t<li>Physical obstruction of biliary flow (eg, cholelithiasis, postsurgical strictures, malignancy, primary sclerosing cholangitis):&nbsp; These conditions tend to have significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels (ie, cholestatic pattern of liver injury).</li>\n\t<li>Other clinical conditions leading to hepatic injury (eg, viral hepatitis, medication toxicity, alcoholic hepatitis).&nbsp; These conditions are characterized by predominantly elevated AST and ALT&nbsp; levels.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These conditions are discussed in separate dedicated articles.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Bilirubin is a yellow pigment produced from the breakdown of heme-containing proteins (primarily hemoglobin).&nbsp;
