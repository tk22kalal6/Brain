The nitrogen component released during the turnover process must be safely transported and ultimately converted to urea for excretion.&nbsp; Therefore, amino acid metabolism is linked to both energy production and nitrogen balance.</p>\n<h1>Overview: Amino acid metabolism and nitrogen balance</h1><br><br><p>Amino acids can be synthesized endogenously (nonessential amino acids) or must be obtained from dietary proteins (essential amino acids).&nbsp; They serve as building blocks of new proteins and are precursors for many nitrogen-containing biomolecules, including purines, pyrimidines, and heme.&nbsp; A few nonproteinogenic amino acids (eg, ornithine, citrulline) participate only in specialized metabolic or signaling pathways (rather than in protein synthesis).</p><br><br><p>When an amino acid is broken down, it yields 2 distinct components:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A <strong>carbon skeleton</strong>, which can enter pathways of energy metabolism, such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, gluconeogenesis, or ketogenesis.</li>\n\t<li>An <strong>amino (nitrogen-containing) group</strong>, which cannot be oxidized for energy and becomes surplus nitrogen.&nbsp; This nitrogen must eventually be converted to <strong>ammonia</strong> (NH<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font>) for excretion.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because ammonia is highly toxic, its production must be tightly controlled, and nitrogen must be safely transported and excreted.&nbsp; The body manages nitrogen through 3 coordinated processes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Amino group transfer, which channels nitrogen safely among amino acids within cells.&nbsp; In many cases, this process collects nitrogen onto glutamate.</li>\n\t<li>Nitrogen transport, which carries nitrogen from peripheral tissues to the liver (a site of excretion).&nbsp; Nitrogen from glutamate is transferred mainly to alanine (in muscle) or glutamine (in most tissues) for transport to the liver.</li>\n\t<li>Nitrogen elimination, in which the nitrogen delivered to the liver is released as ammonia and converted to urea for excretion.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These pathways maintain nitrogen balance while linking amino acid metabolism to both energy production and biosynthetic demands.</p>\n<h1>Amino group transfer</h1><br><br><p>Protein turnover generates nitrogen that must be routed from peripheral tissues to the liver and kidney for elimination.&nbsp; Two reactions are relevant to this process: transamination, which involves the transfer of the (nitrogen-containing) amino group from an amino acid without producing free ammonia; and deamination, which involves the removal of the amino group, generating ammonia for urea synthesis.</p>\n<h2>Transamination</h2><br><br><p>Each amino acid can be reversibly converted to a corresponding alpha-keto acid in a process called transamination, which involves amino group transfer.&nbsp; The general reaction is:</p><br><br><p>Amino acid<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> + alpha-keto acid<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> ↔ new alpha-keto acid<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> + new amino acid<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font></p><br><br><p>In this reaction, the amino group from an amino acid (which serves as the nitrogen source) is transferred to another molecule (an alpha-keto acid), allowing nitrogen to be retained in organic form without producing toxic ammonia.&nbsp; Many glycolysis and TCA cycle intermediates (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L30424.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are alpha-keto acids.&nbsp; Notable examples of alpha-keto acids and their corresponding amino acids include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>α-ketoglutarate (alpha-keto acid) ↔ glutamate (amino acid)</li>\n\t<li>Pyruvate ↔ alanine</li>\n\t<li>Oxaloacetate ↔ aspartate</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Through these exchanges, nitrogen from many different amino acids becomes concentrated in a smaller pool of molecules, with glutamate in particular serving as a major intracellular collector of amino groups (as discussed in the next section).</p><br><br><p>Transamination is catalyzed by <strong>transaminases</strong>, which require pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>6</sub></font>) as a cofactor.&nbsp; Examples include alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which catalyzes the transamination of alanine to pyruvate; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which catalyzes the transamination of aspartate to oxaloacetate; and branched-chain amino acid transferases, which catalyze the transamination of branched-chain amino acids, abundant in muscle tissue.</p>\n<h2>Deamination</h2><br><br><p>In contrast to transamination, <strong>deamination</strong> removes—rather than transfers—the amino group, producing free ammonia that must be rapidly detoxified.&nbsp; The general reaction is:</p><br><br><p>Amino acid + NAD(P)<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> ↔ alpha-keto acid + NH<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font> + NAD(P)H</p><br><br><p>This step primarily occurs in tissues equipped to handle ammonia—namely, the liver and (to a lesser degree) the kidney.&nbsp; The liver is the primary site of oxidative deamination because it hosts the urea cycle, which converts ammonia to urea for excretion.&nbsp; In humans, the principal oxidative deamination reaction is catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in the liver:</p><br><br><p>L-glutamate + NAD(P)<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> + H<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>O ↔ α-ketoglutarate + NH₄<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> + NAD(P)H + H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font></p><br><br><p>The kidney can also carry out oxidative deamination to generate ammonia for acid-base regulation or for excretion in the urine.</p>\n<h1>Nitrogen transport from peripheral tissues to the liver</h1><br><br><p>Transamination and deamination redistribute nitrogen, collected onto specific amino acids (particularly glutamate), within individual cells but do not remove the surplus generated during amino acid breakdown.&nbsp; That excess nitrogen must be transported from the peripheral tissues to the liver for conversion to urea and excretion.&nbsp; In addition to glutamate, key amino acids involved in this process include alanine (especially in skeletal muscle) and glutamine (in other tissues).</p>\n<h2>Glutamate (and α-ketoglutarate)</h2><br><br><p>Within many cells, there is an abundance of α-ketoglutarate (a TCA cycle intermediate), which typically accepts amino acids from basal protein turnover.&nbsp; Transamination of α-ketoglutarate (with these various amino acids) forms <strong>glutamate</strong>, which serves as a common amino acid \"<strong>hub</strong>.\"</p><br><br><p>Amino acid<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> + <strong>α-ketoglutarate ↔</strong> α-ketoacid<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> + <strong>glutamate</strong></p><br><br><p>Glutamate cannot be readily exported into the bloodstream because it is negatively charged at physiologic pH and requires specific active transporters; therefore, additional steps are necessary to transport nitrogen to the liver.</p>\n<h2>Alanine (skeletal muscle)</h2><br><br><p>Skeletal muscle, a major site of amino acid catabolism, generates abundant pyruvate through glycolysis.&nbsp; It also contains high levels of ALT, which catalyzes the transamination of glutamate with pyruvate, forming <strong>alanine</strong>.&nbsp; Unlike glutamate, alanine can circulate freely in the bloodstream to the liver.&nbsp; The glucose-alanine cycle links nitrogen disposal in muscle with glucose production in the liver; muscle exports alanine (carrying nitrogen and carbon), and the liver reconverts it to glucose, which can return to muscle as an energy source (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13078.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>In contrast to ALT in muscle, ALT in the liver catalyzes the reverse reaction, converting alanine back to pyruvate and regenerating glutamate.&nbsp; Pyruvate can be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis, whereas glutamate is deaminated by GDH, releasing ammonia for urea synthesis</p>\n<h2>Glutamine (most tissues)</h2><br><br><p>In contrast to skeletal muscle, most other tissues do not generate enough pyruvate to sustain an alanine-based pathway and instead must neutralize intracellular ammonia.&nbsp; In these peripheral cells, degradation of non–amino acid compounds, such as nucleotides, also leads to ammonia production.&nbsp; To package the ammonia in a nontoxic form, ammonia reacts with glutamate to form another amino acid, <strong>glutamine</strong>.&nbsp; Like alanine, glutamine can then be exported into the bloodstream.&nbsp; Within the liver, ammonia is removed from glutamine (through <u>deamidation</u>), again forming glutamate, which is deaminated by GDH to release ammonia for urea synthesis.</p><br><br><p>In short, alanine and glutamine together act as the principal nitrogen shuttles; alanine moves nitrogen from muscle glycolysis and amino acid catabolism, and glutamine carries excess ammonia from most other tissues.&nbsp; These pathways converge in the liver, where nitrogen from both alanine and glutamine is ultimately funneled through glutamate before entering the urea cycle as ammonia.&nbsp; The interconnection between glutamate transamination and deamination in the liver is shown in this figure (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L35746.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>The urea cycle and nitrogen disposal</h1><br><br><p>In the liver, ammonia enters the urea cycle, the final pathway of ammonia detoxification.&nbsp; This cycle spans the mitochondrial matrix and cytosol and produces urea, which is released into the bloodstream and excreted by the kidneys.</p><br><br><p>The urea cycle uses 2 sources of nitrogen:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Ammonia within liver mitochondria (generated from deamination of glutamate and deamidation of glutamine).</li>\n\t<li>Nitrogen from aspartate, an amino acid intermediate within the urea cycle.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The process is energy intensive, requiring ATP at multiple steps.&nbsp; Major components of the urea cycle within the mitochondria and cytosol are as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Mitochondria</strong>:&nbsp; Ammonia is converted to carbamoyl phosphate by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I; rate-limiting step), then combined with ornithine to form citrulline, a nonproteinogenic amino acid.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cytosol</strong>:&nbsp; Citrulline combines with aspartate to form argininosuccinate, which is cleaved into arginine and fumarate.&nbsp; Arginine is converted to urea and ornithine.&nbsp; Urea is excreted, whereas ornithine returns to the mitochondria.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The urea cycle is closely linked to the TCA cycle and pathways of gluconeogenesis via shared intermediates, allowing amino acid catabolism, the urea cycle, and the TCA cycle to function as an integrated network that balances nitrogen disposal with energy metabolism (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L100704.png\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Regulation of the urea cycle</h2><br><br><p>Urea synthesis adapts to changing metabolic states: urea production is high after protein intake or during fasting-induced amino acid breakdown, and it lowers when protein turnover declines.&nbsp; The main regulatory enzymes influencing the urea cycle are CPS I (which catalyzes the rate-limiting step) and GDH (which provides a major source of ammonia within liver mitochondria).</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>CPS I</strong> requires N-acetylglutamate (NAG) as an allosteric activator.&nbsp; NAG is synthesized from glutamate and acetyl-CoA, and its production is stimulated by arginine.&nbsp; Therefore, high levels of both glutamate and arginine signal increased amino acid catabolism and stimulate urea cycle activity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>GDH</strong> is allosterically activated by ADP (low energy marker) and inhibited by GTP (high energy marker), because low-energy states activate protein catabolism and breakdown, producing more glutamate for deamination.&nbsp; Activation of GDH also supports ATP synthesis by producing α-ketoglutarate, which can enter the TCA cycle.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Both fasting and fed states can be associated with increased urea cycle activity.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Fed state</strong> (increased catabolism of dietary proteins):&nbsp; After a meal rich in protein, amino acid concentrations rise, leading to increased glutamate and arginine, higher NAG production, and increased ammonia clearance.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fasting state</strong> (increased catabolism of endogenous proteins and amino acids):&nbsp; Amino acids from muscle breakdown are used for gluconeogenesis; high ADP levels favor GDH activity, increasing ammonia production for the urea cycle.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The urea cycle is also subject to long-term regulation.&nbsp; Chronic high protein intake or prolonged fasting increases transcription of urea cycle enzymes, whereas low-protein diets or liver dysfunction decrease enzyme expression.&nbsp; Because the cycle contains multiple ATP-dependent steps, adequate energy supply is essential for sustained activity.</p>\n<h1>Amino acids as precursors of other energy sources</h1><br><br><p>After nitrogen removal, the remaining carbon skeletons of amino acids enter standard energy pathways.&nbsp; Depending on the intermediate produced, they can be used to generate glucose, ketone bodies, or both.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Glucogenic amino acids</strong> (eg, alanine, aspartate, asparagine) can be converted to TCA cycle intermediates (through deamination or transamination) or substrates for gluconeogenesis.&nbsp; Most amino acids are glucogenic (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L122605.png\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ketogenic amino acids</strong> (eg, leucine, lysine) can be converted to acetoacetate or its precursor (acetyl-CoA).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Certain amino acids yield products that can participate in either pathway.&nbsp; These include tyrosine (nonessential), isoleucine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan (essential).</p>\n<h1>Clinical applications</h1><h2>Maple syrup urine disease</h2><br><br><p>This disorder results from mutations in the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex, which requires thiamine as a cofactor and metabolizes the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine.&nbsp; Defective enzyme function leads to accumulation of these amino acids in serum and peripheral tissues, resulting in neurotoxicity (eg, seizures, irritability) that can be life-threatening if untreated.&nbsp; Treatment involves restricting branched-chain amino acids, and, in patients with only a mild enzymatic deficiency, supplementing with high-dose thiamine treatment.</p>\n<h2>Vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>6</sub></font> deficiency</h2><br><br><p>Both ALT and AST require vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>6</sub></font> as a coenzyme (pyridoxal 5-phosphate) for transamination reactions.&nbsp; In vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>6</sub></font> deficiency, transaminase activity is reduced because the coenzyme is unavailable, impairing the transfer of amino groups between amino acids and alpha-keto acids.&nbsp; This can lead to:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Amino acid metabolism defects</strong>:&nbsp; Less efficient collection of nitrogen from proteins and reduced formation of glutamate.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Reduced aspartate formation (AST reaction)</strong>:&nbsp; Limits supply of nitrogen for urea formation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hyperammonemia</strong> (severe deficiency):&nbsp; From impaired transport and disposal of nitrogen via the urea cycle.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>6</sub></font> deficiency is most often seen in chronic alcoholism, certain medications (eg, isoniazid), and rare genetic disorders affecting B<font size=\"2\"><sub>6</sub></font> metabolism.</p>\n<h2>Urea cycle defects</h2><br><br><p>These disorders involve defects in the enzymes necessary to synthesize urea.&nbsp; Examples include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (most common)</strong>:&nbsp; Prevents synthesis of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine, leading to buildup of carbamoyl phosphate.&nbsp; Symptoms include hyperammonemia and tachypnea (central compensation for cerebral edema resulting from hyperammonemia).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Arginase deficiency</strong>:&nbsp; Prevents synthesis of ornithine from arginine.&nbsp; It manifests with elevated arginine levels, spasticity, and developmental delay (but not significant hyperammonemia because nitrogen can still be incorporated into the urea cycle).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Proteins consist of amino acids, which carry out several essential functions in the body.&nbsp; Basal protein catabolism recycles amino acids and degrades misfolded or excess proteins, a process that generates nitrogen.&nbsp; Transamination and deamination are essential processes that enable nitrogen to flow from peripheral tissues to the liver, mainly in the form of alanine or glutamine.&nbsp; Ammonia is disposed of via the urea cycle in the liver, which occurs in the mitochondria and cytosol, and is linked to the TCA cycle through fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate.&nbsp; Key activators of the urea cycle include high levels of glutamate, arginine, N-acetylglutamate, and ADP.&nbsp; Defects in enzymatic cofactors (eg, vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>6</sub></font>) or urea cycle enzymes result in defective nitrogen disposal and associated symptoms.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
