These 2 pathways are inseparable.&nbsp; For example, many transmembrane proteins, and those secreted extracellularly, are reinternalized for degradation in lysosomes.</p>\n<h1>Overview</h1><br><br><p>The ER and Golgi apparatus belong to the endomembrane system, a continuous network that begins at the nuclear envelope and extends outward toward the cell periphery.&nbsp; The ER membrane is directly continuous with the outer nuclear membrane, and its lumen is continuous with the perinuclear space.&nbsp; From the ER, newly synthesized proteins and lipids move forward in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus, which is organized as a polarized stack near the nucleus.&nbsp; The cis face receives cargo from the ER, whereas the trans face dispatches it toward the plasma membrane, lysosomes, or secretory vesicles.&nbsp; This arrangement ensures that the luminal side of the ER and Golgi apparatus corresponds to the extracellular side once vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, preserving the orientation of membrane proteins and secreted molecules.</p>\n<h1>Smooth endoplasmic reticulum</h1><h2>Function</h2><br><br><p>The SER is a tubular network of lipid membranes serving as the site of <strong>lipid synthesis</strong> (of steroid hormones, phospholipids, and cholesterol).&nbsp; It supplies lipid membranes throughout the cell, including the contiguous RER, vacuoles, and plasma membrane.&nbsp; In addition, SER has specialized functions in specific organs:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hepatic SER is the site of phase I metabolism <strong>(cytochrome P450 oxidase)</strong>, converting lipophilic drugs (which accumulate in the lipid sink of the ER) into more hydrophilic metabolites, preparing them for biliary or renal excretion.</li>\n\t<li>Cardiac and skeletal muscle SER (known as sarcoplasmic reticulum) is tightly woven around the myofibrils (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L36529.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), where it <strong>sequesters calcium</strong> for controlled release in response to excitation-contraction signaling (eg, ryanodine receptor [RyR]).</li>\n\t<li>Adrenal cortex, thyroid follicular, and gonadal SERs are prominent because they are steroid hormone–producing cells.&nbsp; (The rate-limiting step of steroid hormone synthesis begins in the mitochondria, but the majority of steps are completed in the SER.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dysfunction</h2><br><br><p>Diseases originating in the SER include <strong>congenital adrenal hypoplasia</strong> (eg, 21-hydroxylase [CYP2A1] deficiency: blocked cortisol and aldosterone synthesis but androgen excess) and <strong>malignant hyperthermia</strong> (eg, <em>RYR</em> mutation: inappropriate calcium release and muscle contraction, inhibited by dantrolene).</p>\n<h1>Rough endoplasmic reticulum</h1><h2>Function</h2><br><br><p>The RER is contiguous with the SER but is studded with ribosomes, giving it a grainy appearance on electron microscopy.&nbsp; It is the site for the synthesis of <strong>secreted</strong> and <strong>transmembrane</strong> proteins.&nbsp; Such proteins require a lipophilic vesicle to integrate or pass through the plasma membrane (eg, for secretion).&nbsp; The RER's continuity with the SER enables the transfer of lipid components that form vesicular coats to serve this purpose (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10476.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This is in contrast to soluble cytosolic proteins, which are synthesized by free ribosomes in the cytoplasm and do not require lipid vesicles.<p></p><br><br><p>Because it specializes in protein export, RER is most prominent in secretory cells such as plasma cells (eg, antibodies), pancreatic acinar cells (eg, digestive enzymes), hepatocytes (eg, plasma proteins, clotting factors), and goblet cells (eg, mucins).</p><br><br><p>RER protein processing is as follows (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L104286.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>RER-synthesized peptides begin their translation on free ribosomes in the cytosol.&nbsp; Proteins are synthesized from their N (amino) to C (carboxy) termini.</li>\n\t<li>For secreted or transmembrane proteins, the first (nascent) 15-30 amino acids serve as a signal peptide that engages a <strong>signal recognition particle</strong> (SRP); this process temporarily pauses translation and guides the ribosome-peptide complex to the RER.</li>\n\t<li>Once the complex is docked to the RER, translation resumes, threading the growing peptide into the RER lumen through a pore (translocon).&nbsp; Defects in SRP docking result in elongation arrest, leading to the accumulation of incomplete peptides in the cytosol.</li>\n\t<li>The RER enzymes add <strong>cotranslational</strong> and <strong>posttranslational modifications</strong> such as N-linked glycosylation (to facilitate proper protein folding), proline hydroxylation (for collagen secretion), and GPI anchors (for membrane integration).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dysfunction</h2><br><br><p>Defective RER processing is involved in several conditions, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cystic fibrosis</strong>, in which the most common mutation (<em>ΔF508</em>) results in a misfolded chloride channel (CFTR protein) that is retained in the RER and unable to reach the plasma membrane.</li>\n\t<li>Several forms of <strong>amyloidosis</strong>, in which chronic ER overload due to overproduction of abnormal proteins (eg, immunoglobulin light chains in myeloma, serum amyloid A in chronic inflammation) overwhelms RER capacity, leading to extracellular deposition of incompletely folded proteins as insoluble fibrils.</li>\n\t<li>Most congenital disorders of glycosylation involving the accumulation of improperly N-glycosylated and subsequently misfolded proteins, leading to multisystem organ dysfunction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Golgi apparatus</h1><br><br><p>The Golgi apparatus appears as a stack of flattened cisternae on electron microscopy, typically located just beyond the ER.&nbsp; The Golgi apparatus appears as a zone of perinuclear clearing on hematoxylin and eosin staining because it does not take up the dye.&nbsp; This zone is especially prominent in <strong>plasma cells</strong>, which have extensive ER and Golgi to support their high rate of immunoglobulin production.</p><br><br><p>The Golgi apparatus has 3 major functions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Protein finalization (adding further posttranslational modifications to mature proteins received from the RER).</li>\n\t<li>Protein sorting (directing proteins to their final destinations).</li>\n\t<li>Protein retrograde transport (to replenish ER proteins).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protein finalization</h2><br><br><p>On receiving proteins from the RER, the Golgi apparatus adds further <strong>posttranslational modifications</strong>, namely:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>O-linked glycosylation (eg, surface glycoproteins, immunoglobulins, mucins).</li>\n\t<li>O-linked sulfation (eg, chemokine receptors).</li>\n\t<li>Mannose-6 phosphorylation (eg, lysosomal acid hydrolases).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Deficient O-glycosylation of IgA1 leads to <strong>IgA nephropathy</strong>, with features of impaired mucosal immunity (eg, recurrent respiratory infections) and immune complex deposition in the glomerular mesangium (eg, nephritic syndrome).&nbsp; Chronic exposure to <strong>cigarette smoke</strong> damages the Golgi and ER membranes and impairs O-glycosylation in airway goblet cells, leading to abnormally thick mucus (eg, chronic bronchitis).</p>\n<h2>Protein sorting</h2><br><br><p>The Golgi apparatus then sorts and traffics the RER-synthesized proteins based on specific signal peptides.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Plasma membrane proteins have <strong>no specific sequence</strong> (default secretory pathway).&nbsp; A signal is not required because the lipid vesicles naturally fuse with the plasma membrane (with assistance from specialized SNARE proteins).</li>\n\t<li>Resident ER proteins (eg, chaperones, disulfide isomerases) have an <strong>ER retention signal</strong> (KDEL or KXXX) and are directed back to the ER via retrograde transport (discussed later).</li>\n\t<li>Lysosomal enzymes (acid hydrolases) carry a <strong>mannose-6 phosphate</strong> tag.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>A notable example of aberrant Golgi apparatus sorting is <strong>I-cell disease</strong> (aka mucolipidosis type II), resulting from defective mannose-6-phosphate tagging, which directs digestive enzymes into lysosomes (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29085.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Consequently, lysosomes are unable to hydrolyze waste, leading to the accumulation of undigested debris (inclusion bodies), resulting in severe multisystem organ dysfunction.<p></p>\n<h2>Protein retrograde transport</h2><br><br><p>Vesicular traffic through the Golgi apparatus is bidirectional.&nbsp; In forward <strong>(anterograde)</strong> transport, proteins leave the RER in vesicles coated in <strong>COPII</strong> (coat protein complex II), enter the cis Golgi apparatus, and progress through the stack before exiting the trans face toward the plasma membrane, lysosomes, or secretory vesicles.</p><br><br><p>However, this flow is leaky: some proteins that belong in the RER (eg, chaperones, translocon components) escape into the forward pathway.&nbsp; To maintain ER function, the Golgi apparatus continuously retrieves these proteins and returns them in <strong>COPI</strong>-coated vesicles, a process termed <strong>retrograde</strong> transport.</p><br><br><p>This retrograde Golgi transport is exploited by several extracellular bacterial toxins (eg, Shiga, diphtheria, and cholera toxins) to avoid lysosomal degradation, reentering the cytosol to attack their targets (eg, ribosomes and G-protein subunits).</p>\n<h2>Golgi apparatus–independent sorting</h2><br><br><p>Proteins synthesized by free ribosomes in the cytosol do not pass through the Golgi apparatus for sorting.&nbsp; However, they are included in this section for completeness.&nbsp; Specifically:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cytosolic proteins (eg, glycolytic enzymes, tubulin, actin) have no specific sequence (default pathway).</li>\n\t<li>Nuclear proteins (eg, histones, DNA polymerase) have a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (typically PKKKRKV).</li>\n\t<li>Mitochondrial proteins (eg, Krebs cycle enzymes) have a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) (15-30 basic and positively charged amino acids).</li>\n\t<li>Peroxisomal proteins (eg, catalase) carry a peroxisomal targeting signal, which is recognized by PEX proteins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>The secretory pathway, consisting of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, is responsible for the synthesis, modification, and trafficking of secreted, transmembrane, and organelle-associated proteins, as well as lipids, within the cell.&nbsp; The smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces lipids and steroid hormones and has additional functions, including detoxifying lipophilic drugs (eg, cytochrome P450 enzymes) and storing intracellular calcium (eg, sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle).&nbsp; The rough endoplasmic reticulum, studded with ribosomes, synthesizes proteins, ensures proper folding, and performs essential posttranslational modifications (eg, N-linked glycosylation).&nbsp; Rough endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction is implicated in cystic fibrosis (misfolded CFTR protein) and congenital glycosylation disorders.&nbsp; The Golgi apparatus recognizes protein localization sequences and traffics them to their correct destinations throughout the cell.&nbsp; Golgi apparatus dysfunction is implicated in I-cell disease (defective mannose-6 phosphate) tagging of acid hydrolase enzymes, resulting in lysosomes full of undegraded debris.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
