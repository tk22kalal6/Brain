Patients experience swelling, itching, and crusting of both eyelids and may have burning or a foreign body sensation in the eye.&nbsp; Blepharitis is mainly a clinical diagnosis, and eyelid hygiene is the mainstay of treatment.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors </h1><br><br><p>Blepharitis is more common in adults than in children, and risk increases with advancing age.&nbsp; It can be classified as either anterior, involving the base of the eyelashes, or posterior, involving the inner aspect of the eyelid, with considerable overlap in many cases.</p><br><br><p>The etiology of blepharitis is multifactorial and the exact pathophysiological mechanisms are not completely understood.&nbsp; However, several conditions contribute to an increased risk of blepharitis:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Systemic <strong>inflammatory skin conditions</strong> (eg, seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, eczema) associated with chronic irritation and inflammation of the face, scalp, and eyelid</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bacterial colonization</strong> (typically <em>Staphylococcus</em>), which can lead to eyelid irritation and infection</li>\n\t<li>Overpopulation of <strong><em>Demodex</em> mites</strong>, parasites that are part of normal eyelid flora in most people; however, increased numbers may lead to an inflammatory reaction</li>\n\t<li>Meibomian gland dysfunction, in which these eye-lubricating glands are blocked by excess oil or debris, leading to an abnormal tear film that induces inflammation along the inner aspect of the eyelid</li>\n\t<li>Contact irritants (eg, contact lenses, cosmetics), which may cause localized allergic response after direct exposure</li>\n\t<li>Poor eyelid hygiene, which can promote inflammation resulting from excess oil and skin flaking</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Blepharitis typically <strong>involves both eyes</strong>.&nbsp; Symptoms include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Itching and burning of the eyelids</li>\n\t<li>Redness and swelling of the eyelid margins</li>\n\t<li>Scaling or flaking of the eyelid skin</li>\n\t<li>Discharge, <strong>crusting, or matting along the eyelashes (worst upon waking)</strong></li>\n\t<li>Foreign body sensation</li>\n\t<li>Excessive tearing</li>\n\t<li>Loss or misdirection of eyelashes</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Blepharitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on characteristic signs and symptoms.&nbsp; Key steps during the examination include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inspection of the eyelid margins for characteristic signs of inflammation, including edema, erythema and crusting</li>\n\t<li>Assessment of tear film quality, which may be abnormal due to meibomian gland dysfunction (examination is under a slit lamp, using fluorescein stain to evaluate for dry spots or breaks in the film)</li>\n\t<li>Evaluation for engorged, obstructed meibomian glands that appear as bumps on the inner surface of the eyelid</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hordeolum</strong> (ie, stye) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22626.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; an acute localized inflammatory lesion of the eyelid caused by obstruction of a meibomian gland.&nbsp; It typically presents as a discrete, focally tender, erythematous nodule, rather than diffuse inflammation, erythema, and crusting of the entire eyelid margin.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chalazion</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L102122.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; a chronic, non-infectious inflammatory nodule resulting from obstruction of the meibomian gland.&nbsp; It presents as a painless, firm, solitary nodule on the eyelid margin.&nbsp; It has no erythema, crusting, and relapsing episodes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Conjunctivitis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L104788.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; an acute inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin membrane that covers the sclera and inner eyelid.&nbsp; It may be bacterial, viral, or allergic in nature.&nbsp; Conjunctivitis presents with redness and irritation of the eye with discharge, but the eyelid margins are typically not involved.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Preseptal cellulitis</strong>:&nbsp; a bacterial infection of the eyelids and periorbital soft tissues that presents with erythema and edema of the affected area.&nbsp; It can appear similar to blepharitis but is usually unilateral and involves the entire eyelid (not just the margin).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation and imaging</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory tests are not routinely necessary for the diagnosis of blepharitis.&nbsp; However, in cases of suspected secondary infection or possible malignancy, additional tests such as bacterial culture or skin biopsy may be indicated.</p><br><br><p>Imaging studies are generally not required when evaluating blepharitis, unless there is suspicion for an acute infection extending into the posterior orbit (ie, orbital cellulitis).&nbsp; Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to assess the extent of infection.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Blepharitis tends to be a recurrent condition without a definitive cure.&nbsp; Management involves routine, long-term interventions to alleviate acute symptoms and prevent future exacerbations:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Eyelid hygiene with daily <strong>warm compresses and gentle lid scrubs</strong> to remove debris and crusts; meibomian gland massage may also improve symptoms</li>\n\t<li>Lubricating eye drops or ointments, which can alleviate symptoms of dry eye that may further increase inflammatory response</li>\n\t<li>Avoidance of triggers such as eye makeup and other irritants</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with severe or continuing symptoms should be administered topical antibiotics (eg, bacitracin).&nbsp; Oral antibiotics (eg, doxycycline) can be used in severe cases unresponsive to topical therapy and topical corticosteroids may be considered for refractory cases.&nbsp; In addition, treatment of underlying conditions (eg, seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, <em>Demodex</em> infestation) may help improve blepharitis symptoms.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Blepharitis is typically a <strong>chronic, relapsing condition</strong>, but with appropriate treatment and eyelid hygiene most patients experience improvement in symptoms and a reduced frequency of exacerbations.</p><br><br><p>Complications are uncommon but can include corneal abrasions/erosions from an inflamed eyelid rubbing against the cornea.&nbsp; Dry eye disease is another complication of blepharitis, likely related to meibomian gland dysfunction.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Blepharitis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/84385.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an inflammatory condition of the eyelid margins that is typically chronic and recurrent.&nbsp; Etiology is multifactorial, often associated with conditions that promote inflammation.&nbsp; Symptoms are usually bilateral and include eyelid itching, burning, erythema and edema, along with crusting and flaking along the eyelash line.&nbsp; It is a clinical diagnosis, and the mainstay of treatment is eyelid hygiene.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
