The severity of retinopathy is related to both the intensity and duration of hypertension and serves as an indicator of damage to other target organs (eg, heart, kidneys).&nbsp; Adequate blood pressure control is the mainstay of both prevention and treatment.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The pathogenesis of hypertensive retinopathy involves increased pressure within the small retinal blood vessels with subsequent microvascular damage.&nbsp; The initial autoregulatory response to blood pressure elevations in the retinal arterioles is vasoconstriction, which maintains retinal perfusion while limiting pressure injury to the distal capillary network.&nbsp; However, chronic hypertension eventually leads to autoregulation failure, resulting in ongoing microvascular injury.</p><br><br><p>Microvascular changes include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Arteriolar narrowing</strong>:&nbsp; Retinal arterioles constrict to protect the capillary bed from excessive pressure (ie, autoregulation).&nbsp; This narrowing is often an early finding.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vascular wall thickening</strong>:&nbsp; Prolonged high pressure causes the walls of retinal arterioles to thicken and become stiff.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Endothelial damage</strong>:&nbsp; Severe, sustained hypertension damages the vascular endothelium, leading to increased vascular permeability and the formation of retinal exudates (made of leaked lipid and proteinaceous material) and retinal hemorrhages.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ischemia</strong>:&nbsp; Severe hypertension can cause optic disc swelling (ie, papilledema) and resultant retinal ischemia.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Hypertensive retinopathy can be both an acute and a chronic process.&nbsp; Chronic hypertensive retinopathy develops over time due to longstanding hypertension, resulting in gradual changes in the retinal vessels and other structures.&nbsp; Acute hypertensive retinopathy may occur in the context of a hypertensive emergency (also called malignant hypertension) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/43920.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which is characterized by sudden increases in blood pressure (&gt;180/120 mm Hg) leading to immediate retinal changes, such as hemorrhages, exudates, and papilledema (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11867.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Risk factors for hypertensive retinopathy include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Chronic hypertension:&nbsp; most significant risk factor, particularly of prolonged duration or poorly controlled.</li>\n\t<li>Older age:&nbsp; due to the cumulative effects of hypertension over time.</li>\n\t<li>Diabetes mellitus:&nbsp; chronic hyperglycemia exacerbates retinal vascular injury.</li>\n\t<li>Smoking:&nbsp; accelerates vascular disease.</li>\n\t<li>Obesity:&nbsp; associated with higher blood pressure.</li>\n\t<li>Hyperlipidemia:&nbsp; contributes to atherosclerosis of retinal vessels and increases the risk of vascular complications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with chronic hypertensive retinopathy are typically asymptomatic, especially in the early stages.&nbsp; The condition is often identified on routine funduscopic examination and may be the first sign that hypertension is impacting end-organ systems (eg, heart, brain, kidneys).&nbsp; When retinopathy becomes symptomatic, patients experience progressive decrease in visual acuity, blurred vision, or visual field defects.</p><br><br><p>Hypertensive emergencies (ie, malignant hypertension) involving the retina can have a more sudden onset of visual disturbances.&nbsp; These patients often have symptoms of other end-organ injury such as headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath.</p><br><br><p>Funduscopic examination findings are key for diagnosis and grading the severity of hypertensive retinopathy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11954.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Mild hypertensive retinopathy:&nbsp; Arteriolar narrowing, thickened arteriole walls (eg, <strong>copper wiring appearance</strong>), and <strong>arteriovenous nicking</strong> (ie, retinal vein is compressed by an overlying thickened arteriole) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11991.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):</li>\n\t<li>Moderate hypertensive retinopathy:&nbsp;

<strong>Optic disc edema</strong> (papilledema), a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Diabetic retinopathy</strong>:&nbsp; Chronic hyperglycemia causes microvascular damage to retinal vessels and presents as progressive, painless vision loss (typically in both eyes).&nbsp; Characteristic funduscopic findings include dot-and-blot hemorrhages, hard exudates, or cotton wool spots, but arteriolar narrowing and papilledema would not be expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)</strong>:&nbsp; Acute thrombosis of the retinal vein causes painless monocular vision loss.&nbsp; Funduscopy reveals dilated and tortuous retinal veins, optic disc swelling, and extensive hemorrhages throughout the entire retina (eg, \"blood and thunder\" appearance).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)</strong>:&nbsp; CRAO most commonly results from atherosclerosis and causes acute monocular vision loss.&nbsp; Funduscopic examination reveals a pale ischemic retina with a cherry-red spot (ie, fovea remains perfused by the choroid and so appears red).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy is primarily based on funduscopy that reveals a combination of arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, retinal hemorrhages, hard exudates, cotton wool spots, and/or papilledema.&nbsp; Grading the severity of hypertensive retinopathy provides insight into the extent of systemic hypertension.</p>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory studies are not necessary to diagnose hypertensive retinopathy, but the following tests are indicated in patients with chronic hypertension:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN):&nbsp; evaluate renal function, as chronic, uncontrolled hypertension often damages the kidneys</li>\n\t<li>Lipid profile:&nbsp; assess for concomitant hyperlipidemia, which can make hypertensive retinopathy worse</li>\n\t<li>Blood glucose and HbA1c:&nbsp; retinopathy may be more severe or progress faster in patients with both diabetes and hypertension</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Imaging studies</h1><br><br><p>Ophthalmologic imaging studies can be used to obtain more detailed images of the retina and retinal vessels:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Fluorescein angiography:&nbsp; is used in severe or atypical cases to assess retinal vascular leakage and ischemia.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Optical coherence tomography (OCT):&nbsp; provides detailed images of the retinal layers to assess for retinopathy, as well as retinal vein occlusion and macular degeneration.</li>\n\t<li>OCT angiography (OCTA):&nbsp; can visualize retinal and choroidal vasculature and blood flow in more detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of hypertensive retinopathy focuses on controlling systemic hypertension to prevent progression of retinal damage.</p><br><br><p>Patients with <strong>acute hypertensive retinopathy</strong> (ie, hypertensive emergency with retinal involvement) or those with <strong>chronic hypertensive retinopathy who develop papilledema</strong> should be managed with emergent, <strong>aggressive blood pressure reduction</strong> using parenteral antihypertensive medications (eg, nicardipine, labetalol) to prevent further retinal injury (and other end-organ damage).&nbsp; The goal is to lower the mean arterial pressure by 10%-15% within 1 hour and no greater than 25% in the first 24 hours, as this may lead to hypoperfusion in vessels accustomed to higher pressures.</p><br><br><p>The treatment of mild-to-moderate chronic hypertensive retinopathy involves antihypertensive therapy, risk factor management (eg, controlling diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia; smoking cessation; exercise), and regular ophthalmologic follow-up to monitor the progression of retinal changes.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of hypertensive retinopathy depends on the severity of the retinopathy and the ability to maintain control of systemic hypertension:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Mild retinopathy:&nbsp; microvascular changes are often reversible with good blood pressure control</li>\n\t<li>Moderate retinopathy:&nbsp; associated with progressive visual impairment and an increased risk of other hypertensive complications (eg, stroke, heart failure).&nbsp; Early identification and management can limit further progression of retinal damage, halt vision loss, and prevent other end-organ injury.</li>\n\t<li>Severe retinopathy:&nbsp; carries a poor prognosis without immediate treatment to lower the blood pressure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Regular monitoring and adherence to antihypertensive therapy and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are critical in preventing hypertensive retinopathy.&nbsp; In addition, routine eye examinations can identify early signs of retinopathy and prompt immediate intervention.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Hypertensive retinopathy is an important manifestation of systemic hypertension.&nbsp; It is diagnosed based on characteristic funduscopic findings, which indicate the severity of retinal vascular disease.&nbsp; Early detection and aggressive control of blood pressure are essential in preventing the progression of retinal and systemic complications.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
