<em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is the most frequent causative organism.&nbsp; The inflammation and obstruction of the glandular ducts leads to the accumulation of secretions, resulting in the formation of a painful, erythematous nodule on the eyelid.<p></p><br><br><p>Risk factors include poor eyelid hygiene, chronic blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid margin), and skin conditions such as rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, or acne vulgaris.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with a hordeolum typically present with a <strong>localized, painful swelling on the eyelid</strong>; the affected area is often red, swollen, and tender to palpation.&nbsp; An external hordeolum (stye) typically presents as a pustule or abscess at the base of an eyelash follicle, whereas an internal hordeolum may manifest as a deeper, more diffuse swelling within the eyelid.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of hordeolum is primarily clinical, based on the characteristic appearance of a painful, erythematous eyelid nodule.&nbsp; Differentiation between external and internal hordeolum may be determined based on the location of the lesion and the presence of a visible pustule; however, distinguishing between them does not affect management.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chalazion</strong> (meibomian cyst) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L102122.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; A painless, chronic granulomatous inflammation of the eyelid resulting from the obstruction of the meibomian glands.&nbsp; Unlike hordeolum, chalazion typically presents as a firm, nontender nodule on the eyelid without associated acute inflammation or pain.&nbsp; It may develop gradually and persist for weeks to months, often requiring warm compresses and sometimes surgical excision for resolution.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Eyelid malignancies</strong>:&nbsp; Common malignancies affecting the eyelids include basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and sebaceous gland carcinoma.&nbsp; Unlike hordeolum, eyelid malignancies often exhibit features such as nonhealing ulcers, nodules, or changes in pigmentation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dacryocystitis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L109063.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; An infection or inflammation of the lacrimal sac caused by nasolacrimal duct obstruction that presents with localized swelling, erythema, and tenderness in the medial canthal region.&nbsp; It is associated with tearing, discharge, and expression of pus from the puncta upon palpation of the lacrimal sac.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation and imaging</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory tests and imaging are typically not required for a diagnosis of hordeolum.&nbsp; However, in cases of severe or recurrent infections, bacterial cultures or swabs may be obtained to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy.&nbsp; Imaging may be indicated in cases of suspected complications such as orbital cellulitis or abscess formation.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Hordeolum is managed conservatively with <strong>warm compresses</strong> applied to the affected eyelid several times a day to promote glandular drainage and resolution of inflammation.&nbsp; Lid hygiene measures, such as gentle eyelid cleansing, can help prevent recurrence.</p><br><br><p>Topical antibiotics are typically not used but may be prescribed in cases of severe or recurrent infections.&nbsp; Incision and drainage may be necessary for large, fluctuant abscesses or those refractory to conservative measures.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for hordeolum is generally favorable, with most cases resolving spontaneously within 1-2 weeks with conservative management.&nbsp; Recurrence is possible, particularly in patients with underlying skin conditions, but can be minimized with good eyelid hygiene practices.&nbsp; Complications such as preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, or eyelid scarring are rare.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Hordeolum is a common eyelid disorder characterized by localized infection or inflammation of the eyelid glands typically caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.&nbsp; Management is conservative with warm compresses.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
