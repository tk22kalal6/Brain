Pterygia are benign but can lead to discomfort, visual disturbances, and cosmetic concerns for affected individuals.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Pterygium results from chronic irritation and inflammation of the conjunctiva in response to chronic exposure to environmental factors such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, dust, and wind—particularly in individuals living in sunny climates or working outdoors.&nbsp; Pterygium is characterized by the proliferation of fibrovascular tissue, inflammation, and elastotic degeneration.&nbsp; The fibrovascular tissue extends onto the cornea, leading to changes in corneal curvature and potentially affecting visual acuity.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with pterygium typically display a wedge-shaped (pterygium means \"insect wing\") growth that most commonly develops medially on the nasal conjunctiva (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108524.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The lesion may appear pink, red, or yellowish and may exhibit prominent blood vessels.&nbsp; Pterygium often starts as a small lesion near the limbus and gradually progresses toward the center of the cornea.&nbsp; Symptoms may include foreign body sensation, dryness, tearing, or blurred vision.<p></p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of pterygium is primarily clinical, based on the characteristic appearance of a triangular-shaped growth on the conjunctiva.&nbsp; Visual acuity and anterior segment examination should be performed to assess the extent of corneal involvement and any associated complications such as astigmatism or corneal scarring.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis of pterygium includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pinguecula</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28907.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; a yellowish, elevated lesion on the conjunctiva, typically located adjacent to the limbus.&nbsp; In contrast to pterygium, pinguecula has no corneal involvement and is not associated with fibrovascular proliferation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Conjunctival melanoma</strong>:&nbsp; a rare but aggressive malignancy of the conjunctival epithelium.&nbsp; Unlike pterygium, conjunctival melanoma presents as a pigmented lesion with irregular borders and may exhibit rapid growth or changes in color.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Conjunctivitis:</strong>&nbsp; inflammation of the conjunctiva, often associated with redness, discharge, and itching.&nbsp; Unlike pterygium, conjunctivitis typically affects both eyes symmetrically and is not associated with fibrovascular growth onto the cornea.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation and imaging are typically not required for the diagnosis of pterygium.&nbsp; However, in cases of suspected atypical or malignant lesions, biopsy and histopathological examination may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Conservative management of mild-to-moderate pterygium includes lubricating eye drops, sunglasses, and avoidance of UV exposure to minimize irritation and inflammation.&nbsp; Topical anti-inflammatory medications such as corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be prescribed to alleviate symptoms, but the adverse effects of each limit their use.&nbsp; Surgical excision is indicated for visually significant or cosmetically bothersome pterygium, recurrent lesions, or those causing corneal astigmatism or scarring.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for pterygium is generally favorable, with most cases responding well to conservative measures or surgical intervention.&nbsp; Recurrence rates following surgical excision vary but can be minimized with appropriate surgical techniques and postoperative management.&nbsp; Complications such as corneal scarring, astigmatism, or recurrence may occur but are relatively rare with timely diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Pterygium is a common, benign ocular disorder characterized by a wedge-shaped growth of fibrovascular conjunctival tissue onto the cornea.&nbsp; A major risk factor is chronic sun exposure (ie, UV radiation).</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
