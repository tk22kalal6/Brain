Most ulcers fall into 3 primary categories:&nbsp; <strong>arterial</strong>, <strong>venous</strong>, and <strong>neuropathic</strong>, each reflecting a distinct pathophysiologic process.&nbsp; Less commonly, ulcers may result from other conditions (eg, infections, neoplastic transformation,&nbsp; inflammatory conditions such as vasculitis).&nbsp; Although ulcers often present with similar characteristics, management strategies and outcomes vary based on the specific etiology.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Most lower extremity ulcers develop from minor trauma in an environment compromised by arterial insufficiency, venous hypertension, neuropathy, or a combination of these factors.</p>\n<h2>Arterial ulcers</h2><br><br><p>Arterial ulcers develop in areas of insufficient arterial perfusion, typically due to chronic peripheral artery disease (PAD).&nbsp; They often begin as minor traumatic wounds that fail to heal because reduced blood flow leads to ischemia, tissue hypoxia, and eventual necrosis.&nbsp; These ulcers typically occur at distal sites (eg, toes, lateral malleoli), where perfusion is naturally lowest and collateral circulation is limited (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29116.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Venous ulcers</h2><br><br><p>Venous ulcers develop in the setting of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), where sustained venous hypertension from incompetent valves and poor venous return leads to elevated capillary pressures.&nbsp; This causes leakage of plasma proteins, red blood cells, and inflammatory cells into surrounding tissues, resulting in pericapillary fibrin deposition, impaired oxygen diffusion, and ongoing inflammation.&nbsp; The resulting tissue damage and characteristic skin changes (eg, hemosiderin deposition, lipodermatosclerosis, stasis dermatitis) leave the skin prone to ulceration and impaired wound healing (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29158.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Neuropathic ulcers</h2><br><br><p>Neuropathic ulcers develop in areas of diminished protective sensation (most commonly from diabetes mellitus).&nbsp; Large-fiber sensory loss allows minor trauma or repetitive pressure to go unnoticed, preventing normal protective behaviors.&nbsp; Concurrent autonomic dysfunction impairs skin hydration and integrity, increasing susceptibility to fissures and breakdown.&nbsp; Over time, these unrecognized injuries at high-pressure sites (eg, plantar surface of foot) result in deep, chronic ulcerations.</p>\n<h2>Other causes</h2><br><br><p>Other causes of lower extremity ulcers include inflammatory vasculopathies (eg, cutaneous vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum), malignancy (eg, squamous cell carcinoma arising in chronic wounds), deep or chronic infections, and medication-related effects (eg, warfarin-induced skin necrosis, hydroxyurea ulcers).&nbsp; These ulcers result from a variety of mechanisms that include immune-mediated tissue injury, neoplastic invasion, pathogen-induced necrosis, and drug-induced vascular compromise, often in the setting of impaired healing or immunocompromise.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Although the specific risk factors differ depending on the type of ulcer, lower extremity ulcers typically develop in the setting of systemic conditions or local factors that impair blood flow (eg, PAD, venous stasis), disrupt sensation, or delay wound healing (eg, malnutrition).</p>\n<h2>Arterial ulcers</h2><br><br><p>Arterial ulcers are most strongly associated with conditions that accelerate atherosclerosis and PAD.&nbsp; These factors include older age (eg, &gt;70), male sex, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.</p>\n<h2>Venous ulcers</h2><br><br><p>Venous ulcers arise from structural factors (eg, age-related valve degeneration, post-thrombotic syndrome, connective tissue disorders), inflammatory and hormonal influences (eg, smoking, estrogen exposure), and lifestyle factors (eg, obesity, prolonged standing, immobility).&nbsp; These factors impair venous return or promote inflammation, leading to the development of venous hypertension.</p>\n<h2>Neuropathic ulcers</h2><br><br><p>Neuropathic ulcers are most strongly associated with diabetes mellitus, the leading cause of peripheral neuropathy.&nbsp; Other risk factors include alcohol use disorder, spinal cord injury, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, chronic renal failure, and infectious causes (eg, leprosy).</p>\n<h2>Other ulcers</h2><br><br><p>The risk factors vary depending on the etiology of the ulcer but often involve autoimmune disease (as in vasculitis), immunocompromise (predisposing to infection), or prolonged wound presence (increasing risk for malignant transformation).&nbsp; In addition, the use of certain medications (eg, warfarin, hydroxyurea) can cause impaired local blood flow or skin integrity, increasing ulcer risk.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The location, appearance, pain characteristics, and surrounding skin findings of ulcers provide information regarding their etiology (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29159.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Arterial ulcers</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Common locations</strong>:&nbsp;

Evaluation typically involves a focused history and detailed physical examination followed by targeted diagnostic testing based on clinical suspicion rather than a fixed algorithm.&nbsp; Ulcers that are unusually painful, purpuric, rapidly enlarging, or refractory to standard wound care should raise suspicion for an alternative or atypical etiology beyond the common causes (eg, arterial or venous insufficiency, neuropathic etiology).</p>\n<h2>Initial clinical evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Important historical elements:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Onset, duration, and progression of the ulcer</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Precipitating events</strong> (eg, trauma, pressure).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Associated symptoms</strong> (eg, pain, numbness, paresthesias, swelling, drainage).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Risk factor assessment</strong> (eg, smoking, prior ulceration, medications).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Physical examination findings:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Ulcer characteristics</strong>:&nbsp;

For example:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A pale, painful ulcer on the toe of a smoker with absent pulses points to arterial insufficiency.</li>\n\t<li>A shallow, exudative ulcer above the medial malleolus with surrounding stasis dermatitis suggests a venous etiology.</li>\n\t<li>A painless plantar ulcer with a callus rim in a patient with diabetes is characteristic of a neuropathic ulcer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Additional testing</h2><br><br><p>Depending on the suspected etiology based on history and physical examination, the following studies may be indicated:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Suspected arterial etiology</strong>:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement</strong>:&nbsp;

An ABI &lt;0.9 indicates PAD; an ABI &lt;0.4 suggests critical ischemia.&nbsp; The ABI may be falsely elevated in diabetes or advanced age due to arterial calcification.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Arterial duplex ultrasonography</strong>:&nbsp; Identifies the location and severity of arterial stenosis or occlusion.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Advanced imaging</strong> (eg, CT angiography, MR angiography):&nbsp; Localizes vascular occlusions and assesses suitability for revascularization (eg, angioplasty, bypass).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Suspected venous etiology</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Venous duplex ultrasonography</strong>:&nbsp;

Guide antimicrobial therapy in infected ulcers; superficial swabs are generally unreliable.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Although the vast majority of lower extremity ulcers are due to arterial insufficiency, venous hypertension, or neuropathy, alternative etiologies can occur, particularly in patients with atypical presentations (eg, unusually painful, purpuric, rapidly enlarging) or ulcers that are refractory to standard treatment.&nbsp; Important differentiating features include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Vasculitis</strong>:&nbsp; Vasculitic ulcers are often multiple, painful, and associated with inflammatory signs (eg, purpura, livedo reticularis) on surrounding skin.&nbsp; Systemic symptoms (eg, arthralgia, fever) may be present.&nbsp; Biopsy can confirm the diagnosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pyoderma gangrenosum</strong>:&nbsp; Pyoderma gangrenosum presents as a rapidly progressive, painful ulcer that begins as a pustule or nodule that develops into a deep lesion with violaceous, undermined borders.&nbsp; Unlike arterial or venous ulcers, it can occur anywhere and is notable for pathergy (exaggerated skin injury response).&nbsp; It is commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hematologic malignancies and is a diagnosis of exclusion (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L95631.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Marjolin ulcer</strong>:&nbsp; A Marjolin ulcer refers to a squamous cell carcinoma arising within a chronic wound or scar, often many years after initial injury.&nbsp; Marjolin ulcers are marked by rolled, heaped-up, or everted edges; induration; and a tendency to resist conventional wound care.&nbsp; Nonhealing ulcers within a scarred or irradiated area should be biopsied.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infectious ulcers</strong>:&nbsp; Infections (eg, cutaneous tuberculosis, deep fungal infections, ecthyma gangrenosum) can produce ulcerations, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.&nbsp; Systemic signs (eg, fever, leukocytosis) and atypical distribution or morphology are common.&nbsp; Culture and biopsy can aid in the diagnosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Thromboangiitis obliterans</strong> (ie, Buerger disease):&nbsp; Thromboangiitis obliterans is a segmental inflammatory disease that is strongly linked to tobacco use and causes occlusion of small- and medium-sized arteries and veins.&nbsp; It presents most commonly in young male smokers as painful ischemic ulcers or gangrene on the distal extremities.&nbsp; Unlike typical arterial ulcers, it affects both arteries and veins.&nbsp; The diagnosis is based on patient history, physical examination, and arteriography findings (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L34306.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other uncommon etiologies of ulcers include medications (eg, warfarin, hydroxyurea, heparin), other microocclusive vascular disorders (eg, cryoglobulinemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, sickle cell disease), and brown recluse spider bites.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Effective treatment of lower extremity ulcers depends on correcting the underlying pathology and creating an environment conducive to wound healing.&nbsp; Local wound care alone is often insufficient unless the root cause is addressed.</p>\n<h2>Arterial ulcers</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Increase arterial perfusion</strong>:&nbsp; Restore blood flow (most important intervention); methods include endovascular procedures (angioplasty, stenting, atherectomy) and open surgical revascularization (bypass, endarterectomy).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Manage risk factors</strong>:&nbsp; Promote smoking cessation, initiate statin therapy, and control diabetes and hypertension.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pharmacologic therapy</strong>:&nbsp; Use antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) as recommended in patients with PAD; reserve parenteral prostanoids (eg, iloprost, alprostadil) for patients unsuitable for revascularization.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Wound care</strong>:&nbsp; Keep ulcers clean and protected.&nbsp; Avoid compression unless revascularization is successful and ABI is adequate.&nbsp; There is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical agents/dressings (beyond standard wound care principles) to specifically accelerate healing of arterial ulcers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Venous ulcers</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Compression therapy</strong>:&nbsp; Apply compression stockings or wraps (≥30 mm Hg pressure).&nbsp; This is the mainstay of CVI management because it improves venous return and relieves symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lifestyle modifications</strong>:&nbsp; Elevate legs, encourage exercise, promote weight loss, and support smoking cessation to reduce venous pressure, edema, and vascular inflammation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Skin care</strong> (eg, emollients):&nbsp; Maintain skin integrity with emollients to prevent infection and stasis dermatitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Surgical or endovenous procedures</strong>:&nbsp; Use surgical options (eg, vein stripping) or endovenous procedures (eg, endovenous thermal ablation) for correctable venous abnormalities when compression alone is inadequate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Neuropathic ulcers</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Offloading</strong>:&nbsp; Relieve pressure at the ulcer site using total contact casts, removable walking boots, or specialized diabetic footwear.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Debridement</strong>:&nbsp; Remove necrotic tissue and callus regularly to create a clean wound bed and encourage healing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Wound care/dressings</strong>:&nbsp; Maintain a moist wound environment with appropriate dressings (eg, hydrocolloid, alginate, foam).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pharmacologic therapy</strong>:&nbsp; Used primarily for infection management.&nbsp; Consider topical agents such as growth factors or oxygen therapies if standard care fails.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Atypical ulcers</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Vasculitic ulcers</strong>:&nbsp;

All ulcer types can become secondarily infected, potentially progressing to cellulitis, abscesses, or osteomyelitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Limb loss</strong>:&nbsp; Amputation risk is highest in arterial and neuropathic ulcers, particularly when infection or ischemia is advanced.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic pain and disability</strong>:&nbsp; Particularly common in arterial ulcers.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Recurrence</strong>:&nbsp; Most common in venous ulcers without long-term compression.&nbsp; Neuropathic ulcers recur without offloading and foot protection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Malignant transformation</strong>:&nbsp; Chronic, nonhealing ulcers can transform into squamous cell carcinoma (Marjolin ulcer).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><h2>Arterial ulcers</h2><br><br><p>Without revascularization, patients typically have a poor prognosis that includes slow healing and high risk for limb loss.&nbsp; In patients ineligible for revascularization, wound closure rates are low and amputation risk increases, especially with severe ischemia (ABI &lt;0.5), large wounds, or comorbidities (eg, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure).&nbsp; Restoration of blood flow is the most important determinant of healing and limb salvage.&nbsp; Persistent ischemia, infection, and large or deep ulcers predict poor outcomes.</p>\n<h2>Venous ulcers</h2><br><br><p>These generally heal within 6 months with proper compression and wound care, but recurrence rates are high (50%-70%).&nbsp; Poor outcomes are linked to ulcers lasting &gt;3 months, large size (&gt;10 cm), advanced age, obesity, and arterial disease.</p>\n<h2>Neuropathic ulcers</h2><br><br><p>These carry an intermediate prognosis, with 60%-90% healing in a few months (eg, 3-4) under optimal care.&nbsp; Outcomes worsen with infection, ischemia, large ulcers, or comorbidities (eg, renal disease, heart failure).</p>\n<h2>Atypical ulcers</h2><br><br><p>Outcomes vary widely depending on early diagnosis and control of the underlying disease.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Lower extremity ulcers (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/127477.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are most commonly caused by arterial insufficiency, venous hypertension, or neuropathy, but they may also result from autoimmune, infectious, or neoplastic processes.&nbsp; Clinical characteristics—such as ulcer location, appearance, pain, and surrounding skin changes—are important for identifying the underlying cause.&nbsp; A comprehensive evaluation combines vascular, neurologic, and systemic assessment, with targeted testing as needed.&nbsp; Management should be focused on treating the primary disorder while providing optimal local wound care.&nbsp; Awareness of atypical presentations is essential to avoid delays in diagnosing vasculitis, malignancy, or other serious conditions.&nbsp; With appropriate intervention, many ulcers can be stabilized, healed, and prevented from recurring.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
