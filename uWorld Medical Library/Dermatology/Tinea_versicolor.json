Although typically benign, tinea versicolor can cause cosmetic concerns due to its characteristic skin discoloration.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The pathogenesis of tinea versicolor starts with the overgrowth of <em>Malassezia</em> species, which are nondermatophytic, lipid-dependent yeasts.&nbsp; These yeasts are part of normal skin flora and proliferate under certain conditions, such as increased sebum production, warm temperatures, and high humidity.&nbsp; They colonize the stratum corneum and interfere with pigment transfer to keratinocytes.&nbsp; The affected skin does not tan when exposed to the sun, leading to the characteristic hypopigmented patches seen in tinea versicolor.</p><br><br><p>Several factors predispose patients to tinea versicolor, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hot and humid climates</li>\n\t<li>Excessive sweating</li>\n\t<li>Oily skin</li>\n\t<li>Hormonal changes (eg, puberty, pregnancy)</li>\n\t<li>Immunocompromised states (eg, HIV, organ transplantation, chronic corticosteroid use)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Tinea versicolor is characterized by <strong>well-circumscribed macules</strong> that can be hypopigmented (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L101457.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (most common), hyperpigmented (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97727.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), or erythematous (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L46644.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (hence the name \"versicolor\"); they often coalesce and are <strong>covered with fine scales</strong>.&nbsp; The scales become more apparent when the affected skin is stretched or scraped.&nbsp; Tinea versicolor most commonly affects the upper trunk and extremities, likely due to greater sebum production in these areas.&nbsp; Mild pruritus can occur, but most patients are asymptomatic.<p></p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Tinea versicolor is diagnosed clinically with microscopic examination of skin scrapings.&nbsp; Skin scrapings with potassium hydroxide preparation showing hyphae and yeast cells with a <strong>spaghetti-and-meatballs appearance</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L33885.jpg\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are diagnostic of tinea versicolor.&nbsp; Wood lamp examination reveals yellow to yellow-green fluorescence of affected areas in fewer than half of cases; if present, this finding is nonspecific and supports, but does not confirm, the diagnosis.<p></p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for tinea versicolor includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Seborrheic dermatitis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108854.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; an inflammatory condition of the skin characterized by erythematous patches with oily scales that commonly affect areas with a high density of sebaceous glands, such as the scalp and face.&nbsp; In contrast to tinea versicolor, involvement of the chest is less common, and scales are thicker (when present).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vitiligo</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L7377.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

an acute, self-limiting skin condition characterized by oval, erythematous patches with a fine collarette of scale in a Christmas tree pattern (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L37263.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) on the trunk.&nbsp; Unlike tinea versicolor, pityriasis rosea typically presents with a herald patch—a larger, solitary lesion preceding the eruption of smaller lesions.&nbsp; Pityriasis rosea is associated with viral, not fungal, infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Secondary syphilis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108623.png\" alt=\"image 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; possibly, a generalized macular rash.&nbsp; In contrast to tinea versicolor, the rash of secondary syphilis often involves the palms and soles and is associated with other symptoms, such as fever and lymphadenopathy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of tinea versicolor includes <strong>topical ketoconazole</strong>, which limits the production of fungal cell membrane components by inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes.&nbsp; Topical terbinafine and selenium sulfide can also be used.&nbsp; In addition to using antifungal therapy, avoiding excessive sun exposure may make tinea versicolor less noticeable.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Patients with tinea versicolor generally experience resolution of symptoms and restoration of normal skin pigmentation within weeks to months of starting treatment.&nbsp; However, recurrence is common, especially in predisposed individuals.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Tinea versicolor (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/52251.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ), also known as pityriasis versicolor, is a benign fungal infection of the skin caused by <em>Malassezia</em> species.&nbsp; Patients develop well-circumscribed hyperpigmented, hypopigmented, or erythematous macules with fine scales on areas of the skin that have a high density of sebaceous glands (eg, face, chest).&nbsp; Diagnosis is clinical with visualization of hyphae and yeast cells on microscopic examination of skin scrapings with potassium hydroxide preparation for confirmation.&nbsp; Management is topical antifungal therapy (eg, ketoconazole, selenium sulfide) with resolution of symptoms in weeks to months.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
