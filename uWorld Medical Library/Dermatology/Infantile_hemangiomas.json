Natural tumor progression begins with a proliferative phase during infancy followed by an involution phase during childhood.</p><br><br><p>During the proliferative phase, <strong>benign tumor</strong> growth is related to the de novo production of a densely packed capillary network (ie, vasculogenesis) and/or the sprouting of new capillaries from existing ones (ie, angiogenesis).&nbsp; This process is facilitated by angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).&nbsp; The involution phase is predominated by apoptosis as the endothelial cells are replaced by fibrotic and adipose tissue.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Infantile hemangiomas usually present between <strong>age 2 weeks to 6 months</strong>, the period characterized by the most rapid growth; the tumor is classically absent at birth but may appear as a telangiectasia precursor lesion.&nbsp; Hemangiomas can arise anywhere within the body (ie, skin, mucus membranes, viscera) but usually occur as a single cutaneous lesion on the head or neck.</p><br><br><p>Cutaneous findings vary based on the depth and morphology of the lesions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Superficial hemangiomas are the most common type and manifest as nontender, bright red, sharply demarcated nodules/plaques (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L66028.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L96682.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Deep hemangiomas develop in the subcutaneous tissue and often appear as raised skin-colored nodules with a faint bluish hue; there may be a superficial component to deep hemangiomas.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Segmental hemangiomas may have deep and superficial components, but rather than a round or discrete shape, these lesions are geographic in appearance and located over a broad distribution (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L96451.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Until age 1, lesions may continue to proliferate, increasing in size at a slower rate than in early infancy.</p>\n<h1>Evaluation and diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Infantile hemangioma is diagnosed clinically based on characteristic findings (eg, bright red, sharply demarcated nodule/plaque).&nbsp; Biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis but would show lobules of densely packed capillaries lined by plump endothelial cells in the dermis and superficial subcutaneous tissue (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L65291.jpg\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Imaging for deeper lesions or associated anomalies is typically indicated for the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>≥5 cutaneous lesions</strong> or <strong>segmental abdominal hemangioma</strong>:&nbsp;

These flat, pink, blanching vascular lesions commonly occur on the eyelids, glabella, and nape of the neck.&nbsp; They are present at birth, lack a proliferative phase, and usually fade by age 1-2.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Arteriovenous malformations</strong>:&nbsp;

These tumors may occur in the absence of cutaneous lesions, but cervicofacial hemangiomas in a \"beard\" distribution are an associated finding.</p><br><br><p><strong>Multifocal hepatic hemangiomas</strong> may have arteriovenous connections and can sometimes cause <strong>high output heart failure</strong> due to hemodynamically significant left-to-right extracardiac shunting.&nbsp; Venous return to the right atrium is increased and leads to pulmonary overcirculation with tachypnea, poor feeding, and poor weight gain.&nbsp; The presence of ≥5 cutaneous lesions or segmental abdominal hemangioma is an associated finding.</p>\n<h1>Management and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Due to the natural history of <strong>spontaneous involution</strong> after age 12 months, management of simple hemangiomas (eg, size &lt;2 cm, location on trunk or extremities) is reassurance and serial observation.&nbsp; The tumor softens, dulls in color, and can completely involute (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L20468.png\" alt=\"image 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                );
