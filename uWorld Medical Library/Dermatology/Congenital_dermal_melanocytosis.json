No treatment is required because the lesions fade in early childhood.&nbsp; However, differentiation of CDM from bruising (ie, nonaccidental trauma) is required.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>CDM is a <strong>benign</strong>, pigmented condition caused by the delayed disappearance of melanocytes within the dermis.&nbsp; In utero, melanocytes normally migrate from the neural crest to the epidermis through the dermis.&nbsp; CDM is likely related to arrested melanocyte migration within the dermis, resulting in melanin production in this deeper layer of skin and the characteristic blue-gray color.&nbsp; This likely explains the higher incidence in patients with darker skin tones; CDM was formerly referred to as \"mongolian spots.\"</p><br><br><p>The trapped dermal melanocytes are contained within a fibrous sheath, which expands and deteriorates over time, resulting in fading and resolution of the lesion over time.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>CDM lesions are <strong>asymptomatic, flat, blue-gray patches</strong> that are <strong>present at birth</strong>.&nbsp;

The diagnosis is supported when the parents and/or medical records indicate that lesions have been present since birth.</p><br><br><p>Notably, CDM in its classic sacral location is not a cutaneous marker for an occult spinal dysraphism (such as a lipoma, hair tuft, hemangioma, or atypical sacral dimple) and therefore does not warrant imaging.</p>\n<h1>Management and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Management is reassurance alone because CDM is benign and usually fades spontaneously by age 5.&nbsp;
