This can have a significant negative impact on a patient's mental, emotional, and cognitive well-being.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Presbycusis results from <strong>age-related</strong> changes in both the peripheral (cochlear) and central auditory pathways.&nbsp; These changes include cochlear hair cell loss, degeneration of spiral ganglion cells in the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), and/or age-related brain atrophy, leading to <strong>progressive, symmetric sensorineural hearing loss</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25857.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The loss of high-frequency hearing occurs first, making it more difficult to understand speech, particularly with higher-pitched voices (eg, women, children).&nbsp; Many consonant sounds (eg, \"t\" and \"s\") are high frequency, leading patients to report hearing but not understanding others.&nbsp; Patients often have little trouble hearing in quiet environments or during one-on-one conversations but struggle with speech discrimination when there is even a small amount of background noise.<p></p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Age (strongest factor).</li>\n\t<li>Genetic predisposition.</li>\n\t<li>Chronic noise exposure.</li>\n\t<li>Ototoxic medications (eg, aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, cisplatin).</li>\n\t<li>Systemic conditions (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Hearing loss from presbycusis is typically first noticed around <strong>age 60-70</strong>.&nbsp; It classically presents with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Insidious, <strong>progressive, symmetric hearing loss</strong> initially impacting the perception of <strong>high-frequency sounds</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Difficulty understanding speech, especially in noisy environments.</li>\n\t<li>Tinnitus, described as a continuous (ie, nonpulsatile) ringing, rushing, or buzzing sound heard in both ears, possibly related to cochlear hair cell loss.</li>\n\t<li>Social withdrawal, depression, or cognitive decline due to communication difficulties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Otosclerosis</strong>:&nbsp; Abnormal bone deposition in the otic capsule (bone surrounding the inner ear) results in decreased mobility of the stapes, which leads to progressive, asymmetric conductive hearing loss, most often in young women.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ménière disease</strong>:&nbsp; Increased volume and/or pressure of endolymph within the inner ear leads to discrete episodes of spinning vertigo with sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acoustic neuroma</strong> (vestibular schwannoma):&nbsp; This benign neoplasm arises from the Schwann cells covering the vestibular branch of CN VIII.&nbsp; The neoplasm presents with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss and often a sense of imbalance (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26404.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Presbycusis should be considered in older patients (age &gt;60) with gradual, symmetric hearing loss.&nbsp; The first step when evaluating hearing loss is to differentiate conductive from sensorineural hearing loss with tuning fork testing (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/51504.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Rinne test</strong>:&nbsp; Normally, air conduction (AC) &gt; bone conduction (BC).&nbsp; In presbycusis (sensorineural hearing loss), both AC and BC are reduced equally, but AC remains better than BC; therefore, the Rinne test stays positive (AC &gt; BC) despite overall diminished hearing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Weber test</strong>:&nbsp; Normally, vibration is felt equally in both ears.&nbsp; In sensorineural hearing loss, the vibration lateralizes to the better-hearing ear.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>For confirmation, all patients with suspected presbycusis should undergo <strong>formal audiometry</strong> to confirm <strong>sensorineural hearing loss</strong> and assess the severity of impairment.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation is not necessary for diagnosing presbycusis but may be used to evaluate for systemic diseases associated with an increased risk for hearing loss such as diabetes mellitus (eg, hemoglobin A1c) and hyperlipidemia (eg, lipid panel).</p><br><br><p>Imaging is not routinely required in typical bilateral, symmetric, age-related hearing loss.&nbsp; If hearing loss is unilateral, rapidly progressive, or associated with other neurologic deficits (eg, facial droop, vertigo), MRI of the brain and/or internal auditory canals may be considered to rule out central lesions or acoustic neuroma.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>There is no cure for presbycusis.&nbsp; The mainstay of treatment is hearing aids, which improve hearing thresholds and quality of life.&nbsp; Patients often benefit from education and emotional support regarding the use of and adjustment to hearing aids, as well as strategies for improving communication in challenging environments.</p><br><br><p>Cochlear implants may be considered when hearing aids are ineffective in patients with severe or profound hearing loss.&nbsp; Cochlear implantation bypasses damaged portions of the auditory system by directly stimulating the auditory nerve.&nbsp; However, candidacy for cochlear implants requires an intact auditory nerve and appropriate cognitive function to ensure that patients can benefit from the device.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Presbycusis is a chronic and progressive condition with no cure.&nbsp; Without intervention, it can negatively impact a patient's communication abilities, independence, mental health, and cognition.&nbsp; Appropriate management with hearing aids greatly improves quality of life, mental/cognitive health, and social engagement.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>A certain degree of presbycusis is expected with aging, but strategies that may help minimize the risk include avoiding prolonged noise exposure and using ear protection in loud environments, managing comorbid conditions, avoiding ototoxic medications when possible, and conducting regular hearing screenings to detect changes early.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Presbycusis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/116296.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is sensorineural hearing loss associated with aging.&nbsp; It typically presents as progressive, bilateral, high-frequency hearing loss due to degenerative changes in the inner ear's sensorineural structures.&nbsp; Audiometry is used to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the hearing loss.&nbsp; Although there is no cure, hearing aids are the primary treatment and significantly enhance quality of life for most patients by improving communication and auditory function.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
