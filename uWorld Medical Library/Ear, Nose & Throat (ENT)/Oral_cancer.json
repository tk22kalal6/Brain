Patients typically present with a nonhealing intraoral ulcer or exophytic mass.&nbsp; Early detection and treatment are critical because prognosis declines markedly with advanced-stage disease.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Most cancers of the oral cavity, which include the anterior tongue, inner lips, hard palate, floor of the mouth, buccal mucosa, and gingiva, are <strong>squamous cell carcinomas</strong> (SCC).&nbsp; Major risk factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Tobacco use</strong> (smoking and chewing).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Excessive alcohol consumption</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Betel leaf/areca nut chewing</strong> (popular in Southeast Asia/India).</li>\n\t<li>Chronic contributors:&nbsp; Poor oral hygiene, chronic oral infections (eg, <em>Candida albicans</em>), and repetitive trauma (eg, ill-fitting dentures), which perpetuate inflammation and epithelial injury.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Notably, infection with high-risk human papillomavirus, which is strongly associated with oropharyngeal cancer (eg, tonsillar, tongue base tumors), has a low prevalence in oral cavity cancers.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Prolonged exposure to carcinogens (eg, tobacco, alcohol) and chronic irritation initiate cellular injury by directly damaging DNA and generating reactive oxygen species, which promote mutagenesis.&nbsp; Over time, these insults lead to the accumulation of mutations and epigenetic modifications in the basal epithelial cells (ie, progenitors of squamous epithelium), disrupting the normal regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and differentiation.&nbsp; Key molecular events in this process include the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (eg, <em>p53</em>) and the overexpression of oncogenes such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cyclin D1; these changes drive unchecked cell proliferation.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Early manifestations of oral cancer include asymptomatic intraoral plaques, most notably leukoplakia and erythroplakia.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Leukoplakia</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10652.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; A <strong>white patch</strong> on the oral mucosa that <strong>cannot be scraped off</strong>.&nbsp; It represents epithelial hyperplasia and is typically asymptomatic.&nbsp; Although leukoplakia is benign, it carries a variable risk of malignant transformation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Erythroplakia</strong> (less common):&nbsp; A <strong>fiery red, velvety patch</strong> that cannot be clinically or pathologically classified as any other disease.&nbsp; It is more likely than leukoplakia to show significant dysplasia on histologic evaluation and carries a higher risk of progression to invasive carcinoma.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Disease progression and malignant transformation may result in the following signs and symptoms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Nonhealing oral ulcer</strong> with indurated margins or an <strong>exophytic/infiltrative mass</strong>; the lesion may be accompanied by pain and bleeding.</li>\n\t<li>Tooth loosening (due to lesions involving the alveolar ridge).</li>\n\t<li>Dysarthria, dysphagia, trismus (due to space-occupying lesion in the oral cavity).</li>\n\t<li>Paresthesia/anesthesia of lip/tongue or referred otalgia (due to cranial nerve compression).</li>\n\t<li>Cervical lymphadenopathy (from nodal metastasis).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Aphthous ulcers</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10718.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

A chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of basal keratinocytes, resulting in bilateral, symmetric mucosal lesions with a white, lacy or reticulated appearance.&nbsp; Unlike SCCs, lichen planus is typically nonulcerative, nonbleeding, and nonprogressive.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Oral hairy leukoplakia</strong>:&nbsp; A white mucosal lesion with a distinct, corrugated appearance most often found on the lateral tongue.&nbsp; It is caused by Epstein-Barr virus and occurs almost exclusively in patients with significant immunosuppression (eg, HIV) and frequently resolves with antiretroviral treatment; it is not premalignant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Any oral lesion persisting for &gt;2-3 weeks warrants evaluation for malignant potential.&nbsp; A thorough examination should include inspection of all mucosal surfaces within the oral cavity and palpation of the lymph nodes of the neck.&nbsp; Imaging studies (eg, CT scan, MRI, positron emission tomography) are often used to assess the extent of disease (eg, local invasion, regional lymph node involvement, and distant metastases) and cancer staging, but definitive diagnosis requires biopsy and histopathologic evaluation.</p>\n<h1>Histopathology</h1><br><br><p>Biopsy of a suspicious oral lesion followed by histopathologic evaluation is the gold standard for diagnosing oral SCC.&nbsp; Tissue sampling should be obtained from the most clinically concerning area (eg, indurated, ulcerated, or erythroplakic regions).&nbsp; Histopathologic hallmarks that support a definitive diagnosis of SCC include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cellular atypia</strong>:&nbsp;

The TNM staging system is used to classify cancers based on tumor size (T), nodal involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M).</p>\n<h2>Early-stage (stages I and II) cancers</h2><br><br><p>Early-stage oral cancers (ie, localized without nodal involvement) are most often managed with surgery.&nbsp; <strong>Wide local excision</strong> with <strong>histologically clear margins</strong> is the primary treatment.&nbsp; Radiotherapy is an alternative for patients with small, well-demarcated lesions or those who are poor surgical candidates.</p>\n<h2>Advanced-stage (stages III and IV) cancers</h2><br><br><p>Advanced-stage disease (ie, regional nodal involvement and/or extranodal metastasis) is treated with surgical resection of the primary tumor and adjuvant radiotherapy (± chemotherapy or immunotherapy).&nbsp; Chemoradiotherapy (± immunotherapy) alone may be pursued when surgery is not feasible (eg, significant comorbidities, unresectable tumor).</p>\n<h2>Recurrent and metastatic disease</h2><br><br><p>A combination of systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation is the mainstay for unresectable recurrent or distant metastatic disease.&nbsp; If the disease progresses despite all interventions, palliative care or hospice can improve quality of life by optimizing symptom control (eg, palliative radiation) and providing multidisciplinary psychosocial support.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Five-year survival depends on several factors.&nbsp; The prognosis is significantly worse in cases of advanced-stage disease, regional or distant metastases, and poorly differentiated tumors.&nbsp; Oral cancer that is detected at stage I or II has a 5-year survival rate of 70%-90%, whereas survival in late-stage disease decreases to &lt;50%.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Primary prevention of oral cancer focuses on reducing modifiable risk factors, particularly tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption, which act synergistically to increase cancer risk.&nbsp; High-risk individuals should have regular oral examinations and timely biopsy of any suspicious lesions to facilitate early diagnosis and prevent progression to advanced-stage disease.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Oral cancer is predominantly squamous cell carcinoma and is strongly associated with long-term tobacco and alcohol use (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/51544.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
