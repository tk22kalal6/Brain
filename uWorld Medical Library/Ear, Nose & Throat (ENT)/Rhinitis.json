This article focuses on allergic rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis, and rhinitis medicamentosa.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The core mechanism underlying all forms of rhinitis involves inflammation of the nasal mucosa.&nbsp; However, the specific triggers and mediators differ:</p>\n<h2>Allergic rhinitis</h2><br><br><p>Development of allergic rhinitis is a 2-step process:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Sensitization occurs when inhaled antigens penetrate the nasal epithelium and are presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, causing activation of naive T-helper (Th) cells.&nbsp; The release of cytokines (eg, IL-25, IL-33) from the nasal epithelium promotes Th2-cell differentiation, resulting in secretion of IL-4, IL-13, and other lymphokines that stimulate B-cell maturation and production of IgE antibodies.&nbsp; Antigen-specific IgE antibodies then bind to the high-affinity IgE receptor on mast cells, priming the patient for an allergic response.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Repeated exposure to allergens (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L80200.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) triggers binding of a previously recognized antigen to IgE antibodies on mast cells.&nbsp; Cross-linking (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L23794.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) of these antibodies leads to mast cell degranulation, which releases histamine and other inflammatory mediators.&nbsp; This <strong>type I hypersensitivity</strong> reaction leads to vasodilation, increased mucus production, and tissue edema.&nbsp; Repeated exposure can further increase priming, worsening symptoms over time.<p></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nonallergic rhinitis</h2><br><br><p>Various irritants (dust, smoke, strong odors), infections (viral), hormonal fluctuations (pregnancy), and autonomic dysfunction can initiate an inflammatory response involving tachykinins, neuropeptides, and inflammatory cells.&nbsp; Nonallergic rhinitis is also thought to be mediated, at least partially, by dysregulation in branches of the vagus nerve.&nbsp; Subtypes include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Vasomotor rhinitis:&nbsp; intermittent symptoms with an exaggerated reaction to nonspecific irritants (eg, cigarette smoke, cold air)</li>\n\t<li>Gustatory rhinitis:&nbsp; triggered by hot and/or spicy foods</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rhinitis medicamentosa</h2><br><br><p>Oxymetazoline, the most commonly used over-the-counter nasal decongestant spray, leads to rapid relief of nasal congestion by causing profound vasoconstriction.&nbsp; However, with continued use, it can injure the vascular endothelium and induce tolerance by receptor internalization.&nbsp; As alpha-adrenergic receptors become increasingly scarce and there is increased vascular permeability, the release of endogenous catecholamines is no longer sufficient to provide adequate vasoconstrictive stimulation.&nbsp; This leads to rebound congestion; patients then use these alpha-adrenergic decongestants more frequently, setting up a vicious cycle that can occur in as few as 3-5 days (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L57019.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Intranasal cocaine use can also induce this cycle.<p></p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><h2>Allergic rhinitis</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Family history of allergies</li>\n\t<li>Atopic conditions (often considered the second step of the \"atopic march,\" which begins with the development of eczema, then allergic rhinitis, then asthma)</li>\n\t<li>Environmental allergen exposure (pollen, dust mites, pet dander)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nonallergic rhinitis</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Exposure to irritants (occupational or environmental)</li>\n\t<li>Structural abnormalities in the nose (deviated septum, nasal polyps)</li>\n\t<li>Hormonal fluctuations (pregnancy, hypothyroidism)</li>\n\t<li>Certain medications (aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rhinitis medicamentosa</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Prolonged (&gt;3 days) use of topical nasal decongestants (oxymetazoline)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Histopathologic examination of the nasal mucosa in rhinitis may show:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Edema and inflammatory cell infiltration (eosinophils in allergic rhinitis)</li>\n\t<li>Increased mucus production</li>\n\t<li>Goblet cell hyperplasia</li>\n\t<li>Epithelial desquamation</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The inflammatory cell infiltrate can differ in the specific types of rhinitis (eg, eosinophils in allergic rhinitis).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><h2>General manifestations</h2><br><br><p>Symptoms of rhinitis can vary depending on the type and severity.&nbsp; Common presentations include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Sneezing:</strong>&nbsp; particularly prominent in allergic rhinitis and triggered by allergen exposure</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rhinorrhea:</strong>&nbsp; can be watery, clear, or mucopurulent depending on the cause</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nasal congestion:</strong>&nbsp; stuffiness or blockage in the nose, causing difficulty breathing through the nose</li>\n\t<li><strong>Postnasal drip:</strong>&nbsp; drainage of mucus down the back of the throat, leading to cough, sore throat, and voice changes</li>\n\t<li><strong>Itching:</strong>&nbsp; primarily a symptom of allergic rhinitis, affecting the nose, eyes, and palate</li>\n\t<li><strong>Reduced sense of smell:</strong>&nbsp; impaired ability to smell due to nasal congestion and inflammation</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Specific types of rhinitis may have additional presentations:</p>\n<h2>Allergic rhinitis</h2><br><br><p>Exposure to allergens results in a rapid allergic response characterized by nasal congestion, sneezing, and rhinorrhea, as well as itchy, watery eyes (allergic conjunctivitis).&nbsp; Patients can often distinguish patterns in their reactions which may include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Seasonal variation:&nbsp; Exposure to specific pollen types may fluctuate at particular times of the year (eg, trees in spring, grass in summer, weeds in fall).</li>\n\t<li>Geographic variation:&nbsp; Symptoms improve when patients are not exposed to the typical allergens of the region (eg, work travel, vacation).</li>\n\t<li>Animal exposure:&nbsp; Symptoms occur when visiting a house with pets or begin shortly after animal acquisition.</li>\n\t<li>Indoor versus outdoor:&nbsp; Patients with predominantly indoor symptoms may have an allergy to dust mites; outdoor symptoms suggest pollen.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other features sometimes seen include \"allergic shiners\" (infraorbital edema and darkening); the allergic salute (transverse nasal crease); enlarged, pale, bluish turbinates; pharyngeal cobblestoning; and \"allergic facies\" (high-arched palate, open-mouth breathing).</p>\n<h2>Nonallergic rhinitis</h2><br><br><p>Symptoms can be persistent or episodic and triggered by specific irritants.&nbsp; Nonallergic rhinitis does not usually cause conjunctivitis symptoms.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Often triggered by irritants (eg, cold air, strong smells) rather than allergens (eg, pollen)</li>\n\t<li>Usually lacks conjunctivitis symptoms and sneezing</li>\n\t<li>Does not usually have predictable patterns of waxing and waning</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rhinitis medicamentosa</h2><br><br><p>Presentation includes persistent nasal congestion that worsens with continued use of decongestant sprays.&nbsp; Patients do not often volunteer information about the use of nasal decongestant sprays.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of rhinitis is based primarily on clinical presentation and history.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Detailed history</strong>, including information about symptoms, duration, triggers (allergic or irritant exposure), response to medications, and medical history, is crucial.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Physical examination</strong> of the nose should focus on signs of inflammation, structural abnormalities (septal deviation, polyps), and nasal discharge characteristics.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Serum IgE</strong> levels are usually elevated in allergic rhinitis but not in nonallergic rhinitis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Allergy testing</h2><br><br><p><strong>Antigen-specific allergy testing</strong> can be used for patients with allergic rhinitis to help guide avoidance strategies or in those considering immunotherapy.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Skin prick test</strong>:&nbsp; A type I hypersensitivity reaction is induced.<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Allergens are introduced into the dermis.</li>\n\t\t<li>If sensitization has already occurred (which means that antigen-specific IgE is bound to the surface of mast cells), the allergen causes cross-linking of the bound IgE.</li>\n\t\t<li>This cross-linking leads to degranulation of preformed histamine and leukotrienes that cause vasodilation and increased capillary permeability.&nbsp; The result is a rapid (minutes) early-phase type I hypersensitivity response characterized by superficial dermal edema and erythema (eg, wheal and flare reaction).</li>\n\t\t<li>There is a risk that the induced response can progress to anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals.&nbsp; The treatment for anaphylaxis is epinephrine, which is less effective in patients taking beta blockers.&nbsp; Therefore, the use of beta blockers is relatively contraindicated during skin prick testing.</li>\n\t\t<li>Widespread skin conditions (eg, dermatitis, eczema) can also be a contraindication to skin prick testing.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Serum radioallergosorbent test (RAST</strong>)\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>A patient's serum is added to allergens; if the patient has preformed antibodies, they will bind to the allergen.</li>\n\t\t<li>Radiolabeled antibodies that detect IgE are then added to detect those allergen-specific antibodies.</li>\n\t\t<li>Patients may experience less discomfort with RAST than with skin prick testing.&nbsp; RAST can be used in patients with dermatologic conditions or in those at increased risk for anaphylaxis.&nbsp; However, it is less sensitive and is much more expensive than skin prick testing.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Several conditions can mimic and/or coexist with rhinitis, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Sinusitis:</strong>&nbsp; Rhinitis symptoms are accompanied by facial and/or tooth pain, pressure, and fever.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nasal polyps:</strong>&nbsp; Soft, noncancerous growths in the nasal passages can cause nasal obstruction and postnasal drip.&nbsp; These are also from an allergic etiology.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Septal deviation:</strong>&nbsp; A deviated septum can cause nasal obstruction and recurrent sinusitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma:</strong>&nbsp; This rare cancer in the upper part of the throat can present with nasal congestion and discharge.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Drug-induced rhinitis:</strong>&nbsp; Certain medications (eg, beta blockers, phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitors, alcohol) can cause nasal congestion as an adverse effect.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rhinitis of pregnancy:</strong>&nbsp; Approximately one-third of pregnant patients develop rhinitis in the last trimester of pregnancy; it can interfere with sleep and has an unclear pathophysiology.&nbsp; This condition resolves after delivery.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of rhinitis focuses on controlling symptoms and improving quality of life.&nbsp; The approach depends on the type and severity of rhinitis.</p>\n<h2>Allergic rhinitis</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Allergen avoidance</strong>:&nbsp; Identifying and avoiding triggers such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander is the first line of defense.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intranasal corticosteroids</strong>:&nbsp; These sprays (eg,&nbsp; fluticasone, budesonide) are the mainstay of treatment.&nbsp; Glucocorticoids (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L89832.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) bind to cytoplasmic receptors and translocate to the nucleus, where they inhibit transcription of genes that encode inflammatory mediators and decrease immune cell survival propagation.&nbsp; This suppresses the immunostimulatory activity of all leukocyte cell lines, including:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Decreased tissue production of proinflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes through the inhibition of phospholipase A<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font></li>\n\t\t<li>Decreased synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines</li>\n\t\t<li>Increased synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-10)</li>\n\t\t<li>Impaired macrophage activation and neutrophil emigration</li>\n\t\t<li>Increased apoptosis of eosinophils, T cells, and monocytes, perhaps by decreasing Bcl-2 expression</li>\n\t\t<li>Decreased uptake of allergen particles, decreased mucus production, decreased vascular permeability</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antihistamines</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>First-generation antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine) are nonspecific and act as antagonists to multiple receptors, including the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.&nbsp; Although effective at controlling allergic rhinitis symptoms, they often have intolerable adverse anticholinergic effects (eg, urinary retention, altered mental status, decreased sweating).&nbsp; They also cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation.</li>\n\t\t<li>Second-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine) are more specific to the histamine H<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> receptor and have less permeability through the blood-brain barrier.&nbsp; Although they are often less effective than first-generation antihistamines, they have significantly fewer adverse effects.</li>\n\t\t<li>Intranasal antihistamines are often used with intranasal glucocorticoids with synergistic effects.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Leukotriene receptor antagonists</strong>:&nbsp; Mast cells and eosinophils release cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes (leukotriene C4, D4, and E4) that trigger mucus secretion and edema.&nbsp; Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists (eg, montelukast, zafirlukast) block these leukotriene-mediated effects to improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual drops)</strong>:&nbsp; This approach involves gradual desensitization to allergens through injections, offering long-term relief for some patients.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti-IgE antibodies</strong> (eg, omalizumab):&nbsp; Binding of circulating IgE decreases serum IgE levels and limits the allergen-induced immunologic response.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nonallergic rhinitis</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Avoidance of triggers</strong> such as dust, smoke, or strong odors is crucial.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intranasal corticosteroids</strong> may be helpful for some types of nonallergic rhinitis, particularly those with a strong inflammatory component.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intranasal antihistamines</strong> (eg, azelastine, olopatadine) are sometimes added to intranasal glucocorticoids for moderate to severe symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nasal saline solution irrigation</strong> can help clear mucus and soothe irritated tissues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rhinitis medicamentosa</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Discontinuation of the offending decongestant spray</strong> is the primary treatment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intranasal corticosteroids</strong> and/or oral glucocorticoids can help control inflammation and reduce the urge to use decongestant sprays.</li>\n\t<li>Significant counseling is often required.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other types of rhinitis </h2><br><br><p>Other systemic conditions can be associated with rhinitis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/104831.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Complications and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Although not life-threatening, rhinitis can significantly impact quality of life.&nbsp; Potential complications include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Sleep disturbances:</strong>&nbsp; Nasal congestion and postnasal drip can disrupt sleep patterns and can sometimes cause or worsen obstructive sleep apnea.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sinusitis:</strong>&nbsp; Chronic allergic rhinitis can increase the risk for chronic sinusitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Otitis media:</strong>&nbsp; Inflammation of the middle ear (otitis media) can occur due to eustachian tube dysfunction associated with rhinitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Decreased productivity:</strong>&nbsp; Symptoms can affect concentration and work performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Rhinitis encompasses a spectrum of inflammatory disorders affecting the nasal mucosa.&nbsp; The most common types are allergic rhinitis, an IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction that occurs following repeat exposure to antigens; nonallergic rhinitis, which is a response to nonspecific irritants; and rhinitis medicamentosa, which occurs due to a cycle of increasing damage to vascular endothelial cells caused by profound vasoconstriction.&nbsp; Diagnosis is usually clinical.&nbsp; Management most commonly involves a combination of avoidance of triggers, intranasal glucocorticoids, and/or antihistamines.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
