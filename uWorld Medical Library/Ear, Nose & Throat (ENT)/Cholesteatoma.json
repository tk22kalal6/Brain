However, the majority (~95%) of cases are acquired, occur unilaterally, and typically develop as a complication of middle ear disease.</p><br><br><p>The most common way that a cholesteatoma develops is from the formation of an invagination of the tympanic membranes, known as <strong>a retraction pocket</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45949.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; A retraction pocket develops due to chronic negative pressure in the middle ear (from recurrent infection, eustachian tube dysfunction), which causes a focal collapse (or pocket) in the tympanic membrane.&nbsp; As the pocket enlarges, it can become a deep pouch and allow squamous epithelium and keratin debris to accumulate, creating the cholesteatoma.<p></p><br><br><p>Less commonly, cholesteatomas can develop secondarily from squamous epithelium migration into the middle ear after either trauma (eg, temporal bone fracture) or surgical procedures that access the middle ear (eg, tympanostomy tube placement).</p><br><br><p>Regardless of the cause of development, all cholesteatomas may enlarge and produce lytic enzymes that can erode into nearby structures, resulting in a variety of complications.&nbsp; These complications include conductive hearing loss (auditory ossicles), vertigo (vestibular apparatus), and cranial nerve palsy (facial nerve [CN VII] (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108721.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).<p></p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Acquired cholesteatomas are due to conditions that affect the middle ear and cause eustachian tube dysfunction, which prevents equalization of negative pressure buildup within the middle ear.&nbsp; The main risk factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Chronic middle ear effusions</li>\n\t<li>Recurrent acute otitis media</li>\n\t<li>Tympanostomy tube placement</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Less commonly, genetic syndromes associated with eustachian tube dysfunction (eg, trisomy 21 [Down syndrome], Turner syndrome) and craniofacial anomalies that affect eustachian tube muscles (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L72520.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (eg, cleft palate) also increase the risk for cholesteatoma.<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The most common symptoms of a cholesteatoma are <strong>persistent (&gt;2 weeks) otorrhea despite antibiotics</strong> (if infected) or <strong>conductive hearing loss</strong> (often found incidentally on a hearing screen).&nbsp; Many patients are also asymptomatic and are diagnosed on otoscopic examination.</p><br><br><p>Classic otoscopic examination findings, which are found in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pearly white mass</strong> behind the tympanic membrane</li>\n\t<li>Deep <strong>retraction pocket</strong> with or without skin debris or granulation</li>\n\t<li><strong>Focal granulation</strong> at the periphery of the tympanic membrane</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Late-onset clinical features of the enlarging cholesteatoma include facial nerve (CN VII) palsy, vertigo, venous thrombosis, and secondary bacterial infections (eg, mastoiditis, brain abscesses).</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis </h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chronic otitis media</strong>:&nbsp; often presents with ear discharge and hearing loss, but does not have the retraction pocket or granulation tissue seen in cholesteatoma.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Otosclerosis</strong>:&nbsp; this condition involves abnormal bone remodeling of the middle ear, leading to conductive hearing loss; however, it does not typically cause ear discharge, differentiating it from cholesteatoma.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acute otitis media</strong>:&nbsp; can present pain, fever, and sometimes ear discharge. However, it is usually self-limiting and does not have the pearly white mass seen in cholesteatoma.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tympanosclerosis</strong>:&nbsp; scarring or calcification of the tympanic membrane or middle ear structures due to repeated infections. It may cause hearing loss but does not cause ear discharge.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Foreign body</strong>:&nbsp; In children, a foreign object can cause chronic ear discharge and irritation, which may mimic cholesteatoma, but symptoms resolve with removal of the object.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><br><br><p>In patients with a suspected cholesteatoma, the diagnosis is usually confirmed via visual examination from an otolaryngologist.&nbsp; In addition, <strong>CT scan of the temporal bone</strong> is performed to evaluate the extent of the lesion and detect complications.</p><br><br><p>Audiometric testing should be performed in all patients to establish baseline hearing function.&nbsp; Laboratory evaluation is not typically performed to diagnose cholesteatoma.&nbsp; However, cultures from the persistent otorrhea can help identify the causative organisms, which can guide antibiotic therapy if an infection is present.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The primary treatment for cholesteatoma is surgical intervention, which attempts to remove the cholesteatoma and preserve or improve hearing.&nbsp; The type of procedure depends on the type and extent of disease.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Complications of untreated cholesteatomas include hearing loss, cranial nerve palsies (facial [CN VII], abducens [CN VI]), other neurologic signs and symptoms (eg, vertigo), venous thrombosis, and potentially life-threatening infections (eg, brain abscess, meningitis).</p><br><br><p>With early detection and appropriate management, the prognosis for cholesteatoma is generally favorable, with most patients having stable or improved hearing.</p><br><br><p>Following surgery, regular follow-up examinations (eg, imaging, audiometry) are required to monitor for disease recurrence.&nbsp; Patients with recurrent disease may need additional surgical intervention.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>A cholesteatoma is an abnormal accumulation of squamous epithelium within the middle ear that occurs as a complication of chronic middle ear disease.&nbsp; Treatment involves surgical removal. If unrecognized, progressive accumulation can erode into surrounding structures, leading to complications (eg, hearing loss, facial nerve [CN VII] palsies).</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
