An understanding of the mechanics of extremity movements, associated somatic dysfunctions, and relevant anatomic landmarks greatly enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment effectiveness.&nbsp; This article reviews these elements and discusses targeted osteopathic treatments for common upper extremity somatic dysfunctions.</p>\n<h1>Thoracic outlet syndrome</h1><br><br><p>The thoracic outlet is the area above the first rib (bordered by the clavicle, cervical vertebrae, and sternum) through which the primary upper extremity <strong>neurovascular bundle</strong> (ie, brachial plexus, subclavian vessels) passes to move from the neck to the shoulder (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26826.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p><strong>Compression</strong> of this neurovascular bundle in the thoracic outlet can be evaluated by assessing the radial pulse with specific provocative tests that accentuate compression.&nbsp; An absent or diminished radial pulse indicates a positive test.&nbsp; Compression can occur between distinct spaces:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Anterior and middle scalene</strong> (ie, scalene triangle):&nbsp; Compression occurs due to muscle hypertrophy/hypertonia and is evaluated using the Adson test, which narrows this space by shoulder extension, external rotation, and slight abduction while the patient holds the breath and looks toward the side being tested.</li>\n\t<li><strong>First rib and clavicle</strong>:&nbsp; Compression occurs due to somatic dysfunction of the clavicle and/or first rib and is evaluated using the military posture test, which narrows this space by shoulder extension and compression (ie, depression).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pectoralis minor and the upper ribs</strong>:&nbsp; Compression occurs due to hypertrophy/abnormal position of the pectoralis minor and is evaluated using the Wright (hyperabduction) test, which narrows this space by shoulder abduction and slight extension.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The findings from these provocative tests help direct treatment with stretching, range of motion exercises, and OMT techniques (eg, muscle energy, myofascial release) to free the restrictions causing the neurovascular compression.</p>\n<h1>Adhesive capsulitis</h1><br><br><p>Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) is characterized by <strong>glenohumeral joint capsule contracture</strong> due to inflammation and fibrosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L79766.png\" alt=\"Adhesive capsulitis\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">Adhesive capsulitis</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; It usually develops spontaneously or secondary to immobilization after shoulder injury (eg, rotator cuff tear) or overuse.&nbsp; The initial phase involves <strong>inflammation</strong> that causes severe shoulder pain.&nbsp; This is followed by progressive fibrosis and glenohumeral capsule contracture that causes <strong>reduced range</strong> of motion (both active and passive) of the shoulder in all planes of motion.<p></p><br><br><p>The primary goal of treating adhesive capsulitis is to reduce pain and increase shoulder mobility by releasing capsular contractions, thereby allowing patients to resume normal activities.&nbsp; This can be achieved with the <strong>Spencer technique</strong> (passive range-of-motion treatment) and periodic corticosteroid injections.&nbsp; The Spencer technique consists of <strong>7 distinct stages of passive articulation</strong> (eg, flexion, circumduction, internal rotation) at the glenohumeral joint that gently move the shoulder through the various restrictions caused by capsule contractures (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73767.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Patients in whom conservative management fails can be treated with arthroscopic capsular release or shoulder manipulation under general anesthesia.<p></p>\n<h1>Bicipital tendonitis</h1><br><br><p>Bicipital tendonitis results from inflammation and degeneration of the <strong>long head of the biceps</strong> tendon within the bicipital groove, often caused by overuse or chronic tendon subluxation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L77203.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The pain is often localized to the anterior shoulder over the bicipital groove but can also radiate down into the biceps.&nbsp; Provocative tests that can assist in evaluation include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Speed test</strong>:&nbsp; Evaluates for pain during <strong>shoulder flexion</strong> beyond 90 degrees against resistance</li>\n\t<li>Biceps squeeze test:&nbsp; Assesses the integrity of the biceps tendon by evaluating for supination when the examiner firmly squeezes the patient's biceps.</li>\n\t<li>Yergason test:&nbsp; Evaluates for pain or instability of the biceps tendon while the examiner supinates and extends the patient's forearm (with the elbow flexed 90 degrees).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Initial treatment consists of rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy/OMT (eg, myofascial release, counterstrain).&nbsp; If the pain is persistent or severe (ie, interferes with sleep or daily activities, as in this patient), ultrasonography-guided glucocorticoid injection into the sheath of the long head of the biceps tendon at the bicipital groove can improve function and decrease pain.</p>\n<h1>Radial head dysfunction</h1><br><br><p>The proximal radius (ie, radial head) and distal radius move in opposite directions (ie, <strong>reciprocal motion</strong>) during forearm supination and pronation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L74388.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>During supination, the distal radius moves posterolaterally (ie, palm facing forward), resulting in an anterior glide of the radial head.</li>\n\t<li>During pronation, the distal radius moves anteromedially (ie, palm facing backward), resulting in a posterior glide of the radial head.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Disruption of this motion is seen in radial head dysfunction.&nbsp; For example, <strong>anterior radial head dysfunction</strong> is characterized by restricted posterior glide of the radial head (ie, restricted forearm pronation).&nbsp; This occurs because the radial head is \"stuck\" in an anterior position.</p><br><br><p>Osteopathic manipulative therapy using either direct muscle energy or the high velocity–low amplitude (HVLA) technique aims to restore normal joint motion by moving the joint through the restrictive barrier to pronation/posterior glide.&nbsp; Treating anterior radial head dysfunction with the HVLA technique involves engaging the restrictive barrier by moving the patient's forearm into pronation.&nbsp; Next, the physician <strong>moves the forearm into flexion</strong> and further pronation while applying posterior pressure to the anterior aspect of the radial head (to move it posteriorly) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73507.png\" alt=\"HVLA for posterior radial head dysfunction\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">HVLA for posterior radial head dysfunction</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>In posterior radial head dysfunction, the opposite applies regarding diagnostic findings and treatment; direct muscle energy is demonstrated in the following image (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73483.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Cubitus valgus and varus</h1><br><br><p>The <strong>carrying angle</strong> of the arm is normally 5-10 degrees in men and 10-15 degrees in women and allows for arm swing during ambulation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73923.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Changes in the carrying angle due to somatic dysfunction result in alterations to both elbow and wrist mechanics because of the ligaments and fascia that span between the elbow and wrist.&nbsp; Therefore, altered mechanics in one joint can affect the other (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L74282.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increased carrying angle (ie, <strong>cubitus valgus</strong>):&nbsp; Medial displacement of the proximal ulna (ie, olecranon) and lateral displacement of the distal ulna (ie, ulnar abduction).&nbsp; This causes the carpal bones to glide medially (ie, wrist adduction) and results in restriction of wrist abduction.</li>\n\t<li>Decreased carrying angle (ie, <strong>cubitus varus</strong>):&nbsp; Lateral displacement of the proximal ulna and medial displacement of the distal ulna (ie, ulnar adduction).&nbsp; This causes the carpal bones to glide laterally (ie, wrist abduction) and results in restriction of wrist adduction.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>OMT uses balanced ligamentous tension and myofascial release techniques targeting ligamentous and fascial connections between the elbow and the wrist, restoring normal joint biomechanics.</p>\n<h1>Wrist dysfunctions</h1><br><br><p>Most wrist motion occurs primarily at the radiocarpal joint, which is a condylar (ie, modified ball and socket) joint between the distal radius and proximal carpal bones (scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum).&nbsp; Normal wrist flexion/extension depends on dorsal/ventral glide of the carpal bones at this joint (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L74860.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Wrist flexion causes the carpal bones to glide dorsally (toward the back of the hand).</li>\n\t<li>Wrist extension causes the carpal bones to glide ventrally (toward the palm).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>For example, <strong>flexion wrist dysfunction</strong> is characterized by the wrist being restricted in extension (ie, \"stuck\" in flexion).&nbsp; The carpal bones are restricted in ventral glide (ie, \"stuck\" dorsally), and there is hypertonicity of wrist flexor muscles.&nbsp; Muscle energy treatment involves moving the hand toward the restrictive barrier by extending the wrist while the patient then attempts to flex the wrist while the physician provides an equal counterforce (ie, isometric contraction).</p>\n<h1>Carpal tunnel syndrome</h1><br><br><p>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) results from compression of the <strong>median nerve</strong> within the carpal tunnel, causing sensory loss, pain, and weakness primarily in the thumb and first 3 digits.&nbsp; Diagnosis is facilitated by the Phalen maneuver and/or Tinel test (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28517.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; CTS often coexists with <strong>T2-T7 spine dysfunctions</strong>.&nbsp; This occurs because sympathetic nerve fibers that supply the upper extremity originate from these thoracic segments and share pathways with pain nerve fibers, potentially amplifying carpal tunnel pain through sympathetic activation.<p></p><br><br><p>OMT involves <strong>stretching the flexor retinaculum</strong> and mobilizing the surrounding tissue (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73238.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Treating concurrent thoracic dysfunctions (eg, HVLA to T2-T7) can reduce upper extremity sympathetic tone and improve pain and function.<p></p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Osteopathic manipulative treatment of the upper extremities applies anatomic and biomechanical understanding to restore motion, alleviate pain, and support systemic function.&nbsp; In the upper extremities, conditions such as thoracic outlet syndrome are diagnosed with provocative tests and treated by releasing compressive restrictions.&nbsp; Adhesive capsulitis is managed with the Spencer technique to improve shoulder mobility, whereas bicipital tendonitis benefits from myofascial release and counterstrain.&nbsp; Radial head dysfunction disrupts normal supination-pronation mechanics and is corrected through the high velocity–low amplitude technique or through muscle energy.&nbsp; Cubitus valgus/varus alters wrist mechanics via changes in the carrying angle, requiring ligamentous balancing.&nbsp; Carpal tunnel syndrome is treated by stretching the flexor retinaculum and addressing thoracic dysfunctions to reduce sympathetic tone.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
