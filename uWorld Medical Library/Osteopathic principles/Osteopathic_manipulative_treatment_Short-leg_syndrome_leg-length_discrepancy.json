Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is valuable in managing short-leg syndrome, particularly functional LLD, by addressing biomechanical imbalances and associated somatic dysfunctions and by promoting symptom relief and functional improvement.&nbsp; This article discusses anatomic considerations, etiologies, clinical presentations, diagnostic methods, and therapeutic roles of OMT and heel lifts in managing short-leg syndrome.</p>\n<h1>Incidence and etiology</h1><br><br><p>Clinically significant LLDs <strong>(&gt;5 mm)</strong> occur in roughly 10%-15% of individuals.&nbsp; LLD can be classified into anatomic and functional causes.</p>\n<h2>Anatomic</h2><br><br><p>Anatomic discrepancies involve <strong>bone length differences</strong> that are measurable radiographically.&nbsp; These commonly result from <strong>congenital</strong> conditions (eg, growth plate disturbances, hip dysplasia), <strong>trauma</strong>, or surgical procedures.&nbsp; A common example is <strong>hip replacement surgery</strong>, which often aims to restore the affected limb to its prearthritic length (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L74472.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Functional</h2><br><br><p>Functional discrepancies arise from <strong>reversible</strong> causes affecting pelvic alignment (eg, <strong>scoliosis</strong>, muscular imbalances) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L74494.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; These typically improve with OMT or correction of underlying causes.<p></p>\n<h1>Anatomy and biomechanics</h1><br><br><p>LLDs alter biomechanics, causing compensatory pelvic and spinal adaptations:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Pelvic tilt and rotation</strong>:&nbsp; A shorter leg typically induces a downward pelvic tilt and anterior innominate rotation on the affected side as the body attempts to functionally lengthen the limb, resulting in an inferior anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) on that side.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lumbar spine compensatio</strong>n:&nbsp; Functional scoliosis, characterized by vertebral rotation and lateral curvature with the convexity typically toward the short limb, is a common adaptation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lower extremity compensation</strong>:&nbsp; Adaptations within the lower extremities, such as knee hyperextension on the short side or flexion on the long side, and changes in foot and ankle mechanics (eg, supination on the short side, pronation on the long side) can lead to altered gait, muscle imbalances, increased joint stress, and potential degenerative changes over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosis and measurement</h2><br><br><p>Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, palpation of pelvic landmarks (ASIS, posterosuperior iliac spine [PSIS]), standing flexion tests, gait assessment, and radiographic imaging to measure <strong>femoral head heights and sacral base unleveling</strong>.&nbsp; Severity classification is generally as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mild</strong>:&nbsp; &lt;10 mm.</li><br><br><li><strong>Moderate</strong>:&nbsp; 10-20 mm.</li><br><br><li><strong>Severe</strong>:&nbsp; &gt;20 mm.</li>\n</ul><br><br><h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management strategies are guided by severity, underlying cause, and patient age:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mild</strong>:&nbsp; Managed <strong>conservatively</strong> with footwear modifications, exercises, and OMT to address pelvic and spinal compensations.</li><br><br><li><strong>Moderate</strong>:&nbsp; Managed with <strong>heel lifts</strong>, regular monitoring, and targeted OMT.&nbsp; Heel lift initiation for young, flexible patients includes 3.2 mm (1/8 inch) increments every 2 weeks and for elderly patients, 1.6 mm (1/16 inch) increments every 2 weeks.</li><br><br><li><strong>Severe</strong>:&nbsp; <strong>Surgical</strong> interventions or significant orthotic management combined with rehabilitative and osteopathic care.</li>\n</ul><br><br><h2>Heel lift recommendations</h2><br><br><p>Heel lifts are recommended when femoral head height discrepancies exceed 5 mm (3/16 inch) despite OMT.&nbsp; The aim is typically to correct <strong>half to three-fourths of the measured LLD</strong> in <strong>chronic</strong> conditions; <strong>full correction may be considered in acute cases</strong> (eg, following recent hip replacement surgery).&nbsp; Typically, the maximum heel lift is 1/2 inch total (1/4 inch inside shoe, 1/4 inch outside shoe).&nbsp; Aggressiveness in the correction rate depends on patient tolerance; in general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Young</strong>, flexible patients:&nbsp; Begin with <strong>1/8 inch</strong> increments every <strong>2 weeks.</strong></li><br><br><li><strong>Elderly</strong> patients:&nbsp; Begin with <strong>1/16 inch</strong> increments every <strong>2 weeks</strong>.</li>\n</ul><br><br><h2>Osteopathic manipulative treatment</h2><br><br><p>OMT effectively treats functional LLD and related somatic dysfunctions.&nbsp; Commonly used techniques include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Muscle energy techniques:&nbsp; Improve pelvic alignment and reduce muscular hypertonicity.</li><br><br><li>Myofascial release:&nbsp; Relieve fascial restrictions affecting compensatory patterns.</li><br><br><li>High velocity–low amplitude technique:&nbsp; Particularly, leg-pull techniques for correcting posterior innominate rotations and partially lengthening the shorter leg.</li><br><br><li>Balanced ligamentous tension:&nbsp; Normalize ligamentous tension, enhancing alignment and mobility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Specific somatic dysfunction presentations, such as superior ASIS and inferior PSIS indicating posterior innominate rotation, can guide precise diagnosis and targeted OMT.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Short-leg syndrome, also known as leg-length discrepancy, encompasses both anatomic (true bone difference) and functional (apparent) differences in leg lengths.&nbsp; These discrepancies can lead to pelvic asymmetry, compensatory spinal curvatures, and altered biomechanics throughout the body.&nbsp; Diagnosis relies on thorough clinical evaluation and imaging studies.&nbsp; Management strategies are tailored to the individual and may incorporate osteopathic manipulative treatment, heel lifts, and, in severe cases, surgical interventions.&nbsp; Osteopathic manipulative treatment is particularly beneficial for addressing functional discrepancies and the musculoskeletal compensations associated with anatomic causes, aiming to improve alignment, reduce pain, and enhance overall musculoskeletal function.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
