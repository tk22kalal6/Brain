Normally, infants pass meconium within 24 hours.&nbsp; However, intrauterine passage of meconium can occur, most commonly due to fetal stress.&nbsp; Umbilical cord compression, for example, increases vagal tone, resulting in intestinal peristalsis, anal sphincter relaxation, and passage of meconium into the amniotic fluid.&nbsp; As a result, meconium can be aspirated before (eg, fetal gasping due to prolonged hypoxia), during, or immediately after birth.&nbsp; Once aspirated, meconium causes <strong>bronchiolar obstruction and inflammation</strong>, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Obstruction</strong>:&nbsp; Meconium can cause complete or partial bronchiolar obstruction.&nbsp; Complete obstruction results in distal atelectasis, and partial obstruction results in distal air trapping as the partially obstructed airway becomes more narrow during exhalation.&nbsp; Air trapping can lead to alveolar rupture and pulmonary air leak (eg, pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inflammation</strong>:&nbsp; Meconium can cause inflammatory pneumonitis, which increases vascular permeability, epithelial disruption, and proteinaceous exudate in the alveoli.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Therefore, risk factors for MAS include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Postterm pregnancy</strong> (&gt;41 weeks gestation)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fetal stress/hypoxia</strong> (eg, maternal infection, vaginal breech delivery, umbilical cord compression)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Microscopic examination of the lungs reveals meconium in the bronchioles and alveoli with areas of atelectasis and hyperinflation.&nbsp; Inflammatory cells (eg, macrophages, neutrophils) are often present throughout.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Most patients are symptomatic immediately at birth; however, some patients develop symptoms as meconium is aspirated into the smaller distal airways (eg, bronchioles) from the larger proximal airways after birth.</p><br><br><p>The clinical presentation of MAS varies from mild respiratory distress to life-threatening respiratory failure, depending on the extent of pulmonary involvement; common features include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Respiratory distress</strong> (eg, tachypnea, grunting, nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, and cyanosis)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Barrel-shaped chest</strong> with an increased anterior-posterior diameter due to hyperinflation</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rales and rhonchi</strong> on auscultation</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hypoxemia</strong> due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch (eg, atelectasis, air trapping)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Additional findings include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Meconium-stained amniotic fluid or signs of meconium staining on the nails or umbilical cord</li>\n\t<li>Signs of perinatal asphyxia (eg, neurologic and/or respiratory depression)</li>\n\t<li>Signs of postterm pregnancy (eg, peeling skin, long fingernails)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>MAS should be suspected in a term or postterm infant who aspirates meconium-stained amniotic fluid during or shortly after birth and develops respiratory distress.&nbsp; Chest radiography is helpful when differentiating MAS from other causes of neonatal respiratory distress; classic radiographic findings include <strong>streaky, linear densities</strong> with <strong>hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragm</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99300.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; As the disease progresses, there may be alternating areas of expansion and patchy densities.<p></p><br><br><p>Although not required for diagnosis, blood gas analysis may reveal hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis.&nbsp; Because the clinical presentation and radiographic features of MAS are similar to neonatal pneumonia, laboratory evaluation for infection (eg, complete blood count, inflammatory markers, blood culture) should be performed.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for MAS includes other causes of neonatal respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, retractions), such as the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Transient tachypnea of the newborn</strong>:&nbsp; This benign, self-limited (resolves in 48-72 hr) condition presents with respiratory distress immediately after birth (similar to MAS) in late preterm and term infants due to delayed reabsorption of retained fetal alveolar fluid.&nbsp; Distinguishing radiographic features include perihilar linear streaking and fluid in the interlobar fissures (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L57478.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Respiratory distress syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Preterm (&lt;34 weeks gestation) infants experience respiratory distress shortly after birth due to surfactant deficiency.&nbsp; Chest radiography reveals widespread alveolar collapse (ground-glass opacities) and air bronchograms (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L57477.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pneumonia</strong>:&nbsp; Infants have respiratory distress and systemic symptoms (eg, fever, lethargy, poor feeding) shortly after birth.&nbsp; Risk factors (eg, maternal infection) and radiographic findings (eg, focal alveolar densities) are similar to those of MAS, and empiric antibiotics should be administered while awaiting blood culture results.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Congenital heart disease</strong>:&nbsp; Depending on the underlying cardiac lesion, patients often have respiratory distress that is worse with feeding.&nbsp; The diagnosis can be distinguished from MAS by physical examination (eg, heart murmur, central cyanosis), chest radiography (eg, cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema), and pre- and postductal pulse oximetry; postductal oxygen saturation is lower in patients with defects in which right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood occurs through the ductus arteriosus.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn</strong>:&nbsp; This condition occurs due to persistently elevated pulmonary vascular resistance after birth.&nbsp; Right-to-left shunting across the ductus arteriosus can cause cyanosis and respiratory distress; however, chest radiography is often normal, and preductal oxygenation saturation is higher than postductal oxygen saturation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Intrapartum nasopharyngeal suctioning is <em>not</em> routinely recommended for infants who aspirate meconium-stained antibiotic fluid during or shortly after birth; routine suctioning does not decrease the incidence of MAS.&nbsp; Instead, neonatal resuscitation should be performed according to the patient's respiratory effort and heart rate, similar to management for other infants (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L89264.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>After any resuscitation, management of MAS is supportive, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Respiratory support</strong>:&nbsp; noninvasive (eg, oxygen hood, low-flow nasal cannula, high-flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure) or invasive (eg, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation) modalities with a target oxygen saturation of 95%-98%</li>\n\t<li><strong>Supportive care</strong>:&nbsp; thermal neutral environment, nutrition, and fluid management</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because neonatal pneumonia presents similarly, empiric antibiotics should be administered while awaiting laboratory results.</p>\n<h1>Complications and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of MAS depends on the severity of disease; typically, patients with mild disease fully recover, whereas those with moderate to severe disease can develop acute and chronic complications, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pulmonary air leak</strong> (eg, pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema):&nbsp; This complication occurs due to distal air trapping and alveolar rupture.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infection</strong> (eg, pneumonia):&nbsp; Although sterile, meconium is an ideal growth medium for certain bacteria (eg, <em>Escherichia coli</em>), which increases the risk for infection.&nbsp; In addition, meconium can inhibit phagocytosis and generation of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils, which impairs the innate immune response and further increases the risk for infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Surfactant deficiency</strong>:&nbsp; Although patients with MAS produce sufficient surfactant, certain components of meconium can inactivate circulating surfactant, resulting in a qualitative surfactant deficiency.&nbsp; Exogenous surfactant may be considered in severe cases.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn</strong>:&nbsp; Meconium aspiration causes maldevelopment of the pulmonary vasculature.&nbsp; Although the number of pulmonary arterioles is adequate, they are surrounded by an abnormally thick muscle layer that often extends into smaller vessels that normally have thin walls without muscle cells.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Meconium aspiration syndrome occurs in infants who aspirate meconium during or shortly after delivery, which causes airway obstruction, inflammation, and respiratory distress.&nbsp; Management is supportive, and most patients fully recover.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
