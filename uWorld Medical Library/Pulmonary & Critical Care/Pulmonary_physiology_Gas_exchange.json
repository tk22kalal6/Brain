Normal oxygenation requires:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Normal inspired oxygen (ie, PiO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>).</li>\n\t<li>Normal alveolar ventilation (ie, PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>), which requires normal minute ventilation and dead space.</li>\n\t<li>Normal alveolar-capillary exchange (ie, A-a gradient), which requires:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Proper ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching.</li>\n\t\t<li>Efficient diffusion.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>V/Q matching</h2><br><br><p>Ventilation (V) and perfusion (Q) matching can be conceptualized as the <strong>opportunity</strong> for oxygen uptake.&nbsp; Wherever air (ventilation) is present, there should be corresponding blood flow (perfusion).&nbsp; When ventilation is wasted on areas with insufficient blood flow (ie, dead space) or when perfusion is wasted on areas with insufficient ventilation (ie, shunt), V/Q mismatching occurs.</p><br><br><p>Ventilation and perfusion both decrease from the lung bases to the lung apices (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44451.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Ventilation is slightly greater at the lung bases because basal alveoli, compressed by overlying lung weight, start smaller and can expand relatively more during inspiration; conversely, apical alveoli are already stretched open and expand less.</li>\n\t<li>Perfusion is significantly greater at the lung bases due to the effect of gravity.&nbsp; Gravity increases hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary arteries (PAs), allowing blood to flow continuously (because the PA blood pressure exceeds the alveolar air pressure).&nbsp; At the apices, PA pressure falls below alveolar pressure; as a result, capillaries are compressed and perfusion is reduced.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>V/Q ratios</h2><br><br><p>Based on the relative pressures of the PAs, alveoli, and pulmonary veins, the lung is traditionally divided into 3 zones of West (named after physiologist John West) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13217.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Zone 1 (apices and upper lobes)</strong>:&nbsp; Ventilation is low at the apices because the already distended alveoli have limited capacity to expand further during inspiration.&nbsp; Perfusion is even lower because hydrostatic PA pressure is reduced at the apices, allowing alveoli to compress the capillaries and limit blood flow (alveolar pressure &gt; PA pressure).&nbsp; As a result, the <strong>V/Q is &gt;1</strong> (often &gt;2).&nbsp; This zone has a <strong>dead space tendency</strong> (ie, wasted ventilation) due to relative underperfusion.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Zone 2 (midlung)</strong>:&nbsp; Ventilation is intermediate because the alveoli are moderately compressed and capable of further expansion during inspiration.&nbsp; Perfusion is also intermediate because the increasing hydrostatic PA pressure toward the lung bases helps keep the capillaries from being compressed by alveolar pressure (PA pressure &gt; alveolar pressure).&nbsp; As a result, the <strong>V/Q ~1</strong>.&nbsp; This zone has <strong>ideal V/Q matching</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Zone 3 (bases and lower lobes)</strong>:&nbsp; Ventilation is high at the bases because the basal alveoli expand the most during inspiration.&nbsp; Perfusion is even higher because the gravitational hydrostatic pressure in the PAs keeps the vessels open.&nbsp; As a result, the <strong>V/Q is &lt;1</strong>.&nbsp; This zone has <strong>shunt tendency</strong> due to relative overperfusion.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>At <strong>rest</strong>, V/Q ratios normally range from 3 at the apices to ~0.6 at the bases, with a global average ratio of ~1 for the entire lung.&nbsp; The spread of the V/Q ratios is often represented as a histogram centered at 1 (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L69964.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>V/Q with exercise</h2><br><br><p>At rest, the V/Q ratio is ~3 at the apices, as described previously.&nbsp; During exercise, a rise in cardiac output recruits the capillaries in the apices and upper lobes, increasing perfusion in these regions.&nbsp; As a result, apical perfusion increases, lowering the V/Q ratio toward 1.&nbsp; This enables V/Q matching to improve <strong>even further</strong> with exercise compared to at rest, optimizing oxygen uptake efficiency.&nbsp; Consequently, a slight <strong>increase</strong> in PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> is considered a normal oxygenation response during exercise.&nbsp; Desaturation is never normal.</p>\n<h2>Diffusion</h2><br><br><p>Perfect V/Q matching brings air and blood into close proximity, but oxygenation is not complete unless oxygen effectively crosses the alveolar-capillary membrane, a process known as diffusion.&nbsp; Normal diffusion is governed by Fick law (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L32656.png\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The 2 most important variables in Fick laws of diffusion are the following:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Alveolar membrane <strong>surface area (A)</strong> determines the total area available for diffusion, with increased area increasing diffusion.&nbsp; Membrane surface area is normally 100 m<font size=\"2\"><sup>2</sup></font> in a healthy adult (approximately the size of a tennis court).&nbsp; It is reduced by conditions such as lung resection (eg, lobectomy) and emphysema.</li>\n\t<li>Alveolar membrane <strong>thickness (T)</strong> determines the distance that oxygen needs to cross, with increased thickness decreasing diffusion.&nbsp; Membrane thickness is normally 0.5 μm in a healthy adult and comprises 3 layers (epithelium, basement membrane, endothelium).&nbsp; Thickness is increased by conditions such as interstitial lung disease and pulmonary edema.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The other variables include the <strong>diffusion coefficient (D)</strong> (a unique value for each gas representing its solubility [eg, highest for carbon dioxide]) and <strong>partial pressure difference (ΔP)</strong> across the membrane (increased by altering the pressure or purity of inhaled gas).</p>\n<h2>Diffusion with exercise</h2><br><br><p>Oxygen diffuses quickly enough to fully equilibrate between the alveoli and the capillary blood within the first third of the pulmonary capillary.&nbsp; This rapid diffusion prevents hypoxemia during exercise (eg, even when blood flow triples).&nbsp; Because diffusion reaches an early ceiling, oxygen uptake can be increased further only by greater perfusion.&nbsp; As a result, in healthy individuals, oxygen uptake is said to be <strong>perfusion limited</strong>.&nbsp; However, in individuals with alveolar membrane damage (eg, due to severe emphysema or interstitial lung disease), oxygenation can become diffusion limited (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L66327.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Oxygenation might be marginally normal at rest, but significant desaturation can often be revealed by exertion.<p></p>\n<h1>Ventilation</h1><br><br><p>Ventilation refers to the elimination of carbon dioxide by the lungs.&nbsp; It requires normal alveolar ventilation (V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font>).&nbsp; Therefore, alveolar hypoventilation and hypercapnia (ie, PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> &gt;45 mm Hg) are synonymous.</p>\n<h2>Minute ventilation</h2><br><br><p>Minute ventilation (V<font size=\"2\"><sub>E</sub></font>) is the total respired volume per minute.&nbsp; It is calculated as the product of tidal volume (V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font>) and respiratory rate (RR) (V<font size=\"2\"><sub>E</sub></font> = V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> · RR).&nbsp; Normal V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> is approximately 500 mL, and normal RR is 12/min, yielding a typical V<font size=\"2\"><sub>E</sub></font> of 6 L/min.</p>\n<h2>Alveolar ventilation</h2><br><br><p>Alveolar ventilation (V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font>) is the total respired volume that participates in alveolar gas exchange.&nbsp; It is equal to V<font size=\"2\"><sub>E</sub></font>&nbsp;<strong>minus the dead space ventilation (V</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>D</strong></sub></font><strong>)</strong>.&nbsp; Dead space is the fraction of V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> that is unavailable for exchange.&nbsp; There are 2 components of V<font size=\"2\"><sub>D</sub></font> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L47244.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Anatomic V</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>D</strong></sub></font> is created by the conducting airways, such as the trachea and bronchi, where no gas exchange occurs.&nbsp; In adults, this is a fixed value of roughly 150 mL, so only 350 mL of a normal 500-mL V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> ever reaches the alveoli.&nbsp; As V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> decreases, the anatomic dead space fraction increases (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L42474.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; For example, with a 300-mL V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font>, only 150 mL reaches the alveoli.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Alveolar V</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>D</strong></sub></font> is created by alveoli with very high V/Q ratios (eg, extreme lung apices), where perfusion is low compared to ventilation.&nbsp; Under normal conditions, alveolar dead space is minimal (eg, 5-10 mL), but it can be greatly increased by conditions that reduce perfusion (eg, pulmonary embolism).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font> is calculated as V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font> = (V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> − V<font size=\"2\"><sub>D</sub></font>) · RR.&nbsp; Therefore, in normal conditions, V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font> = (500 − 150) · 12 = 4.2 L/min.&nbsp; A slower, deeper breathing pattern (eg, V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> = 600 mL, RR = 10/min) is preferable to a faster, shallower one (eg, V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> = 300 mL, RR = 20/min), even if V<font size=\"2\"><sub>E</sub></font> is the same (eg, 6 L/min for both).&nbsp; The shallow pattern results in a lower V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font> because more V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> is wasted in anatomic dead space.</p>\n<h2>PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font></h2><br><br><p>PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> is directly proportional to the carbon dioxide production rate (VCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>) and inversely proportional to V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font> (ie, PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> ∝ VCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> / V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font>):</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>VCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> (ie, ventilatory load) is determined by metabolic rate.&nbsp; It increases with exercise, pathologic conditions (eg, fever, hyperthyroidism, sepsis, burns, trauma), and overfeeding (especially with a carbohydrate-rich diet).</li>\n\t<li>V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font> is determined by V<font size=\"2\"><sub>E</sub></font> and dead space, as discussed previously.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Normally, a rise in VCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> is accompanied by a proportional rise in V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font>.&nbsp; Peripheral and central chemoreceptors rapidly adjust ventilation to maintain arterial carbon dioxide within a normal range.&nbsp; If V<font size=\"2\"><sub>A</sub></font> fails to keep pace with VCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>, acute hypercapnic respiratory failure results.&nbsp; This is seen in severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, when patients generate more carbon dioxide from their own work of breathing than they can expel through ventilation.</p>\n<h2>Ventilation with exercise</h2><br><br><p>Exercise leads to increases in both V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> and RR.&nbsp; The respiratory response differs based on the presence of lung disease:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Healthy</strong>:&nbsp; With exercise that is low-to-moderate intensity, <strong>V</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>T</strong></sub></font> <strong>increases first</strong>.&nbsp; With higher-intensity exercise, RR increases as V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> approaches inspiratory capacity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Abnormal</strong>:&nbsp; In patients with lung disease or neuromuscular weakness, RR increases earlier and more sharply because V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> cannot increase sufficiently.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In other words, V<font size=\"2\"><sub>T</sub></font> is the primary mechanism for increasing ventilation, whereas RR becomes more important as ventilatory load increases.&nbsp; In clinical practice, persistent tachypnea at rest often signals a serious underlying illness.</p>\n<h1>Gas transport</h1><h2>Oxygen transport</h2><br><br><p>Oxygen is transported in the blood in 2 forms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Some 98.5% of oxygen is bound to hemoglobin <strong>(HbO</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>2</strong></sub></font><strong>)</strong>.&nbsp; Each gram of hemoglobin can carry <strong>1.34</strong> mL of oxygen when fully saturated (ie, SaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> 100%).</li>\n\t<li>Some 1.5% of oxygen is carried as a dissolved gas in the plasma <strong>(PaO</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>2</strong></sub></font><strong>)</strong>.&nbsp; Only <strong>0.003</strong> mL of oxygen can dissolve in each deciliter of blood per every 1 mm Hg of increase in partial pressure.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Total blood oxygen content (CaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>) is the sum of HbO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> and PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>:</p><br><br><p>CaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> = HbO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> + PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>= (1.34 · SaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> · Hb) + (0.003 · PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>)</p><br><br><p>In a healthy patient with normal hemoglobin (eg, Hb = 15 g/dL) and normal oxygenation (eg, SaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> = 99%, PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> = 90 mm Hg), the oxygen carrying capacity is 20.1 mL O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>/dL of blood.</p><br><br><p>Carrying capacity is determined <strong>almost entirely</strong> by hemoglobin concentration.&nbsp; For example, when a patient with severe anemia (eg, Hb = 5 mg/dL) is breathing pure oxygen (ie, SaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> = 99%, PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> = 600 mm Hg), the oxygen-carrying capacity is only 8.43 mL O<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>/dL of blood (only 42% of normal).&nbsp; Therefore, the total CaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> remains very low despite maximizing the dissolved oxygen.</p>\n<h2>Carbon dioxide transport</h2><br><br><p>Carbon dioxide is transported in the blood in 3 forms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>70% of carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate anion <strong>(HCO</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>3</strong></sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup><strong>−</strong></sup></font><strong>)</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>23% of carbon dioxide is transported as carbaminohemoglobin <strong>(HbCO</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>2</strong></sub></font><strong>)</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>7% of carbon dioxide is carried as a dissolved gas in the plasma <strong>(PaCO</strong><font size=\"2\"><sub><strong>2</strong></sub></font><strong>)</strong>.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These 3 states are in an equilibrium mediated by <strong>carbonic anhydrase</strong> in red blood cells (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L122698.png\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; When PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> increases, more HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>−</sup></font> is formed and subsequently transported out of red blood cells in exchange for chloride anions to maintain electrical neutrality (ie, Hamburger phenomenon).&nbsp; This phenomenon is one of the reasons that metabolic alkalosis (excess plasma HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>−</sup></font>) is often accompanied by hypochloremia.<p></p><br><br><p>Some of the carbon dioxide binds to the terminal amine group of hemoglobin as carbaminohemoglobin;

Therefore, fat- and protein-rich diets are often preferred to help reduce RQ and assist with respiratory recovery (eg, ventilator weaning).</p>\n<h2>Effect of exercise</h2><br><br><p>The RQ increases during exercise.&nbsp; At rest or during routine activity, the RQ is approximately 0.8.&nbsp; With more intense exercise, tissues preferentially use carbohydrates for fuel, causing the RQ to increase toward 1.&nbsp; With very-high-intensity exercise, the RQ increases further and can exceed 1 as the anaerobic threshold is reached (ie, oxygen is no longer being consumed, but carbon dioxide is still being produced from glycolysis).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Respiratory gas exchange encompasses the processes of oxygenation, ventilation, and gas transport in the blood.</p><br><br><p>Effective oxygenation requires normal alveolar-capillary exchange.&nbsp; It requires tight ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching (ie, opportunity for air to contact blood) and rapid diffusion across the alveolar membrane (ie, speed of oxygen uptake).&nbsp; V/Q mismatch or diffusion limitation leads to impaired alveolar-capillary exchange and a subsequent fall in PaO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> (ie, hypoxemia).&nbsp; Blood oxygen content is mainly carried by hemoglobin (98.5%).</p><br><br><p>Effective ventilation requires normal minute ventilation (tidal volume · respiratory rate) and minimal dead space volume.&nbsp; Insufficient minute ventilation or abnormally increased dead space leads to alveolar hypoventilation and a subsequent rise in PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> (ie, hypercapnia), which can also cause secondary hypoxemia.&nbsp; Blood carbon dioxide content is mainly carried as intracellular bicarbonate in red blood cells (70%).</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
