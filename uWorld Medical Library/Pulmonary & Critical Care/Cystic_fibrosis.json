It is the most common monogenic disorder, affecting ~1/3,000 live births, with ~1/25 Caucasian adults being carriers.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><h2>Genetics and molecular biology</h2><br><br><p>CF is an autosomal recessive disorder due to inheritance of 2 abnormal copies of the <strong>cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (</strong><em><strong>CFTR</strong></em><strong>)</strong> gene.&nbsp; Mutations in <em>CFTR</em> result in a protein that is truncated (eg, G542X), is nonfunctional (eg, G551D), or fails to reach the cell surface (ΔF508).&nbsp; <strong>ΔF508</strong> is the most common mutation, accounting for ~70% of CF cases.&nbsp; ΔF508 (ie, deletion of phenylalanine at position 508) leads to misfolding and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the CFTR protein (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16555.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Approximately 2,000 mutations of CFTR have been discovered, but only a minority are clinically consequential (ie, variable penetrance).&nbsp; Compound heterozygosity with 2 alleles can also produce significant CF clinical disease (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L69539.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The CFTR protein is an apical (ie, lumen-facing) <strong>epithelial chloride channel</strong> that actively (ie, using ATP) transports chloride out of the cell.&nbsp; Movement of chloride creates an electrochemical potential that also draws sodium and water across the cell membrane, promoting hydration and thinning of mucus secretions.&nbsp; The impact of CFTR <strong>depends on orientation</strong> of the channel, which is different at different sites (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28038.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Mucosae:&nbsp; CFTR is oriented outward, functioning to excrete chloride (as well as sodium, bicarbonate, and water) into the lumen.&nbsp; Abnormal CFTR function results in desiccated, thick mucus that clogs organ lumens (eg, airways, pancreaticobiliary ducts), leading to clinical manifestations of recurrent pneumonias and pancreatic failure.</li>\n\t<li>Eccrine sweat glands:&nbsp; CFTR is oriented inward, functioning to remove chloride from the sweat (creates hypotonic sweat relative to plasma).&nbsp; Abnormal CFTR function results in hypertonic sweat with elevated chloride and sodium (eg, salty).&nbsp;

Occasionally, older patients (especially those with lower penetrance mutations causing slower disease progression) can be diagnosed retroactively based on clinical features and follow-up CFTR testing.&nbsp; CF is sometimes first evaluated during investigations for infertility.</p><br><br><p>Some patients with suspected CF have intermediate results (eg, &lt;2 major <em>CFTR</em> mutations, intermediate sweat chloride levels [30-59 mmol/L]).&nbsp; In these cases, more intensive workup is needed (expanded DNA analysis [whole-gene sequencing], nasal epithelial potential difference, fecal elastase measurement, semen analysis).</p>\n<h2>Universal newborn screening</h2><br><br><p>The inclusion of CF in newborn screening (NBS) along with other genetic conditions (eg, phenylketonuria, aminoacidurias) is now widespread (eg, all 50 states in the United States).&nbsp;

IRT detects elevated levels of trypsinogen (a propeptide of trypsinogen) that accumulates in the blood due to defective pancreatic secretion.</li>\n\t<li>DNA mutation screen:&nbsp; DNA mutation screen is a PCR-based assay that detects the 40 most common <em>CFTR</em> mutations (accounting for ~85% of cases in Caucasians).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>When NBS is positive, infants undergo confirmatory testing with a pilocarpine sweat chloride assay.</p><br><br><p>The incidence of CF remains stable (~1/3000 births) due to unchanging prevalence of mutant <em>CFTR</em> alleles.&nbsp; This is likely because <strong>carriers</strong> of <em>CFTR</em> mutation (ie, heterozygous) are asymptomatic and have normal fertility, and CFTR disease (ie, homozygous) is not embryonically lethal.&nbsp;

They operate via 2 main mechanisms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Correctors</strong> (eg, lumacaftor, tezacaftor):&nbsp; These drugs restore proper folding and stabilization of CFTR, allowing successful trafficking to the cell surface.&nbsp; They are especially effective for mutations that result in CFTR misfolding and degradation (eg, ΔF508).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Potentiators</strong> (eg, ivacaftor):&nbsp; These drugs increase the opening probability of CFTR, allowing for more effective transport of chloride.&nbsp; They are especially effective for mutations that result in abnormal CFTR ion gating (eg, G551D).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The most common CFTR modulator regimen (elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor) is a fixed-dose triple therapy that combines a potentiator and 2 correctors.&nbsp; CFTR modulators are recommended for any patient with a responsive mutation; therefore, CFTR genotyping is the standard of care for all patients.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Survival in CF has steadily improved, with an unprecedented jump after the introduction of CFTR modulators (median survival increased from 40 in 2013 to 70 in 2023).&nbsp; In terms of pulmonary status, most patients have complete resolution of respiratory symptoms and normalization of lung function.&nbsp; In terms of extrapulmonary status, CFTR modulator therapy markedly improves virtually all aspects of organ dysfunction (eg, resolution of constipation, pancreatic insufficiency, and liver disease).&nbsp; Because of their transformative impact, CFTR modulators have been deemed an \"effective cure\" (for patients with eligible mutations).</p><br><br><p>Despite these advances, the burden on patients is considerable.&nbsp; For example, upon awakening, a typical teenager with CF must perform ACT (~30 minutes), followed by nebulized medications (~60 minutes), followed by oral and systemic medications (~30 minutes).&nbsp; This routine is then repeated again in the evening.&nbsp; Integrating these time-consuming (~5 hours/day) activities into school and daily life is taxing, requiring intensive support (eg, social work, mental health counseling) to help patients navigate their illness and to encourage adherence.</p><br><br><p>Some patients continue to suffer from progressive lung function decline with recurrent exacerbations.&nbsp; They eventually require bilateral lung transplantation (referred once FEV<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> ≤35%).&nbsp; The most common cause of death in CF remains progressive respiratory failure, with gastrointestinal complications (eg, large bowel obstruction) a close second.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Cystic fibrosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/38262.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 7\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the <em>CFTR</em> gene that impair chloride transport, leading to abnormally dehydrated mucus that obstructs and causes progressive dysfunction of multiple organs (eg, lungs, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract).&nbsp; ΔF508 is the most common mutation (~70% of cases) and causes misfolding and proteasomal degradation of CFTR.<p></p><br><br><p>Clinical manifestations include chronic and recurrent sinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, pancreatic insufficiency, and male infertility.&nbsp; Diagnosis requires the presence of a positive clinical criterion (eg, abnormal newborn screen) and proof of CFTR dysfunction (eg, elevated sweat chloride).&nbsp; Most cases are diagnosed based on universal newborn screening (eg, immunoreactive trypsinogen) with a confirmatory sweat chloride test.&nbsp; Management focuses on airway clearance techniques (eg, chest physiotherapy), mucolytic agents (eg, hypertonic saline), antibiotics (antipseudomonal), and CFTR modulators, which have dramatically improved survival rates and quality of life.&nbsp;
