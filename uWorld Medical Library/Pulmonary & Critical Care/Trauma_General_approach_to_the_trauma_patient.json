care.&nbsp; Trauma can involve a range of injuries from external wounds to internal organ damage and can result in life-threatening conditions.&nbsp; The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol provides a standardized framework for the initial assessment and management of trauma patients, emphasizing the need for a primary survey (focused on airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure) followed by a secondary survey (a more detailed evaluation after life-threatening conditions have been addressed).</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>In penetrating trauma (eg, stab or gunshot wounds), rapid assessment of potential organ damage and hemorrhage is crucial.</li>\n\t<li>In blunt trauma (eg, motor vehicle collisions or falls), internal injuries may be less obvious but equally dangerous.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The systematic approach ensures that both types of trauma are managed in an organized, life-saving manner, preventing oversight of critical injuries and improving patient outcomes.&nbsp; Information regarding specific injuries is provided in separate articles.</p>\n<h1>Primary survey</h1><br><br><p>The <strong>ATLS protocol</strong> offers a systematic method through its primary survey.&nbsp; This survey is organized by prioritizing injuries that are most immediately life-threatening, following a specific sequence of evaluation.&nbsp; In resource-limited settings, this approach helps to focus priorities, ensuring that any identified life-threatening issues are promptly addressed before moving to the next step.&nbsp; At major trauma centers with more resources and staff, multiple aspects of the patient's condition can be managed simultaneously by the trauma team.&nbsp; The primary survey follows the structured <strong>ABCDE</strong> algorithm.</p>\n<h2>Airway</h2><br><br><p>Address any life-threatening airway compromise immediately because airway obstruction is a leading cause of death in trauma patients.&nbsp; Common obstructions include the tongue, foreign bodies, aspirated material, swollen tissue, or an expanding hematoma.&nbsp; If intubation is necessary, attempt to stabilize the patient beforehand to minimize the risk of postintubation hypotension.&nbsp; Trauma patients often present with difficult airways, so alternative techniques, such as cricothyroidotomy, should be ready before attempting intubation.</p><br><br><p>Additionally, if there is concern for cervical spine injury, cervical stabilization should be maintained throughout the intubation process.</p>\n<h2>Breathing</h2><br><br><p>Assess the chest for signs of injury, including abnormal movement (eg, flail chest), asymmetric breath sounds, and palpable crepitus or deformities.&nbsp; Life-threatening conditions such as tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, and cardiac tamponade should be identified (either clinically or with ultrasonography) and treated without delay.</p><br><br><p>Patients with signs of tension pneumothorax (eg, hypotension, dyspnea, decreased breath sounds on the affected side) should receive immediate needle decompression, preferably with a 14-gauge or larger angiocatheter, either at the second intercostal space (midclavicular line) or fifth intercostal space (midaxillary line); this should be followed promptly by tube thoracostomy.&nbsp; Ultrasonography can also be used at the bedside for faster diagnosis because it is more sensitive than x-rays for detecting pneumothorax.&nbsp; If resources allow, proceeding directly to chest tube insertion is appropriate, bypassing needle decompression.&nbsp; A pneumothorax or hemothorax should be managed immediately with a chest tube (eg, 28 French or greater).</p>\n<h2>Circulation</h2><br><br><p>Two large-bore (16 gauge or larger) intravenous (IV) catheters should be placed.&nbsp; Assess pulses in all extremities, obtain blood pressure, and in unstable patients point-of-care ultrasonography (eg, focused assessment with sonography in trauma [FAST], described below) is usually performed.&nbsp; When possible, immediately control hemorrhage (eg, direct compression, tourniquet, placement of pelvic binder), which is typically from one of the following sites:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>External</li>\n\t<li>Intrathoracic</li>\n\t<li>Intraperitoneal</li>\n\t<li>Retroperitoneal</li>\n\t<li>Pelvic or long bone fractures</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Consider initiating blood product transfusion if indicated (described later) and/or reversal of anticoagulation.&nbsp; Consider obstructive shock (eg, pericardial tamponade, tension pneumothorax) as an alternative cause of hypotension.&nbsp; Hypotension along with muffled heart sounds suggests tamponade requiring emergent pericardiocentesis, whereas hypotension along with diminished breath sounds suggests tension pneumothorax, requiring emergent needle decompression or tube thoracostomy.</p>\n<h2>Disability</h2><br><br><p>A focused neurologic examination should be conducted.&nbsp; This includes assessing the patient's level of consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), along with evaluating pupillary size and reactivity, gross motor function, and sensation.&nbsp; Be sure to identify any lateralizing signs or sensory deficits, especially if a spinal cord injury is suspected.&nbsp; Although the GCS is a valuable tool for monitoring neurologic status, its initial score may not reliably predict outcomes in severe brain injury, and factors such as intubation, sedatives, or intoxication can affect its accuracy.&nbsp; Spinal immobilization should be maintained for patients at risk of spinal cord injury, and motor deficits or sensory changes warrant immediate imaging of the brain, spinal cord, and associated vascular structures.</p>\n<h2>Exposure</h2><br><br><p>Patients should be undressed and the entire body should be searched for occult injuries.&nbsp; Areas often missed include the scalp, axillary folds, perineum, and, in patients with obesity, abdominal folds.&nbsp; While maintaining cervical spine precautions, check the patient's back, including the gluteal fold and posterior scalp.</p><br><br><p>Prevent and promptly treat hypothermia because it can lead to coagulopathy and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.&nbsp; To manage hypothermia, especially in cold conditions, the resuscitation room should be heated to at least 29.4 C (85 F).&nbsp; Remove wet clothing quickly, and use warm blankets, external warming devices, warm IV fluids, and blood when needed.</p>\n<h1>Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST)</h1><br><br><p>An important tool in the initial assessment of trauma patients, the FAST ultrasonographic examination evaluates for the presence of free fluid or air in specific areas of the body following trauma.&nbsp; It is a noninvasive, rapid imaging tool that can be performed in &lt;5 minutes.&nbsp; The primary areas examined during a FAST examination include:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Pericardial view (subxiphoid or parasternal):</strong>&nbsp; This view is used to evaluate for pericardial effusion or blood in the pericardial sac, which can indicate cardiac tamponade.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Right upper quadrant (RUQ):</strong>&nbsp; This view assesses the hepatorenal (Morrison) pouch for free fluid between the liver and kidney.&nbsp; Blood in this area may indicate a liver injury, bleeding into the abdominal cavity, or major vascular injury.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Left upper quadrant (LUQ):</strong>&nbsp; This view examines the splenorenal recess and the area around the spleen and kidney.&nbsp; Fluid here may indicate splenic injury or intraabdominal bleeding.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pelvic view (suprapubic):</strong>&nbsp; This view evaluates for fluid in the pouch of Douglas (rectovesical space in men and rectouterine space in women), where blood may accumulate due to trauma to pelvic organs or major vessels.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The E-FAST examination extends the traditional FAST examination by adding views to evaluate for pneumothorax and hemothorax.&nbsp; It includes all 4 standard FAST views plus bilateral anterior lung views.&nbsp; These views are used to assess the pleural line for the presence of lung sliding, which indicates that the pleura are intact.&nbsp; The absence of lung sliding suggests a pneumothorax.&nbsp; Hemothorax can be identified as free fluid seen between the lung and the chest wall in dependent portions of the pleural cavity.</p><br><br><p>The FAST and E-FAST examinations play a critical role in guiding decision-making by helping distinguish patients who require immediate surgical intervention, such as patients with massive internal bleeding or cardiac tamponade, from patients who can be managed with observation or nonsurgical treatments.&nbsp; In unstable patients, the FAST examination is often performed simultaneously with the primary survey, although it should not delay critical interventions like thoracostomy, thoracotomy, or transfer to the operating room.&nbsp; The examinations can also be repeated during resuscitation to monitor for changes in the patient's condition, such as new fluid collections or pneumothorax, without disrupting ongoing care.&nbsp; FAST and E-FAST are minimally disruptive, unlike CT scans, which require patient transport and more time.&nbsp; They are especially effective in unstable patients where rapid detection of internal bleeding can be lifesaving.&nbsp; Disadvantages of the FAST and E-FAST examinations are that they are operator-dependent (requiring skill to interpret accurately) and that small amounts of fluid may be missed, particularly early in the assessment.</p>\n<h1>Secondary survey</h1><br><br><p>The secondary survey in trauma assessment is a comprehensive and systematic approach to evaluate the patient after the primary survey has stabilized any immediate life-threatening conditions.&nbsp; It involves a thorough head-to-toe examination, detailed history-taking to identify all injuries (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a

the chest, pelvis, and/or extremities to assess for fractures or injuries.</li>\n\t<li>FAST or E-FAST ultrasonography for rapid evaluation of intraabdominal and thoracic injuries if not performed during the primary survey.</li>\n\t<li>CT scans of the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis, especially in stable patients, to detect injuries not visible on physical examination or ultrasonography.</li>\n\t<li>Laboratory tests are often indicated but should be tailored to the patient's clinical status.&nbsp; Examples include:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Complete blood count:</strong>&nbsp; assesses for blood loss (although drop in hemoglobin often lags actual blood loss).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Blood type and crossmatch:</strong>&nbsp; is essential for patients requiring a blood transfusion.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Basic metabolic panel:</strong>&nbsp; evaluates kidney function, electrolyte balance, and glucose levels, which are important for managing fluid resuscitation and overall metabolic status.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Liver function tests:</strong>&nbsp; assesses for possible liver injury if the trauma may have affected the upper abdomen.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Coagulation panel:</strong>&nbsp; determines if the patient has any coagulopathies or if there is ongoing bleeding risk.&nbsp; This also helps guide blood product administration.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Arterial blood gas:</strong>&nbsp; evaluates oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base status.&nbsp; This can help determine the severity of shock or respiratory compromise.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Lactate level:</strong>&nbsp; elevations can be a marker of tissue hypoperfusion, shock, and the severity of trauma.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Urinalysis:</strong>&nbsp; checks for hematuria, which might indicate kidney or urinary tract involvement.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Pregnancy test:</strong>&nbsp; should be performed for females of reproductive age.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Incorporating these diagnostic tools helps ensure that any hidden injuries or complications are identified promptly, guiding appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes.</p>\n<h1>General principles of trauma management</h1><h2>Unstable trauma patients</h2><br><br><p>For patients with life-threatening injuries, the goal is rapid stabilization followed by definitive care.&nbsp; Immediate surgical or interventional procedures may be required.</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Damage control resuscitation (DCR)</strong><br><br>\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Hemorrhage control:&nbsp; Immediate intervention to control bleeding (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/63357.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) may involve surgical intervention (eg, laparotomy for intraabdominal bleeding, thoracotomy for chest injuries) or angiography with embolization for noncompressible internal bleeding (eg, pelvic fractures).</li>\n\t\t<li>Permissive hypotension:&nbsp; Maintain a systolic blood pressure that prevents exsanguination while avoiding excessive fluid resuscitation that can worsen bleeding.</li>\n\t\t<li>Massive transfusion protocols:&nbsp; Identify patients at risk for having significant (eg, ≥10 units packed red blood cells) transfusion requirements (2+ of the following: penetrating injury, positive FAST, tachycardia ≥120/min, hypotension ≤90 mm Hg).&nbsp; Use balanced blood products (eg, 1:1:1 ratio of packed red blood cells/plasma/platelets) or whole blood early in resuscitation (\"massive transfusion protocol\") and avoid overuse of crystalloids because it worsens the <strong>\"lethal triad\"</strong> (hypothermia, acidosis, coagulopathy) already present in severely injured trauma patients, increasing the risk for mortality.</li>\n\t\t<li>Consider administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) (an antifibrinolytic agent) in patients who present within 3 hours of trauma with significant hemorrhage.&nbsp; TXA works in trauma by inhibiting fibrinolysis, stabilizing blood clots, and reducing excessive bleeding, which helps improve survival when administered early.</li>\n\t\t<li>Damage control surgery:&nbsp; a limited surgical approach focused on controlling bleeding and contamination rather than definitive repair, to avoid prolonged operations that can worsen the patient's condition.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rapid transfer to the operating room or interventional suite:</strong>&nbsp; immediate surgery for conditions like uncontrolled hemorrhage (eg, from the abdomen, chest, or pelvis) or penetrating injuries to vital organs.&nbsp; Interventional radiology for nonsurgical bleeding control, particularly in areas like the pelvis or solid organs.&nbsp; After initial stabilization, these patients may need to return for more definitive surgical repair.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Critical care and postoperative monitoring:</strong>&nbsp; Transfer to the intensive care unit for continuous monitoring and further stabilization.&nbsp; Conduct ongoing management of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia (the \"lethal triad\").</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Early recognition and prompt management of these life-threatening conditions are essential to optimize patient survival and reduce complications</p>\n<h2>Stable trauma patients</h2><br><br><p>For patients who are hemodynamically stable and not in immediate danger, a more measured approach can be taken.</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Definitive surgical repair:</strong>&nbsp; If surgery is required (eg, fracture stabilization), it can be planned and performed without the time constraints of an unstable patient.&nbsp; Timing and type of surgery are often elective, based on injury severity and the patient's overall condition.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nonoperative management:</strong>&nbsp; Some injuries in stable patients can be managed without surgery, particularly with advances in imaging and interventional techniques.&nbsp; Lower grade liver or spleen lacerations may be observed and may heal without surgery.&nbsp; Internal bleeding in solid organs (liver, kidney, spleen) or pelvic fractures may be managed with embolization via interventional radiology.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Comprehensive care and monitoring:</strong>&nbsp; ongoing monitoring for any delayed complications, such as bleeding, infection, or organ failure.&nbsp; Frequent reassessment should be performed to ensure that stable patients do not deteriorate and require more urgent interventions.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In general, for unstable patients, immediate, often life-saving interventions (surgery, DCR, interventional radiology) are prioritized.&nbsp; For stable patients, more measured, often elective surgical or nonsurgical management is prioritized with a focus on long-term recovery and rehabilitation.&nbsp; This approach ensures the best possible outcome by prioritizing immediate stabilization for unstable patients, while allowing for more comprehensive planning in stable cases.</p>\n<h1>Management of blunt versus penetrating trauma</h1><h2>Penetrating trauma</h2><br><br><p>Penetrating injuries tend to be localized with clear entry wounds and well-defined trajectories, whereas blunt injuries can cause diffuse damage over a broader area without obvious external signs.&nbsp; In general, penetrating chest and abdominal trauma often requires immediate surgical exploration to identify and repair damaged organs or vessels, whereas blunt injuries may be managed conservatively at first, with surgery reserved for cases of clinical deterioration or definitive injury findings on imaging.</p>\n<h2>Blunt trauma</h2><br><br><p>Blunt trauma usually involves more extensive monitoring and imaging to detect hidden injuries, especially when symptoms are subtle or delayed, whereas penetrating injuries typically present more overtly, with visible wounds and immediate signs of organ or vessel damage.</p>\n<h1>Transfers</h1><br><br><p>Clinicians in hospitals with limited trauma management capabilities should consult the nearest trauma center once they recognize that a patient has sustained injuries that exceed their facility's resources.&nbsp; In facilities with fewer resources the focus should be to stabilize trauma patients before transferring them to a higher-level trauma center where definitive care can be provided.&nbsp; These trauma centers are equipped with advanced resources and specialized teams to manage complex injuries.&nbsp; Before transfer, it is essential to address immediate life-threatening conditions, secure the airway, ensure adequate breathing and circulation, and initiate critical interventions, such as fluid resuscitation or hemorrhage control.&nbsp; Transfer should be initiated as soon as the patient has been stabilized to the best ability of the treating facility with clear communication between the referring facility and the receiving trauma center to ensure seamless care upon arrival.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>A structured approach should be used when managing trauma patients.&nbsp; The primary survey (ABCDE) is the initial assessment that focuses on airway, breathing, circulation, disability (neurologic status), and exposure to address life-threatening issues immediately.&nbsp; For patients who are hemodynamically unstable, rapid interventions are prioritized.&nbsp; This often includes immediate procedures like chest decompression, focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) for fluid detection, and emergency surgery (eg, laparotomy) to control bleeding or repair injuries.&nbsp; Hemodynamically stable patients undergo more detailed evaluation after the primary survey.&nbsp; This includes advanced imaging (eg, CT scans) to assess internal injuries, serial physical examinations, and targeted interventions like diagnostic laparoscopy.&nbsp; Surgery may be deferred unless imaging reveals significant injuries.&nbsp; In general, unstable patients generally require immediate surgical management, while stable patients may be managed conservatively with observation or minimally invasive procedures unless their condition deteriorates.&nbsp; These tenets emphasize rapid assessment, prioritization of life-saving measures, and the use of imaging or observation to guide management based on patient stability.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
