From there, it can invade the bloodstream (eg, bacteremia) and evade the immune system, potentially allowing for infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via the cerebral capillary epithelium or the choroid plexus.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p><em>N meningitidis</em> affects individuals of all ages but is more common in infants, adolescents, and young adults.&nbsp; Endemic outbreaks often occur in crowded settings such as college dormitories, but larger epidemic infections can also occur.&nbsp; Risk factors for infection include close contact with an infected individual (eg, in college dormitories or child care facilities), living in crowded conditions, and immunodeficiency (eg, complement deficiency, HIV).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with meningococcal meningitis often have:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Fever</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Altered mental status</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Nuchal rigidity</strong> (eg, stiff neck)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Myalgias</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Petechial rash</strong> (may progress to purpura and necrosis in severe cases)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In the early stages, the illness may be more mild and nonspecific (eg, fever, headache, nausea, sore throat), suggestive of a typical viral illness.&nbsp; However, there can be distinguishing features to help identify this disease.&nbsp; In meningococcal meningitis, the severe myalgia is more painful than the myalgia of a typical viral illness.&nbsp; Patients often report feeling extremely sick with the <strong>\"worst illness of their lives\"</strong> out of proportion to the early symptoms.&nbsp; Another hallmark clinical feature is a distinctive petechial or purpuric rash, which is often present on initial evaluation.</p><br><br><p>Meningococcal meningitis can <strong>rapidly progress</strong> within hours from mild illness to severe disease with <strong>sepsis</strong>, <strong>circulatory collapse</strong>, and <strong>multiorgan dysfunction</strong>.&nbsp; Early signs of sepsis, including pale or mottled skin or cold extremities, can be a helpful clinical sign.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of <em>N meningitidis</em> infection is confirmed through lumbar puncture and CSF analysis, which show:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Neutrophilic leukocytosis</strong> (usually &gt;1,000/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>), <strong>low glucose levels</strong>, <strong>high protein levels</strong></li>\n\t<li>Gram stain and culture that identifies <em>N meningitidis</em></li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Blood cultures can be positive about half of the time and are a useful ancillary test.&nbsp; CT of the head can be considered prior to lumbar puncture for patients who have had a seizure or who have focal neurologic deficits, or papilledema.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Given that meningococcal meningitis can rapidly progress to severe disease, a key principle in treatment is that antibiotics should not be delayed while awaiting diagnostic test results.&nbsp; If clinical suspicion exists, blood specimens should be drawn for cultures, and antibiotics should be prescribed immediately.&nbsp; Antibiotics should not be delayed while awaiting a lumbar puncture.</p><br><br><p><strong>Empiric antibiotic therapy</strong> for suspected <em>N meningitidis</em> infection consists of a third-generation cephalosporin (eg, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime).&nbsp; Treatment can be specifically tailored after cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing results.&nbsp; Patients usually require 4-7 days of antibiotic therapy.&nbsp; Supportive care and resuscitation for septic shock should be provided if needed.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Antibiotics can be effective for the treatment of meningococcal meningitis.&nbsp; However, this disease still has significant morbidity and mortality rates, even with the administration of antibiotics.&nbsp; Mortality rates can be up to 15%.&nbsp; Neurologic sequelae, such as hearing loss, seizures, intellectual disability, and cerebral palsy can occur after meningitis in both adults and children.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Preventive measures for <em>N meningitidis</em> infection include vaccination, infection control measures, and chemoprophylaxis for high-risk contacts.</p><br><br><p>In the United States, a quadrivalent conjugate <strong>vaccine</strong> that prevents serogroups A, C, Y, and W is part of routine immunizations in adolescents, with the first dose given at age 11-12 and a booster dose given at age 16.&nbsp; The serogroup B meningococcal vaccine is also recommended for high-risk patients, such as those with asplenia.</p><br><br><p>In patients with suspected or confirmed <em>N meningitidis</em> infection, <strong>droplet precautions</strong> are recommended for 24 hours after antibiotics are begun.</p><br><br><p>To prevent the spread of infection, high-risk contacts should be prescribed <strong>antibiotic chemoprophylaxis</strong>, regardless of vaccination status.&nbsp; This includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Members of the same household (eg, family members, roommates)</li>\n\t<li>Child care workers</li>\n\t<li>Health care workers (with direct exposure to secretions)</li>\n\t<li>Individuals who have ≥8 hours of close contact within 3 feet of an infected patient</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The preferred antibiotics for prophylaxis include rifampin, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin (in adults only) administered preferably within 24 hours of exposure.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p><em>N meningitidis</em> is a major cause of community-acquired bacterial meningitis that can clinically start with nonspecific symptoms and rapidly progress within hours to severe disease with septic shock.&nbsp; Identification of hallmark findings, such as petechial rash and severe myalgia, can help identify the disease early in its course.&nbsp; Diagnosis can be made with lumbar puncture and testing of the cerebrospinal fluid, but treatment with antibiotics should be started without delay.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
