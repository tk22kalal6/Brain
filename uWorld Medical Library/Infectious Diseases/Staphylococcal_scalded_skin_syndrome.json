It primarily affects young children but can occur in adults, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression or renal insufficiency.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p><strong>Age ≤5</strong> is the greatest risk factor for developing SSSS.&nbsp; This is likely related to a relative lack of toxin-neutralizing antibodies in young children as compared to older children and adults, as well as poor renal toxin clearance due to immature renal function.</p><br><br><p>In adults, risk factors include immunosuppression (eg, HIV) and renal insufficiency.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The pathogenesis of SSSS involves infection with certain strains of <em>S aureus</em> that produce <strong>exfoliative toxins</strong>.&nbsp; In children, the inciting infection is typically conjunctivitis, impetigo, or umbilical or circumcision site infection, whereas, in adults, abscess or pneumonia is more common.</p><br><br><p>The bacterial exotoxins disseminate via hematogenous spread to the skin and act as proteases that cleave desmoglein, a desmosomal protein involved in the adherence of epidermal cells with one another (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26361.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This results in disruption and detachment of keratinocytes in the superficial epidermis, causing superficial and widespread desquamation.<p></p><br><br><p>The incubation period from the onset of the initial focus of infection, which may not always be apparent, to the development of SSSS is 1-10 days.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Manifestations of SSSS begin with a prodrome lasting 1-2 days and include fever, malaise, and skin tenderness; poor feeding and irritability may be present in infants.</p><br><br><p>Cutaneous symptoms then develop as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Tender erythema</strong>:&nbsp; The first skin manifestation is generalized, tender erythema that is most prominent around the mouth and in skinfolds (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L46450.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (eg, neck, axillae, groin).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Flaccid blisters</strong>:&nbsp; Within hours, flaccid blisters/bullae form, predominantly in flexural areas exposed to mechanical pressure (eg, axillae, groin).&nbsp; Crusting and fissuring (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L46451.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) around the mouth is also typical, but mucous membranes are spared.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Desquamation</strong>:&nbsp; Gentle pressure causes detachment and shedding of the outer layer of skin (ie, Nikolsky sign).&nbsp; Epidermal shedding (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45667.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) exposes large patches of underlying skin that have a moist and erythematous, or scalded, appearance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of SSSS is primarily <strong>clinical</strong> based on characteristic features of diffuse, tender erythema with flaccid blisters and superficial desquamation.</p><br><br><p>Histopathology is confirmatory for atypical cases and shows superficial (ie, not full thickness) intraepidermal cleavage without significant inflammation.</p><br><br><p>Further evaluation in patients with SSSS may include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cultures:&nbsp; Bacterial cultures from blood (usually negative in children) and potential primary sites of infection (eg, conjunctivae, abscess) are assessed; intact bullae are typically sterile, and cultures of these lesions are not required.</li>\n\t<li>Laboratory studies:&nbsp; Renal function testing is used to assess for underlying renal insufficiency, and electrolytes are monitored for derangements due to fluid extravasation and insensible fluid losses.</li>\n\t<li>Imaging:&nbsp; Chest x-ray may be warranted if a primary focus of pneumonia is suspected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1> <h2>Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis </h2><br><br><p>Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis is a cell-mediated hypersensitivity (ie, type IV or delayed-type) that causes blistering, bullae, and a positive Nikolsky sign (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L9313.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
