Rubella is generally self-limited; however, neonates with congenital rubella infection are at risk for significant morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The rubella virus is transmitted via respiratory droplets.&nbsp; The virus adheres to and replicates within the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes, and viremia occurs 5-7 days later, disseminating the virus to various tissues.&nbsp; Viral shedding occurs 1 week before and 2 weeks after the rash, which appears with the formation of neutralizing antibodies.</p><br><br><p>Because the vaccine is highly effective, being unimmunized is the primary risk factor for infection.&nbsp; Similarly, living in a geographic area with low vaccination rates is also a risk factor.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The clinical presentation of rubella varies, depending on the patient's age at the time of infection:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Children</strong>:&nbsp; Postnatal rubella infection typically causes a <strong>generalized maculopapular rash</strong> that lasts &lt;3 days.&nbsp; The rash is generally nontender and nonpruritic, although patients may report occasional, mild pruritus.&nbsp; The rash typically <strong>begins on the face</strong> and <strong>spreads cephalocaudally</strong> within 24 hours, sparing the palms and soles.&nbsp; Some patients also develop petechiae known as Forchheimer spots on the soft palate.&nbsp; The rash may be preceded or accompanied by mild systemic symptoms, including low fever and lymphadenopathy involving the suboccipital, posterior articular, and posterior cervical nodes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Adolescents and adults</strong>:&nbsp; Rubella in adolescents and adults presents similarly to that in children.&nbsp; These patients have postnatal infection, although the rash may last longer.&nbsp; Primary infection in adult women often causes <strong>arthralgia</strong> and arthritis involving the knees, wrists, and fingers that can persist for &gt;1 month.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnostic testing should be performed in cases of suspected rubella (eg, nonimmune patient with acute onset of a generalized maculopapular rash and potential exposure to the virus).&nbsp; Rubella-specific IgM serology is the initial diagnostic test.&nbsp; If IgM is initially negative, repeat testing should be performed 2-4 weeks later in highly suspicious cases.&nbsp; Real-time reverse transcriptase–PCR may be performed, but results are most accurate when the specimen is obtained within 3 days of rash onset.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for rubella includes other types of infectious exanthems, such as:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Measles</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L39293.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Measles presents with a maculopapular rash that can also spread cephalocaudally.&nbsp; After a few days, the rash coalesces and darkens.&nbsp; Patients are generally ill-appearing with high fever, cough, and coryza.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Parvovirus B19 infection</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10732.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; This virus can cause erythema infectiosum, which presents with prodromal symptoms (eg, fever, rhinorrhea) followed by an erythematous malar rash (ie, slapped cheeks) and a reticular rash on the body.&nbsp; The rash typically does not appear until prodromal symptoms have resolved.&nbsp; In addition, palatal lesions (eg, Forchheimer spots) and posterior auricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy are not typical.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Scarlet fever</strong>:&nbsp; Presenting with fever, palatal petechiae, and a fine papular rash, scarlet fever is due to streptococcal infection.&nbsp; The rash usually begins and is most prominent along skinfolds (eg, axillae, groin) and then spreads to the trunk and extremities.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Roseola</strong>:&nbsp; Caused by human herpesvirus 6, roseola causes high fever followed by a diffuse, maculopapular rash that appears as the fever subsides.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The management of rubella is supportive, including antipyretics, analgesics, and hydration.&nbsp; The course of illness is generally self-limited with a favorable prognosis.&nbsp; Most patients recover completely, although reinfection can occur.&nbsp; All confirmed cases of rubella should be reported to the local health department for detection of potential outbreaks.</p>\n<h1>Special consideration: congenital rubella syndrome</h1><br><br><p>Congenital rubella infection (transplacental transmission of the virus from mother to fetus) can lead to a spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from miscarriage to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) with varying severity (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/73677.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In addition to nonspecific findings of congenital infection (eg, symmetric growth restriction, hepatosplenomegaly), early manifestations of CRS include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Bilateral <strong>sensorineural hearing loss</strong></li>\n\t<li>Congenital heart disease (eg, <strong>patent ductus arteriosus</strong>, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis)</li>\n\t<li>Ocular involvement (eg, <strong>cataracts</strong>, glaucoma, pigmented retinopathy)</li>\n\t<li>CNS involvement (eg, microcephaly, meningoencephalitis).</li>\n\t<li>Purpuric lesions (nonblanching blue/purple nodules) described as a <strong>blueberry muffin rash</strong></li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Infection during the first trimester is particularly threatening and results in the most severe phenotypes because it occurs during organogenesis, and the mother is often asymptomatic.&nbsp; The diagnosis is confirmed with rubella-specific IgM serology, PCR, or viral culture using specimens from neonates.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>In general, rubella is a <strong>self-limited viral illness</strong> with a favorable prognosis.&nbsp; However, the virus is particularly threatening to fetuses and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; Therefore, the goal of rubella vaccination is to prevent congenital rubella syndrome.&nbsp; The rubella vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine available only as part of the <strong>measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine</strong>.&nbsp; The vaccine is highly effective with a seroconversion rate of approximately 95% after a single dose.&nbsp; Vaccination is the best method for preventing congenital rubella syndrome.&nbsp; The vaccine should be given prior to conception; because it is a live virus, MMR is contraindicated during pregnancy.&nbsp; All pregnant women are screened for immunity (ie, rubella-specific IgG serology), and all nonimmune women should be vaccinated postpartum.</p><br><br><p>Because the rubella virus can be spread via droplets, proper precautions should be taken to avoid further spread, especially to those who may be pregnant.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Rubella (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/36473.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a vaccine-preventable viral illness caused by the rubella virus.&nbsp;
