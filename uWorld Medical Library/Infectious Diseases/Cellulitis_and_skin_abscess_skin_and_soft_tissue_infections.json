Both conditions can generally be treated effectively (eg, antibiotics, incision and drainage), but early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to preventing complications.</p>\n<h1>Microbiology</h1><br><br><p>SSTIs are typically divided into 2 types (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/36887.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p>\n<h2>Nonpurulent cellulitis</h2><br><br><p>Nonpurulent cellulitis is characterized by skin warmth, edema, and erythema with no fluctuant nodules.&nbsp; It is most often caused by beta-hemolytic <strong>streptococci</strong> (groups A, B, C, G, and F); group A <em>Streptococcus</em> (<em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>) accounts for the majority of cases.</p>\n<h2>Purulent SSTI</h2><br><br><p>Purulent SSTI is characterized by a painful, fluctuant nodule in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue with or without surrounding erythema.&nbsp; This includes skin <strong>abscesses</strong>, furuncles (deep infections near hair follicles), and carbuncles (confluences of furuncles).&nbsp; The most common cause is <em><strong>Staphylococcus aureus</strong></em>, which includes both methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains.&nbsp; Strains that express the virulence factor Panton-Valentine leukocidin are particularly likely to cause skin abscesses.</p><br><br><p>MRSA should be suspected in patients with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Recent hospitalization or surgery</li>\n\t<li>History of MRSA infection</li>\n\t<li>Injection drug use</li>\n\t<li>Immunosuppression (eg, neutropenia)</li>\n\t<li>Extensive burns</li>\n\t<li>Evidence of systemic toxicity (eg, fever, hypotension)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Skin abscesses affecting the perioral, perirectal, or vulvovaginal areas often involve polymicrobial infections, including pathogens such as <em>S aureus</em>, <em>S pyogenes</em>, gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes, distinguishing them from typical skin abscesses caused by single pathogens.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Cellulitis arises from bacterial invasion into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, often through a break in the skin barrier.&nbsp; Common routes of entry include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Minor skin trauma (eg, abrasions, insect bites)</li>\n\t<li>Chronic skin conditions (eg, eczema, ulcers)</li>\n\t<li>Surgical wounds</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Following bacterial invasion, the host immune system mounts an inflammatory response characterized by vasodilation, edema, and infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes.&nbsp; These processes contribute to the cardinal signs and symptoms of cellulitis: erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain.</p><br><br><p>Similar to cellulitis, skin abscesses arise from bacterial invasion through a break in the skin.&nbsp; However, in an abscess, the body attempts to wall off the infection by creating a localized collection of pus, which consists of dead white blood cells, bacteria, and tissue debris.&nbsp; This localized pocket prevents the infection from spreading farther but typically requires drainage to resolve completely.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Most cases of cellulitis are driven by <strong>disruptions to the skin barrier</strong> due to minor trauma, lymphedema, or dermatophytic (eg, tinea pedis) infection, all of which provide a portal of entry for bacteria.&nbsp; Immunosuppression (eg, diabetes mellitus, HIV), skin barrier disruption (eg, dry skin, chronic inflammation), and chronic edema (eg, chronic venous insufficiency, lymphedema) are all risk factors (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/52178.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Risk for abscess is increased in those with skin inflammation (eg, atopic dermatitis), trauma, or edema (due to impaired lymphatic drainage or venous insufficiency).<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The classic presentation of <strong>cellulitis</strong> is typically unilateral and includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Erythema:</strong>&nbsp; redness of the skin, often described as spreading and poorly demarcated</li>\n\t<li><strong>Warmth:</strong>&nbsp; affected area that feels warm to the touch compared to surrounding skin</li>\n\t<li><strong>Swelling:</strong>&nbsp; edema due to fluid accumulation within the tissues</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pain:</strong>&nbsp; involved area that may be tender or painful to touch</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The course tends to be gradual and indolent.&nbsp; In some cases, fever (typically, later in the course), malaise, and nausea may occur; regional lymphangitis/lymphadenitis may be present.</p><br><br><p>A skin <strong>abscess</strong> often presents as a localized, red, tender, and swollen area with a central point (fluctuance) that may be pus-filled.&nbsp; Surrounding skin may be red and inflamed; regional lymphadenopathy may be present.&nbsp; Systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise can occur with larger abscesses.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis is primarily <strong>clinical</strong>, based on the characteristic presentation.&nbsp; However, in some cases (eg, signs of systemic toxicity, immunosuppression), other studies may be helpful.&nbsp; Laboratory studies often show leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, a characteristic of most acute bacterial infections.&nbsp; Blood cultures (positive in &lt;10% of cases) may be useful in identifying the pathogen.&nbsp; In systemically ill patients, obtaining markers of inflammation (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and sepsis (eg, lactic acid level) may be warranted.</p><br><br><p>Imaging studies are not routinely used in diagnosing uncomplicated cellulitis or simple abscesses but may be helpful in more complicated cases:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Ultrasonography:</strong>&nbsp; can be used to differentiate cellulitis from a deep abscess or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</li>\n\t<li><strong>CT/MRI:</strong>&nbsp; may be used in rare cases to assess for deeper soft tissue involvement, particularly if there is concern for necrotizing fasciitis (although management should not be delayed for imaging)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The mainstay of treatment for cellulitis is antibiotics.&nbsp; The choice of antibiotic depends on the suspected causative organism and local resistance patterns.</p>\n<h2>Nonpurulent cellulitis</h2><br><br><p>Many cases of nonpurulent cellulitis can be managed with oral <strong>antibiotics</strong>.&nbsp; For typical cases involving streptococci or MSSA, first-line therapy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84658.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) options include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Dicloxacillin</li>\n\t<li>Cephalexin</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>For cases at high risk of MRSA, first-line therapy options (which target both <em>Streptococcus</em> and MRSA) include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</li>\n\t<li>Amoxicillin plus doxycycline</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In contrast, parenteral antibiotics should be considered for those with systemic signs of infection, rapidly progressive symptoms, persistent symptoms after 48 hours of oral antibiotics, or an inability to tolerate oral therapy.&nbsp; Possible parental antibiotic options in immunocompetent adults due to streptococci or MSSA and no evidence of sepsis include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cefazolin</li>\n\t<li>Nafcillin</li>\n\t<li>Vancomycin (if MRSA is suspected or if there is a beta-lactam allergy)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Immunocompromised patients or those with more severe infections (eg, sepsis) should receive cefepime in addition to vancomycin.</p><br><br><p>Patients can transition to oral therapy once there is clinical improvement and no evidence of sepsis.&nbsp; Treatment duration typically ranges from 5-10 days.</p>\n<h2>Abscess</h2><br><br><p>The majority of abscesses should be treated with <strong>incision and drainage</strong>.&nbsp; Occasionally, small, self-draining abscesses may resolve without incision and drainage.&nbsp; Routine cultures of debrided material are not necessary in simple abscesses but may be indicated in patients with severe infections; recurrent, resistant, or multiple abscesses; and high-risk comorbid conditions (lymphedema, malignancy, neutropenia).</p><br><br><p>Empiric antibiotics are typically unnecessary in healthy patients with small abscesses and no surrounding cellulitis but should be considered for patients with abscesses ≥2 cm, extensive surrounding cellulitis, systemic signs of infection, neutropenia, or multiple abscesses.&nbsp; Empiric therapy for abscesses should cover MRSA.&nbsp; Oral options include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</li>\n\t<li>Doxycycline or minocycline</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Similar to cellulitis, parenteral antibiotics (eg, vancomycin plus cefepime) should be considered for those with more severe infections.</p>\n<h2>Special epidemiologic circumstances</h2><br><br><p>Antibiotic selection may need adjustment in specific circumstances that may involve uncommon organisms such as infection that follows a mammalian bite, is caused by water or soil, and occurs in immunocompromised patients (eg, neutropenia), as summarized in the table (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/118461.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Adjunctive measures</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Elevation:&nbsp;

indicated as a preventative measure in patients with recurrent cellulitis of the lower extremities in the setting of chronic lower extremity venous insufficiency or lymphedema.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>While most cases of cellulitis respond well to antibiotics and abscesses typically resolve with incision and drainage, there can be potential complications if left untreated or if the infection spreads to deeper tissues.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Bacteremia/sepsis:</strong>&nbsp; Spread of the infection to the bloodstream can lead to bacteremia and sepsis (with the potential for infective endocarditis).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lymphangitis:</strong>&nbsp; Inflammation of the lymphatic vessels can occur with cellulitis, which can lead to swelling, warmth, and pain along the affected vessel (which may appear as red streaking), as well as bacteremia and sepsis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Septic thrombophlebitis:</strong>&nbsp; Inflammation of a vein caused by an adjacent bacterial infection can lead to clot formation within the vein, causing localized pain, swelling, and redness.&nbsp; Moreover, septic emboli resulting from this condition can lead to various complications such as osteomyelitis, septic joint, and septic pulmonary embolism.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Osteomyelitis/septic arthritis:</strong>&nbsp; Bone and joint infections can occur when bacterial infections spread and involve these structures, leading to substantial morbidity.&nbsp; Complications may include long-term disability or systemic spread of infection if not promptly treated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for cellulitis and abscesses is generally good with prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment.&nbsp; Most uncomplicated infections resolve within a week with antibiotics.&nbsp; Early recognition and intervention are crucial to preventing complications.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Several conditions (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/80746.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) can mimic cellulitis and require careful differentiation to ensure appropriate management.<p></p>\n<h2>Other SSTIs</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Erysipelas:</strong>&nbsp;

Nonpurulent cellulitis is an acute, diffuse infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, most commonly caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci.&nbsp; It presents with redness, swelling, warmth, and pain in the affected area and is usually treated with oral antibiotics.&nbsp; Abscesses are localized collections of pus resulting from bacterial infections, most commonly <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.&nbsp; They appear as painful, swollen, and fluctuating masses and can be accompanied by systemic symptoms.&nbsp; Treatment generally involves incision and drainage, with antibiotic therapy added based on factors such as abscess size, location, and the patient's overall health.&nbsp; Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial for effective treatment and prevention of complications.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
