Clinical presentation varies based on the location of spore entry.&nbsp; Anthrax is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates and remains a public health concern due to its potential use as a biological weapon.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology</h1><br><br><p><em>B anthracis</em> is endemic to agricultural areas in sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, Central and Southwest Asia, and Eastern Europe.&nbsp; Although outbreaks occur in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, anthrax is rare in these areas due to effective animal vaccination programs and strict agricultural regulations.&nbsp; Globally, anthrax remains a significant concern due to its potential use for bioterrorism.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p><em>B anthracis</em> is a <strong>spore-forming, aerobic, gram-positive bacteria</strong> that mainly affects herbivores (eg, sheep, cows) that graze on contaminated vegetation or soil.&nbsp; Spores can remain viable in the soil for decades.&nbsp; On entry into the nutrient-rich tissue of a host, the spores germinate into vegetative rods with 2 main virulence factors:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A polypeptide capsule that inhibits phagocytosis, allowing the bacteria to proliferate and spread.</li>\n\t<li>A trimeric exotoxin composed of protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor that causes edema and cell death.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Protective antigen:&nbsp; Protective antigen binds to a host cell membrane receptor on macrophages and forms a channel that facilitates the entry of edema factor and lethal factor into cells.</li>\n\t\t<li>Edema factor:&nbsp; Edema factor increases intracellular cyclic AMP, causing the accumulation of fluid within/between cells and the suppression of neutrophil and macrophage function.</li>\n\t\t<li>Lethal factor:&nbsp; Lethal factor disrupts cellular signal transduction, leading to cell death.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Transmission to humans can occur from inhalation, ingestion, or cutaneous inoculation of <em>B anthracis</em> spores.&nbsp; This typically occurs during contact with infected animals or animal products (eg, hides, wool), although bioterrorism is another potential source.&nbsp; Human-to-human transmission has not been reported.</p><br><br><p>The pathophysiology of anthrax infection differs based on the route of infection.&nbsp; There are 3 main conditions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Inhalational anthrax</strong>:&nbsp; Aerosolized spore-containing particles (eg, animal hair, bioweapons) are inhaled.&nbsp; Spores are deposited into the alveoli and then carried to the mediastinal lymph nodes by macrophages and dendritic cells.&nbsp; The spores germinate and begin releasing toxins, which cause hemorrhagic necrosis of the lymph nodes, hemorrhagic mediastinitis, pleural effusions, and, often, bacteriemia.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gastrointestinal anthrax</strong>:&nbsp; Spores enter the gastrointestinal tract after consuming undercooked meat from infected animals.&nbsp; Toxins cause mucosal ulcerations within the gastrointestinal epithelium, which can result in gastrointestinal hemorrhage.&nbsp; Transport of the organism to the mesenteric lymph nodes can lead to hemorrhagic adenitis, ascites, and sepsis.&nbsp; Anthrax may also cause necrotic lesions within the oropharynx, resulting in throat/neck pain, cervical lymphadenopathy, neck swelling, and airway compromise, which can be fatal.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cutaneous anthrax</strong>:&nbsp; Spores enter subcutaneous tissue via open wounds (eg, abrasions, insect bites) or by invading hair follicles on contact.&nbsp; The production of exotoxin leads to localized tissue necrosis with surrounding edema.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Regardless of the portal of entry, if untreated, <em>B anthracis</em> can spread rapidly throughout the body, leading to disseminated disease (eg, sepsis, meningitis).&nbsp; Anthrax meningitis develops in about half of inhalational anthrax cases and is almost always fatal.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The main risk factors for anthrax infection include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Occupations, such as farming or veterinary work, that involve the handling of animals or animal products (eg, wool, hides, bone meal).</li>\n\t<li>Exposure to soil contaminated with <em>B anthracis</em> spores.</li>\n\t<li>Ingestion of undercooked meat from infected animals.</li>\n\t<li>Bioterrorism involving the intentional release of anthrax spores in aerosols.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The clinical findings vary based on the route of spore entry.</p>\n<h2>Inhalational anthrax</h2><br><br><p>Inhalational anthrax is the most dangerous form of anthrax and is often fatal.&nbsp; It begins with a nonspecific <strong>prodrome</strong> of flu-like symptoms, including <strong>fever, cough</strong>, nausea, myalgia, and fatigue.&nbsp; It rapidly progresses to fulminant disease with severe dyspnea, stridor, <strong>hypoxemia</strong>, and <strong>shock</strong>.&nbsp; Mediastinal widening (due to <strong>hemorrhagic mediastinitis</strong>) is a characteristic finding on chest x-ray.</p>\n<h2>Gastrointestinal anthrax</h2><br><br><p>Common symptoms of gastrointestinal anthrax include <strong>nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain</strong>, and, possibly, bloody diarrhea or hematemesis.&nbsp; Severe cases may result in <strong>ascites</strong>, volume depletion, coagulopathy, and hypotension.&nbsp; Oropharyngeal involvement leads to mucosal ulcers, dysphagia, cervical lymphadenopathy, neck swelling, stridor, and airway compromise.</p>\n<h2>Cutaneous anthrax</h2><br><br><p>Cutaneous anthrax begins as a <strong>painless, pruritic papule</strong>, typically on the face, neck, or upper extremities (exposed areas), that rapidly enlarges and ulcerates, resulting in a <strong>black eschar</strong>.&nbsp; Edema is often prominent around the ulceration and regional lymphadenopathy may be present.&nbsp; Systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and malaise may occur but are uncommon.&nbsp; Most patients recover with treatment.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for anthrax varies based on inhalational, gastrointestinal, or cutaneous infection and may include the following.</p>\n<h2>Inhalational anthrax</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pneumonia</strong>:&nbsp; Patients typically have cough, fever, and dyspnea, but mediastinal widening on chest x-ray is unlikely.&nbsp; Rapid decompensation to hypoxic respiratory failure and hemodynamic collapse is more consistent with anthrax.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pulmonary tuberculosis</strong>:&nbsp; Characterized by progressively worsening cough, dyspnea, weight loss, and night sweats, tuberculosis has a more gradual course, and the rapid onset of respiratory failure and shock is not typical.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gastrointestinal anthrax</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Bacterial gastroenteritis</strong>:&nbsp; A common condition, bacterial gastroenteritis presents with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.&nbsp; Although fever and bloody stools may occur with certain organisms (eg, <em>Shigella</em>), the development of significant gastrointestinal bleeding (eg, hematemesis), massive ascites, or severe sepsis is uncommon.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Peptic ulcer disease</strong>:&nbsp; Peptic ulcer disease may cause nausea, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal bleeding.&nbsp; However, the pain is often worse with eating, and patients have risk factors, including frequent use of alcohol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cutaneous anthrax</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Brown recluse spider bites</strong>:&nbsp; Typically sustained indoors (eg, attics, garages), brown recluse bites result in an erythematous plaque or papule that can develop a necrotic center over several days.&nbsp; However, severe pain often evolves rapidly (within hours) after this spider's bite, whereas cutaneous anthrax is usually painless.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cellulitis</strong>:&nbsp; An infection of the dermis and subcutaneous fat, cellulitis causes erythema and warmth of the affected skin; regional lymphadenopathy may also be present.&nbsp; Papular, necrotic lesions are not typical, and pain is often a predominant symptom.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Anthrax is an uncommon infection that requires a high index of clinical suspicion.&nbsp; It should be considered in patients with characteristic clinical syndromes, such as a necrotic skin lesion or a rapidly progressive respiratory illness with mediastinal widening on x-ray, particularly when there is a relevant risk factor or exposure history.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Several laboratory tests can be used to make the diagnosis of anthrax:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Gram stain and culture</strong>:&nbsp; Growth of <em>B anthracis</em> from blood samples, respiratory fluid/aspirates, swab wounds, stool, or cerebrospinal fluid (if meningitis is suspected) confirms the diagnosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Polymerase chain reaction</strong> (PCR):&nbsp; <em>B anthracis</em> DNA in blood/fluid samples allows for rapid and specific detection by PCR.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Direct fluorescent antibody test</strong>:&nbsp; Fluorescent-labeled antibodies bind and highlight <em>B anthracis</em> bacterial antigens.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Serology</strong>:&nbsp; Antibodies to anthrax toxins or capsules are detected by serologic evaluation.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In patients with symptoms of inhalational anthrax, gastrointestinal anthrax, anthrax meningitis, or disseminated disease (eg, hypotension, tachycardia), the general laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and coagulation studies.&nbsp; A lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid evaluation is indicated if meningitis is suspected (eg, headache, confusion, meningeal signs).</p>\n<h2>Imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Evidence of anthrax infection may be identified using imaging studies.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest</strong>:&nbsp; These imaging modalities may reveal mediastinal widening, pleural effusion, and hilar lymphadenopathy in patients with inhalational anthrax.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Abdominal imaging</strong>:&nbsp; Thickened bowel loops and free fluid can be seen in gastrointestinal anthrax.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Suspected or confirmed cases of anthrax should be reported to the local authorities due to concerns about bioterrorism.</p><br><br><p>The management of anthrax varies somewhat based on the organs affected and the severity of the infection.&nbsp; Inhalational anthrax, gastrointestinal anthrax, anthrax meningitis, and anthrax bacteremia/sepsis are considered systemic anthrax infections and require more aggressive treatment.</p>\n<h2>Systemic anthrax</h2><br><br><p>Patients with symptoms of inhalational anthrax, gastrointestinal anthrax, anthrax meningitis, and sepsis are managed with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Urgent empiric antibiotics</strong>:&nbsp; A multidrug combination of 2 bactericidal medications from different classes (eg, meropenem and ciprofloxacin) and a protein synthesis inhibitor&nbsp; (eg, doxycycline) are recommended.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antitoxins</strong>:&nbsp; The monoclonal antibodies raxibacumab and obiltoxaximab neutralize anthrax toxins and are most effective when used early in the disease course.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Supportive care</strong>:&nbsp; Interventions for critically ill patients may include intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, fluids and vasopressors for shock, and blood transfusion for hemorrhage or coagulopathy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cutaneous anthrax</h2><br><br><p>Patients with isolated cutaneous anthrax (eg, no meningitis) can be managed with single <strong>antibiotic therapy</strong> (eg, doxycycline, minocycline, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin).</p>\n<h2>Postexposure prophylaxis</h2><br><br><p>Prophylaxis is essential for preventing infection after a potential exposure to anthrax.&nbsp; The recommended regimen includes antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline and anthrax vaccination (3-vaccine series).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of anthrax is largely dependent on the site of infection and time to antibiotic treatment:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Inhalational anthrax</strong>:&nbsp; Most cases of inhalational anthrax are fatal.&nbsp; Even with early diagnosis and treatment, the mortality rate often exceeds 50%.&nbsp; Patients typically present with fulminant infection, which has a mortality rate &gt;90%.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gastrointestinal anthrax</strong>:&nbsp; The mortality rate may be &gt;40%-50%, depending on early diagnosis.&nbsp; Patients with peritonitis or sepsis at presentation have worse outcomes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cutaneous anthrax</strong>:&nbsp; With early antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate from cutaneous anthrax is typically &lt;2% but may be up to 20% if the condition is untreated.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anthrax meningitis</strong>:&nbsp; Regardless of treatment, anthrax that disseminates to cause meningitis is almost always fatal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>An anthrax vaccine for preexposure prophylaxis is available for high-risk populations, such as those who work directly with the anthrax organism (eg, laboratory personnel), have occupational exposure to animals (eg, veterinarian) or animal products (eg, those in the fur trade), or are active military in high-risk areas.&nbsp; It is not currently recommended for the general population.</p><br><br><p>Emergency preparedness for bioterrorism is an important aspect of anthrax prevention.&nbsp; Preparedness includes the creation of rapid response protocols and the stockpiling of vaccines and antitoxins in case of an attack.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Anthrax is a potentially fatal infection that typically affects herbivorous animals.&nbsp; Human infection can occur through inhalation and ingestion or cutaneous exposure to <em>Bacillus anthracis</em> spores.&nbsp; The clinical presentation varies based on the portal of spore entry and may involve a necrotic skin lesion, a serious pulmonary or gastrointestinal illness, or bacteremia with fulminant septic shock.&nbsp; Treatment involves empiric antibiotics, which can improve outcomes, especially for cutaneous anthrax, but mortality is often high.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
