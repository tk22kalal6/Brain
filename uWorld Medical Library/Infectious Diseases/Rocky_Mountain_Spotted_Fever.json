Cases occur in North and Central America and portions of South America (eg, Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia).&nbsp; The transmitting tick vector varies by region.&nbsp; Common infected species include <em>Dermacentor variabilis</em> (American dog tick), <em>Dermacentor andersoni</em> (Rocky Mountain wood tick), and <em>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</em> (common brown dog tick).&nbsp; <em>R rickettsii</em> attacks the vascular endothelium and can cause severe (fulminant) infections in as little as 5 days.&nbsp; Therefore, prompt recognition and initiation of antimicrobial treatment is required to reduce the risk for complications and death.</p><h1>Pathophysiology</h1><p><em>R rickettsii</em> is transmitted from the salivary glands of infected ticks within 6-10 hours of attachment.&nbsp; The pathogen targets host vascular endothelial cells, entering the cells via endocytosis and using hemolysins to pierce the phagosome membrane.&nbsp; Once in the cytoplasm, <em>R rickettsii</em> proliferates and spreads to adjacent endothelial cells using filopodia, causing progressive lymphohistiocytic vasculitis.</p><p>Manifestations of RMSF arise due to endothelial denudation, which causes the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Microhemorrhages</strong>, leading to increased vascular permeability, edema, and inflammation.&nbsp; This can result in shock and multiorgan dysfunction.</li><li><strong>Activation of the coagulation cascade</strong>, leading to a procoagulant state.&nbsp; Disseminated intravascular coagulation is uncommon in RMSF, but microvascular thrombosis can occur.</li></ul><h1>Risk factors</h1><p>Key risk factors include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Tick exposure:</strong>&nbsp; Nearly all cases of RMSF are caused by exposure to an infected tick.&nbsp; Risk is particularly high for those who live in endemic areas where exposure to dogs is common.&nbsp; Living near wooded areas or in areas with tall grass also increases risk.&nbsp; Although less common, cases occasionally occur in urban areas (eg, New York City).</li><li><strong>Geographic location:</strong>&nbsp; Incidence is greatest in the southeastern (eg, North Carolina, Tennessee) and south-central (eg, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri) United States.</li><li><strong>Season:</strong>&nbsp; Most infections occur in the spring and early summer, coinciding with peak tick activity in these regions.</li><li><strong>Delayed tick removal:</strong>&nbsp; The longer a tick remains attached, the greater the risk for transmission and severe disease.</li><li><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp; Incidence increases with age.</li></ul><h1>Pathology</h1><p>RMSF causes a progressive endothelial infection that primarily affects small and medium-sized blood vessels.&nbsp; The lesions are characterized by acute, focal necrosis; fibrin extravasation; perivascular mononuclear infiltrates; and, occasionally, small vessel thrombosis.</p><h1>Clinical presentation</h1><p>RMSF classically causes fever, headache, and rash.&nbsp; Skin manifestations are present in &lt;15% of patients at presentation.</p><p>Most cases come to clinical attention 5-7 days after transmission, when patients have severe nonspecific symptoms that may include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Fever</strong> that often exceeds 39 C (102.2 F)</li><li><strong>Headache</strong> that may be severe and associated with photophobia</li><li>Nausea/vomiting that may be associated with significant abdominal pain (abdominal pain is particularly common in children and may be severe enough to be confused with acute appendicitis)</li><li>Diffuse myalgias</li></ul><p>The hallmark <strong>rash</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L100470.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) occurs in approximately 90% of cases.&nbsp; It usually develops 3-5 days after initial symptoms and is marked by blanching, erythematous macules on the ankles and wrists that spread to the trunk over a few days <strong>(centripetally)</strong>.&nbsp; The rash often becomes <strong>petechial</strong> over time and eventually <strong>includes the palms and soles</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85816.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><p>As the disease progresses, organ dysfunction can occur in the brain (eg, seizure, confusion, focal neurologic signs), eyes (eg, conjunctivitis, retinal abnormalities), cardiovascular system (eg, arrhythmia, shock), and gastrointestinal tract (eg, bleeding).&nbsp; The most common cause of death from RMSF is noncardiac pulmonary edema.</p><h1>Diagnosis</h1><p>A presumptive diagnosis of RMSF is made based on clinical manifestations and exposure to an endemic area.&nbsp; Patients may or may not recall a tick bite (up to one-third of infected individuals do not recall tick attachment).&nbsp; Because most cases present with nonspecific manifestations (prior to rash), the illness may be initially mistaken for a viral syndrome.&nbsp; Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required when a patient has a febrile illness in the spring or summer months and a history of exposure to an area where RMSF tick vectors are common.&nbsp; Prompt diagnosis is crucial because early initiation of empiric antibiotics limits morbidity and mortality.</p><h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><p>Patients often have a normal complete blood count at presentation, but thrombocytopenia is common as the disease progresses due to platelet consumption in areas of endothelial injury.&nbsp; Patients may also have low fibrinogen and elevated fibrin split products, but disseminated intravascular coagulation is rare.&nbsp; Hyponatremia can occur in patients with severe disease due to the release of antidiuretic hormone in response to hypovolemia and impaired tissue perfusion.&nbsp; Prolonged PT/PTT, azotemia, and elevated serum aminotransferases and bilirubin can also be seen.&nbsp; Hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis can cause renal insufficiency.</p><p>Serologic results are rarely available at the time of initial diagnosis.&nbsp; Therefore, the clinical diagnosis is usually <em>retrospectively confirmed</em> with serologic testing.&nbsp; Common tests include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA):</strong>&nbsp; A set of serum IgM and IgG antibody titers are drawn 7-10 days and 14-21 days after symptom onset.&nbsp; A fourfold increase in IgG titers is considered a positive IFA.&nbsp; Serum antibody levels may be falsely negative the first 5 days of illness.</li><li><strong>PCR:</strong>&nbsp; PCR testing can be done on tissue (eg, skin biopsy of rash) or blood.&nbsp; Because of low levels of circulating <em>R rickettsii</em> organisms in the blood during infection, blood-based PCR has low sensitivity; however, it has high specificity.</li><li><strong>Skin biopsy:</strong>&nbsp; Direct immunofluorescence testing or immunoperoxidase staining of a skin biopsy from an area of rash can provide rapid diagnosis.&nbsp; Sensitivity is as high as 90% if biopsy is taken before or within 12 hours of antibiotic administration.</li></ul><h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><p>Patients usually present with a viral-like syndrome.&nbsp; As the illness progresses, nonspecific symptoms become increasingly severe and the characteristic rash usually develops.&nbsp; Diagnosis can be difficult, particularly when patients do not recall tick bite, because these symptoms overlap with a wide range of conditions, including the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Meningococcemia:</strong>&nbsp; Fever, rash, and headache are key symptoms of meningococcal meningitis.&nbsp; Thrombocytopenia and petechial rash are also frequently present, but meningococcemia progresses very rapidly (within 24 hr) and rash usually occurs within hours of symptom onset.&nbsp; Lumbar puncture and blood cultures can often distinguish meningococcemia from RMSF, but patients may initially require coverage for both RMSF and meningococcal meningitis until testing is completed.</li><li><strong>Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis:</strong>&nbsp; These tick-borne illnesses have very similar clinical features to RMSF, but rash is less common and leukopenia may be present.&nbsp; Clinical diagnosis cannot typically distinguish between these illnesses, but first-line RMSF treatment with doxycycline provides coverage against all 3 pathogens (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/37398.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li><strong>Viral exanthems:</strong>&nbsp; Measles, infectious mononucleosis, primary HIV, rubella, and other viral illnesses often cause fever and rash, but prodromal symptoms and epidemiologic risk factors are typically different.</li><li><strong>Secondary syphilis:</strong>&nbsp; Within a few weeks or months of infection, patients with syphilis develop nonspecific symptoms and a diffuse rash that includes the palms and soles.&nbsp; However, diffuse adenopathy is often present and mucosal lesions may occur.</li></ul><h1>Management</h1><p>Patients with suspected RMSF should be treated without delay to reduce the risk for complications and death.&nbsp; The diagnosis of RMSF should be considered in patients with the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Recent tick bite or exposure to a tick environment (within 14 days)</li><li>Fever <em>plus</em> rash, headache, constitutional symptoms, or characteristic laboratory findings (eg, thrombocytopenia)</li><li>Presentation in the spring or summer months (in Arizona, cases can be seen in the fall)</li></ul><p>Patients with these features should receive empiric therapy with oral or intravenous <strong>doxycycline</strong>.&nbsp; This is the treatment of choice for adults, pregnant women, and children, despite concerns about hepatotoxicity in pregnant mothers (quite rare) and dental staining in the fetus/pediatric patients.&nbsp; Doxycycline is highly lipophilic, which allows it to enter cells easily, making it highly effective against many intracellular organisms (eg, <em>R rickettsii</em>).</p><p>Patients who develop mild adverse effects (eg, nausea, diarrhea) with doxycycline should receive supportive therapy and continue doxycycline treatment.&nbsp; In cases of severe adverse reaction to doxycycline (eg, severe hepatotoxicity), the only known alternative agent is chloramphenicol.&nbsp; Doxycycline should be given for 5-7 days and for at least 3 days after fever subsides.</p><p>Because the initial presentation of RMSF may occasionally resemble meningococcal meningitis, patients may require empiric therapy for both conditions until testing can be performed.</p><h1>Complications</h1><p>RMSF can cause significant morbidity if not treated early.&nbsp; Potential complications include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Central nervous system:</strong>&nbsp; encephalitis, focal neurologic signs</li><li><strong>Ocular:</strong>&nbsp; conjunctivitis, retinal abnormalities, blindness</li><li><strong>Pulmonary:</strong>&nbsp; noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome</li><li><strong>Renal:</strong>&nbsp; acute tubular necrosis, renal failure</li><li><strong>Cardiovascular:</strong>&nbsp; arrhythmia, shock</li><li><strong>Coagulation disorders:</strong>&nbsp; thrombocytopenia, microthrombosis</li></ul><h1>Prognosis</h1><p>The mortality rate for untreated RMSF can be as high as 30% depending on the strain, but antibiotic therapy reduces the risk for death to &lt;1%.&nbsp; Delayed treatment, advanced age, and comorbid conditions are associated with worse outcomes.&nbsp; Most patients with RMSF recover completely, but a minority have long-term sequelae such as peripheral neuropathy, deafness, or hemiparesis.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Rocky Mountain spotted fever (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/37194.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a potentially life-threatening tick-borne illness caused by <em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em>.&nbsp; Symptoms usually begin 5-7 days after transmission.&nbsp; Initial manifestations are nonspecific (eg, fever, headache, myalgia, nausea/vomiting).&nbsp; A characteristic rash typically arises on day 3-5 of illness on the wrists and ankles and spreads centripetally.&nbsp; Over time, the rash becomes petechial and involves the palms and soles.&nbsp; The diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is made clinically with retrospective serologic confirmation.&nbsp; Early recognition and treatment with doxycycline are critical to reducing morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; Prognosis is excellent with prompt antibiotic therapy.<p></p></div>\n            "
