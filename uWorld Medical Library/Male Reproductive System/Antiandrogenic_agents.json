These agents are used in diverse clinical contexts, including prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hirsutism, androgenetic alopecia, and gender-affirming hormone therapy for transgender women.<p></p><br><br><p>Antiandrogens can be broadly categorized into GnRH agonists or antagonists, androgen receptor antagonists, androgen synthesis inhibitors, and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24587.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Androgens are synthesized from the precursor cholesterol in the adrenal cortex and in testicular Leydig cells or ovarian theca cells under stimulation by LH from the pituitary gland (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28056.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L124685.png\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In men, the majority of androgens are produced in the testes, whereas in women, most androgens are produced in the adrenal gland and peripheral tissue.<p></p><br><br><p>The testosterone precursors dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate are produced by the adrenal glands and are converted to the more potent androstenedione and testosterone.&nbsp; Testosterone is converted to its more potent form, DHT, by 5-alpha reductase.&nbsp; This occurs predominantly in the skin and liver and in the prostate in men.&nbsp; Androgens exert their effects by binding to the intracellular androgen receptor, which then translocates to the nucleus and modulates gene expression.</p><br><br><p>In men, both testosterone and DHT are essential for fetal sexual differentiation and pubertal development.&nbsp; In adults, testosterone drives muscle mass, libido, spermatogenesis, and sexual function, whereas DHT is predominantly responsible for terminal hair growth, sebaceous gland secretion (acne), and prostate growth.&nbsp; In addition, conditions such as prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia are androgen dependent.&nbsp; Excess androgens can also affect fertility or cause male pattern baldness.</p><br><br><p>In adult women, androgens (predominantly testosterone) play a role in libido, muscle mass, body hair growth, and ovarian function.&nbsp; Androgen excess can be seen in various conditions, such as androgen-secreting ovarian or adrenal tumors, polycystic ovary syndrome, or congenital adrenal hyperplasia.&nbsp; Excess androgens are thought to contribute to female pattern hair loss and hirsutism.&nbsp; Hyperandrogenism can also cause deepening of the voice, clitoromegaly, acne, and menstrual cycle disruption or infertility.</p>\n<h1>General principles of antiandrogen therapy</h1><br><br><p>Antiandrogen therapy may be used long or short term in both sexes.&nbsp; Antiandrogen treatment may be needed for several weeks to months before improvement is noted.&nbsp; It is frequently combined with other treatments (eg, surgery or radiation for tumors) or medications of different classes (eg, topical treatments for acne and hair loss).&nbsp; Common adverse effects of antiandrogens include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increased body fat and loss of lean body mass, thinning of body hair, gynecomastia (ie, breast enlargement in male patients), reduced penile and testicular size.</li>\n\t<li>Metabolic changes (eg, reduced insulin sensitivity, increased cholesterol) and risk of cardiovascular disease with long-term use.</li>\n\t<li>Depression/anxiety.</li>\n\t<li>Sexual dysfunction:&nbsp; Reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced sperm count, infertility.</li>\n\t<li>Risk of feminization of a male fetus if used during pregnancy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>GnRH agonists and antagonists</h1><h2>Mechanism of action</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>GnRH agonists (eg, <strong>leuprolide</strong>):&nbsp; Bind to and stimulate pituitary GnRH receptors, leading to increased production of LH and an initial increase in testicular or ovarian testosterone production (ie, flare).&nbsp; Within several days, pituitary GnRH receptors are downregulated, leading to low LH and decreased testosterone production, which is sustained with continued GnRH agonist administration.</li>\n\t<li>GnRH antagonists (eg, degarelix, relugolix):&nbsp; Bind to and block pituitary GnRH receptors, immediately leading to decreased LH and testosterone secretion (avoids the initial flare with GnRH agonists).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Indications</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Prostate cancer:&nbsp; A GnRH agonist or antagonist is used as the primary component of androgen deprivation therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.</li>\n\t<li>Precocious puberty:&nbsp; GnRH agonists can be used to treat central precocious puberty (puberty due to a rise in gonadotropins from early maturation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis) in both sexes by suppressing pituitary hormones and subsequently reducing androgen and estradiol levels.</li>\n\t<li>Ovarian hyperthecosis:&nbsp; This condition of progressive hyperandrogenism leads to the virilization (ie, clitoromegaly, male pattern hair loss, deepening of the voice) typically seen in postmenopausal women due to increased ovarian production of androgens.</li>\n\t<li>Gender-affirming care:&nbsp; GnRH agonists can be used to suppress androgen production in transgender women and are usually used with estrogen therapy.</li>\n\t<li>Other indications:&nbsp; Because they also reduce estrogens via suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, GnRH agonists and antagonists have multiple other indications, including suppression of uterine fibroid growth and treatment of endometriosis and breast cancer (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L69534.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Adverse effects</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>\"Flare\" prostate cancer symptoms:&nbsp; The initial increase in testosterone levels with GnRH agonist therapy can cause the transient stimulation of growth of prostate cancer cells, worsening bone pain (from bone metastases) or bladder obstruction (from an enlarged prostate).&nbsp; As a result, initiation of GnRH agonists is usually combined with short-term use of androgen receptor antagonists (eg, flutamide) to block the effects of elevated testosterone and prevent flare symptoms.</li>\n\t<li>Bone density:&nbsp; A transient decrease in bone mineral density is observed with prolonged use that resolves with cessation of therapy.</li>\n\t<li>Hot flashes:&nbsp; Hot flashes are a common reason for discontinuation in female patients using GnRH agonists for treatment of uterine fibroids or endometriosis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Androgen receptor antagonists</h1><h2>Mechanism of action</h2><br><br><p>Androgen receptor antagonists competitively inhibit the binding of testosterone and DHT to the androgen receptor, preventing downstream gene transcription.&nbsp; First-generation medications include <strong>flutamide</strong> and bicalutamide.&nbsp; Enzalutamide, darolutamide, and apalutamide are newer-generation androgen receptor antagonists that have improved activity or reduced adverse effects.</p>\n<h2>Indications</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Prostate cancer:&nbsp; Short-term use (eg, bicalutamide, flutamide) helps prevent flare symptoms with the initiation of GnRH agonists.&nbsp; Androgen receptor agonists can also be used in patients with progressive disease despite treatment with a GnRH agonist or antagonist as an additional management component.</li>\n\t<li>Female pattern hair loss and hirsutism:&nbsp; Androgen receptor antagonists are occasionally used for these indications but are not the preferred treatment due to limited efficacy and adverse effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Adverse effects</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Musculoskeletal pain.</li>\n\t<li>Hot flashes.</li>\n\t<li>Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.</li>\n\t<li>Small increased risk of seizures.</li>\n\t<li>Flutamide:&nbsp; Hepatotoxicity and risk of hepatic failure limit its use; routine monitoring of liver function tests is required.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Androgen synthesis inhibitors</h1><h2>Mechanism of action</h2><br><br><p>Androgen synthesis inhibitors (eg, <strong>ketoconazole</strong>, abiraterone) reduce overall androgen production by inhibiting key enzymes in the steroidogenesis pathway.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Ketoconazole:&nbsp; This imidazole antifungal inhibits multiple cytochrome enzymes (eg, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase, 21-hydroxylase) involved in androgen, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid synthesis.</li>\n\t<li>Abiraterone:&nbsp; This medication irreversibly inhibits 17 alpha-hydroxylase (and therefore also interferes with cortisol production) and 17,20-lyase, blocking testicular and adrenal androgen production.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Indications (as an antiandrogen)</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Prostate cancer:&nbsp; Abiraterone or ketoconazole may be used as a component of care for castration-resistant prostate cancer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Adverse effects</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Ketoconazole:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Drug interactions:&nbsp; Ketoconazole inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme, interfering with hepatic metabolism of various medications and altering plasma drug levels.</li>\n\t\t<li>QT-interval prolongation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L3805.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Ketoconazole itself leads to QT-interval prolongation but can also potentiate the effect of other QT-interval–prolonging medications via its effects on their drug metabolism (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/46841.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t\t<li>Adrenal insufficiency:&nbsp; Insufficiency may occur in patients with abnormal pituitary or adrenal function (ie, those unable to compensate for the inhibitory effects of ketoconazole on cortisol synthesis) or in times of increased physiologic stress (eg, surgery, major illness).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Abiraterone:&nbsp; This medication interferes with cortisol synthesis, which can cause increased ACTH secretion and subsequently increased production of mineralocorticoids by the adrenal glands, leading to fluid retention, hypertension, and hypokalemia.&nbsp; Therefore, blood pressure and potassium levels are monitored routinely in patients taking abiraterone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>5-Alpha reductase inhibitors</h1><h2>Mechanism of action</h2><br><br><p><strong>Finasteride</strong> and <strong>dutasteride</strong> reduce DHT levels by inhibiting 5-alpha reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT.&nbsp; These drugs do not interfere with testosterone action at the androgen receptor.</p>\n<h2>Indications</h2><br><br><p>Because they specifically reduce DHT levels, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are used primarily for conditions driven by excess DHT:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L15785.png\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Reduced DHT leads to reduced stimulation of the prostate, reduced prostate size, and improved symptoms (eg, urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, hesitancy, slow urinary stream).</li>\n\t<li>Male pattern hair loss:&nbsp; 5-Alpha reductase inhibitors reduce DHT levels and their action on hair follicles, leading to reduced hair loss and improved hair growth.&nbsp; The effect is temporary, and hair loss resumes with cessation of treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Adverse effects</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Prostate cancer risk and detection:&nbsp; 5-Alpha reductase inhibitors significantly reduce the serum PSA level, which is used to screen for prostate cancer.&nbsp; Therefore, PSA levels should be checked before treatment and after initiation to establish a new baseline.&nbsp; The overall risk of prostate cancer is reduced with the use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, but the risk of high-grade prostate cancers may be increased.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Spironolactone</h1><h2>Mechanism of action</h2><br><br><p>Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic (aldosterone receptor antagonist) that has antiandrogen properties due to multiple mechanisms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Androgen receptor antagonist.</li>\n\t<li>Weak inhibitor of synthesis of testosterone (inhibits 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) and DHT (inhibits 5-alpha reductase).</li>\n\t<li>Increase in sex hormone–binding globulin (binds testosterone in the circulation, preventing it from entering cells and exerting its effect).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Indications (as an antiandrogen)</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Acne (in postmenarchal female patients):&nbsp; Spironolactone reduces androgen-driven production of sebum, which contributes to the obstruction of pilosebaceous follicles.</li>\n\t<li>Hirsutism:&nbsp; Spironolactone is the preferred antiandrogen for the treatment of hirsutism and is usually used with combined hormonal contraceptives.&nbsp; Spironolactone is frequently used in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome due to its beneficial effects on hirsutism and acne.</li>\n\t<li>Gender-affirming care:&nbsp; Spironolactone is the first-line antiandrogen for transgender women, usually used in combination with estrogen therapy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Adverse effects</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Menstrual irregularities.</li>\n\t<li>Breast pain.</li>\n\t<li>Orthostatic hypotension.</li>\n\t<li>Hyperkalemia:&nbsp; Spironolactone blocks aldosterone action at the collecting duct, causing potassium retention and subsequent hyperkalemia (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16602.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Potassium level monitoring is required after initiating treatment and with any dose adjustments and is typically monitored intermittently in patients with increased risk (eg, cardiac or renal conditions, other medications that affect potassium balance [eg, ACE inhibitors, drospirenone]).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Antiandrogens inhibit the action of testosterone and/or dihydrotestosterone.&nbsp; They are generally classified by their mechanism of action as GnRH agonists or antagonists, androgen receptor antagonists, androgen synthesis inhibitors, or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
