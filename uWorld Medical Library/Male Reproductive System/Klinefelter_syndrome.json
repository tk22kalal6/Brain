Neuropsychologic conditions (eg, learning disabilities) and infertility are common.</p>\n<h1>Genetics</h1><br><br><p>Klinefelter syndrome, the most common cause of <strong>primary hypogonadism</strong> in males, is due to meiotic nondisjunction (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L9565.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Improper separation of homologous X chromosomes (ie, sister chromatids) from either parent results in some gametes with an extra X chromosome, resulting in a zygote with <strong>47,XXY</strong> aneuploidy.<p></p><br><br><p>Normally, one X chromosome in somatic cells in an individual with 2 X chromosomes undergoes X-inactivation, with a few genes that are still expressed (escape inactivation).&nbsp; The extra X chromosome in those with Klinefelter syndrome results in an overexpression of genes that escape X-inactivation.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The overexpressed genes in patients with Klinefelter syndrome primarily affect testicular development and sex hormone production.&nbsp; Patients typically have <strong>atrophied, hyalinized seminiferous tubules</strong> (causing small testes) and <strong>impaired Sertoli and Leydig cell function</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10036.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Sertoli cells are responsible for sperm production and inhibin B secretion.&nbsp; Klinefelter syndrome typically results in <strong>azoospermia</strong>, although individuals with mosaic variants may have variable degrees of spermatogenesis.&nbsp; A lack of inhibin B feedback regulation increases FSH production.</li>\n\t<li>Leydig cells are responsible for testosterone production.&nbsp; <strong>Low testosterone</strong> causes sparse or absent facial and body hair, and decreased muscle mass.&nbsp; A lack of testosterone feedback inhibition results in elevated FSH and LH, causing increased aromatase activity and an <strong>elevated estrogen/testosterone ratio</strong> (leading to breast tissue growth).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because rising estrogen and testosterone are responsible for growth plate closure, patients typically have tall stature due to delayed growth plate closure.&nbsp; Moreover, patients have an additional <em>SHOX</em> (short stature homeobox) gene, which also likely contributes to tall stature because it is found on both X and Y chromosomes and is essential for linear growth.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Klinefelter syndrome is often diagnosed in adolescence when the characteristic findings become apparent (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L18332.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Tall stature</strong> (with long legs and a reduced upper-to-lower–segment ratio)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Small testes</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Gynecomastia</strong></li>\n</ul><br><br><p>A gynecoid body habitus (eg, adiposity at hips and thighs) is also seen and consistent with the development of hypogonadism prior to puberty.&nbsp; Sparse body hair and decreased muscle mass are also typical.</p><br><br><p>Other associated findings include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Neuropsychologic conditions, including autism, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, language delays, and/or learning disabilities</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infertility</strong> (due to azoospermia)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Characteristic laboratory findings, consistent with male primary hypogonadism, include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Decreased serum testosterone and inhibin B levels</li>\n\t<li>Elevated serum LH and FSH levels (due to loss of feedback inhibition)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Estrogen levels are not routinely obtained but are often elevated, and an increased estrogen/testosterone ratio is typical.&nbsp; Infertility evaluation typically reveals azoospermia.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis is confirmed on <strong>karyotype analysis</strong> by demonstrating a 47,XXY aneuploidy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L5525.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Karyotype analysis from fetal cells obtained via amniocentesis of chorionic villous sampling is diagnostic, but this is typically an incidental finding because there are not consistent prenatal findings suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Other causes of hypogonadism should be considered in male patients with signs of testosterone deficiency (eg, small testes, gynecomastia) or impaired sperm production (due to azoospermia).</p>\n<h2>Primary causes (testicular)</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cryptorchidism</strong>:&nbsp; Bilateral undescended testicles can result in azoospermia, particularly when surgically corrected after early childhood.&nbsp; If untreated, the seminiferous tubules are damaged (resulting in elevated FSH levels), and the interstitial Leydig cells are usually preserved (maintaining normal LH and testosterone levels).&nbsp; Examination differentiates cryptorchidism from other causes of hypogonadism.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gonadal injury</strong> (eg, radiation, infection):&nbsp; Radiation near the testes, the use of alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide), or infection (eg, mumps) can damage the seminiferous tubules, causing azoospermia.&nbsp; Infectious causes are often associated with a history of painful, testicular swelling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Secondary causes (pituitary/hypothalamic)</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Kallmann syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; This condition is also referred to as congenital idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with anosmia and can cause infertility.&nbsp; Loss of smell would be present, and gynecomastia is not typical because gonadotropin deficiency results in low aromatase activity and low estrogen levels.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prader-Willi syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; A loss of paternally derived genes on chromosome 15 can lead to a range of manifestations, including hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and intellectual disability.&nbsp; However, short stature and hyperphagia are expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hypothalamic/pituitary tumor or infiltration</strong>:&nbsp; Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can occur due to craniopharyngioma, hemochromatosis, or injury.&nbsp; Associated neurologic findings (eg, headache, vision changes) due to local tumor growth are common, and, similar to other central causes of hypogonadism, LH and FSH would be low.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anabolic steroid use</strong>:&nbsp; Increased androstenedione due to anabolic steroid use can cause irreversible gynecomastia and testicular atrophy with lowered sperm counts.&nbsp; However, exogenous steroids would also cause acne, male pattern baldness, and increased libido.&nbsp; In addition, hastened epiphyseal closure (reduced height potential) is characteristic with adolescent steroid use, and sparse facial and body hair is not expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Exogenous testosterone use</strong>:&nbsp; High androgen levels suppress LH secretion, decreasing endogenous testosterone production.&nbsp; Despite the high circulating levels of exogenous androgen, patients have a low sperm count because local androgen concentrations in the seminiferous tubule are suboptimal for spermatogenesis.&nbsp; Over time, this leads to atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and soft, small testes.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Additional diagnoses to consider based on presenting features include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Physiologic gynecomastia</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85930.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; This condition is due to the transient estrogen increase relative to testosterone during male puberty and presents as breast enlargement (directly under the nipple-areolar complex).&nbsp; Symptoms typically resolve within a year, and small, firm testes are not an associated finding.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Testicular tumors</strong>:&nbsp; Leydig and Sertoli cell tumors can present with gynecomastia (either from increased estrogen production or conversion of excess testosterone to estrogen by aromatase).&nbsp; A palpable, asymmetric testicular mass would be expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Marfan syndrome</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L104936.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; This inherited connective tissue disorder presents with tall stature and a reduced upper-to-lower–segment ratio.&nbsp; Hypogonadism and gynecomastia are not associated findings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management and complications</h1><br><br><p>Male hypogonadism in Klinefelter syndrome is treated with <strong>testosterone therapy</strong> beginning around the time of puberty, resulting in gradual virilization without early closure of the bony epiphyses.&nbsp; In addition, testosterone can improve libido and erectile function.&nbsp; Complications of Klinefelter syndrome may also be reduced (but not eliminated) with testosterone therapy because an elevated estrogen/androgen ratio contributes to their development:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Breast cancer</strong>:&nbsp; A relative increase in estrogen stimulates proliferation and division of breast cells, increasing risk for malignant transformation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ischemic heart disease</strong> and <strong>venous thromboembolism</strong>:&nbsp; A relative decrease in testosterone can predispose to development of metabolic syndrome and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease; genes for factors VIII and IX are located on the X chromosome and the presence of excess clotting factors may also contribute to a hypercoagulable state.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Osteoporotic fracture</strong>:&nbsp; Reduced testosterone leads to lower bone density due to increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Neuropsychologic support should be provided, particularly when comorbid conditions such as autism or learning disabilities are present.&nbsp; Patients should receive education regarding fertility expectations, although fertility can be achieved in some patients with early treatment and assisted reproductive technologies.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Klinefelter syndrome (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/81120.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is the most common cause of male primary hypogonadism.&nbsp;
