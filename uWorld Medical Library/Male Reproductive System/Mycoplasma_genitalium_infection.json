It is a small, self-replicating organism belonging to the class Mollicutes.&nbsp; Like other types of mycoplasma bacteria (eg, <em>M pneumonia</em>, <em>Ureaplasma urealyticum</em>), <em>M genitalium</em> lacks a cell wall, making it difficult to culture, stain, and treat.&nbsp; Although <em>M genitalium</em> infection is often asymptomatic, it is a common cause of cervicitis in females and nongonococcal urethritis in males.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p><em>M genitalium</em> has a specialized terminal tip-like structure that allows it to attach and adhere to the surfaces of cells.&nbsp; This structure allows the bacterium to move along host surfaces and penetrate into tissues (ie, invasion).&nbsp; After invasion, <em>M genitalium</em> alters the expression of its surface proteins, allowing it to avoid immune detection and persist in the host.&nbsp; Host tissue destruction from the secretion of mycoplasmal toxins leads to the chronic inflammation and tissue damage responsible for most of the clinical disease manifestations.&nbsp; Because the bacterium can form biofilms, which are protective clusters of bacteria encased in a polysaccharide matrix, <em>M genitalium</em> is protected from immune responses and antibiotic treatments, facilitating chronic infection.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The most important risk factor in the spread of <em>M genitalium</em> infection is high-risk <strong>sexual activity</strong>.&nbsp; There is an increased risk of infection with unprotected sexual contact, a new sexual partner, multiple partners, and for men who have sex with men (MSM).&nbsp; In addition, HIV infection or a prior sexually transmitted infection increases the risk for infection.&nbsp; Concurrent infection with other sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, is common and can facilitate the transmission and persistence of <em>M genitalium</em>.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentations</h1><h2>Male urogenital infection</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Urethritis</strong>:&nbsp; A leading cause of nongonococcal urethritis, infection of the urethra by <em>M genitalium</em> is frequently asymptomatic but may cause urethral discharge, pruritus, and dysuria.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prostatitis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85840.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; More common in MSM, infection of the prostate can cause fever, pelvic and perineal pain, dysuria, and obstructive voiding symptoms (eg, hesitancy, dribbling).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Female urogenital infection</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cervicitis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97800.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Cervical infection is most commonly asymptomatic.&nbsp; When symptomatic, patients often have purulent or mucopurulent cervical discharge and intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97801.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; PID is a polymicrobial infection of the upper genital tract (ie, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries).&nbsp; PID causes pelvic or abdominal pain that may be accompanied by fever, abnormal uterine bleeding, and mucopurulent cervical discharge.&nbsp; More severe cases can lead to tuboovarian abscess, Fitz-Hugh and Curtis syndrome (inflammation of the Glisson capsule surrounding the liver), and sepsis.&nbsp; PID leads to scarring of the fallopian tubes and an increased risk for infertility and ectopic pregnancy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Reproductive complications</strong>:&nbsp; Infection can increase the risk of preterm delivery and spontaneous abortion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Extragenital Infection</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Proctitis</strong>:&nbsp; Inflammation of the rectum is more common in MSM, especially those who are HIV-positive.&nbsp; Symptoms include anal itching, discharge, and pain during bowel movements.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The organism does not commonly spread throughout the body, and infections beyond the anogenital area have been reported only in rare cases.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis and laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p><strong>Nucleic acid amplification testing</strong> (NAAT) is the preferred method for diagnosing <em>M genitalium</em>.&nbsp; This is because <em>M genitalium</em> is extremely difficult to grow in the laboratory setting, a process that may take up to 6 months to complete.&nbsp; NAAT bypasses the need for culture, allowing for quicker and more practical diagnosis.&nbsp; Some NAATs also evaluate for antibiotic resistance mutations, especially macrolide resistance, which impacts treatment strategy.</p><br><br><p>In male patients, NAAT can be performed on a first-catch urine specimen or urethral swab.&nbsp; In female patients, NAAT performed on a vaginal or endocervical swab is preferred, but it can also be performed on a first-catch urine specimen.&nbsp; NAAT can also be performed on rectal swabs if indicated by sexual activity or symptoms.&nbsp; Routine panels for sexually transmitted infections often do not include <em>M genitalium</em> unless specifically requested.&nbsp; Therefore, it should be considered in symptomatic patients who test negative for chlamydia and gonorrhea.</p>\n<h1>Treatment</h1><br><br><p>Treatment is complicated by increased antimicrobial resistance, particularly to macrolides and fluoroquinolones.&nbsp; Because <em>M genitalium</em> lacks a cell wall, beta-lactam antibiotics (eg, penicillins, cephalosporins) are ineffective.&nbsp; Furthermore, due to increasing macrolide resistance, 2-stage therapy approaches, ideally using resistance-guided therapy, are recommended for treatment.</p><br><br><p>First-line treatment (if macrolide susceptibility is known) is with a course of oral doxycycline followed by an extended regimen of azithromycin.&nbsp; If macrolide resistance is unknown or if resistance is confirmed, treatment is with a course of doxycycline followed by a course of moxifloxacin.</p><br><br><p>A test of cure is <u>not</u> recommended unless there are persistent symptoms or concerns for unidentified resistance.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>The most effective means of prevention is with safe sex practices (eg, consistent condom use) and expedited partner notification and treatment (to prevent reinfection and further transmission).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>For most uncomplicated infections, prompt treatment usually results in a good prognosis.&nbsp; In female patients, <em>M genitalium</em> infection can lead to PID, which can have permanent consequences such as chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and tubal damage that can predispose to ectopic pregnancy.&nbsp; Serious complications of PID, such as tuboovarian abscess and sepsis, can be fatal.</p><br><br><p>In addition, pregnancies complicated by maternal <em>M genitalium</em> infection are at increased risk for preterm delivery and subsequent complications of prematurity (eg, respiratory distress, cerebral palsy).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p><em>M genitalium</em> is a significant cause of urethritis in men and cervicitis and PID in women.&nbsp; Its small genome and lack of a cell wall make it unique among bacterial pathogens, contributing to its resilience and difficulty in treatment.&nbsp; Due to increasing resistance, especially to macrolides, careful antimicrobial selection guided by susceptibility testing is critical.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
