Most cases occur in young or middle-aged men when colonic flora (eg, <em>Escherichia coli</em>) gain access to the prostate by ascending the urethra.&nbsp; Presenting symptoms include dysuria, urgency, and frequency, along with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, chills) and perineal pain.&nbsp; The diagnosis is generally confirmed when digital rectal examination shows a warm, edematous, and exquisitely tender prostate.<p></p><h1>Risk factors</h1><p>Several factors can increase the likelihood of developing acute bacterial prostatitis:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Urogenital tract infections (eg, cystitis, urethritis):&nbsp; Bacteria migrate from the urethra or bladder into the prostate via urinary reflux.</li><li>Urologic instrumentation (eg, bladder catheterization, cystoscopy):&nbsp; Certain procedures may inadvertently introduce bacteria into the urethra.</li><li>Urinary retention (eg, urethral stricture, benign prostatic hyperplasia):&nbsp; Incomplete bladder emptying and diminished forward flow of urine increase the risk for infection and reflux.</li><li>Unprotected sexual intercourse:&nbsp; This promotes entry of bacteria, including sexually transmitted infections (eg, <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>), into the urethra.&nbsp; It is more common in young men.</li><li>Prostate biopsy/surgery:&nbsp; This may cause inoculation directly into the prostate.</li><li>Immunocompromise (eg, diabetes mellitus, HIV/AIDS):&nbsp; This state increases susceptibility to infection.</li></ul><h1>Pathophysiology</h1><p>Most cases of acute bacterial prostatitis arise when colonic pathogens contaminate the urethra and subsequently enter the sterile prostate via intraprostatic reflux of urine.&nbsp; <em><strong>E coli</strong></em> (a gram-negative bacillus) is the leading pathogen, causing ~75% of cases; other enteric organisms include <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>.</p><p>Gram-positive infections (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococci</em>) are less common and should prompt evaluation for remote infection elsewhere (eg, hematogenous spread from endocarditis).</p><h1>Clinical presentation</h1><p>Patients with acute prostatitis usually experience a combination of lower urinary tract symptoms and systemic symptoms:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Lower urinary tract symptoms</strong><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Dysuria (painful urination)</li><li>Urinary frequency and urgency</li><li>Pelvic, perineal, or lower back pain</li><li>Bladder obstruction/urinary retention:&nbsp; Prostatic swelling can sometimes impinge the urethra and cause difficulty voiding (eg, dribbling); urinary obstruction can lead to renal insufficiency due to increased pressure on the kidney.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Systemic symptoms</strong> include fevers, chills, malaise, and myalgia.</li><li>Digital rectal examination shows a <strong>tender, swollen, and warm prostate</strong>.&nbsp; Rectal examination should be performed with care; vigorous massage can increase the risk for bacteremia.</li></ul><h1>Diagnosis</h1><p>Acute bacterial prostatitis should be suspected in any patient with fever, perineal pain, and lower urinary symptoms.&nbsp; To establish a definitive diagnosis, digital rectal examination is required.&nbsp; The presence of prostatic warmth, edema, and tenderness indicates acute bacterial prostatitis.</p><p>Urinalysis with nitrites, leukocyte esterase, pyuria, and bacteriuria further supports the diagnosis; a urine culture identifies the causative organism.</p><h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Urinary tract infection</strong> (eg, cystitis):&nbsp; dysuria, frequency, and urgency are characteristic, but cystitis is not typically associated with perineal discomfort, fever, or prostate tenderness.</li><li><strong>Epididymitis</strong>:&nbsp; often presents with lower urinary tract symptoms (eg, dysuria, urgency), but patients usually have scrotal pain, swelling, and tenderness as well as a purulent urethral discharge.</li><li><strong>Benign prostatic hyperplasia</strong>:&nbsp; may cause irritative voiding symptoms, but patients typically have slowly progressive bladder outlet obstruction (eg, decreased force of stream, incomplete voiding, dribbling, nocturia) and lack systemic signs of infection.</li><li><strong>Urethritis</strong>:&nbsp; is usually caused by sexually transmitted pathogens (eg, <em>N gonorrhoeae</em>, <em>C trachomatis</em>); symptomatic cases are generally marked by dysuria and urethral discharge, not prostate tenderness.</li><li><strong>Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31146.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; presents with pelvic and perineal pain associated with voiding symptoms (eg, frequency, urgency, hesitancy) that have been ongoing (&gt;3 months).&nbsp; However, patients are generally afebrile, have little or no prostate tenderness, and have a negative urine culture.&nbsp; The exact etiology is unclear but suspected to be noninfectious chronic inflammation.</li></ul><h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><p>The following laboratory tests are indicated in the evaluation of acute bacterial prostatitis:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Urinalysis:&nbsp; pyuria, nitrates, and bacteriuria indicates infection of the urinary tract.</li><li>Complete blood count:&nbsp; typically reveals leukocytosis with bandemia.</li><li>Urine gram stain and culture:&nbsp; necessary to identify causative organisms.</li><li>Sexually transmitted infection testing:&nbsp; in sexually active individuals.</li><li>Blood cultures:&nbsp; not always required unless there is evidence of severe sepsis (eg, hypotension).</li><li>Basic metabolic panel:&nbsp; severe or prolonged urinary obstruction can cause renal dysfunction with electrolyte abnormalities.</li></ul><h1>Imaging</h1><p>Imaging (eg, CT scan, prostate ultrasonography) is generally not required and should be reserved for patients who are likely to have a complication such as prostatic abscess (eg, prostatic fluctuance on digital rectal examination, failure to improve with antibiotics).</p><h1>Management</h1><p>The management of acute bacterial prostatitis involves initiation of empiric <strong>broad-spectrum antibiotics</strong>, typically with a fluoroquinolone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (both antibiotics have excellent coverage against enteric pathogens and achieve high prostatic tissue levels).&nbsp; Treatment should continue for 4-6 weeks for bacterial eradication (shorter courses may lead to chronic symptoms), and the antibiotic selection may be adjusted based on urine culture results or lack of appropriate improvement.&nbsp; Sexually transmitted infections should be managed with appropriate antibiotics (eg, doxycycline, ceftriaxone).</p><p>Many patients can receive outpatient treatment, but hospitalization and IV antibiotics are recommended in the following situations:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Evidence of bacteremia/sepsis or shock</li><li>Comorbid conditions that may increase the risk for severe infection (eg, diabetes mellitus, HIV)</li><li>Inability to tolerate oral antibiotic treatment (eg, vomiting)</li><li>Urinary retention (often requires suprapubic catheter placement for bladder drainage)</li></ul><p>Hospitalized patients receiving IV antibiotics can be transitioned to oral medication and discharged once symptoms improve (eg, fever resolution).</p><h1>Prognosis</h1><p>With prompt and appropriate treatment, most patients with acute prostatitis recover fully.&nbsp; However, complications can include the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Prostatic abscess</strong>:&nbsp; There is an increased risk for abscess in patients with diabetes mellitus and HIV; percutaneous or transurethral drainage may be required.</li><li><strong>Urinary retention</strong>:&nbsp; Suprapubic catheterization is typically used to alleviate obstruction until prostatic edema subsides (passage of urethral catheters can lead to sepsis by dislodging of bacteria from infected prostate).</li><li><strong>Sepsis and septic shock</strong>:&nbsp; These conditions can be life threatening without prompt and aggressive management (eg, IV antibiotics, pressors).</li><li><strong>Chronic bacterial prostatitis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/47251.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; This is characterized by repeated episodes of irritative urinary symptoms (eg, dysuria, frequency) associated with recurrent bacterial infection of the prostate (usually by the same organism).&nbsp; The prostate may be swollen and tender, but examination is often normal and systemic symptoms are absent.&nbsp; Urinalysis before and after prostatic massage reveals a &gt;10-fold increase in bacteriuria after massage.&nbsp; It may be related to inadequate treatment of acute bacterial prostatitis.</li></ul><h1>Summary</h1><p>Acute prostatitis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/47233.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is inflammation of the prostate typically caused by colonic bacteria that enter the prostate via the urethra.&nbsp; It usually manifests with a flu-like illness (eg, fever, myalgia) and lower urinary tract symptoms (eg, dysuria).&nbsp; A tender, swollen prostate on digital rectal examination confirms the diagnosis.&nbsp; Urine culture is required to establish the underlying pathogen, and 4-6 weeks of empiric antibiotic treatment is necessary to eradicate the infection.<p></p></div>\n            "
