It is a common condition that can significantly impact a patient's quality of life, affecting psychological well-being and intimate relationships.&nbsp; The etiology of ED is variable and usually multifactorial, involving vascular, neurologic, hormonal, and psychological factors.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Penile erection involves a complex interplay between vascular, neuropsychological, and endocrine systems (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L65228.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Initiation of erection typically begins with psychological arousal (eg, visual stimuli, fantasy), genital stimulation, or both.&nbsp; During sexual arousal, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum, leading to the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).&nbsp; This results in smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpora cavernosa, causing penile engorgement and erection.<p></p><br><br><p>The vascular and neural mechanisms leading to erection are potentiated by testosterone.&nbsp; Normal aging in men is associated with a slow decline in gonadal testosterone production.&nbsp; Common, nonspecific symptoms in older men include decreased ejaculate volume, increased erectile latency and sexual refractory time, and moderately impaired erectile function.&nbsp; However, overt ED can arise from disruptions in any of the following systems:</p>\n<h2>Vascular</h2><br><br><p>Atherosclerosis can restrict blood flow to the penis, leading to ED (eg, as seen in <strong>Leriche syndrome</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L41845.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), a classic triad of proximal lower extremity claudication, diminished femoral pulses, and ED that occurs from occlusion at the distal aorta, iliac arteries, and/or femoropopliteal arteries).&nbsp; Conversely, ED is associated with an increased risk for systemic atherosclerosis.<p></p><br><br><p>In addition, the major atherosclerotic risk factors (eg, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus) can impair endothelial function and reduce penile blood flow, even in the absence of significant arterial stenosis.</p>\n<h2>Neurologic</h2><br><br><p>Neural control of erection involves the thoracolumbar erection center at T11-L2 (which primarily regulates detumescence), sacral erection center at S2-S4 (which primarily regulates tumescence), and peripheral nerves (eg, cavernous nerves, pudendal nerve).&nbsp; Peripheral nerve disorders (eg, diabetic neuropathy), spinal cord injuries, or pelvic surgery (eg, prostatectomy) can interfere with the neural signals required for erection.</p>\n<h2>Endocrine</h2><br><br><p>Testosterone influences multiple components of erectile function, including libido/central arousal, vascular function, and likely autonomic function.&nbsp; Low testosterone levels can impair psychological arousal and erectile function.&nbsp; Common causes of low testosterone levels include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Primary hypogonadism:&nbsp; chromosomal disorders (eg, Klinefelter syndrome), cryptorchidism, cancer chemotherapy, aging</li>\n\t<li>Secondary (central) hypogonadism:&nbsp; hyperprolactinemia, hemochromatosis, pituitary masses and injuries</li>\n\t<li>Liver cirrhosis:&nbsp; can cause direct testicular suppression and decreased clearance of estrogen, which down-regulates gonadotropin production</li>\n\t<li>Withdrawal from chronic anabolic steroid use:&nbsp; often characterized by prolonged delay in recovery of endogenous testosterone production, leading to ED; paradoxically, ED may also be seen with anabolic steroid use due to disruption to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psychological</h2><br><br><p>Anxiety, depression, relationship discord, and other major stressors (eg, medical illness) can contribute to psychogenic ED.&nbsp; In these cases, erectile function is typically intact (evidenced by persistence of nocturnal nonsexual erections), but the erectile response during sexual activity is impaired.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Consistent with the multifactorial etiology of ED, a broad variety of patient factors is associated with increased risk:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chronic medical conditions</strong><br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Diabetes mellitus</li>\n\t\t<li>Cardiovascular (CV) disease and CV risk factors (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia)</li>\n\t\t<li>Chronic kidney or liver disease</li>\n\t\t<li>Thyroid disorders</li>\n\t\t<li>Psychological stress and depression</li>\n\t\t<li>Medications:&nbsp; opioids (decreased GnRH secretion), glucocorticoids, antihypertensives (eg, thiazide diuretics), spironolactone, antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can cause ED but more often cause delayed orgasm)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Demographic and lifestyle factors</strong>\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Age &gt;40 (increased incidence with advancing age)</li>\n\t\t<li>Obesity and sedentary lifestyle</li>\n\t\t<li>Smoking, alcohol, recreational drug use</li>\n\t\t<li>Possible association with long-distance cycling and pornography use</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with ED typically present with an inability to achieve or maintain an erection.&nbsp; The degree of dysfunction can vary, including partial erections that are insufficient for penetration, erections that are initially firm but soften rapidly during coitus, and complete absence of tumescence.</p><br><br><p>However, due to the sensitive nature of the subject, patient case presentation is highly variable.&nbsp; Some patients may not describe the symptoms directly or may emphasize other aspects of sexual activity (eg, changes in libido, frequency of intercourse).&nbsp; In addition, because ED is most common in patients with medical and psychiatric comorbidity, concerns in other domains may overshadow the concern for the ED itself.</p><br><br><p>ED is usually painless.&nbsp; However, patients frequently have additional conditions that may lead to discomfort (eg, Peyronie disease).&nbsp; Conversely, pain during intercourse can lead to ED as a secondary phenomenon.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The clinical evaluation of ED is usually very informative in determining the most likely contributing factors.&nbsp; The initial assessment should include the following (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L82243.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Sexual history</strong>:&nbsp;

smoking, alcohol, and drug history</li>\n\t<li><strong>Physical examination</strong>:&nbsp; A focused genital exam assessing penile deformities, testicular size, and secondary sexual characteristics.&nbsp; A CV and neurologic examination should also be performed.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because the etiology of ED is diverse and multifactorial, a single cause is not usually identified.&nbsp; However, certain patterns may be evident to help identify the primary etiology (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35835.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Vascular ED</strong>:&nbsp; Symptoms typically develop gradually, often in the context of other CV symptoms and risk factors.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neurologic ED</strong>:&nbsp; Symptoms often begin suddenly following trauma or surgery and may be accompanied by other neurologic deficits, such as loss of sensation in the pelvic region.&nbsp; When symptoms develop gradually (eg, in patients with diabetes), other symptoms of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy are often present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Endocrine ED</strong>:&nbsp; Besides ED, patients with hypogonadism usually also have reduced libido.&nbsp; Objective manifestations of hypogonadism include loss of muscle mass, decreased bone density, and gynecomastia.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Psychogenic ED</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/59555.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Often sudden in onset, this type of ED may occur in specific situations (eg, with a new partner or in stressful circumstances), and patients may report normal erections during sleep or masturbation.&nbsp; Libido is often, though not always, normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation and imaging</h1><br><br><p>It is uncommon for ED to be the initial or only manifestation of an otherwise occult medical condition (eg, diabetes mellitus), and in many cases the major contributors (eg, smoking, medical comorbidity, psychosocial stressors) are apparent based on the clinical assessment.&nbsp; Nevertheless, a limited laboratory evaluation is appropriate in the assessment of most patients with ED:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Serum testosterone</strong>:&nbsp; Morning measurement (ie, 8am) is preferred.&nbsp; Because levels are variable, if the first test is low, it should be repeated later, concurrently with gonadotropins (ie, LH, FSH) and serum prolactin.&nbsp; Overtly low testosterone levels with elevated gonadotropins suggest primary hypogonadism as a cause of ED, but borderline and mildly low testosterone levels are nonspecific, especially in older men, and may not be the cause of ED.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lipid profile and fasting glucose (or hemoglobin A1c)</strong>:&nbsp; To assess for CV risk factors such as dyslipidemia and diabetes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Serum chemistry profile</strong>:&nbsp; To assess for chronic kidney and liver disease.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Serum TSH</strong></li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Imaging and biophysical testing do not usually play a prominent role in evaluation of ED.&nbsp; Specialized tests are typically performed in concert with specialist consultation, often in patients who have not responded to first-line treatment for ED.&nbsp; Potential tests include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Penile Doppler ultrasound</strong>:&nbsp; This imaging test evaluates penile blood flow and can identify arterial insufficiency or venous leak in cases of suspected vascular ED.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) test</strong>:&nbsp; Monitors nocturnal erections to differentiate between psychogenic and organic causes of ED.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis of ED includes other conditions that may present with impaired sexual function:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Decreased libido</strong>:&nbsp; Patients with low libido (eg, due to hypogonadism, chronic illness, psychological factors) may have absence of erection in sexual encounters.&nbsp; But sexual arousal, once achieved, may be associated with normal erectile function.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Peyronie disease</strong>:&nbsp; This disease is characterized by the formation of fibrous plaques within the tunica albuginea, causing painful erections and penile curvature.&nbsp; ED may be present independently, but erectile function is often preserved.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other sexual dysfunction</strong>:&nbsp; Patients with other sexual disorders (eg, premature ejaculation, increased ejaculatory latency) may self-describe as having ED, either because the underlying disorder is generating performance anxiety resulting in ED, or because the patient may not be fully conversant in complex sexual behaviors.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Normal aging</strong>:&nbsp; With age, men commonly experience mild, nonspecific changes in sexual function, including decreased ejaculate volume, increased erectile latency and sexual refractory period (ie, time from orgasm until another orgasm is possible), and moderately impaired erectile function, with increased stimulation needed to achieve an erection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of ED involves addressing underlying causes, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacological interventions:</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle modifications</h2><br><br><p>Nonpharmacologic interventions for ED include weight loss, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and increased physical activity.&nbsp; In certain cases, particularly for patients with psychogenic ED, behavioral counseling (eg, joint couples therapy, reduction in pornography use) may be appropriate.</p>\n<h2>Pharmacologic therapy</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors</strong> (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil):&nbsp; These treatments are first-line for most patients with ED.&nbsp; Inhibition of PDE5 augments intracellular cGMP concentrations, leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle of the venous sinuses of the corpora cavernosa.&nbsp; This causes the corpora to become engorged, inducing and sustaining the erection.&nbsp; Major adverse effects include hypotension (which can be severe in patients taking alpha blockers or nitrates), blue discoloration of vision, priapism, flushing, headache, hearing loss, and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/57283.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; PDE5 inhibitors are typically taken as needed prior to sexual activity; tadalafil also may be given in a low daily dose.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intracavernosal injections</strong>:&nbsp; Alprostadil and other vasoactive agents may be injected directly into the corpora cavernosa to induce an erection.&nbsp; Alprostadil may also be administered as an intraurethral pellet (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10946.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Testosterone replacement therapy</strong>:&nbsp; For patients with confirmed hypogonadism, testosterone therapy can restore libido and improve erectile function.&nbsp; Optimal replacement levels are debated, and some studies indicate that testosterone levels mildly below laboratory reference ranges may be adequate for erectile function.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical and surgical interventions</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Vacuum erection devices</strong>:&nbsp; These create a vacuum around the penis, drawing blood into the corpora cavernosa, which is then maintained with a constriction band.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Penile implants</strong>:&nbsp; For patients who fail pharmacologic therapy, penile prostheses offer a permanent solution to ED.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Revascularization</strong>:&nbsp; Percutaneous and open vascular procedures may be indicated in select cases of arterial stenosis but are rarely performed for ED alone in patients without additional symptoms of vascular insufficiency (eg, claudication).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CV assessment &nbsp;</h2><br><br><p>Due to the significant overlap in etiology and risk factors, patients with ED have a high prevalence of atherosclerotic CV disease.&nbsp; Sexual intercourse typically entails at least moderate physical exertion that may lead to cardiac strain; the possible hemodynamic fluctuations due to PDE5 inhibitor use in patients with significant CV disease can potentially lead to cardiac complications (eg, myocardial infarction).</p><br><br><p>Patients at low risk, such as those with ≤2 CV risk factors, or those who have atherosclerosis but have undergone revascularization and are asymptomatic, can be safely prescribed PDE5 inhibitor therapy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/38355.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; However, patients at intermediate to high risk for CV events may warrant cardiac stress testing or cardiology consultation prior to initiating treatment.&nbsp; Factors that may warrant additional evaluation include the following:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>≥3 CV risk factors or significantly uncontrolled risk factors (eg, uncontrolled hypertension)</li>\n\t<li>Unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, stable angina with symptoms induced by light activity (ie, &lt;4 METs)</li>\n\t<li>New York Heart Association class III or higher symptomatic heart failure</li>\n\t<li>Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or moderate-to-severe valvular heart disease</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>ED itself does not directly cause significant medical complications, although it is associated with increased CV morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; However, it can have a significant psychological impact and diminished quality of life due to anxiety, depression, and strained interpersonal relationships.</p><br><br><p>In addition, treatment-related complications are common.&nbsp; PDE5 inhibitors are generally well tolerated but may cause headaches, flushing, and hypotension, particularly when combined with nitrates.&nbsp; The risks of testosterone therapy are debated but can include erythrocytosis and venous thromboembolism; there may also be an increased risk for prostate cancer and CV events.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of ED depends on its underlying cause and the patient's response to treatment.&nbsp; In cases of psychogenic ED, outcomes are generally favorable with counseling and lifestyle changes.&nbsp; Organic causes, such as vascular or neurogenic ED, may require long-term pharmacologic or surgical management, but many patients experience significant improvement with appropriate therapy.&nbsp; Early identification and management of CV risk factors are crucial for improving overall health.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Erectile dysfunction is a multifactorial condition that can be caused by disorders of the cardiovascular, neurologic, endocrine, and psychological systems (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35835.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
