This causes constriction around the distal penis, limiting venous and lymphatic outflow.&nbsp; It presents with edema and tenderness of the glans and prepuce.&nbsp; Without urgent manual reduction, paraphimosis can result in strangulation, vascular compromise, and necrosis of the penile tissue.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Prolonged or forced retraction can lead to entrapment of the prepuce behind the rim of the glans (the coronal sulcus).&nbsp; Constriction around the distal penis limits venous and lymphatic drainage, causing edema and venous congestion of the glans.&nbsp; Penile arterial flow may then be compromised; if untreated, lack of perfusion can result in ischemia and necrosis of the tissue.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Phimosis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31411.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; a tight prepuce that is difficult to manipulate over the glans; the small opening makes retraction difficult and increases the risk of entrapment</li>\n\t<li><strong>Improper handling of prepuce</strong>:&nbsp; failure to promptly return the prepuce to its natural position after retraction; this may occur after glans cleaning, urination, genitourinary procedures (eg, catheterization), or genital examination&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sexual activity</strong>:&nbsp; commonly precedes paraphimosis in older patients</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Paraphimosis typically presents with the following clinical findings:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Distal penile pain</li>\n\t<li>Edematous and congested glans</li>\n\t<li>Tight band of constricted foreskin proximal to the glans</li>\n\t<li>Inability to return the foreskin to its normal position</li>\n\t<li>Pink and soft glans (early), dark and firm glans if ischemic (late)</li>\n\t<li>Normal, flaccid penile shaft</li>\n\t<li>Decreased urinary flow or urinary retention may develop with severe edema</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Paraphimosis is a clinical diagnosis.&nbsp; Uncircumcised patients who report penile pain and swelling should be immediately evaluated for this condition.&nbsp; Physical examination revealing a <strong>tight band of retracted prepuce strangulating the glans</strong> confirms the diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Balanoposthitis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/65322.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Inflammation of the glans and prepuce causes penile pain, swelling, and difficulty with prepuce manipulation.&nbsp; A retracted, entrapped prepuce is not characteristic, and purulent discharge is commonly observed.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tourniquet syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; A hair or thin fiber becomes wrapped around the penis (or a finger/toe) causing severe pain, edema, and erythema at the site of constriction.&nbsp; With careful inspection, the hair or fiber is often visible; examination of the prepuce can help rule out prepuce retraction and entrapment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Penile edema</strong>:&nbsp; Swelling can occur secondary to systemic diseases like congestive heart failure or renal disease (eg, anasarca).&nbsp; Patients typically have known comorbid conditions, and the swelling is often symmetric and not isolated to the distal penis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation and imaging</h1><br><br><p>There are no laboratory or imaging studies required to diagnose paraphimosis.&nbsp; The diagnosis is clinical, based on examination findings.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of paraphimosis is <strong>emergency reduction</strong>, either manually or surgically, to maintain vascular flow to the glans penis.&nbsp; Interventions include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Manual reduction:&nbsp; gentle, constant compression of the glans (eg, grasp and squeeze circumferentially) while attempting to pull the prepuce forward.&nbsp; Topical and/or systemic analgesics are typically required; local anesthesia or procedural sedation may be necessary in some cases.&nbsp; Application of hypertonic solutions (eg, sugar) to edematous tissue prior to reduction can help to draw out water and reduce swelling.&nbsp; Treatment with ice reduces edema, but should be avoided if any evidence of ischemia is present because vasoconstriction may further limit penile perfusion.</li>\n\t<li>Dorsal slit:&nbsp; invasive surgical technique that is performed when manual reduction fails; involves incising the constricting band of prepuce</li>\n\t<li>Circumcision:&nbsp; may be considered after resolution to prevent recurrence</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Prompt reduction of paraphimosis typically leads to good outcomes with no long-term sequelae, although recurrent episodes can occur.&nbsp; Circumcision is the definitive treatment for prevention.&nbsp; Delayed treatment may result in tissue ischemia and necrosis of the penis.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Paraphimosis is the retraction and entrapment of the prepuce behind the glans penis.&nbsp; This circumferential constriction can lead to severe edema with vascular compromise.&nbsp; The diagnosis is made based on physical examination, which reveals a tight band of foreskin strangulating the glans penis.&nbsp; Immediate manual or surgical reduction is necessary to prevent penile ischemia and necrosis.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
