It most commonly affects the epiphyses of long bones in young adults (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13546.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>GCTB is thought to develop from the activation of neoplastic stromal cells secondary to an intraluminal hemorrhage.&nbsp; These cells are involved in the recruitment and development of osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells, whose increased activity leads to the characteristic bone resorption within the tumor.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology</h1><br><br><p>The incidence is highest in young adults (age 20-40) who have reached skeletal maturity, but it can also occur in older adults, typically associated with Paget disease of bone.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>GCTB typically affects the <strong>epiphyses of long bones</strong> in young adults, with the distal femur and proximal tibia being the most common sites.&nbsp; Symptoms include local pain, swelling, and limited range of motion of the involved joint; pathologic fracture due to thinning and weakening of the local cortex may occur.&nbsp; Examination may reveal a soft tissue mass.</p>\n<h1>Evaluation</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>X-ray characteristically reveals an <strong>eccentric, expansile lytic lesion</strong> within the epiphysis that may extend into the metaphysis, often with a multilocular appearance resembling <strong>soap bubbles</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108647.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; A prominent sclerotic rim at the lesion margin is typically absent.</li>\n\t<li>MRI is used to visualize the extent of soft tissue involvement of the tumor and to help differentiate GCTB from other bone lesions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy, which demonstrates interspersed <strong>multinucleated giant cells</strong> (resembling osteoclasts) among sheets of mononuclear stromal cells (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L75601.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
