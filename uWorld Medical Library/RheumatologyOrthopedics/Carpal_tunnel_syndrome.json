CTS is the most common compressive neuropathy.</p>\n<h1>Anatomy</h1><h2>Boundaries</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The floor of the carpal tunnel (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L120041.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an arch formed by the 8 carpal bones.</li>\n\t<li>The roof of the carpal tunnel consists of the transverse carpal ligament (flexor retinaculum), which attaches to the carpal bones laterally (scaphoid, trapezium) and medially (pisiform, hamate).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contents</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The carpal tunnel primarily functions as a conduit for 9 of the flexor tendons that help bend the thumb and fingers during forearm muscle contraction.&nbsp; The transverse carpal ligament helps prevent these tendons from bowing at the wrist.</li>\n\t<li>The <strong>median nerve</strong> must pass through the tunnel to transmit sensory input from the first 3½ digits, as well as motor output to the muscles needed for thumb abduction (abductor pollicis brevis), opposition (opponens pollicis), and flexion (flexor pollicis brevis).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Because the carpal tunnel's boundaries are rigid (hard bones, fibrous ligament), there is little room for expansion.&nbsp; Therefore, any process that increases the volume of the tunnel's contents or reduces its anatomic size can <strong>elevate intratunnel pressures</strong>, resulting in median nerve compression (the hallmark of CTS).</p><br><br><p>Compression induces microvascular injury (eg, venous congestion, edema, inflammation) resulting in nerve dysfunction due to ischemia and demyelination.&nbsp; Sustained, severe compression can cause axonal loss, which manifests as more severe disease.&nbsp; CTS typically affects sensory fibers first (sensory more sensitive to compression), followed by motor fibers (with progression).</p><br><br><p>Repetitive wrist movements tend to exacerbate median nerve injury because position changes elevate intratunnel pressures (extension or flexion can increase pressure up to 10-fold).&nbsp; Repeated compression creates a vicious cycle of worsening nerve edema, inflammation, and ischemia.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Although CTS is often idiopathic, there is an increased risk for CTS with environmental factors, medical conditions, and gender differences.</p>\n<h2>Environmental factors</h2><br><br><p>Just as repetitive movements can worsen established CTS, extensive wrist use during certain occupations has been implicated in the development of CTS.&nbsp; Occupations that increase risk typically involve wrist movements with prolonged extension/flexion, excessive force/repetition, or mechanical vibration/pulsation (eg, manufacturing, construction, food processing).&nbsp; Although often implicated in symptom exacerbation, light-duty office work (eg, typing, computer use) does not independently cause CTS.</p>\n<h2>Medical conditions</h2><br><br><p>Median nerve compression at the wrist is associated with medical conditions that either increase the volume of the carpal tunnel's contents or reduce the tunnel's anatomic size:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increased volume of tunnel contents can occur with multiple conditions including pregnancy (fluid accumulation), diabetes mellitus (tendon glycosylation), obesity (excess fat), rheumatoid arthritis (synovial inflammation), hypothyroidism (mucin buildup), and amyloidosis (eg, beta-2 microglobulin accumulation with hemodialysis).</li>\n\t<li>Reduced tunnel size can occur insidiously from osteoarthritis (eg, osteophyte formation) or acutely from trauma (eg, lunate dislocation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L58783.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gender</h2><br><br><p>Females are more susceptible than males (ratio 3:1), possibly related to generally smaller carpal tunnel sizes in female patients, making them more susceptible to intratunnel volume change.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>CTS is hallmarked by pain and paresthesia (tingling, burning, numbness) in the median nerve's sensory distribution (ie, in the <strong>first 3 digits and radial half of digit 4</strong>) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L119803.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Because the median nerve's palmar cutaneous branch arises proximal to the wrist and passes over (not through) the carpal tunnel, CTS does not typically affect skin sensation over the thenar eminence.<p></p>\n<h2>Clinical course</h2><br><br><p>Onset is usually gradual with intermittent symptoms.&nbsp; The pain and paresthesia typically worsen at night (likely due to prolonged nocturnal wrist flexion and/or supine fluid redistribution causing higher tunnel pressures) and may awaken the patient from sleep.&nbsp; With progression, symptoms can become persistent throughout the day.&nbsp; The dominant hand is most often affected, and bilateral CTS is common.</p>\n<h2>Aggravating and alleviating factors</h2><br><br><p>Symptoms are often provoked by activities involving sustained wrist extension or flexion (eg, driving, typing) that increase carpal tunnel pressures.&nbsp; Transient relief is sometimes reported by shaking the affected hand or holding it under warm water.</p>\n<h2>Severe disease</h2><br><br><p>Because motor fibers are less sensitive to compression than sensory fibers, evidence of muscle weakness typically signals more advanced disease.&nbsp; Severe CTS impairs median nerve innervation to the hand muscles (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L61401.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Clinical manifestations include weakness of thumb abduction and opposition with atrophy of the thenar eminence (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L105731.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Patients may describe symptoms of weakness or clumsiness and typically report difficulty with gripping activities that involve the thumb (eg, holding objects, opening jars, buttoning clothes).&nbsp; Permanent loss of sensory axons (eg, disappearance of pain) is another late finding.<p></p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>CTS is primarily a clinical diagnosis for patients with classic symptoms (eg, pain, paresthesia) and examination findings (eg, weakness, sensory loss) in a median nerve distribution.&nbsp; Diagnostic accuracy increases with the presence of classic aggravating factors (eg, sleep, sustained wrist positions) or alleviating activities (eg, hand shaking).</p>\n<h2>Provocative maneuvers</h2><br><br><p>Maneuvers that reproduce symptoms at the bedside can help support CTS diagnosis:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The <strong>Phalen maneuver</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28518.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) induces hyperflexion (~90 degrees) of the wrist, causing increased carpal tunnel pressure.&nbsp; A positive test is defined as pain or paresthesia in the median nerve–innervated fingers within a minute (sensitivity and specificity ~70%).</li>\n\t<li>The <strong>Tinel test</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28519.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) involves tapping the carpal tunnel over the median nerve and is positive when percussion elicits pain or paresthesia (sensitivity ~50%; specificity ~75%).</li>\n\t<li>Other tests that support the diagnosis of CTS include symptom reproduction with continuous hand elevation or manual carpal compression.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Electrodiagnostic testing</h2><br><br><p>Electrodiagnostic testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of CTS in any patient with atypical or inconclusive findings.&nbsp; It is also warranted for patients being considered for surgical intervention, including those with moderate to severe disease or worsening symptoms despite conservative management (eg, wrist splinting):</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Nerve conduction studies (NCSs):&nbsp; showing slowed conduction velocities across the carpal tunnel (indicating demyelination) can confirm the diagnosis of CTS.&nbsp; NCSs can also identify axonal loss (seen as decreased amplitude of compound action potentials), which indicates more severe disease and the need for surgical referral.</li>\n\t<li>Electromyography:&nbsp; demonstrating denervation of the median-innervated hand muscles (eg, abductor pollicis brevis) is frequently combined with NCS to confirm the diagnosis of CTS.&nbsp; It also helps exclude median nerve dysfunction proximal to the carpal tunnel (eg, radiculopathy).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other testing</h2><br><br><p>Imaging studies are not necessary for CTS diagnosis but may be useful during treatment (eg, using ultrasonographic guidance for glucocorticoid injections) or when atypical features suggest a mass lesion (eg, using MRI).</p><br><br><p>Laboratory tests may be helpful when there is suspicion for underlying medical conditions that increase CTS risk (eg, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>CTS management is based on disease severity.&nbsp; For mild to moderate CTS (eg, patient able to perform activities of daily living [ADLs], no axon loss on NCS), a trial of conservative therapy is recommended.&nbsp; Patients with severe CTS (eg, interference with ADLs, axon loss on NCS) and those for whom conservative measures fail should be offered surgical decompression.</p>\n<h2>Nonsurgical therapy</h2><br><br><p>Nonsurgical therapy includes wrist splinting, glucocorticoid injections, physical therapy, therapeutic ultrasonography, and yoga:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Wrist splinting</strong> is first-line treatment for mild to moderate CTS.&nbsp; Splinting helps the patient maintain a neutral wrist position (ie, preventing excessive wrist extension or flexion), which lowers carpal tunnel pressures, provides symptom relief, and improves nerve conduction velocities.&nbsp; Nocturnal splinting is often adequate for relief, but some patients gain additional benefit from continuous splinting or specific use during exacerbating activities.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Glucocorticoid injection</strong> (eg, methylprednisolone) into the carpal tunnel region can provide rapid symptom improvement by reducing tissue inflammation.&nbsp; An injection is often helpful when splinting is inadequate, but it may also be used as initial therapy for patients wanting faster results (with similar efficacy to splinting).&nbsp; Combined therapy with splinting and injections may improve CTS symptoms better than either therapy alone.&nbsp; Oral glucocorticoids are a reasonable alternative for patients wanting to avoid injections, although they are probably somewhat less effective.</li>\n\t<li>Other nonsurgical therapies sometimes used for CTS include physical therapy (eg, flexor retinaculum stretching (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73238.png\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), nerve-gliding exercises), therapeutic ultrasonography, and yoga.&nbsp; However, evidence is conflicting for reliable improvement in short-term symptoms or function.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Nonsurgical therapies without clear benefit:&nbsp; Although commonly used, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have not demonstrated significant improvement for CTS patients.&nbsp; Gabapentinoids (eg, pregabalin), which are used for other neuropathic diseases such as diabetic neuropathy, appear to have negligible effects on CTS.&nbsp; Despite the role of diuretics in decreasing edema and the relationship of vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>6</sub></font> deficiency to peripheral neuropathy, neither has shown benefit for CTS.</p>\n<h2>Surgical therapy</h2><br><br><p><strong>Surgical decompression</strong> is the treatment of choice for patients with CTS who have severe symptoms (eg, weakness of thumb abduction/opposition), evidence of axon loss on NCS, or mild to moderate symptoms refractory to nonsurgical therapies.&nbsp; Surgery for CTS involves division of the transverse carpal ligament (flexor retinaculum) to relieve pressure on the median nerve (can be performed via open incision or endoscopy).&nbsp; For patients with moderate to severe CTS, surgical decompression results in greater improvement than nonsurgical treatments for both symptom relief and function.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>CTS should be differentiated from any disorder that causes symptoms of hand/arm pain, paresthesia, or weakness.&nbsp; Examples include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cervical radiculopathy:</strong>&nbsp; This is common and can mimic CTS by causing pain, paresthesia, and weakness in the hand (eg, in the C6, C7, and C8 nerve roots).&nbsp; However, cervical radiculopathy is often exacerbated by neck movement and is usually accompanied by some combination of neck or shoulder pain, reduced reflexes (eg, biceps, brachioradialis), proximal arm weakness (eg, impaired elbow flexion/extension), and a dermatomal (rather than median nerve) pattern of sensory loss.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pronator teres syndrome (PTS):</strong>&nbsp; This describes median nerve compression in the upper forearm, where the median nerve passes between the humeral and ulnar heads of the pronator teres muscle (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25344.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Although PTS can cause pain and paresthesia of the first 3½ digits, sensory symptoms are also expected over the thenar eminence due to proximal median nerve compression, which, unlike in CTS, includes the palmar cutaneous branch.&nbsp; There may also be weakness of median-innervated muscles proximal to the wrist (eg, impaired wrist flexion or forearm pronation).&nbsp; PTS is rare and generally occurs with repetitive/forceful forearm movements (eg, in tennis players or body builders).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cubital fossa injury:</strong>&nbsp; The median nerve passes through the cubital fossa (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L58677.jpg\" alt=\"figure 9\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 9</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), where it is susceptible to penetrating and mechanical trauma (eg, laceration, supracondylar fracture).&nbsp; Sensory and motor symptoms can be identical to those in PTS, but nerve injury in the more proximal cubital fossa often results in inability to flex the index and middle fingers (hand of benediction (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L88913.jpg\" alt=\"figure 10\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 10</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )) from denervation of the flexor digitorum muscles that bend the 2nd and 3rd digits.&nbsp; Cubital fossa injuries often also impact the brachial artery, which runs parallel to the median nerve.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Because CTS often worsens with time, prognosis improves with early diagnosis and treatment (ie, before permanent median nerve damage can occur).&nbsp; Patients with mild to moderate CTS typically respond to conservative measures, but many patients ultimately require surgery (better long-term outcomes in appropriately selected patients).&nbsp; Effective treatment (nonsurgical or surgical) produces complete or significant improvement in approximately 80% of patients at a year.&nbsp; However, up to one-third of patients experience recurrence.&nbsp; Prognosis is worse (eg, involving permanent numbness or weakness) for patients with advanced disease (eg, axonal loss on NCS).&nbsp; In rare cases, CTS can lead to complex regional pain syndrome.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compressive neuropathy and results from median nerve compression during its passage through the carpal tunnel.&nbsp; Carpal tunnel syndrome typically presents with pain, paresthesia, and numbness in the sensory distribution of the median nerve (first 3½ digits).&nbsp; Motor involvement (eg, weakness of thumb abduction/opposition, thenar atrophy) signals more advanced disease.&nbsp; Risk factors include excessive/repetitive wrist use, medical conditions (eg, pregnancy, hypothyroidism), and female sex.&nbsp; Diagnosis is primarily clinical and aided by the presence of aggravating factors (eg, nocturnal worsening), alleviating activities (eg, hand shaking), and bedside tests (eg, Phalen maneuver, Tinel test).&nbsp; Electrodiagnostic studies can confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases and help guide surgical decisions in moderate to severe cases.&nbsp; Management includes nonsurgical options (eg, wrist splinting, glucocorticoid injection) for mild to moderate disease and decompressive surgery for severe disease and when conservative treatment fails.&nbsp; Prognosis is generally good and improves with early diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
