Type I collagen is an important structural component of bone, tendons, ligaments, skin, sclera, and teeth.&nbsp; It is the predominant collagen in osteoid (the organic component of bone matrix), allowing bones to be somewhat flexible while still maintaining strength.</p><br><br><p>The vast majority of OI cases involve mutations in <em>COL1A1</em> or <em>COL1A2</em>, which code for the alpha chains in <strong>type I collagen</strong>.&nbsp; Mutations in these genes cause impaired type I collagen synthesis by osteoblasts, resulting in thin, irregular trabeculae and reduced bone mass.&nbsp; Consequently, the bones are brittle and prone to fractures and deformities.&nbsp; OI is typically inherited in an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> pattern, but spontaneous mutations can occur as well.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Clinical manifestations of OI are variable and can range from lethal disease in utero (type II (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31858.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                )) to mild defects (type II) diagnosed later in life.&nbsp; Because type I collagen is also present in teeth, ligaments, skin, and sclerae, patients with OI may have involvement of these structures as well.&nbsp; Clinical findings may include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Fractures</strong>:&nbsp; Recurrent fractures with minimal trauma are a hallmark of OI.&nbsp; Patients typically present after age 1 (when they begin walking).&nbsp; Long bones, ribs, and spinal vertebrae are commonly affected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Short stature</strong>:&nbsp; Recurrent fractures, continued bone turnover, and decreased bone volume contribute to short stature in some patients, who may also develop premature osteoporosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Blue sclerae</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11288.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Because type I collagen is also found in the sclera, this portion of the eye is abnormally thin and translucent, allowing the underlying choroid to be seen.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dentinogenesis imperfecta</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12708.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; This condition is characterized by an opalescent blue-gray or yellow-brown discoloration of the teeth due to the underlying dentin seen through translucent and weak enamel.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hearing loss</strong>:&nbsp; This may occur due to dislocation or fracture of the middle ear bones, contributing to speech delay.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Joint hypermobility</strong>:&nbsp; Type I collagen is also found in tendons and ligaments, resulting in ligamentous laxity and pain.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>OI may also affect other systems, causing cardiovascular (eg, aortic root dilation due to abnormal type I collagen in the aortic wall), respiratory (eg, restrictive lung disease due to abnormal thoracic spine development), neurologic (eg, headaches from abnormal skull development), and dermatologic symptoms (eg, skin laxity, easy bruising).</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Nonaccidental trauma</strong>:&nbsp; Both OI and nonaccidental injury may present with multiple fractures at different stages of healing.&nbsp; OI is more likely if other associated findings (eg, blue sclerae) are present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vitamin D deficiency</strong>:&nbsp; Severe vitamin D deficiency can result in rickets (ie, deficient mineralization at the growth plate), which can present with bone deformities and fractures.&nbsp; Patients with rickets have characteristic metaphyseal fraying with widened physes on x-ray due to impaired mineralization (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L63419.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In addition, there is no associated joint hypermobility.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Paget disease of bone</strong>:&nbsp; This disease occurs due to accelerated bone remodeling.&nbsp; Symptomatic patients can have bone pain and recurrent fractures due to excessive remodeling; however, this disorder is more common in adults and has no associated dental abnormalities.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy</strong>:&nbsp; Mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin result in skeletal and cardiac muscle fiber degradation.&nbsp; Patients with muscular dystrophy can have frequent fractures due to a combination of proximal muscle weakness (leading to falls) and decreased bone density (secondary to glucocorticoids).&nbsp; Muscle weakness is not seen in OI.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28707.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; This connective tissue disorder is most commonly caused by defective type V collagen.&nbsp; The defect causes patients to have joint hypermobility and skin laxity but not recurrent fractures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>OI may be discovered incidentally in the antenatal period through routine ultrasonography, which may reveal multiple fractures, limb shortening, a hypoplastic thoracic cage, and/or growth restriction.&nbsp; After birth, OI should be suspected in patients presenting with recurrent fractures, bone deformities, or any of the other extraskeletal manifestations.&nbsp; If there is clinical suspicion for OI, work-up involves a skeletal survey, which may reveal:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Fractures</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44802.jpg\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Imaging may reveal multiple fractures due to minor trauma at different stages of healing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bone deformities</strong>:&nbsp; There may be bowing of long bones (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97750.jpg\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and growth arrest lines (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97753.jpg\" alt=\"image 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), suggesting interruptions in bone growth related to fractures.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Osteopenia</strong>:&nbsp; Evidence of early osteopenia may be seen with cortical bone thinning and increased trabecular bone transparency.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) may be obtained to establish a baseline of bone mineral density and assess response to interventions.</p><br><br><p>Echocardiogram is also typically obtained due to the risk of cardiovascular involvement (eg, aortic root dilation).</p><br><br><p>Diagnostic confirmation involves molecular genetic testing to identify mutations in the <em>COL1A1</em> or <em>COL1A2</em> genes.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The goal of management in OI is to improve musculoskeletal health and function to maximize quality of life.&nbsp; This may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Bisphosphonates for patients with moderate to severe disease to increase bone density and reduce fracture risk.</li>\n\t<li>Prompt recognition and appropriate management of fractures.</li>\n\t<li>Physical therapy for optimizing mobility and preventing deformities.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition to musculoskeletal health, patients should be continually monitored for extraskeletal complications (eg, dental, cardiovascular).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Because of its wide range of severity, the prognosis of OI is variable.&nbsp; Type II (the most severe type) is lethal in utero.&nbsp; Amongst the nonlethal types, those with more severe forms may have challenges with pain, weakness, and motor difficulty due to fractures and death early in childhood, likely related to pulmonary disease from altered thoracic anatomy.&nbsp; Conversely, patients with mild OI can live independent lives with a normal lifespan.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Osteogenesis imperfecta (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/40247.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a genetic disorder affecting type I collagen synthesis and structure, resulting in increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture.&nbsp;
