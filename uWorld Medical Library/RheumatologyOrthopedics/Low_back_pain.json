structural changes to the spine (eg, degeneration of discs) are commonly associated with LBP but are also seen with high prevalence in asymptomatic patients.&nbsp; Comorbid conditions (eg, obesity, physical deconditioning) also appear to play a role in the experience of pain.&nbsp; Accurate diagnosis and management of LBP (including ruling out more serious disorders) are crucial to prevent chronic pain and improve patient outcomes.&nbsp; This article primarily focuses on mechanical causes of LBP, discussing appropriate evaluation and management strategies, but also reviews the main nonmechanical etiologies to consider.</p><h1>Anatomy and pathophysiology</h1><p>The lumbar spine is composed of vertebrae, intervertebral discs, ligaments, muscles, and neural elements (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L6202.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Lumbar vertebrae</strong> (L1-L5) provide structural support and protect the spinal cord and nerves.&nbsp; Facet joints (or zygapophyseal joints) are small, synovial joints located between the vertebrae of the spine that, along with spinal ligaments, provide stability while enabling cardinal spinal movements (eg, spinal flexion, extension).</li><li><strong>Intervertebral discs</strong> contain a soft, gel-like core (nucleus pulposus) that is surrounded by an outer protective layer (annulus fibrosus), and function as shock absorbers.</li><li><strong>Spinal nerves</strong> exit the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina, passing close to the posterolateral aspect of the intervertebral disc (where they are particularly vulnerable to compression, inflammation, or irritation by damage to surrounding structures).</li><li><strong>Muscles and ligaments</strong> of the lumbar region, including the paraspinal muscles and the psoas major, play a key role in maintaining stability, movement, and posture.</li></ul><h2>Mechanical etiologies</h2><p>Mechanical etiologies for LBP involve changes to the spine that can occur as natural sequelae of aging or be acutely precipitated by excess mechanical stress (eg, injury, trauma, obesity).&nbsp; These changes include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Spondylosis</strong>:&nbsp; Is a broad term encompassing degenerative changes in the spine; it can involve the discs (eg, disc degeneration/loss of disc height, weakening of the annulus fibrosis), bony vertebrae and joints (eg, arthritis [osteophytes], hypertrophy of facets and end-plate sclerosis) or spinal ligaments (eg, ligamentum flavum thickening).</li><li><strong>Lumbar spinal stenosis</strong>:&nbsp; Refers specifically to narrowing of the spinal canal or foramina where spinal nerves exit, often as a result of changes seen in spondylosis (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L6075.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li><strong>Intervertebral disc herniation</strong>:&nbsp; Occurs due to extrusion of the nucleus pulposus through the outer fibrous layer.&nbsp; It most commonly occurs at L4-L5 and L5-S1.</li><li><strong>Spondylolisthesis</strong>:&nbsp; Represents anterior displacement of a vertebral body relative to the one below (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L91357.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li></ul><p>Although these etiologies are commonly linked to LBP, the causative relationship between these changes and LBP (especially chronic LBP) is complex, as evidenced by the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Mechanical spinal damage (eg, disc herniations, spondylolisthesis) is commonly seen as incidental findings in asymptomatic patients (≥80% in patients age ≥80).</li><li>LBP severity is poorly correlated with the degree of mechanical spinal damage.</li><li>LBP symptoms may occur in a pattern that does not correspond to the radiographic changes in the spine (eg, symptoms or nonspecific pain that occur in a different nerve distribution from the location of spinal damage).</li></ul><p>Multiple factors, including overall state of physical and psychological health, strength of supporting spinal musculature (eg, latissimus dorsi, multifidi, erector spinae), and severity of nerve root damage appear to play a role in creating and perpetuating LBP.</p><h2>Nonmechanical etiologies</h2><p>In some cases, LBP is the result of nonmechanical etiologies (eg, inflammatory arthritis, fracture, malignancy, hematoma).&nbsp; The initial evaluation of LBP should be directed at ruling out these other etiologies (as described in further detail below), including:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Infection</strong>:&nbsp; This includes osteomyelitis or spinal epidural abscess (infection of epidural space around the spinal cord), most commonly from <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>; other agents of concern in patients with risk factors (eg, injection drug use, immunocompromise) include gram-negative bacilli (eg, <em>Escherichia coli)</em> and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (ie, Pott disease).</li><li><strong>Inflammatory conditions</strong>:&nbsp; These include autoimmune inflammatory arthritides (eg, causing synovitis) involving the axial spine (eg, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), or conditions involving inflammation of the nerve root (eg, sarcoidosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome)</li><li><strong>Neoplastic disorders</strong>:&nbsp; Metastatic spread of tumor (eg, from breast, lung, or prostate cancers) can cause compression of the nerve root.</li><li><strong>Vascular disease</strong>:&nbsp; This includes vasculitis, arteriovenous malformation, and spinal hematoma (eg, from trauma or use of anticoagulants).</li></ul><h1>Risk factors</h1><p>Several factors contribute to the development of mechanical LBP, including:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Age</strong>:&nbsp; Degenerative changes in the discs and joints increase with age; the peak incidence of LBP is age 30-60, with declining prevalence afterward.</li><li><strong>Occupational factors</strong>:&nbsp; Jobs requiring repetitive bending, heavy lifting, or prolonged sitting can strain the lumbar spine.</li><li><strong>Obesity</strong>:&nbsp; Excess body weight increases mechanical stress on the lumbar spine, accelerating degenerative changes.</li><li><strong>Physical inactivity</strong>:&nbsp; Sedentary lifestyle weakens the supporting muscles of the spine, predisposing individuals to musculoskeletal injuries.</li><li><strong>Psychosocial factors</strong>:&nbsp; Factors strongly associated with LBP include prolonged psychological stress, trauma, depression, and poor job satisfaction.&nbsp; These factors possibly contribute to pain by exacerbating muscle tension, spasm, and pain sensitivity.</li><li><strong>Smoking</strong>:&nbsp; Nicotine impairs blood flow to the spine, accelerating disc degeneration and delaying tissue healing.</li><li><strong>Pregnancy</strong>:&nbsp; Contributing factors include weight gain, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, and increased joint and ligament laxity (due to effects of progesterone and relaxin).</li></ul><h1>Presentation and differential diagnosis</h1><p>LBP can be characterized with respect to duration of symptoms (ie, chronicity), which has significant prognostic and therapeutic implications.</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Acute LBP</strong>:&nbsp; Symptoms &lt;4 weeks</li><li><strong>Subacute LBP</strong>:&nbsp; Symptoms 4-12 weeks</li><li><strong>Chronic LBP</strong>:&nbsp; Symptoms &gt;12 weeks</li></ul><p>Common patterns of pain seen in LBP include the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Lumbar strain</strong>:&nbsp; Causes nonspecific pain usually centered on the paraspinal muscles, most commonly reflective of a mechanical cause; often with onset of symptoms following physical exertion.&nbsp; The pain is typically dull or aching and worsens with movement or prolonged standing.&nbsp; No radicular signs are seen.</li><li><strong>Facet joint syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Is typically from mechanical causes and characterized by unilateral or bilateral pain that may radiate to the buttocks or posterior thighs.&nbsp; The pain is often exacerbated by extension and rotation of the spine.</li><li><strong>Radiculopathy</strong>:&nbsp; May be due to mechanical or nonmechanical causes and is characterized by pain symptoms occurring along a particular dermatome, and indicates nerve involvement (eg, nerve root compression) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L61725.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The pain is typically described as burning and shooting.&nbsp; Associated findings include weakness and hyporeflexia (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/60250.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Sciatica refers to a type of radiculopathy that involves the sciatic nerve (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L48811.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and/or contributing nerve roots (ie, L4-S3) and that presents with shooting pain radiating down the leg below the knee.&nbsp; It may be caused by acute disc herniation or compression by the overlying piriformis muscle (piriformis syndrome).</li><li><strong>Lumbar spinal stenosis</strong>:&nbsp; Classically presents as leg pain that is worse with walking and spinal extension and is relieved by sitting or leaning forward (neurogenic claudication) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L30513.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li><strong>Coccydynia</strong>:&nbsp; Refers to pain that is localized to the coccyx and is classically worse with sitting and defecation.&nbsp; It is often caused by direct trauma (fall, prolonged sitting on a hard surface) or obstetric complications.</li><li><strong>Vertebral compression fracture (VCF)</strong>:&nbsp; When associated with pain, typically an acute presentation characterized by spinal tenderness in the setting of trauma (eg, lifting, twisting, ground-level fall).&nbsp; The pain is usually sharp or achy; it may be worse with the Valsalva maneuver, position changes, or spinal extension.&nbsp; The pain and spinal tenderness of VCF are classically localized to the midline, but referred or radicular pain in the flank or upper abdomen may also occur.&nbsp; The pain of VCF is typically self-limited, but alterations to spinal geometry (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44810.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) can contribute to other causes of back pain (eg, facet arthropathy) later.</li><li><strong>Cauda equina syndrome</strong> (spinal cord compression):&nbsp; Involves acute compression of nerve roots comprising the cauda equina (eg, by large disc herniation, infection, malignancy) that presents with radiculopathy (unilateral or bilateral), possible bladder and rectal sphincter paralysis, and sensory loss (saddle anesthesia) affecting the dermatomes of the involved nerve roots.&nbsp; It must be treated emergently to prevent permanent damage.</li></ul><p>Certain presentations of LBP are more likely to signal a nonmechanical cause.&nbsp; Characteristics include the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Malignancy</strong>:&nbsp; Often a deep, gnawing pain that can present acutely (eg, pathologic fracture); it may be worse at night and unrelieved with rest or other typical pain relief measures.&nbsp; LBP may be associated with weight loss or other systemic symptoms.&nbsp; Pre-existing malignancy or cancer risk factors (eg, smoking) are often present.</li><li><strong>Visceral pain</strong>:&nbsp; Corresponding gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms (eg, vomiting, nausea, jaundice) suggesting referred pain from disease in abdominal or pelvic organs (eg, pancreatitis, nephrolithiasis).</li><li><strong>Infection (eg, spinal epidural abscess, osteomyelitis)</strong>:&nbsp; Persistent, increasing, and/or severe pain accompanied by systemic features (eg, fever, malaise).&nbsp; Patients may have a history of risk factors (eg, immunocompromise, injection drug use) with neurologic signs (eg, hyporeflexia, radiculopathy).</li><li><strong>Inflammatory back pain (eg, ankylosing spondylitis)</strong>:&nbsp; Insidious onset of achy pain in a younger patient (eg, age &lt;40) that is often associated with significant morning stiffness (eg, &gt;30 minutes), worse with rest (eg, night, morning) but improved with activity.&nbsp; It may involve other extraspinal features (eg, uveitis, enthesitis).</li></ul><h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><p>Initial evaluation of LBP primarily emphasizes a problem-focused history and physical examination aimed at ruling out \"red flags\" suggesting nonmechanical causes, and judicious use of imaging and laboratory testing.</p><h2>History</h2><p>The clinical history in LBP should document the following features:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Location, onset, duration, and quality of pain</li><li>Aggravating and relieving factors</li><li>Associated symptoms</li><li>Medical history and risk factors for specific etiologies</li></ul><h2>Physical examination</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Inspection and palpation of spine and paraspinal muscles</li><li>Range of motion</li><li>Neurologic examination (especially sensation, motor strength, and reflexes)</li></ul><p>Provocative maneuvers include the straight-leg raising test (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/74668.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Patients with sciatica may have worsening of their radicular pain when the symptomatic leg is extended at the knee and the hip is passively flexed by the examiner.<p></p><h2>Red flag features</h2><p>Certain high-risk features should be screened for in the initial evaluation of LBP in all patients.&nbsp; These red flag features increase the risk for a serious etiology of pain and sometimes warrant a more aggressive diagnostic evaluation.&nbsp; Examples include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Systemic symptoms</strong>:&nbsp; Fever, unexplained weight loss, pain worse at night</li><li><strong>High-risk comorbidities</strong>:&nbsp; Cancer, immunocompromised status, osteoporosis, autoimmune disease, age ≥60</li><li><strong>High-risk medications or drugs</strong>:&nbsp; Anticoagulant, glucocorticoid, or intravenous drug use</li><li><strong>Severe neurologic deficits</strong>:&nbsp; Progressive weakness, symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (urinary or fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia)</li><li><strong>Point tenderness</strong> on the spine (concerning for spinal abscess)</li><li><strong>Known significant spinal trauma</strong> (eg, motor vehicle collision)</li></ul><h2>Laboratory tests</h2><p>Laboratory testing is not usually needed in evaluation of LBP.&nbsp; For patients with red flags suggestive of inflammatory disorders (eg, vasculitis, neoplasm, inflammatory arthritis), the following tests are recommended:</p><ul><li><strong>Inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein)</strong> are elevated in infection, inflammatory arthritis, or malignancy.</li><li><strong>Complete blood count (CBC)</strong> may show leukocytosis in infections or anemia in malignancy.</li><li><strong>Serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase</strong> are elevated in destructive bone conditions (eg, osteoblastic metastasis).</li></ul><h2>Imaging studies</h2><p>In the absence of red flag features, imaging in acute (eg, &lt;4-6 weeks), uncomplicated LBP has low sensitivity and specificity, is not associated with improved health outcomes (possibly increasing patient morbidity due to unnecessary or ineffective procedures as well as health care costs), and is not indicated.&nbsp; Diagnostic imaging in patients without malignancy risk factors is reserved primarily for when symptoms do not improve after 6 weeks of conservative therapy:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Plain radiographs</strong> are useful for detecting fractures, certain types of inflammation (eg, sacroiliitis), or significant degenerative changes.</li><li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> is the preferred modality for assessing disc pathology, spinal stenosis, infections, and neoplasms in patients with persistent pain or red flag symptoms.&nbsp; MRI with contrast is recommended for evaluation of potential infection or malignancy.</li><li><strong>CT scan</strong> offers detailed bone visualization and can be used in cases in which MRI is contraindicated.</li><li><strong>Bone scan</strong> may be employed to detect occult fractures, osteomyelitis, or metastatic disease.</li></ul><p>A summary of imaging considerations in acute, nontraumatic back pain is shown in the accompanying flowchart (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L79730.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><h1>Management</h1><p>The management of mechanical LBP (not associated with red flags or other nonmechanical causes) depends on the chronicity and severity of symptoms (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/55555.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; For chronic pain, non-drug therapies (eg, exercise, physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy) are recommended as first-line options; medications are generally recommended as adjuncts to these therapies rather than stand-alone treatments.<p></p><h2>Nonpharmacologic management</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Activity modification</strong>:&nbsp; Continued activity (eg, moderate, low-impact exercise) has been associated with improved outcomes and is generally advisable for patients with mechanical LBP.&nbsp; Although activities that significantly exacerbate pain should be avoided, prolonged bed rest and other undue activity restrictions are associated with slower recovery.</li><li><strong>Physical treatment modalities</strong>:&nbsp; Exercise therapy (eg, physical therapy) is recommended in the management of chronic or subacute back pain even when pharmacologic treatments are used.&nbsp; For patients with chronic LBP, spinal manipulation and acupuncture may offer short-term relief, although long-term benefit is unclear.</li><li><strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>For chronic pain, treatment strategies (eg, offered by a clinical psychologist) that address negative thinking patterns and coping behaviors are associated with improved pain and disability outcomes compared to pharmacologic treatment alone.</li></ul><h2>Pharmacologic treatment</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</strong>:&nbsp; These are first-line therapy for most cases of LBP (especially in the acute setting) due to their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.&nbsp; Major side effects include gastrointestinal bleeding (due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis), worsening hypertension (due to sodium retention and reduced renal filtration), and possible increased cardiovascular disease risk (eg, COX-2 inhibitors).&nbsp; For these reasons, chronic NSAID therapy is not routinely recommended in high-risk patients, and topical NSAIDs are preferred whenever possible to minimize side effects.&nbsp; Acetaminophen likely has little to no benefit.</li><li><strong>Muscle relaxants</strong> (eg, cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine):&nbsp; These may be used for short-term relief of muscle spasms but can be associated with drowsiness and increased fall risk in older patients.&nbsp; Carisoprodol and benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam) have been advocated historically, but these medications carry a nontrivial risk for sedation and abuse potential, and their use has largely been supplanted by safer options.</li><li><strong>Antidepressants</strong>:&nbsp; Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, duloxetine) are generally safe and effective in chronic LBP and have additional benefits in patients with coexisting depression.&nbsp; Tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline) likely have small benefits but carry significant adverse effects (eg, drowsiness, constipation, fall risk).</li><li><strong>Opioids</strong> (eg, hydrocodone, oxycodone):&nbsp; These are generally not indicated for management of nontraumatic LBP as benefit is limited and often outweighed by significant adverse effects.&nbsp; Tramadol also has a generally unfavorable risk-benefit ratio in LBP.&nbsp; For most patients with severe, chronic LBP, additional nonpharmacologic therapies such as neuromodulation (eg, spinal cord stimulator) or possibly ablative procedures (eg, nerve block/rhizotomy) are alternative options.&nbsp; Opioids for chronic, severe LBP are reserved for use as part of a comprehensive pain management program only when all other treatment modalities (including interventional options) have been exhausted.&nbsp; In such cases, careful counseling and close monitoring (eg, regular pain assessment, medication review) are recommended.</li><li><strong>Epidural steroid injections</strong>:&nbsp; These can be considered in patients with radicular pain secondary to disc herniation or spinal stenosis, providing temporary relief by reducing inflammation around the nerve roots.&nbsp; Evidence does not support their use in nonradicular, nonspecific LBP.</li></ul><h2>Surgical management</h2><p>Surgery is rarely indicated for LBP due to lack of demonstrated benefit.&nbsp; Key indications include cauda equina syndrome or patients with severe, progressive motor deficit (in which urgent neurosurgical evaluation is warranted, rather than a trial of conservative therapy).&nbsp; In contrast, radicular symptoms and minor deficits associated with LBP (eg, mild foot drop) are not by themselves an indication for surgery as they often resolve with conservative measures.</p><p>Surgery may be performed on patients who have failed all conservative and nonsurgical interventional measures who have intractable symptoms that are significantly impairing their quality of life.&nbsp; Common procedures include spinal fusion (stabilization of the spine by fusing 2 or more vertebrae, such as in spondylolisthesis), and discectomy or laminectomy (removal of the disc or part of the vertebral arch to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots, as in spinal stenosis or disc herniation).&nbsp; However, especially for nonspecific LBP, such procedures are not associated with significant improvements in pain- and disability-related outcomes compared with conservative therapies.</p><h1>Prognosis</h1><p>The prognosis of LBP varies widely based on the underlying cause and the timeliness and appropriateness of treatment.&nbsp; Most cases of acute mechanical LBP (including disc herniation) resolve within weeks with conservative management.&nbsp; However, patients with chronic LBP, especially those with psychosocial factors or severe structural abnormalities, may experience prolonged symptoms and disability.</p><p>Prognostic factors associated with poor outcomes include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Chronicity of pain</strong>:&nbsp;
