It occurs most commonly on the dorsal wrist; other common sites include the volar wrist, digits, and feet.&nbsp; Because it contains mucinous fluid, it <strong>transilluminates</strong> with a penlight (in contrast to a solid mass that does not transilluminate).<p></p><br><br><p>Ganglion cysts are usually painless, and most patients seek medical attention because of cosmetic concerns or fear of malignancy.&nbsp; However, some patients may experience mild aches.&nbsp; When the ganglion cyst compresses a nerve, paresthesia or weakness can result.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of a ganglion cyst is usually obvious on inspection and can be confirmed on transillumination with a penlight.&nbsp; If in doubt, ultrasonography or MRI can confirm the diagnosis, but imaging is rarely necessary.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Lipoma</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11067.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; is a benign neoplasm caused by the proliferation of fat cells.&nbsp; It rarely occurs on the wrists and does not transilluminate on penlight examination due to its solid nature.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Synovial sarcoma</strong>:&nbsp; is a malignancy that presents as a mass adjacent to a joint, usually in a young adult.&nbsp; Unlike ganglion cysts, it is fixed (not mobile) and does not transilluminate.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tenosynovial giant cell tumor</strong>:&nbsp; presents as a solid mass, typically over the flexor tendons of the hand.&nbsp; Unlike ganglion cysts, it is fixed (not mobile) and does not transilluminate.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Epidermoid cysts</strong> (also known as epidermal inclusion cyst) present as smooth, firm nodules with a central punctum, not present in a ganglion cyst.&nbsp; Because an epidermoid cyst is filled with solid keratin, it does not transilluminate.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gouty tophus</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45633.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; is a hard, fixed, irregular, subcutaneous collection of uric acid crystals found in patients with advanced gout.&nbsp; Patients typically have a history of recurrent painful, swollen joints.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rheumatoid nodules</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45446.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; present as nontender subcutaneous nodules over pressure points (eg, olecranon process); they do not transilluminate.&nbsp; Patients also have accompanying symmetric joint swelling and characteristic joint deformities (eg, swan neck deformity, ulnar deviation).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>More than 50% of ganglion cysts resolve spontaneously and do not require treatment; therefore, asymptomatic cysts can be observed.</p><br><br><p>Symptomatic (eg, pain, paraesthesia from nerve compression) or cosmetically bothersome cysts can be treated with needle aspiration; however, recurrence is common (half recur within a year of aspiration).&nbsp; Surgical excision (of the cyst and its stalk) is often necessary for recurrent, symptomatic cysts.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Ganglion cysts are benign lesions with no malignant potential.&nbsp; Most resolve spontaneously without intervention.&nbsp; Surgical treatment for persistent or recurrent cysts usually affords excellent outcomes.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Ganglion cysts (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/61445.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are formed by connective tissue outpouchings from tendon sheaths, joint capsules, or bursae; they contain mucinous fluid and are encapsulated by connective tissue sacs.&nbsp; They typically present as painless, round, mobile, and firm subcutaneous nodules, located most commonly on wrists.&nbsp; When a ganglion cyst compresses on a nerve, paresthesia and weakness can develop.&nbsp; Diagnosis is made clinically.&nbsp; Asymptomatic cysts can be observed (due to high rates of spontaneous resolution); symptomatic cysts can be aspirated or surgically removed.<p></p>\n\n            "
