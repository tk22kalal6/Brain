Maintaining confidentiality upholds patient autonomy and promotes a trusting physician-patient relationship wherein patients feel comfortable sharing their medical concerns.&nbsp; Respecting patient privacy and confidentiality is mandated by federal law according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).&nbsp; However, breaking confidentiality is permitted, or required, in certain circumstances.</p>\n<h1>Protected health information</h1><br><br><p>Protected health information (PHI) is information that can identify the patient, including information about the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, services provided, and payments made for services.&nbsp; Medical personnel are ethically and legally obligated to keep PHI confidential, upholding the ethical principle of nonmaleficence because harm may occur to patients when PHI is disclosed to unauthorized persons or the public.</p>\n<h1>HIPAA Privacy Rule</h1><br><br><p>HIPAA's Privacy Rule establishes legal standards that medical professionals and other health care entities (eg, insurance plans, health care clearinghouses) must follow to protect patients' PHI (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/58688.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Disclosing protected health information</h2><br><br><p>In general, PHI can be disclosed only with direct authorization by the patient, typically through verbal consent or a written release of information.</p>\n<h2>Exceptions to confidentiality</h2><br><br><p>Disclosing PHI without patient authorization is permitted when the information is necessary for providing medical care, for protecting anyone from immediate harm, or when required by law.</p><br><br><p><strong>Providing medical care</strong></p><br><br><p>PHI can be disclosed without patient authorization to support the provision of medical care in the following ways:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Treatment:&nbsp; Coordinating care among clinicians or others directly involved in a patient's care (eg, medical interpreter, specialist sending treatment notes to the patient's primary care physician).</li>\n\t<li>Payment:&nbsp; Facilitating billing and insurance claims (eg, physician's office sending diagnosis information to a health insurance company to obtain reimbursement).</li>\n\t<li>Health care operations:&nbsp; Supporting quality improvement and administrative activities (eg, regulatory agency requesting clinical information to ensure that documentation standards are met).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Imminent risk of harm to self/others</strong></p><br><br><p>Breaking patient confidentiality is permitted, or even mandated by law in some states, when the safety of the patient or others is at risk, including situations involving:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Suspected child, disabled person, or elder abuse (reporting laws for spousal abuse vary by state).</li>\n\t<li>Threats of harm to self or others and reasonable ability to carry out the threat in the near future.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Public health</strong></p><br><br><p>New diagnoses of communicable diseases (eg, HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis) must be reported, as mandated by state law, to the local public health department.</p><br><br><p>Regulations regarding HIV disclosure to endangered third parties vary, depending on location.&nbsp; Some states have laws (such as partner notification and duty to warn) that apply to health care providers, and some states criminalize the withholding of HIV status information.&nbsp; Other states have anonymous partner notification systems through the public health system.</p><br><br><p><strong>Law enforcement and judicial purposes</strong></p><br><br><p>PHI can be disclosed to law enforcement when required by law (eg, court orders, subpoenas).&nbsp; Disclosure is also permitted when law enforcement requests information about a crime (eg, knife or gunshot wounds).</p><br><br><p><strong>Incapacity in emergencies</strong></p><br><br><p>When a patient is incapacitated during a medical emergency, physicians are permitted to use their professional judgment to disclose basic information (eg, stating that a patient is stable) to family or friends, if it is in the best interest of the patient (eg, reassuring a distressed family member).&nbsp; However, further detailed information should be deferred until the patient can consent to its disclosure.</p>\n<h2>Patient rights to access their own protected health information</h2><br><br><p>Patients who have decision-making capacity have the right to authorize the release of their medical information, including to themselves.&nbsp; Any information (eg, laboratory results, imaging reports, progress notes, payment records) in the medical record, except for psychotherapy notes maintained outside the medical record or information related to a civil or criminal proceeding, must be disclosed to the patient on request.</p><br><br><p>Medical records must be released within 30 calendar days of the request and cannot be withheld due to a patient having an outstanding payment balance, although health care facilities can charge a nominal fee to print and/or mail medical records.</p>\n<h2>Protected health information and family members</h2><br><br><p>A physician may disclose PHI to family members only if the patient gives permission and has the capacity to give consent for disclosure.&nbsp; Family members who contact the physician for information about the patient should not be given any PHI without the patient's consent.&nbsp; Exceptions include situations when the family member is involved with the patient's medical care or payments (eg, relative picking up a prescription for the patient, parent calling the doctor's office to pay medical bills).</p><br><br><p>If a patient does not wish for family members to be informed of their PHI when they become incapacitated in the future, the patient should designate a durable power of attorney for health care.&nbsp; Without a durable power of attorney for health care, a surrogate decision maker is designated, which generally involves a family member by default (ie, next of kin).</p><br><br><p>A concerned family member or friend may offer additional information (eg, collateral information) that may affect patient care.&nbsp; The physician may receive such information but must be limited to passive listening.&nbsp; The physician can not reciprocate or engage in a discussion involving PHI without the patient's consent (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84025.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Protected health information and other medical professionals</h2><br><br><p>Physicians are prohibited from disclosing PHI to anyone not directly involved in a patient's medical care.&nbsp; This includes being prohibited from discussing PHI for educational purposes (eg, case presentations).&nbsp; Clinical information should be deidentified in these situations.</p>\n<h2>Genetic information</h2><br><br><p>Results of genetic testing, including hereditary conditions (eg, Huntington disease), are considered PHI.&nbsp; When discussing informed consent prior to genetic testing, physicians should counsel the patient about the importance of disclosing these results to potentially affected family members.&nbsp; However, these results are ultimately confidential if the patient does not permit disclosure unless there is an imminently modifiable risk to family members due to the genetic condition.</p><br><br><p>The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits health insurance companies and employers from intentionally obtaining or using genetic testing information to discriminate against the employee (eg, refusing disability coverage).</p>\n<h1>Confidentiality with adolescents</h1><br><br><p>Providing confidential care to adolescents requires balancing the adolescent's autonomy with the medical decision-making rights of parents/guardians.</p><br><br><p>Adolescents should have the opportunity to independently discuss sensitive topics with the physician and without the parent present.&nbsp; Confidentiality regarding sensitive topics (eg, mental health, drug use, sexual activity) reinforces a trusting physician-patient relationship, the adolescent's willingness to seek health care, and the development of the adolescent's independence.</p><br><br><p>However, confidentiality is conditional and adolescents should not be given false assurance of unconditional confidentiality.</p><br><br><p>Prior to initiating a confidential conversation, physicians should clearly inform adolescents that their parents/guardians or appropriate authorities must be notified of imminent risks of harm, such as life-threatening self-injurious and/or dangerous behaviors (eg, drunk driving), suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, abuse, or neglect.&nbsp; The adolescent should ideally be involved when this information is disclosed to their parents/guardians, although, ultimately, the parents/guardians must be notified even if the adolescent does not permit it.</p><br><br><p>Laws pertaining to parental disclosure differ by state.&nbsp; In some states, physicians are allowed to disclose issues related to sexual health, mental health, or substance use to parents/guardians without the adolescent's consent.</p>\n<h1>HIPAA Breach Notification Rule</h1><br><br><p>The HIPAA Breach Notification Rule mandates medical personnel to notify patients when their PHI is disclosed to an unauthorized person or for an improper purpose (ie, breach).&nbsp; The notification must include how the breach occurred, what information was disclosed and to whom, and what actions are being taken to mitigate the breach and prevent future disclosure.</p>\n<h2>Mitigating the risk for an information breach</h2><br><br><p>Procedures to prevent unauthorized disclosure include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Restricting physical access of unauthorized persons within health care facilities.</li>\n\t<li>Implementing device security measures (eg, password protection).</li>\n\t<li>Training employees about privacy policies.</li>\n\t<li>Avoiding discussion of patient information in public places (eg, elevators).</li>\n\t<li>Disclosing only the \"minimum necessary\" amount of PHI (ie, solely the information required to complete the specific request).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Patients have the right to privacy with respect to their protected health information (PHI).&nbsp; Physicians have an ethical duty to maintain patient confidentiality, which is also legally mandated by federal law according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.&nbsp; PHI should generally be disclosed only with patient consent.&nbsp; However, there are exceptions when PHI can be disclosed without a patient's authorization, such as to provide medical care, prevent imminent harm to the patient or others, or to comply with laws when required.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
