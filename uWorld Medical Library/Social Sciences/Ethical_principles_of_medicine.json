In some situations, these principles may conflict with each other, requiring physicians to prioritize certain ethical principles.</p>\n<h1>Autonomy</h1><br><br><p>Autonomy refers to the patient's right to make informed decisions about their own health care.&nbsp; This principle involves respecting the patient's capacity to make choices based on their values, preferences, and understanding of their health conditions.&nbsp; It also includes respecting a patient's desire to not know certain information about their condition (eg, patient declines to discuss biopsy results and requests they be shared with a family member instead).</p><br><br><p>Providing informed consent is central to patient autonomy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/59296.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Physicians must provide patients with information about their diagnosis as well as the benefits and risks of the recommended interventions, alternative treatment options, and nontreatment.&nbsp; Patients should have the opportunity to voluntarily consent to or refuse treatment without coercion.&nbsp; Physicians should be reasonably certain that patients have a conceptual understanding of the treatment.&nbsp; When this is in doubt, assessing the patient's decision-making capacity is imperative (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/34653.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Example:&nbsp; A patient who is hospitalized requests to be discharged while being treated for severe pneumonia.&nbsp; The patient, who is assessed to have decision-making capacity, is informed of the indications for continued inpatient treatment and the risks of nontreatment.&nbsp; The patient still desires to be discharged and is permitted to leave the hospital against medical advice.</p>\n<h1>Beneficence</h1><br><br><p>Beneficence obligates physicians to act in the patient's best interest.&nbsp; This includes advocating for the patient, providing treatments that reflect the standard of care, and promoting the patient's well-being.</p><br><br><p>Example:&nbsp; A patient with diabetes mellitus takes metformin but continues to have poor glucose control.&nbsp; The physician recommends a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist to be added for more optimal treatment.</p>\n<h1>Nonmaleficence</h1><br><br><p>Nonmaleficence is the obligation for physicians to do no harm.&nbsp; It requires them to avoid causing unnecessary harm or suffering to patients through their actions or omissions.&nbsp; Physicians must carefully weigh the potential benefits of any intervention against the possible risks and harm.&nbsp; If the risks outweigh the benefits, alternative approaches should be considered.</p><br><br><p>Example:&nbsp; A patient with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) desires estrogen-progestin menopausal hormone therapy (MHT).&nbsp; The physician does not prescribe MHT because it would significantly increase the risk for recurrent VTE.</p>\n<h1>Justice</h1><br><br><p>Justice refers to the fair distribution of resources, treatment, and opportunities among patients.&nbsp; It encompasses the idea that all patients should be treated equitably, without discrimination based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, or other characteristics.&nbsp; The principle of justice is involved in decisions about equitable resource distribution to ensure that limited resources have the greatest positive impact on society.</p><br><br><p>Example:&nbsp; Due to limited organ transplant availability, specific eligibility criteria are established for organ transplant allocation to prioritize recipients who will receive the greatest benefit.</p>\n<h1>Other ethical principles</h1><br><br><p><strong>Proportionality</strong> is the principle of appraising whether an intended therapeutic goal is worthwhile and whether the treatment is necessary, reasonable, and not excessive (eg, recommending conservative nonsurgical management for a minor, nondisplaced arm fracture rather than an inappropriately aggressive approach, such as emergency surgery).</p><br><br><p><strong>Veracity</strong> (truthfulness) is the principle of being honest and disclosing information, even when it is distressing (eg, diagnosis of terminal illness, risks related to a surgery).&nbsp; This principle respects patient autonomy and decision-making abilities, and it is the foundation of a trusting physician-patient relationship.</p>\n<h1>Conflicts between ethical principles</h1><br><br><p>In some situations, fundamental ethical principles may conflict with each other.&nbsp; Physicians should approach these scenarios by ensuring that all treatment options are presented, discussing associated benefits and risks of each, and engaging in shared decision-making with the patient.</p><br><br><p>Most commonly, beneficence and/or nonmaleficence may conflict with autonomy (eg, patient desires invasive biopsy procedures to evaluate incidental findings).&nbsp; Autonomy neither obligates the physician to provide inappropriate care nor condones decisions that are likely harmful, regardless of the patient's request.&nbsp; Nonmaleficence typically supersedes autonomy when the risk for harm outweighs benefits.&nbsp; In these cases, the patient's symptoms and concerns should be validated, their motivations (eg, fear of illness) and priorities should be explored, and alternate evidence-based treatment options should be presented.</p><br><br><p>In complex cases (eg, disagreements among the care team), an ethics committee, when available, can be consulted for guidance.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>The ethical principles (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/84197.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice are fundamental to practicing medicine.&nbsp; They provide a moral framework to guide physicians in delivering care that respects patients' rights, promotes their well-being, prevents harm, and ensures fairness.&nbsp; In cases when autonomy and nonmaleficence conflict, nonmaleficence typically takes precedence.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
