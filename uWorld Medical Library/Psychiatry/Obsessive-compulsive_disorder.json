Obsessions and compulsions are highly variable and can change over the course of illness.&nbsp; OCD symptoms are time-consuming and result in significant distress and functional impairment.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology </h1><br><br><p>The estimated lifetime prevalence rate for OCD is 1%-2%.&nbsp; Onset of symptoms typically occurs by adolescence or young adulthood.&nbsp; OCD is slightly more common among women than men.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Obsessions consist of recurrent thoughts (eg, fear of contamination), urges (eg, to punch someone), or images (eg, graphic violence) and are associated with significant distress (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L91999.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Attempts are made to ignore the obsessions or neutralize them with another action (compulsion).<p></p><br><br><p>Compulsions can be any repetitive behavior (eg, showering) or mental act (eg, silently counting) performed to reduce anxiety or prevent a dreaded event.&nbsp; The compulsions are not realistically connected to preventing the feared event from actually happening (eg, arranging books until \"just right\" due to fear of stabbing spouse) or are clearly excessive (eg, sanitizing baby bottles 5 times due to fear of contamination).</p><br><br><p>Although OCD can consist of obsessions or compulsions, the majority of patients experience both.&nbsp; Common themes include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cleaning:&nbsp; fear of contamination or germs resulting in frequent handwashing or showering</li>\n\t<li>Symmetry:&nbsp; need for order resulting in arranging items and counting</li>\n\t<li>Forbidden/taboo thoughts:&nbsp; aggressive, sexual, or religious thoughts resulting in associated compulsions (eg, seeking reassurance due to fear of being a pedophile, praying to neutralize aggressive urge)</li>\n\t<li>Harm:&nbsp; fear of hurting self or others resulting in associated compulsions (eg, fear of hitting someone while driving resulting in checking car for signs of damage)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Level of insight in OCD ranges from good/fair insight (majority of patients) to absent/delusional (rare) and can vary throughout the course of illness.</p><br><br><p>Comorbid psychiatric conditions are very common.&nbsp; The majority of patients with OCD have at some point also experienced an anxiety disorder or depression and about a third of patients with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder (eg, Tourette syndrome).</p><br><br><p>Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with an increased risk for new onset, recurrence, or exacerbation of OCD; obsessions and compulsions frequently center around fears of contaminating and harming the baby.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>For a diagnosis of OCD, the following criteria must be met:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both</strong>:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Obsessions</strong>:&nbsp; recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are intrusive and unwanted, causing marked anxiety or distress.&nbsp; Attempts are made to ignore or suppress the thoughts, urges, or images, or neutralize them with some other thought or action (compulsion).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Compulsions</strong>:&nbsp; repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.&nbsp; Behaviors and/or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety/distress, or preventing a dreaded situation; however, these behaviors and mental acts are not realistically connected to what they are preventing or are clearly excessive.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The obsessions or compulsions are <strong>time-consuming</strong> (eg, &gt;1 hour a day) or cause significant distress or functional impairment (eg, social, occupational, personal).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder</strong> (GAD):&nbsp; also associated with recurrent thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and reassurance seeking; however, these are about everyday, real-life concerns (eg, finances, health, performance) and are not associated with compulsions/ritualistic behaviors.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Body dysmorphic disorder</strong> (BDD):&nbsp; also characterized by obsessions and compulsions; however, they are limited to perceived defects in physical appearance and are associated with poorer insight.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tic disorders</strong>:&nbsp; can include recurrent motor movements (eg, eye blinking, sniffing) that result in a sense of relief, appearing similar to a compulsion; however, these movements are typically less complex than a compulsion and are not driven by obsessions; tic disorders and OCD can co-occur, in which case both diagnoses would be given.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder</strong>:&nbsp; can include an excessive preoccupation with order and details, perfectionism, and rigidity in thinking; however, it is not associated with obsessions, which are recurrent, unwanted, and intrusive, or compulsions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Occasional repetitive behaviors</strong>:&nbsp; double-checking that the door is locked or that the stove is off are very common examples, not associated with significant distress or functional impairment and not time-consuming.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sydenham chorea</strong>:&nbsp; autoimmune complication of group A <em>Streptococcus</em> infection caused by molecular mimicry (antistreptococcal antibodies cross-react with neuronal antigens in basal ganglia); obsessive-compulsive behaviors are accompanied by chorea, hypotonia, and emotional lability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>First-line treatment for OCD consists of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP) and/or pharmacotherapy with serotonergic antidepressants.&nbsp; Treatment with CBT/ERP may be more effective than pharmacotherapy alone, and combined treatment is recommended for severe symptoms.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>CBT/ERP:</strong>&nbsp; consists of gradual exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli that produce obsessional thoughts, followed by prevention of performing the associated compulsion; goal of treatment is to decrease obsessional distress without reliance on compulsions/rituals.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pharmacotherapy</strong>\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</strong> (SSRIs):&nbsp; considered first-line medication for OCD due to tolerability and efficacy; higher doses and longer trials are often necessary for symptom improvement.</li>\n\t\t<li>Clomipramine:&nbsp; a tricyclic antidepressant with relatively higher serotonergic activity that is reserved for patients unresponsive to 2 SSRI trials given its increased risk for adverse effects and toxicity concerns.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Comorbid conditions (anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders) are very common and require screening and treatment.&nbsp; OCD is also associated with an elevated suicide risk and requires screening for suicidal ideation, assessment of risk factors, and safety planning.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The course of illness is variable and dependent on multiple factors, including engagement in treatment, co-occuring conditions, level of insight, and age of onset.&nbsp; Most patients with untreated OCD and/or onset in childhood will continue to have lifetime symptoms.&nbsp; About 40% of patients that undergo treatment experience remission.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) involves persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive, time-consuming rituals (compulsions) that are aimed at alleviating anxiety (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/73124.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; OCD is associated with an elevated risk of comorbid psychiatric conditions as well as suicidality.&nbsp; First-line treatment consists of cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
