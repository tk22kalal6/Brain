Symptom presentation, course of illness, and prognosis are highly variable, although most patients experience episodic symptom exacerbations and chronic functional impairment.</p><h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><p>The estimated lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is approximately 1%.&nbsp; Prevalence rates are similar in men and women.&nbsp; Symptom onset is typically between late adolescence and early adulthood (eg, mid-20s).</p><p>Factors that may contribute to the risk of developing schizophrenia include genetic predisposition (eg, first-degree relative with schizophrenia), environmental factors (eg, autoimmune disorders [celiac disease, thyrotoxicosis], cannabis use), and psychologic factors (eg, adverse childhood experiences).</p><h1>Pathogenesis</h1><p>The pathogenesis of schizophrenia is unclear, although it likely involves a combination of genetic vulnerabilities, neuropathology, and environmental factors such as:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Neuroanatomic changes (reduced gray matter volume in the prefrontal lobe, enlarged cerebral ventricles)</li><li>Glucose hypometabolism in the frontal cortex</li><li>Abnormal neurotransmitter signaling, such as excess dopamine concentration in the mesolimbic pathway (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L17787.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (associated with positive psychotic symptoms, target of antipsychotics) and decreased NMDA glutamate receptor activity.</li></ul><h1>Clinical presentation</h1><p>Schizophrenia presents with a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional symptoms (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/38462.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) that impair functioning.&nbsp; Psychotic symptoms can be described as <strong>positive</strong> (\"pathologic excesses\" such as hallucinations or delusions) or <strong>negative</strong> (\"pathologic deficits\" such as apathy).<p></p><p><strong>Delusions</strong> are fixed, false beliefs that do not change even when met with contradictory evidence.&nbsp; They can be implausible (eg, belief that aliens removed the internal organs) or plausible (eg, belief that a terrorist group hacked the personal laptop).&nbsp; Varying themes of delusions can include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Persecutory:&nbsp; belief that the self is being harmed or threatened by another person or group</li><li>Referential:&nbsp; belief that certain environmental cues or comments are directed at the self (eg, message on billboard pertains to the patient)</li><li>Grandiose:&nbsp; belief that the self is extraordinary in some way (eg, wealth, fame, abilities)</li><li>Erotomanic:&nbsp; belief that another person is in love with the self</li><li>Somatic:&nbsp; belief about one's health or organ systems (eg, belief about having leukemia despite normal diagnostic studies)</li><li>Nihilistic:&nbsp; belief that the self or the world does not exist or is on the verge of destruction (eg, patient believes the self is already dead)</li></ul><p><strong>Hallucinations</strong> are perceptions that are experienced in the absence of an external stimulus and can be associated with any of the senses (eg, auditory, visual, tactile).&nbsp; Auditory hallucinations are the most common in primary psychotic disorders and are usually experienced as voices.</p><p><strong>Disorganized speech</strong> is an observable sign of a thought disorder, which is one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia.&nbsp; Examples include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Tangentiality:&nbsp; Initial response is indirectly related to the question, but the patient shifts to ideas that are increasingly off-topic without returning to the original idea.</li><li>Incoherence (word salad):&nbsp; Patient responds with words and phrases that have no meaning (eg, \"They you up me them.\").</li></ul><p><strong>Grossly disorganized behavior</strong> can include unpredictable agitation, intense emotional responses (eg, continuously laughing for no apparent reason), or wearing clothing that is inappropriate for the weather (eg, 4 layers of clothing in extremely hot weather).&nbsp; Catatonic behaviors can also be seen in schizophrenia and may include mutism, purposeless motor activity, maintenance of abnormal postures, and staring.</p><p><strong>Negative</strong> symptoms include <strong>diminished emotional expression</strong> (decreased eye contact, facial expressions, and/or body movements), <strong>alogia</strong> (decreased speech output), <strong>avolition</strong> (minimal or no participation in purposeful activities such as work or socialization), and <strong>anhedonia</strong> (little or no interest in or enjoyment of activities).</p><p>Additional features associated with schizophrenia can include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Mood symptoms (eg, low mood, anger, lability)</li><li>Anxiety (panic attacks, phobias)</li><li>Sleep disturbances (eg, daytime sleeping with nocturnal awakening)</li><li>Somatic concerns (may be delusional)</li><li>Lack of awareness or insight of symptoms/disorder</li><li>Neurologic symptoms (eg, impaired motor coordination, left-right confusion)</li><li>Cognitive deficits (impaired language, memory, executive functioning)</li></ul><p>There are 3 phases of illness in schizophrenia:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Prodromal phase</strong>:&nbsp; involves the gradual development of negative symptoms, mood changes, sleep disturbances, and cognitive deficits.</li><li><strong>Active phase</strong>:&nbsp; includes positive symptoms (eg, hallucinations, delusions), disorganized speech and behaviors, as well as negative symptoms (eg, avolition, alogia).</li><li><strong>Residual phase</strong>:&nbsp; consists of persistent negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, and attenuated active-phase symptoms (eg, ideas of reference that are not of a delusional quality).</li></ul><h1>Diagnosis</h1><p>For a diagnosis of schizophrenia to be made, the following criteria must be met:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>≥2 of the following</strong>, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (less if successfully treated).&nbsp; At least 1 must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech:<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Delusions</strong></li><li><strong>Hallucinations</strong></li><li><strong>Disorganized speech</strong></li><li><strong>Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior</strong></li><li><strong>Negative symptoms</strong></li></ul></li></ul><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, the level of functioning in 1 or more major areas (eg, work, interpersonal relations, self-care) is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset.</li><li>Continuous signs of the <strong>disturbance persist for at least 6 months</strong>.&nbsp; This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms (less if successfully treated) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms.&nbsp; During prodromal or residual periods, signs of the disturbance may include only negative symptoms or symptoms present in attenuated form (eg, magical thinking that is not delusional, unusual perceptual experiences).</li><li>Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either:<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>No major depressive or manic episodes have occurred with the active-phase symptoms.<br>OR</li><li>If mood episodes have occurred with active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.</li></ul></li><li>The disturbance is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance (eg, recreational substance, medication) or another medical condition.</li></ul><h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><p>When considering the differential diagnosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/38889.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) for psychotic symptoms, the duration of symptoms and level of functional impairment are distinguishing factors:<p></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Brief psychotic disorder</strong>:&nbsp; is also characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech.&nbsp; However, the duration of symptoms is much shorter, lasting at least 1 day but less than 1 month with a full return to premorbid functioning.</li><li><strong>Delusional disorder</strong>:&nbsp; also presents with delusions that can be associated with hallucinations.&nbsp; However, the hallucinations are not prominent and are related only to the delusion; there are no associated negative symptoms, disorganized speech, or disorganized behaviors.</li><li><strong>Schizophreniform disorder</strong>:&nbsp; involves the same set of symptoms as schizophrenia but is time-limited (ie, the duration of symptoms must be less than 6 months).</li><li><strong>Schizoaffective disorder</strong>:&nbsp; is characterized by the same active-phase symptoms as schizophrenia, but a major depressive or manic episode must exist with the active phase.&nbsp; In addition, delusions or hallucinations must occur for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood episode.</li><li><strong>Substance-induced psychotic disorder</strong>:&nbsp; also presents with prominent delusions and/or hallucinations.&nbsp; However, there must be evidence on the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of substance use that is capable of causing psychosis (eg, alcohol withdrawal, amphetamine intoxication); remission of symptoms is usually associated with an absence of substance use.</li><li><strong>Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition</strong>:&nbsp; also involves hallucinations or delusions.&nbsp; However, clinical findings of a pathophysiologic process known to cause psychosis are identified (eg, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury).</li></ul><h1>Evaluation and diagnostic work-up</h1><p>The large overlap of psychotic symptoms with other medical conditions requires a thorough history, physical examination, and diagnostic work-up.</p><p>Factors that suggest primary psychotic illness include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Age of onset &lt;40</strong></li><li><strong>Prodromal period</strong> (vs acute onset of symptoms)</li><li><strong>Auditory hallucinations</strong> (vs visual, gustatory, tactile)</li><li><strong>Family history of psychiatric illness</strong></li></ul><p>Laboratory evaluation should include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Chemistry panel</li><li>Complete blood count with differential</li><li>Liver function tests</li><li>Thyroid function tests</li><li>Vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> level</li><li>Urine drug screen</li><li>Urinalysis</li><li>HIV serology</li></ul><p>Further diagnostic evaluation may be indicated depending on clinical findings:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Wilson disease (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32077.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (ataxia, dysarthria, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function testing):&nbsp;

<strong>Social skills training</strong> consists of behavioral techniques to improve social skills and apply them to specific problems and activities (eg, initiating conversations, negotiating interpersonal situations): training targets negative symptoms<strong>.&nbsp; Psychotherapy</strong> focuses on modalities that are goal-oriented, are structured, and emphasize psychoeducation such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and family therapy (depending on the amount of contact with family members).</li></ul><p>Because of hallucinations and delusions, especially those that are persecutory, there is a risk for self-harm, agitation, and aggression.&nbsp; Schizophrenia is associated with a higher risk for suicidality (~5% of patients die by suicide; ~20% attempt suicide).&nbsp; Screening for suicidal and homicidal ideation, assessing risk factors, and planning for safety are necessary to determine an appropriate level of care.&nbsp; Hospitalization may be required for those at imminent risk for harming themselves or others.</p><p>Substance use disorders are highly comorbid with schizophrenia (majority of patients have tobacco use disorder) and can contribute to nonadherence to medication regimens, as well as worsening psychosis; appropriate screening and psychosocial interventions are recommended.&nbsp; Depression and anxiety disorders are also more common among patients and warrant treatment.</p><h1>Prognosis</h1><p>The prognosis of schizophrenia is highly variable and dependent on multiple factors (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/42629.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 7\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Patients with negative and/or cognitive symptoms tend to have a poorer outcome because these are less responsive to antipsychotic medication.&nbsp; Early and intensive intervention is associated with an improved prognosis.&nbsp; The majority of patients have recurrent psychotic episodes with chronic functional impairments; a minority of patients experience recovery (&gt;2 years of minimal or no symptoms) after the initial psychotic episode.&nbsp; Life expectancy is decreased due to medical conditions associated with schizophrenia (eg, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease) and may be influenced by adverse medication effects, decreased access to health care, substance use disorders, and lifestyle factors (eg, diet, exercise).<p></p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Schizophrenia (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/41553.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 8\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is characterized by psychosis (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thoughts and behaviors, negative symptoms) of ≥6 months in duration with social and occupational impairment.&nbsp;
