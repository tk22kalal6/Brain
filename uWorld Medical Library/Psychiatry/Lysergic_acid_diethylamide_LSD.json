Some individuals report euphoria or feelings of spiritual insight, whereas others may experience severe dysphoria, anxiety, or paranoia.&nbsp; LSD is a recreational drug of abuse that does not cause physical dependence.&nbsp; Most individuals engage in infrequent or episodic use, and addiction is uncommon.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Younger age, particularly adolescence and young adulthood.</li>\n\t<li>Prior use of other psychoactive substances (eg, psilocybin, MDMA).</li>\n\t<li>Mental health disorders, especially anxiety, depression, or personality disorders.</li>\n\t<li>Peer influence, recreational party culture, and history of polysubstance use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>LSD primarily acts as a partial agonist at serotonin (5-HT2A) receptors in the brain, especially in the prefrontal cortex.&nbsp; This leads to altered sensory perception, mood changes, and disruption of time perception and thought processes.&nbsp; Secondary effects on dopamine and glutamate signaling may contribute to euphoria, arousal, and sympathetic activation.</p>\n<h1>Pharmacokinetics</h1><br><br><p>LSD is most commonly ingested orally, typically via a small sheet of absorbent blotter paper that has been infused with the drug.&nbsp; It is also available in tablets, capsules, or liquid solutions.&nbsp; The onset of action is typically within 30 to 90 minutes after ingestion; peak effects occur at 3-5 hours, and the primary experience lasts 8-12 hours.&nbsp; In some cases, mild residual effects (eg, altered perception, mood fluctuations) may persist for up to 24-48 hours, particularly following higher doses.&nbsp; The intensity of LSD's effects is dose dependent, with larger amounts producing more pronounced perceptual and psychological alterations.</p>\n<h1>LSD intoxication</h1><br><br><p>Most patients remain alert and oriented, aware that their experiences are related to LSD use.&nbsp; Clinical manifestations of intoxication may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Perceptual changes</strong>:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Visual, colorful hallucinations</strong> (eg, geometric shapes, kaleidoscope imagery).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Synesthesia</strong> (eg, hearing colors, seeing sounds).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Altered sense of time and space</strong>.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Distorted perception</strong> of shapes and sizes of objects.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Psychological effects</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Euphoria</strong>, introspection (\"spiritual awakening\").</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Depersonalization</strong> (sense of being outside the body) and derealization (dreamlike state).</li>\n\t\t<li>Impaired judgement.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Anxiety, paranoia, panic</strong>: Negative experience referred to as a \"bad trip.\"</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Physical signs (sympathomimetic effects):&nbsp;

Causes delusions and hallucinations that are typically persecutory and paranoid (not vivid and colorful) in nature.&nbsp; In addition, methamphetamine is associated with intense psychomotor agitation and marked (not mild) tachycardia and hypertension.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Marijuana intoxication</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/116588.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Typically causes euphoria and mild perceptual distortions, along with physical signs such as red eyes, increased appetite, slowed reflexes, and impaired coordination.&nbsp; Vivid visual hallucinations are not characteristic.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Severe alcohol withdrawal</strong> (ie, delirium tremens) (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32062.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

Characterized by delusions, hallucinations (most often auditory), disorganized speech/behavior, and negative symptoms (eg, affect flattening) for ≥6 months.&nbsp; The hallucinogenic effects of LSD resolve as the drug is metabolized, whereas primary psychotic disorders have a more chronic and pervasive pattern.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anticholinergic toxidrome</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/66335.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; May cause agitation, disorientation, and hallucinations, but these findings are often accompanied by significant confusion; dry, flushed skin; urinary retention; and reduced bowel sounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>LSD intoxication is diagnosed clinically based on reported drug use and characteristic symptoms (eg, vivid visual hallucinations, depersonalization).&nbsp; Standard urine drug screens do not detect LSD.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Routine laboratory testing is typically unnecessary for acute LSD intoxication, but it may be indicated if the diagnosis is unclear (eg, no history of LSD use) or if there is concern for coingestions or complications.</p><br><br><p>Imaging is generally unnecessary unless the patient demonstrates somnolence or focal neurologic deficits; these raise concern for intracranial pathology (eg, hemorrhage) and warrant a CT scan of the head.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>There is no specific antidote for LSD intoxication; symptoms usually resolve spontaneously with time.&nbsp; However, distressing symptoms (during a \"bad trip\") can be managed with supportive care (calm, quiet, low-stimulation environment to reduce sensory overload) and possible pharmacologic management with benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam).&nbsp; Antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol) may be required if psychotic symptoms persist despite benzodiazepine therapy.&nbsp; Patients should be monitored closely until their symptoms resolve.</p>\n<h1>LSD withdrawal</h1><br><br><p>LSD does not produce a classic physical withdrawal syndrome, but patients may exhibit symptoms of psychological withdrawal after ceasing use.&nbsp; These may include fatigue, depression, anhedonia, irritability, insomnia, and cravings.</p>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>Although most individuals recover fully after LSD intoxication, some develop long-term psychiatric complications, particularly individuals with underlying mental illness.&nbsp; Complications may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Persistent psychosis or mood disorders, such as depression or anxiety.</li>\n\t<li>Flashbacks:&nbsp; Brief, spontaneous recurrences of LSD-like perceptual experiences that may occur months to years after use.&nbsp; Flashbacks are typically transient and not distressing.</li>\n\t<li>Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD):&nbsp; A condition characterized by recurrent perceptual distortions (eg, flashes of color, halos around objects, visual trails) long after LSD use has ceased.&nbsp; HPPD symptoms are often distressing, can interfere with daily functioning, and may persist for weeks, months, or longer.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Fatalities from LSD use are rare and typically occur from accidental trauma (eg, falls, drowning) during acute intoxication.&nbsp; LSD does not cause physiologic toxicity or direct organ injury, and no deaths have been directly attributed to its pharmacologic effects.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>LSD has a low potential for physical dependence and addiction, and most individuals use the drug only sporadically.&nbsp; Peer groups (eg, Narcotics Anonymous), cognitive-behavioral therapy, and management of cooccurring psychiatric conditions are useful to promote sustained abstinence in individuals with psychological dependence.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a hallucinogenic drug of abuse that profoundly alters sensory perception, mood, and cognition.&nbsp; Intoxication is typically characterized by vivid visual hallucinations, distorted time perception, and euphoria.&nbsp; However, some individuals may experience intense anxiety, paranoia, or panic attacks.&nbsp; Management of acute intoxication is primarily supportive because symptoms usually resolve spontaneously over several hours.&nbsp; Although most individuals recover fully, a minority may develop long-term psychiatric complications.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
