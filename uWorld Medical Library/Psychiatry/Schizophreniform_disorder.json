If symptoms persist beyond 6 months, the diagnosis is changed to schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The lifetime prevalence rate of schizophreniform disorder is estimated to be 0.1%.&nbsp; Prevalence rates are similar in men and women, and symptom onset is typically between late adolescence and early adulthood.</p><br><br><p>Factors that may contribute to the risk for schizophreniform disorder include genetic (first-degree relative with schizophrenia or psychotic mood disorder) and environmental (eg, low birth weight, adverse childhood event, trauma).</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The pathogenesis of schizophreniform disorder is unclear, although it may be related to glutamatergic signaling disruptions, as well as abnormalities of the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and hippocampus.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Schizophreniform disorder includes the <strong>same symptoms as schizophrenia</strong> (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms), although they tend to be more abrupt in onset and are experienced for a <strong>shorter duration</strong> (<strong>&lt;6 months</strong>).</p><br><br><p><strong>Delusions</strong> are fixed, false beliefs that do not change even when met with contradictory evidence.&nbsp; They can be bizarre and clearly implausible (eg, belief that aliens removed internal organs) or nonbizarre (eg, terrorist group hacked personal laptop).&nbsp; Varying themes of delusions can include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Persecutory:&nbsp; belief that one is being harmed or threatened by another person or group</li>\n\t<li>Referential:&nbsp; belief that certain environmental cues or comments are directed at oneself (eg, message on billboard pertains to the individual)</li>\n\t<li>Grandiose:&nbsp; belief that the patient is extraordinary in some way (eg, wealth, fame, abilities)</li>\n\t<li>Erotomanic:&nbsp; false belief that another person is in love with them</li>\n\t<li>Somatic:&nbsp; false belief about health or organ system (eg, patients believe they have leukemia despite normal diagnostic studies)</li>\n\t<li>Nihilistic:&nbsp; belief that oneself or the world does not exist or is on the verge of destruction (eg, individuals believe they are already dead)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Hallucinations</strong> are perceptions that are experienced in the absence of an external stimulus and can be associated with any of the senses (eg, auditory, visual, tactile).&nbsp; Auditory hallucinations are the most common in schizophreniform and primary psychotic disorders and are usually experienced as voices.</p><br><br><p><strong>Disorganized speech</strong> is an observable sign of a thought disorder, which is one of the core symptoms of schizophreniform and schizophrenia.&nbsp; Examples include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Tangentiality:&nbsp; Initial response is indirectly related to the question, although the patient shifts to ideas that are increasingly off-topic without returning to the original idea</li>\n\t<li>Incoherence (word salad):&nbsp; response with words and phrases that have no meaning (eg, \"They you up me them.\")</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Grossly disorganized behavior</strong> can include unpredictable agitation, intense emotional responses (eg, continuously laughing for no apparent reason), or wearing clothing that is inappropriate for the weather (eg, 4 layers of clothing in extremely hot weather).&nbsp; <strong>Catatonic behaviors</strong> can also be seen in schizophreniform disorder and may include mutism, purposeless motor activity, maintenance of abnormal postures, and staring.</p><br><br><p>Negative symptoms are less common in schizophreniform disorder (when compared to schizophrenia).&nbsp; They can include diminished emotional expression (decreased eye contact, facial expressions, and/or body movements), alogia (decreased speech output), and avolition (minimal or no participation in purposeful activities such as work or socialization).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>For a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder, the following criteria must be met:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>≥2 of the following</strong>, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated), are present.&nbsp; At least one of these must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech:<br><br>\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Delusions</li>\n\t\t<li>Hallucinations</li>\n\t\t<li>Disorganized speech</li>\n\t\t<li>Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior</li>\n\t\t<li>Negative symptoms</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>An episode of the disorder lasts <strong>≥1 month</strong> but <strong>&lt;6 months</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Schizoaffective</strong> disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been <strong>ruled out</strong> because either:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>No major depressive or manic episodes have occurred <strong>concurrently</strong> with the active-phase symptoms OR</li>\n\t\t<li>If mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The disturbance is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance (eg, recreational substances, medication) or another medical condition.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Schizophreniform disorder is often a provisional diagnosis that requires longitudinal monitoring; <strong>if symptoms persist for ≥6 months, the diagnosis is changed</strong> to either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (if prominent mood symptoms are also present).</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>When the differential diagnosis for psychotic symptoms is considered, the duration of symptoms and level of functional impairment are distinguishing factors (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/38889.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Brief psychotic disorder</strong>:&nbsp;

however, the hallucinations are not prominent and are related only to the delusion.&nbsp; There are no associated negative symptoms, disorganized speech, or disorganized behaviors.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Schizophrenia</strong> involves the same set of symptoms as schizophreniform disorder, although the diagnosis must also include significant functional impairment; the duration of symptoms is at least 6 months and the course of illness is chronic.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Substance-induced psychotic disorder</strong>:&nbsp; also presents with prominent delusions and/or hallucinations; however, there must be evidence in the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of substance use that is capable of causing psychosis (eg, alcohol withdrawal, amphetamine intoxication).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition</strong>:&nbsp; also involves hallucinations or delusions; however, clinical findings of a pathophysiologic process known to cause psychosis are identified (eg, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Evaluation and diagnostic work-up</h1><br><br><p>The large overlap of psychotic symptoms with other medical conditions requires a thorough history, physical examination, and diagnostic work-up.</p><br><br><p>Factors that suggest primary psychotic illness include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Age of onset &lt;40</li>\n\t<li>Prodromal period (vs acute onset of symptoms)</li>\n\t<li>Auditory hallucinations (vs visual, gustatory, tactile)</li>\n\t<li>Family history of psychiatric illness</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation should include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Chemistry panel to assess for electrolyte and fluid imbalances</li>\n\t<li>Complete blood count with differential</li>\n\t<li>Liver function tests</li>\n\t<li>Thyroid function tests</li>\n\t<li>Vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> level</li>\n\t<li>Urine drug screen</li>\n\t<li>Urinalysis</li>\n\t<li>HIV serology</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Further diagnostic evaluation may be indicated depending on the clinical findings:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Wilson disease (ataxia, dysarthria, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function testing) (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32077.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ): serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper excretion</li>\n\t<li>Heavy metal poisoning (cognitive deficits, ataxia, choreoathetosis, polyneuropathy): heavy metal screening</li>\n\t<li>Systemic lupus erythematosus (arthralgia, photosensitivity, constitutional symptoms) (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31457.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ): erythrocyte sedimentation rate and antinuclear antibodies</li>\n\t<li>Seizure activity: electroencephalography</li>\n\t<li>Stroke or dementia (focal weakness, cognitive/speech impairment): CT scan of the head, MRI of the brain</li>\n\t<li>Autoimmune encephalitis (catatonic symptoms, seizures, cognitive impairment, autonomic instability): antibody testing of cerebrospinal fluid and serum</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Schizophreniform disorder is typically a provisional diagnosis (ie, a temporary diagnosis that requires more information).&nbsp; Longitudinal monitoring is necessary to understand the duration of symptoms and determine a final diagnosis: schizophreniform disorder if the symptoms resolve within 6 months versus schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder if the symptoms persist beyond 6 months.</p><br><br><p>Because of delusions and hallucinations, especially those that are persecutory in nature, there is a risk for self-harm, agitation, and aggression.&nbsp; Screening for suicidal and homicidal ideation, assessing risk factors, and planning for safety are necessary to determine an appropriate level of care.&nbsp; Hospitalization may be required for those at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.</p><br><br><p>Treatment of schizophreniform disorder includes pharmacotherapy with antipsychotic medication and benzodiazepines if necessary, as well as psychotherapy:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pharmacotherapy</strong>:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Second-generation antipsychotics</strong> (SGAs) (eg, risperidone, aripiprazole) are preferred over first-generation antipsychotics (FGA) (eg, haloperidol).<br><br>\t\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t\t<li>Improved tolerability and risk profile occur with SGAs (relatively decreased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Medication is gradually tapered and discontinued after sustained symptom remission (eg, 1 year); close monitoring for recurrence is necessary</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam) may be necessary for severe agitation/anxiety or if catatonic symptoms are present.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Psychotherapy</strong>:&nbsp; Psychotherapy focuses on modalities that are goal-oriented, are structured, and emphasize psychoeducation.&nbsp; Examples include cognitive-behavioral therapy and family therapy (depending on the age and living situation of the patient).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Schizophreniform disorder can occur with depressive and anxiety symptoms.&nbsp; Screening and providing appropriate treatment recommendations are necessary.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of schizophreniform disorder is variable: Approximately a third of patients experience a full recovery, whereas a majority of the remaining patients develop chronic symptoms consistent with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.&nbsp; Positive prognostic indicators include acute onset of psychotic symptoms, confusion, high premorbid functioning, absence of blunted or flat affect, and early treatment intervention.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Schizophreniform disorder involves ≥2 psychotic symptoms—delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms—that last ≥1 month and &lt;6 months.&nbsp; Diagnosis is typically provisional; longitudinal monitoring is required to determine whether symptoms resolve within 6 months (schizophreniform disorder) or persist (schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder).&nbsp; Treatment consists of antipsychotic medication (second-generation antipsychotics) and psychotherapy.</p>\n\n            "
