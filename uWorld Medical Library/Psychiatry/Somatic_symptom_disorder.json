Symptoms (eg, pain, fatigue, weakness) are interpreted as serious and possibly having catastrophic health consequences, causing high health care utilization.&nbsp; Somatic symptoms are authentic and cause emotional and physical suffering, though they may not be explained by a recognized medical condition.</p><h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><p>The estimated prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is 5%-9% in the general population and 15% among primary care patients.&nbsp; Prevalence rates are higher in females (10:1 ratio).</p><p>Factors that may contribute to the risk of developing somatic symptom disorder can be psychologic (eg,&nbsp;concurrent anxiety or depressive disorder, first-degree relative with chronic illness) environmental (eg, recent stressful or health-related life event), and genetic.</p><h1>Clinical presentation</h1><p>Somatic symptoms must be distressing and associated with a disproportionate level of health-related anxiety, thoughts, or behaviors:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Fear of catastrophic consequences from symptoms despite normal examination/results and reassurance</li><li>Self-perception as weak/unhealthy</li><li>Demoralization related to health status and symptoms</li><li>High healthcare utilization (eg, multiple evaluations for various symptoms, requests for repeat testing)</li><li>Excessive body checking (eg, assessing blood pressure multiple times a day, performing daily breast examinations)</li><li>Extensive record keeping of vital signs and/or symptoms (eg, journal, spreadsheet)</li><li>Time-consuming online research of symptoms and potential complications</li><li>Avoidance of physical activity/exercise due to fear of worsening symptoms</li></ul><p>The symptoms frequently become central to a patient's identity and are a daily focus, straining interpersonal relationships and impacting occupational functioning.</p><p>Somatic symptoms are highly variable and can include any organ system.&nbsp; Children typically have a single somatic symptom, most commonly abdominal pain, headaches, fatigue, or nausea.&nbsp; Adults commonly present with localized pain (eg, joint pain, back pain, headache), though they often have multiple physical symptoms.</p><p>A diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder is unrelated to whether the physical symptoms can be medically explained; instead, it is based on the development of disproportionate and disruptive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in response to physical symptoms.</p><h1>Diagnosis</h1><p>For a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder, the following criteria must be met:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life</li><li>Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns, with at least 1 of the following:<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one's symptoms</li><li>Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms</li><li>Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns</li></ul></li><li>Persistent somatic symptoms that are experienced for &gt;6 months</li></ul><h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><p>The differential diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder includes (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/38873.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Illness anxiety disorder</strong>:&nbsp; also includes persistent and excessive health-related anxiety and behaviors; however, somatic symptoms are minimal or not present at all.</li><li><strong>Functional neurological symptom disorder</strong> (conversion disorder):&nbsp; also characterized by somatic symptoms, specifically neurologic symptoms and findings; however, clinical findings must show that these symptoms are incompatible with recognized neurophysiology (eg, through inconsistent physical examination findings or testing).</li><li><strong>Factitious disorder</strong>:&nbsp; includes prominent somatic symptoms that may result in high health care utilization; however, the symptoms are intentionally falsified or induced to deceive others and assume the sick role.</li><li><strong>Malingering</strong>:&nbsp; characterized by the intentional and conscious fabrication of symptoms for external gain (eg, drugs, money, benefits); somatic symptoms are self-induced and not authentic.</li><li><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder</strong> (GAD):&nbsp; can also involve somatic symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and dizziness as well as anxiety about health; however, the worries in GAD include multiple topics (eg, finances, relationships, events) and do not primarily focus on health and somatic symptoms.</li><li><strong>Other medical conditions</strong>:&nbsp; can present with health-related anxiety and disruptive somatic symptoms, which may or may not be explained by a recognized pathophysiological process.&nbsp; A diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder can co-occur with another medical condition only if there are excessive and disproportionate thoughts, feelings, and behaviors about the symptoms and/or health.</li></ul><h1>Management</h1><p>A thorough medical (including psychiatric) history and physical examination are crucialfor establishing an initial baseline and for assessing any changes in symptoms and objective findings in subsequent evaluations.&nbsp; Reviewing medical records and collaborating with other providers can provide insights into the patient's course of symptoms, diagnostic work-up, and level of health care utilization.&nbsp; Obtaining diagnostic testing, based on symptom history and examination findings, may be indicated, though repeat testing is typically avoided as this will not provide additional reassurance to the patient.</p><p>Management does not focus on reduction or resolution of somatic symptoms but rather improvements in functioning and coping with symptoms.&nbsp; Goals include avoiding unnecessary diagnostic testing and specialist referrals, exploring the role of psychosocial stressors on somatic symptoms, and improving functionality through stress reduction and healthy behaviors (eg, sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, exercise, diet, return to productivity).</p><p>Primary care physicians provide treatment through regularly scheduled visits that emphasize patient-centered care.&nbsp; General recommendations include the following (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35768.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Validate the patient's experience (ie, that their symptoms are causing suffering)</li><li>Avoid statements that emphasize mind-body dualism (ie, symptoms explained by either pathophysiological or psychological processes)</li><li>Provide reassurance that normal test results serve to rule out catastrophic medical conditions and do not mean that the patient's symptoms are fabricated or not important</li><li>Schedule regular visits (eg, monthly) instead of symptom-driven appointments in order to develop trust and rapport</li><li>Establish realistic goals with the patient in regard to improving daily functioning while regularly monitoring symptoms and concerns</li><li>Provide education on how somatic symptoms are affected by stress and share stress-reduction strategies</li></ul><p>For those who do not improve with initial management, consultation with a psychiatrist directly about the patient (not referring the patient to a psychiatrist) may help with communication strategies and improving the doctor-patient relationship.&nbsp; An antidepressant (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, low-dose tricyclic) may also be considered for patients with comorbid depression or anxiety symptoms.&nbsp; For treatment-resistant patients, a referral to a psychiatrist for medications or for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with continued primary care management can be considered.</p><p>Comorbid mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders are common and require screening and treatment.</p><p>Somatic symptom disorder is associated with an elevated suicide risk and requires screening for suicidal ideation, assessment of risk factors, and safety planning.</p><h1>Prognosis</h1><p>Somatic symptom disorder is considered a chronic condition with the majority of cases lasting more than 5 years.&nbsp; Early intervention is associated with an improved prognosis.&nbsp; Occupational disability and functional impairment as well as reduced quality of life are common if left untreated.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Somatic symptom disorder (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/38358.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) involves excessive anxiety, thoughts, and behaviors related to 1 or more distressing physical symptoms.&nbsp;
