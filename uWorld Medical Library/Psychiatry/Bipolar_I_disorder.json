Manic episodes are characterized by at least 1 week of elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased energy.&nbsp; \"Bipolar\" refers to the 2 poles of mania and depression, mood states that patients fluctuate between or experience simultaneously (ie, episode with mixed features).&nbsp; Mood episodes are recurrent and debilitating, often requiring lifetime maintenance treatment.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The estimated lifetime prevalence of bipolar I disorder is approximately 1%-2% among adults.&nbsp; Prevalence rates are similar in men and women, and the majority of patients with bipolar I disorder experience symptoms by age 25.</p><br><br><p>Several factors appear to increase the risk of developing bipolar I disorder, including genetic predispostion (eg, first-degree relative with bipolar disorder), environmental factors (eg, adverse childhood experiences, substance use disorder, major life changes/stressors), and biologic factors (eg, postpartum period).</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Although not completely understood, the pathogenesis of bipolar I disorder appears to be multifactorial, involving the interplay of biologic, psychologic, and environmental components:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Neuroendocrine dysfunction:&nbsp; increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone in response to stress, resulting in hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and excess glucocorticoid levels</li>\n\t<li>Neurotransmitter abnormalities:&nbsp; imbalance of monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine) as well as dysfunctional signaling of monoamines and glutamate</li>\n\t<li>Inflammatory pathway activation:&nbsp; increased levels of inflammatory markers (eg, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], and C-reactive protein [CRP])</li>\n\t<li>Neuroanatomic changes:&nbsp; decreased gray matter volume</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>A diagnosis of bipolar I disorder must include ≥1 manic episode, although the majority of patients also experience recurrent hypomanic and depressive episodes.</p>\n<h2>Manic episode</h2><br><br><p>Manic episodes involve a <strong>marked change</strong> from baseline in mood and energy levels for <strong>≥1 week</strong>.&nbsp; Patients may be uncharacteristically enthusiastic and euphoric, although mood can rapidly shift to irritable or enraged, at times resulting in threatening or aggressive behavior.&nbsp; Increased activity levels and energy during mania often lead patients to initiate multiple new tasks or projects without being able to complete them.&nbsp; Additional symptoms of mania may include (<strong>DIG FAST mnemonic</strong>):</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>D</strong>istractibility:&nbsp; results in difficulty focusing, following directions, and conversing; patients are unable to filter out irrelevant external stimuli and may comment on others' clothing or items in the room.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>I</strong>mpulsivity (excessive involvement in activities with high potential for painful consequences):&nbsp; can include uncharacteristic gambling, shopping sprees, reckless driving, and/or risky sexual behaviors due to impaired judgment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>G</strong>randiosity or inflated self-esteem:&nbsp; can include high levels of self-confidence in areas in which the patient has no experience (eg, providing legal advice despite having no knowledge of law) or the presence of grandiose delusions (eg, believing they have superhuman powers or a special relationship with a religious figure).</li>\n\t<li><strong>F</strong>light of ideas or racing thoughts:&nbsp; make it difficult to communicate clearly; patient responses are irrelevant to questions and may jump from one topic to another.</li>\n\t<li><strong>A</strong>ctivity increases (including goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation):&nbsp; may appear as engaging in multiple different activities (eg, projects at work, sex, religious or political causes, increased social contact); patients may also appear to be restless (eg, pacing, fidgeting).</li>\n\t<li><strong>S</strong>leep decreased:&nbsp; very common; patients may not sleep at all or they may sleep 2-3 hours a night and feel well rested; this differs from insomnia, which occurs when a patient wants to sleep and feels tired but is unable.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>T</strong>alkativeness (more talkative than usual or feeling pressured to keep talking):&nbsp; includes rapid speech that is difficult to interrupt; speech is often loud and may include jokes, singing, laughter, or threats.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>To be considered diagnostic of mania, symptoms must include psychotic features (eg, hallucinations, delusions), cause <strong>severe functional impairment</strong>, or require hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others.</p><br><br><p>Level of insight during mania is often limited, with most patients not recognizing themselves as ill or requiring treatment.&nbsp; Duration of mania varies: with treatment, the majority of episodes will resolve within 3-4 months.</p>\n<h2>Hypomanic episode</h2><br><br><p>Hypomania also involves an elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and increased energy levels as well as ≥3 of the cognitive and behavioral symptoms seen in mania (4 if mood is only irritable).&nbsp; Hypomanic episodes differ from mania in the following ways:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Symptom duration is only required most of the day, nearly every day for ≥4 consecutive days.</li>\n\t<li>Symptoms are typically less severe (eg, behaviors are not as risky, speech may be rapid but not pressured, thoughts are less disorganized).</li>\n\t<li>Functioning is not markedly impaired (may even be improved during hypomania).</li>\n\t<li>Symptoms are not severe enough to require hospitalization.</li>\n\t<li>Symptoms do not include psychotic features such as delusional grandiosity (if psychosis is present, episode is considered to be manic).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Duration of hypomania varies, although the majority of episodes resolve within 6 weeks with treatment.</p>\n<h2>Major depressive episode</h2><br><br><p>Most manic episodes are immediately followed by a depressive episode.&nbsp; Depressive episodes are experienced the majority of the day for ≥2 consecutive weeks, include ≥5 symptoms, and are accompanied by significant distress and/or functional impairment.</p><br><br><p>A major depressive episode causes emotional, cognitive, and physical changes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Low mood:&nbsp; can be described by a patient in different ways (eg, down, empty, sad, hopeless) or can be observed (eg, frequent tearfulness); irritability instead of sadness is common in children and adolescents.</li>\n\t<li>Decreased interest or pleasure in activities (anhedonia):&nbsp; may be experienced as not participating in or caring about previously-enjoyed hobbies/activities; symptoms may include social withdrawal (eg, no longer attending family events) and decreased interest in sex.</li>\n\t<li>Weight or appetite changes:&nbsp; vary and can either increase (eg, cravings for carbohydrates with resulting weight gain) or decrease (eg, skipping meals and losing weight).</li>\n\t<li>Sleep changes:&nbsp; can include hypersomnia (increased nighttime sleeping and/or daytime naps) or difficulty sleeping (most commonly nighttime awakening with difficulty falling back to sleep).</li>\n\t<li>Psychomotor changes:&nbsp; present as either restlessness (eg, pacing, hand-wringing, fidgeting) or retardation (eg, slow thinking and body movements, increased speech latency).</li>\n\t<li>Fatigue or decreased energy:&nbsp; very common in depression; everyday tasks that require minimal exertion are exhausting (eg, checking mailbox, brushing teeth).</li>\n\t<li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt:&nbsp; can include negative self-evaluation and feelings of guilt for minor past failings (eg, accidentally denting the car years ago); thoughts can be delusional (eg, patient believes they are the sole cause of climate change).&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Concentration difficulties or indecisiveness:&nbsp; can appear as being easily distracted, experiencing memory issues, or having difficulty making minor decisions (eg, what to wear) and may manifest as poor performance at work or school.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Thoughts of death may manifest as passive thoughts of suicide (eg, not wanting to be alive anymore or feeling that one is better off dead), sometimes intensifying as suicidal ideation (in which one has a specific plan to kill oneself) and suicide attempts. A manic or depressive episode that also involves some symptoms of the opposite polarity is specified as having \"mixed features.\"&nbsp; For example, a patient experiencing a manic episode (irritability, pressured speech, grandiosity, and psychomotor agitation) who has concurrent low mood, guilt, and suicidal ideation would be diagnosed as having a manic episode with mixed features.</p><br><br><p>Postpartum psychosis presents with rapid-onset hallucinations and delusions as well as mood symptoms within 4 weeks of childbirth.&nbsp; This condition can be due to various psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder, schizophrenia) but carries a strong association with bipolar I disorder (ie, patients likely have been or will be diagnosed with bipolar I disorder).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>For a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder to be made, the following criteria for a manic episode must be met.&nbsp; The manic episode may have been preceded and/or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes.</p>\n<h2>Manic episode</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).</li>\n\t<li>During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, ≥3 of the following symptoms (4 if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity</li>\n\t\t<li>Decreased need for sleep (eg, feels rested after only 2-3 hours of sleep)</li>\n\t\t<li>More talkative than usual or feeling pressured to keep talking</li>\n\t\t<li>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing</li>\n\t\t<li>Distractibility (ie, attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed</li>\n\t\t<li>Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (ie, purposeless, non-goal-directed activity)</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (eg, engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, high-risk sexual activity)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.</li>\n\t<li>The episode is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance, medication, or another medical condition.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (eg, medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiologic effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Note:&nbsp; At least 1 manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.</p>\n<h2>Hypomanic episode</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A hypomanic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting <strong>≥4 consecutive days</strong> and present most of the day, nearly every day</li>\n\t<li>During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, ≥3 of the following symptoms (4 if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity</li>\n\t\t<li>Decreased need for sleep (eg, feels rested after only 2-3 hours of sleep)</li>\n\t\t<li>More talkative than usual or feeling pressured to keep talking</li>\n\t\t<li>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing</li>\n\t\t<li>Distractibility (ie, attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed</li>\n\t\t<li>Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (ie, purposeless non-goal-directed activity)</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (eg, engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, high-risk sexual activity, or foolish business investments)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the patient when not symptomatic.</li>\n\t<li>The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others.</li>\n\t<li>The episode is <strong>not severe enough</strong> to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization.&nbsp; If there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic.</li>\n\t<li>The episode is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance, medication, or another medical condition.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; A full hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (eg, medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiologic effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Note:&nbsp; Hypomanic episodes are common but are <u>not</u> required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.</p>\n<h2>Major depressive episode</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>In major depressive episode, ≥5 of the following symptoms are present during the same 2-week period, representing a change from previous functioning; at least 1 of the symptoms is either depressed mood or anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure).\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (eg, patient reports feeling sad) or observation made by others (eg, patient appears tearful).&nbsp;

Major depressive episodes are common but are <em>not</em> required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Bipolar II disorder</strong>:&nbsp; includes ≥1 major depressive episode and ≥1 hypomanic episode with no history of manic episodes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Major depressive disorder</strong> (MDD):&nbsp; also includes depressive episodes that may or may not be recurrent; however, there is no history of manic or hypomanic episodes; patients who are ultimately diagnosed with bipolar I disorder may have multiple depressive episodes before experiencing mania.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type</strong>:&nbsp; must also include ≥1 manic episode for diagnosis; however, mania must coincide with symptoms of schizophrenia (eg, hallucinations, delusions, disorganized behavior) and ≥2 weeks of hallucinations or delusions in the absence of mood episode symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Borderline personality disorder</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108395.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

however, symptoms are persistent (not episodic) with onset by age 12.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder</strong>:&nbsp; also presents with an abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and increased energy; however, there must be evidence on history, examination, or laboratory findings of substance/medication use that is capable of causing symptoms (eg, cocaine intoxication, corticosteroid use); remission of symptoms is associated with the absence of substance or medication use; if mania-like symptoms occur after initiation of an antidepressant and symptoms persist beyond the physiologic effects of the medication, bipolar disorder is diagnosed.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition</strong>:&nbsp; also involves a marked change from baseline in mood and energy levels; however, clinical findings of a pathophysiologic process that causes mania-like symptoms must be identified (eg, multiple sclerosis, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Evaluation and diagnostic work-up</h1><br><br><p>A thorough history (including prior mood episodes, substance use, and family history of psychiatric disorders) and physical examination are necessary to determine the likelihood of bipolar I disorder versus other medical conditions that may present similarly.</p><br><br><p>Initial laboratory testing should include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, serum TSH level, and urine drug screen.&nbsp; Depending on clinical findings, additional diagnostic work-up may be indicated for conditions that can present with mania-like symptoms (eg, bedtime salivary cortisol for hypercortisolism, electroencephalogram for epilepsy).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Bipolar I disorder is associated with a significantly elevated risk for suicide, and approximately 5%-15% of patients die by suicide (lifetime suicide risk is 20 to 30 times greater than in the general population).&nbsp;
