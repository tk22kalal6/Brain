Fears are associated with ≥2 of the following situations: using public transportation, being in open spaces, being in enclosed places, standing in line or being in a crowd, or being outside of the home alone.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The estimated lifetime prevalence of agoraphobia is 1%.&nbsp; Females are more commonly affected than males (2:1 ratio), and onset is typically during adolescence and early adulthood.</p><br><br><p>Several factors may increase the likelihood of developing agoraphobia, including genetic predisposition, psychological factors (eg, neuroticism, behavioral inhibition, introversion), and environmental factors (eg, parental overprotectiveness, parental separation, adverse childhood events, stressful/traumatic life events).</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The pathogenesis of agoraphobia is unclear, but it may involve reinforcement and maintenance of avoidance behaviors, personal experience of a frightening situation (eg, being robbed at gunpoint in a parking lot), and parent/caregiver reinforcement that certain situations are dangerous and need to be avoided (eg, child being told repeatedly that the world is a scary place).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Agoraphobia involves a fear response to ≥2 of the following situations:&nbsp; using public transportation (eg, planes, buses), being in open spaces (eg, park), being in enclosed places (eg, restaurant, church), standing in line or being in a crowd, or being outside of the home alone.</p><br><br><p>These situations are associated with fears of being trapped or unable to escape or help being unavailable if any of the following were to occur:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Panic-like symptoms (eg, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, numbness)</li>\n\t<li>Other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms, such as:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Falling (usually in elderly patients)</li>\n\t\t<li>Getting lost (usually in children)</li>\n\t\t<li>Experiencing physical symptoms related to a chronic medical condition (eg, seizures due to traumatic brain injury, fecal incontinence due to inflammatory bowel disease, vomiting due to motion sickness)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Avoidance behaviors limit or prevent contact with the feared situation and can include behavioral (eg, changing daily routine) and cognitive (eg, distraction techniques) efforts.</p><br><br><p>If patients cannot completely avoid a situation, they may engage in a variety of maladaptive behaviors that promote their sense of safety, such as:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Always traveling with a trusted friend/relative in case help is needed</li>\n\t<li>Staying close to the exit</li>\n\t<li>Having medication (eg, benzodiazepine, antidiarrheal medication) on hand or taking prophylactically</li>\n\t<li>Carrying a comforting item</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In severe cases, patients consider only their home to be a safe environment and do not leave, becoming dependent on others for assistance with daily needs (eg, delivering groceries or mail).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>For a diagnosis of agoraphobia, the following criteria must be met:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The patient has marked fear or anxiety about ≥2 of the following situations:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Using public transportation</li>\n\t\t<li>Being in open spaces</li>\n\t\t<li>Being in enclosed spaces</li>\n\t\t<li>Standing in line or being in a crowd</li>\n\t\t<li>Being outside of the home alone</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The patient fears or avoids these situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms.</li>\n\t<li>The situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.</li>\n\t<li>The situations are actively avoided, require the presence of a companion, or are endured with intense fear or anxiety.</li>\n\t<li>The fear or anxiety is out of proportion with the actual danger posed by the situations and the sociocultural context.</li>\n\t<li>The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting ≥6 months.</li>\n\t<li>The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning.</li>\n\t<li>If another medical condition (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson disease) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly excessive.</li>\n\t<li>The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by another mental disorder (eg, separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Panic disorder</strong>:&nbsp; also involves avoidance of situations to prevent panic symptoms; however, recurrent, unexpected panic attacks must be present.&nbsp; If the avoidance behaviors encompass ≥2 agoraphobic situations, then both diagnoses are given (common).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Social anxiety disorder</strong>:&nbsp; involves intense fear and avoidance of social interactions, which can also occur in a variety of situations.&nbsp; However, a fear of being judged or negatively evaluated by others must also be present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Specific phobia, situational type</strong>:&nbsp; also involves panic symptoms and avoidance associated with specific environments.&nbsp; However, the fears are associated with being harmed by the situation itself (eg, fear of elevator cables snapping, bridge collapsing).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Treatment of agoraphobia involves pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]), depending on patient preference and access:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pharmacotherapy:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</strong> (SSRIs) (eg, sertraline, escitalopram) are first-line due to their efficacy and tolerability.</li>\n\t\t<li>Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are also effective but are typically reserved for inadequate responses to SSRI.</li>\n\t\t<li>Benzodiazepines (eg, clonazepam) may be prescribed short term for severe symptoms while titrating SSRIs/SNRIs if there is no history of substance use disorder.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>CBT with exposure</strong>:&nbsp; Involves repeated guided exposure to feared situations, resulting in decreased avoidance and improved tolerability.&nbsp; This promotes adaptive behaviors and use of coping skills when anxiety arises.&nbsp; Of note, benzodiazepines should be avoided in patients engaging in exposure therapy (may dampen patient's ability to experience anxiety and decrease efficacy of treatment).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Agoraphobia is associated with an increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behavior;

The majority of patients also have a cooccurring psychiatric disorder.&nbsp; Most commonly, other anxiety disorders (eg, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder) precede a diagnosis of agoraphobia, and major depressive and substance use disorders develop as a result of distressing symptoms.<p></p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Although the prognosis of agoraphobia varies, the majority of patients experience a chronic and persistent course.&nbsp; Remission of symptoms is unlikely without treatment, and even with treatment, relapse is common.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Agoraphobia is characterized by an intense fear and/or avoidance of situations in which escape might be difficult or help may not be available if panic symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms occur.&nbsp; First-line treatment includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
