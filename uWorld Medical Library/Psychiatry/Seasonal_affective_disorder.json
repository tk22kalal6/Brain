SAD is not a standalone diagnosis but rather a specifier of unipolar major depressive disorder (ie, MDD with seasonal pattern) and bipolar disorders (ie, bipolar II disorder with seasonal pattern).</p><br><br><p>The term SAD typically refers to unipolar depressive episodes with fall-winter onset and spring-summer remission since this is the most common pattern of symptoms; the remainder of this article pertains only to this subtype of SAD.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Among patients diagnosed with MDD, 10%-20% have SAD.&nbsp; This condition is more common in young adults (usual onset occurs between age 20-30) and females.</p><br><br><p>Risk factors for SAD include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Geographic location:&nbsp; areas with less daylight in winter and more in the summer such as those in northern latitudes</li>\n\t<li>Personal history of MDD or bipolar disorder</li>\n\t<li>Family history of SAD, MDD, or bipolar disorder</li>\n\t<li>Decreased retinal sensitivity to light; visual impairment</li>\n\t<li>Low vitamin D levels:&nbsp; may result in impaired serotonin activity and increased oxidative stress/inflammation</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathogenesis&nbsp;</h1><br><br><p>The cause of SAD is not fully understood, although it may involve:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Circadian rhythm disruption.&nbsp; Due to shorter days and decreased exposure to daylight in fall-winter, the body's circadian rhythm and sleep cycle can be out of sync (eg, daytime drowsiness, phase delay in sleep).</li>\n\t<li>Light exposure, which is associated with a positive effect on mood.&nbsp; Retinal ganglion cells react to light and connect to various parts of the brain, including the amygdala, which plays a role in emotional regulation; patients with visual impairment are at increased risk for SAD.</li>\n\t<li>Melatonin dysregulation.&nbsp; Decreased daylight exposure in fall-winter results in an increased duration of melatonin secretion, causing hypersomnia and depressive symptoms.</li>\n\t<li>Serotonin dysfunction, which due to a decrease in daylight may precipitate a depressive episode.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients enter a \"hibernation\" mode in SAD due to increased melatonin secretion and a phase delay in sleep, resulting in increased appetite (particularly for carbohydrates), weight gain, and hypersomnia.</p><br><br><p>As depressive episodes recur, a seasonal pattern and its effects emerge (eg, school performance repeatedly drops in winter, recurrence of hospitalizations for depression/suicidality in winter).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>For a diagnosis of SAD, a patient must meet criteria for MDD (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/42287.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and the following:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Seasonality</strong>:&nbsp; depressive episodes characterized by symptoms starting in the fall-winter months</li>\n\t<li><strong>Remission</strong>:&nbsp; depression occurs regularly in the spring-summer months</li>\n\t<li><strong>Seasonal recurrence</strong>:&nbsp; depression yearly in fall-winter months for a 2-year period with no nonseasonal depressive episodes occurring during that same time period</li>\n\t<li><strong>Quantity</strong>:&nbsp; seasonal depressive episodes significantly outnumber nonseasonal depressive episodes</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Assessment of patients also includes exposure to daylight, occupation type, exacerbating/ameliorating factors in depression.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Appropriately diagnosing SAD is crucial as management and decreasing risk of recurrence may differ from nonseasonal depressive episodes.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>MDD due to seasonal stressors</strong>:&nbsp; also has a seasonal component to symptoms, although there are identifiable triggers for symptoms (eg, seasonal unemployment, end-of-term examinations).</li>\n\t<li><strong>MDD with atypical features:</strong> is also a subtype of MDD characterized by hyperphagia, weight gain, and hypersomnia; however, atypical depression does not follow a seasonal pattern and includes symptoms of leaden paralysis (eg, sensation of heaviness in arms/legs) and hypersensitivity to interpersonal rejection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Winter \"blues\"</strong>:&nbsp; can cause depression-like symptoms (eg, lower mood, lack of motivation, increased sleep) and may occur due to weather changes, holiday stress, or missing absent loved ones, though these symptoms are not severe enough to be classified as a major depressive episode.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory tests are not indicated for the diagnosis of SAD.&nbsp; However, evaluation of underlying medical conditions (eg, TSH for hypothyroidism) may be indicated.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>First-line treatment of SAD includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Bright light therapy</strong>, typically administered daily for 30-90 minutes with a light box shortly after the patient awakens.&nbsp; Clinical improvement can be expected in 1-4 weeks; light therapy is continued through fall-winter until remission of symptoms in spring-summer.&nbsp; Light therapy can be used alone or in addition to pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.</li>\n\t<li>Pharmacotherapy involving <strong>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</strong> (SSRIs) or <strong>bupropion</strong>, which may be prescribed for more severe cases in addition to light therapy or when light therapy alone is ineffective.</li>\n\t<li>Psychotherapy using <strong>cognitive-behavioral therapy</strong> (CBT), which can help individuals develop coping skills and explore negative thought patterns and is recommended as an adjunct treatment.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, outdoor time to increase sunlight exposure, consistent sleep, and a well-rounded diet are also important recommendations for those with SAD.</p><br><br><p>Maintenance treatment to prevent recurrence of SAD is determined by patient preference and can include either initiating antidepressants a month before expected fall-winter onset of symptoms, followed by medication taper in spring-summer, or continuing antidepressant therapy year-round.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The course of SAD varies depending on severity of symptoms and response to treatments.&nbsp; Though some patients experience full remission (~15%), the majority of patients continue to have recurrent depressive episodes (either seasonal or nonseasonal).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/63891.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) consists of unipolar depressive episodes with fall-winter onset and spring-summer remission that are characterized by carbohydrate cravings, weight gain, and hypersomnia.&nbsp;
