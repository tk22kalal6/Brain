Alcohol-related mortality accounts for nearly 3 million deaths annually, representing approximately 5% of all deaths worldwide.&nbsp; Alcohol use disorder, an inability to control alcohol intake despite adverse consequences (including those related to either acute intoxication or alcohol withdrawal), affects a substantial portion of the population across age groups, with adolescents, young adults, and individuals age &gt;60 most vulnerable to developing problematic drinking patterns.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Alcohol acts as a CNS depressant by modulating several neurotransmitter systems, leading to both immediate and long-term effects:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA):</strong>&nbsp; Alcohol potentiates GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, resulting in sedative and anxiolytic effects that contribute to intoxication.&nbsp; Chronic alcohol use causes downregulation of GABA​ receptors, leading to tolerance and dependence.&nbsp; Abrupt cessation results in decreased GABA-mediated inhibitory tone, contributing to withdrawal symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Glutamate:</strong>&nbsp; Alcohol inhibits the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, specifically at NMDA receptors, leading to memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction during intoxication.&nbsp; Chronic use causes upregulation of NMDA receptors, predisposing individuals to excitotoxicity and withdrawal symptoms (due to increased excitatory neurotransmission upon cessation).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dopamine:</strong>&nbsp; Alcohol stimulates dopamine release in the mesolimbic reward pathway, reinforcing its rewarding effects and contributing to patterns of repeated and escalating use.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These neuroadaptations foster tolerance and dependence.&nbsp; The imbalance between <strong>decreased inhibitory GABA</strong> activity and <strong>increased excitatory glutamate</strong> activity during withdrawal results in CNS overexcitation (eg, anxiety, tremors, seizures).</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Certain factors increase the likelihood of developing complications from alcohol use:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Genetics</strong>:&nbsp; A family history of alcohol use disorder predisposes individuals to unhealthy drinking patterns.&nbsp; Various genetic factors (eg, genes encoding certain enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism) can increase the risk for developing alcohol-associated steatosis and other complications.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Psychosocial</strong> influences:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Early exposure to alcohol and societal permissiveness contribute to early initiation of alcohol use, especially among adolescents and young adults.</li>\n\t\t<li>Individuals who experience chronic stress, trauma, or low socioeconomic status may use alcohol as a coping mechanism.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Comorbid</strong> psychiatric conditions:&nbsp; Depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders often coexist with problematic alcohol use.&nbsp; Up to 50% of patients with schizophrenia have a cooccurring substance use disorder (including alcohol).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Demographics</strong>:&nbsp; Males and younger individuals are at increased risk for complications related to heavy alcohol use.&nbsp; In older adults, factors such as bereavement, depression, chronic pain, and disability can lead to increased alcohol consumption that often goes unrecognized.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology and complications</h1><br><br><p>Alcohol use leads to progressive tissue damage throughout the body, including in the liver and the cardiovascular and nervous systems:</p>\n<h2>Liver disease</h2><br><br><p>Alcohol-associated liver disease encompasses a range of chronic conditions, beginning with steatosis (fatty liver), progressing to steatohepatitis, and, potentially, advancing to alcohol-induced cirrhosis:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Steatosis (fatty liver):</strong>&nbsp; Ethanol metabolism in the liver raises the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio due to increased NADH production (during the conversions of ethanol to acetaldehyde and acetaldehyde to acetate).&nbsp; This elevated ratio inhibits beta-oxidation of free fatty acids and promotes triglyceride buildup by increasing fatty acid synthesis and glycerol-3-phosphate production, leading to hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation (macrovesicular fat deposits).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Steatohepatitis:</strong>&nbsp; This is characterized by inflammation in liver cells with neutrophilic infiltration, hepatocyte ballooning, the presence of Mallory bodies (cytoplasmic inclusions of damaged keratin filaments), and steatosis.&nbsp; Oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to the progression of fibrosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cirrhosis:</strong>&nbsp; Ongoing fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis, which is accompanied by complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition to these chronic processes, the more acute <strong>alcoholic hepatitis</strong> may be seen with similar but typically more severe histologic findings than those found in patients with steatohepatitis.&nbsp; Clinically, alcoholic hepatitis can range from mild to severe, affecting management.</p>\n<h2>Cardiovascular disease</h2><br><br><p>Chronic alcohol consumption adversely affects the cardiovascular system, leading to conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation), hypertension, and ischemic heart disease:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hypertension:</strong>&nbsp; Chronic alcohol use enhances sympathetic nervous system activity and impairs baroreceptor sensitivity, resulting in vasoconstriction and elevated systemic vascular resistance (often resistant to treatment).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dilated cardiomyopathy:</strong>&nbsp; Alcohol's toxic effects on myocardial cells induce mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, causing apoptosis and necrosis of cardiomyocytes.&nbsp; This results in thinning and dilation of the ventricular walls, leading to systolic dysfunction with heart failure symptoms (eg, dyspnea, peripheral edema).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Arrhythmias:</strong>&nbsp; Alcohol alters ion channel function and promotes electrolyte imbalances (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), causing cardiac electrical instability.&nbsp; \"Holiday heart syndrome\" describes atrial fibrillation occurring after acute excessive alcohol intake (eg, during holidays).&nbsp; Arrhythmias can lead to palpitations, dizziness, decreased cardiac output, and an increased risk for thromboembolic events (eg, stroke).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ischemic heart disease:</strong>&nbsp; Heavy alcohol use (&gt;14 drinks/week for men, &gt;7 drinks/week for women) accelerates atherosclerosis via oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction.&nbsp; Elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides promote coronary plaque formation, leading to angina or infarction.&nbsp; Moderate alcohol intake (&lt;3 drinks/day for men, &lt;2 drinks/day for women) is linked to reduced cardiac events and improved insulin sensitivity (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35762.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CNS disease</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Neurotoxicity:</strong>&nbsp; Long-term alcohol use leads to cerebral atrophy, particularly in the frontal cortex and cerebellum, affecting cognition, motor skills, and executive function.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cerebellar degeneration:</strong>&nbsp; Loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar vermis results in gait ataxia, truncal instability, and tremor.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome:</strong>&nbsp; Thiamine deficiency due to poor nutritional intake can cause acute encephalopathy (Wernicke encephalopathy), presenting with encephalopathy, oculomotor dysfunction, and ataxia.&nbsp; Without prompt treatment, it can progress to Korsakoff syndrome, characterized by irreversible anterograde and retrograde amnesia, confabulation, and lack of insight (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/49374.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hematologic effects</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Macrocytic (megaloblastic) anemia:</strong>&nbsp; Chronic alcohol use leads to the production of unusually large red blood cells (ie, megaloblastic anemia) because the bone marrow releases immature cells.&nbsp; In addition, hypersegmented neutrophils are often present (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19283.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Macrocytic anemia is multifactorial and related to alcohol metabolites (eg, acetaldehyde), changes in lipid membrane composition, and (rarely) folate deficiency.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Thrombocytopenia:</strong>&nbsp; Bone marrow suppression and splenic sequestration from liver disease contribute to low platelet counts.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Leukopenia:</strong>&nbsp; Mild reduction in neutrophil counts can be seen transiently following alcohol ingestion.&nbsp; This may increase the risk for worse outcomes in patients with certain infections (eg, pneumonia).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Metabolic effects</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hypoglycemia:</strong>&nbsp; Heavy alcohol intake inhibits gluconeogenesis due to an increased NADH/NAD⁺ ratio, leading to unstable glucose levels and potentially severe hypoglycemia, especially in patients taking hypoglycemic agents.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nutritional deficiencies:</strong>&nbsp; Malabsorption and poor dietary intake lead to deficiencies in vitamins and minerals (eg, thiamine, folate, magnesium).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gastrointestinal complications</h2><br><br><p>In addition to the liver, the following gastrointestinal complications may be seen:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pancreatitis:</strong>&nbsp; Alcohol is a common cause of both acute and chronic pancreatitis, which can result in progressive pancreatic damage and loss of exocrine and endocrine function.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gastritis and peptic ulcer disease:</strong>&nbsp; Alcohol irritates the gastric mucosa, increasing the risk for ulcers and bleeding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psychiatric complications</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Mood disorders:</strong>&nbsp; Chronic alcohol use can lead to or exacerbate major depressive disorder and anxiety.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Psychotic disorders:</strong>&nbsp; Alcohol-induced psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions, can occur, particularly during intoxication or withdrawal.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cognitive impairment:</strong>&nbsp; Alcohol can lead to blackouts (amnesia during or after drinking), executive dysfunction (issues with planning, problem solving), and sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fetal alcohol syndrome</h2><br><br><p>Maternal alcohol use can lead to fetal growth restriction and fetal alcohol syndrome due to alcohol's teratogenic effects and insufficient nutrient supply to the fetus (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14000.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Drug interactions</h2><br><br><p>Co-ingestion of alcohol with other sedative-hypnotics (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates) can lead to profound CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia, increasing the risk for fatal overdose.&nbsp; The combined use of alcohol and cocaine creates a metabolite called cocaethylene, which prolongs and enhances the typical sympathomimetic toxidrome of cocaine.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The clinical presentation of alcohol use varies with the extent and pattern of consumption.&nbsp; Differentiating alcohol intoxication from withdrawal is essential but sometimes difficult (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/106473.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Alcohol intoxication</h2><br><br><p>Intoxication typically involves CNS depression and impaired motor skills.&nbsp; Manifestations include euphoria, disinhibition, slurred speech, impaired motor coordination, nystagmus, and, in severe cases, respiratory depression, hypotension, and coma.&nbsp; However, some individuals who are intoxicated may become belligerent and antagonistic (due to disinhibition), with increased sympathetic tone resembling alcohol withdrawal.</p>\n<h2>Alcohol withdrawal</h2><br><br><p>Alcohol withdrawal often includes agitation, hallucinations, and autonomic hyperactivity.&nbsp; It can occur following abrupt cessation, leading to symptoms that vary in severity and can be life-threatening.&nbsp; Prompt recognition can be challenging at times because alcohol use is often unreported or underreported in patients hospitalized for other reasons.&nbsp; Manifestations are due to rebound CNS overexcitation resulting from decreased inhibitory GABA activity and increased excitatory glutamate activity:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Minor withdrawal</strong> (6-24 hr after last drink):&nbsp; Tremors (\"the shakes\"), anxiety, agitation, insomnia, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and mild autonomic dysfunction (eg, tachycardia, hypertension).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Alcoholic hallucinosis</strong> (12-48 hr after last drink):&nbsp; Visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations (often visual hallucinations featuring insects or animals) without delirium.&nbsp; Patients are typically alert with intact cognition.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Seizures</strong> (12-48 hr after last drink):&nbsp; Generalized tonic-clonic seizures can occur, often in rapid succession.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Delirium tremens</strong> (48-96 hr after last drink):&nbsp; The most severe form of withdrawal, characterized by rapid-onset delirium, confusion, agitation, severe autonomic instability (fever, hypertension, tachycardia), hallucinations, and a high risk for mortality without intervention.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Complex scenarios</h2><br><br><p>Differentiating between intoxication and withdrawal in a patient who is agitated can be difficult initially due to overlapping features:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Both can incite aberrant behavior.&nbsp; However, in withdrawal, the psychomotor <strong>agitation</strong> is typically <strong>more profound</strong> (eg, restlessness, irritability, pacing) and is often accompanied by delirium.</li>\n\t<li>Both can cause vital sign abnormalities.&nbsp; However, withdrawal causes <strong>tachycardia with hypertension</strong> due to a hyperadrenergic state, as well as <strong>diaphoresis</strong>, hyperreflexia, tremors, and/or seizures due to neurologic and autonomic hyperactivity from loss of CNS inhibitory tone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alcoholic hepatitis</h2><br><br><p>Alcoholic hepatitis typically presents with acute onset of anorexia, fever, jaundice, and <strong>right upper quadrant</strong> abdominal pain in the setting of heavy alcohol use.&nbsp; Diagnosis is usually based on clinical and laboratory findings of elevated liver enzymes (<strong>aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ratio &gt;2:1</strong>, bilirubin) and International Normalized Ratio.&nbsp; The presence of coagulopathy, jaundice, and/or encephalopathy indicates little hepatic functional reserve and is associated with poor prognosis.&nbsp; Severity influences management, as discussed later.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Alcohol use and its associated complications are diagnosed based on clinical evaluation and diagnostic criteria, such as those in the DSM-5, which assess patterns of tolerance, dependence, and the impact of alcohol on daily functioning.</p><br><br><p>Alcohol use disorder involves compulsive alcohol use, an inability to control drinking, and adverse effects on functioning.&nbsp; Depression, anxiety, increased risk for suicide, and cooccurring substance use disorders are associated with alcohol use.</p>\n<h2>Screening</h2><br><br><p>Screening tools like the AUDIT (<strong>A</strong>lcohol <strong>U</strong>se <strong>D</strong>isorders <strong>I</strong>dentification <strong>T</strong>est) or its shorter version, AUDIT-C, are recommended for identifying individuals at risk.&nbsp; A single-item screening test can also be effective in primary care settings (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/33831.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The CAGE questionnaire is no longer recommended as an initial screening tool because it emphasizes complications of heavy use and fails to identify the full spectrum of unhealthy use (eg, habitual vs binge drinking patterns).&nbsp; However, it can be used to assess more severe alcohol use problems (eg, alcohol use disorder) in patients who test positive on other initial screening.<p></p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Laboratory tests can provide insight into the severity of alcohol use and related complications:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Liver enzymes:</strong>&nbsp; In alcohol-related liver disease, the <strong>AST/ALT ratio</strong> is often <strong>&gt;2:1</strong> due to alcohol's specific impact on hepatic cells, including ethanol-induced mitochondrial damage (AST is located in mitochondria, ALT is cytosolic).&nbsp; Absolute values may be modest in early disease but can be elevated in alcoholic hepatitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT):</strong>&nbsp; Levels rise with heavy alcohol use, serving as a sensitive marker for alcohol-induced liver injury.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Complete blood count:</strong>&nbsp; Thrombocytopenia is common due to bone marrow suppression and splenic sequestration from liver disease.&nbsp; Macrocytic anemia (increased mean corpuscular volume) is frequently observed in patients who use alcohol chronically, which is attributable to folate deficiency from poor dietary intake and impaired absorption and utilization.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Additional findings:</strong>&nbsp; In alcoholic hepatitis, leukocytosis (neutrophilic predominance), elevated bilirubin, and prolonged PT/PTT can be seen due to impaired hepatic production of coagulation factors.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In cases of suspected heavy alcohol use, <strong>phosphatidyl ethanol</strong> (PEth), a direct biomarker of alcohol consumption, is detectable in blood for up to 2–4 weeks after heavy alcohol intake.&nbsp; PEth offers higher specificity for chronic alcohol use compared to GGT.</p>\n<h2>Imaging</h2><br><br><p>When liver disease or other alcohol-related organ damage is suspected, imaging studies are useful to assess the extent of structural changes and guide management decisions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Ultrasonography</strong> is usually the first-line imaging tool for assessing liver morphology and detecting signs of fatty liver, cirrhosis, and complications such as splenomegaly and ascites.&nbsp; It can also identify varices due to portal hypertension.&nbsp; <strong>Ultrasound elastography</strong> (FibroScan) provides a noninvasive assessment of liver stiffness to evaluate the degree of fibrosis and is valuable for tracking disease progression.</li>\n\t<li><strong>CT imaging</strong> offers a detailed view of liver structure, which can help identify more advanced changes in hepatic architecture (eg, cirrhosis, HCC).&nbsp; CT is also useful for evaluating pancreatitis in patients who use alcohol chronically and can reveal pancreatic calcifications and fluid collections.</li>\n\t<li>MRI is less frequently used in routine practice due to cost, but it provides detailed soft tissue imaging and is highly sensitive in detecting liver fat content and fibrosis.&nbsp; MR elastography is an advanced technique that quantifies liver stiffness and may provide more precise data on the degree of fibrosis than data from ultrasound elastography.&nbsp; MRI can also help evaluate brain changes in patients with alcohol-related neurotoxicity by showing cerebral atrophy, especially in the frontal lobe and cerebellum.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Imaging studies, laboratory results, and clinical findings provide a comprehensive picture of the extent and progression of alcohol-related damage across multiple organ systems, enabling targeted intervention and monitoring.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of alcohol use and its complications includes treating symptoms of intoxication and withdrawal and providing strategies to prevent relapse.</p>\n<h2>Acute intoxication</h2><br><br><p>When encountered in the clinical setting, treatment of acute intoxication is primarily supportive and includes giving IV fluids for hydration, correcting electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia), monitoring for hypoglycemia, and administering thiamine (to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy).&nbsp; In severe intoxication (ie, alcohol poisoning), the airway and breathing should be closely monitored; endotracheal intubation may be necessary if the patient is unable to protect their airway or maintain oxygenation.&nbsp; Activated charcoal and gastric lavage are not helpful given how quickly ethanol is absorbed.</p>\n<h2>Alcohol withdrawal</h2><br><br><p><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> are the primary agents used to manage alcohol withdrawal.&nbsp; They reduce seizure risk and prevent progression to delirium tremens.&nbsp; In addition, they enhance GABA​ receptor activity, restoring inhibitory tone and mitigating CNS overexcitation.&nbsp; Lorazepam, an intermediate-duration benzodiazepine, is often preferred in hospital settings, especially in patients with liver disease, because it is metabolized via glucuronidation and has no active metabolites.&nbsp; Long-acting benzodiazepines (eg, chlordiazepoxide) are effective but may not be suitable for patients with liver impairment due to active metabolites.&nbsp; High doses and prolonged treatment may be required in patients with chronic receptor downregulation due to heavy longstanding alcohol use (eg, several days needed to regenerate new receptors).</p><br><br><p>Antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol) should generally be avoided because they may lower the seizure threshold in the seizure-prone state of alcohol withdrawal.&nbsp; Sympatholytic drugs (eg, clonidine) are sometimes used to help control tachycardia and hypertension, but caution must be exercised not to mask these hyperadrenergic responses.</p>\n<h2>Relapse prevention</h2><br><br><p>Psychosocial interventions are key for achieving long-term sobriety and include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mutual help groups (eg, Alcoholics Anonymous), and motivational interviewing (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/69318.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 5\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; However, up to 70% of individuals resume heavy alcohol use despite psychosocial intervention, often necessitating pharmacotherapy:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Naltrexone:</strong>&nbsp; a mu-opioid receptor antagonist that reduces alcohol cravings, decreases heavy drinking days (ie, &gt;5 drinks for men, &gt;4 drinks for women), and increases days of abstinence.&nbsp; It can be initiated while the patient is still drinking but is contraindicated in patients taking opioids (can precipitate its withdrawal) or with liver failure or hepatitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acamprosate:</strong>&nbsp; a glutamate modulator that helps maintain abstinence by reducing withdrawal symptoms and negative cravings.&nbsp; It is primarily used after achieving abstinence and should be avoided in patients with significant renal impairment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Disulfiram:</strong>&nbsp; an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor that causes an aversive reaction to alcohol, leading to unpleasant symptoms (eg, palpitations, nausea, flushing) when alcohol is consumed.&nbsp; It does not reduce cravings and is not recommended for patients who are actively drinking.&nbsp; Patients must achieve 48 hours of abstinence before taking disulfiram and should be highly motivated or in a supervised setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alcoholic hepatitis</h2><br><br><p>Severity of alcoholic hepatitis should be determined by calculating the <strong>Maddrey discriminant function</strong>, which is based on prothrombin time and bilirubin levels.&nbsp; A score ≥32 indicates severe alcoholic hepatitis and is associated with a high risk for short-term mortality, warranting <strong>corticosteroids</strong> (eg, prednisolone) for 28 days in the absence of contraindications (eg, active infection, gastrointestinal bleeding); pentoxifylline is an alternative.&nbsp; The Lille score may be used at day 7 of steroid treatment to determine if the patient is responding and whether corticosteroid therapy should be continued.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Prognosis varies widely depending on the duration and severity of alcohol use, as well as the degree of organ damage.&nbsp; Abstinence, particularly when achieved early, can reverse some alcohol-related changes (eg, hepatic steatosis, minor neurocognitive impairment).</p><br><br><p>However, advanced complications carry a poorer prognosis.&nbsp; These include cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis with significant liver dysfunction, and alcoholic cardiomyopathy.&nbsp; Delirium tremens is associated with a mortality rate of up to 5% if not promptly recognized and treated.</p><br><br><p>Consistent intervention and support are essential to improve long-term outcomes, reduce the risk for relapse and severe complications, and address coexisting psychiatric conditions.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Alcohol use has extensive effects ranging from acute intoxication to multi-organ complications due to chronic use.&nbsp; Intoxication leads to CNS depression, and long-term alcohol use may result in dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms due to neuroadaptive changes in GABA and glutamate neurotransmission.&nbsp; Laboratory markers such as an elevated aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, macrocytosis, and thrombocytopenia are useful in identifying chronic use.</p><br><br><p>Treatment requires managing withdrawal symptoms with benzodiazepines to prevent progression to seizures and delirium tremens, which carries a significant risk for mortality.&nbsp; Relapse prevention includes pharmacologic agents (eg, naltrexone, acamprosate) and behavioral interventions (eg, motivational interviewing).&nbsp; Complications span neurologic (eg, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, cerebellar degeneration), hepatic (eg, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis), cardiovascular (eg, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation), hematologic (eg, pancytopenia), and psychiatric domains.&nbsp; Because outcomes are largely dependent on abstinence and comprehensive management, early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent progression and improve prognosis.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
