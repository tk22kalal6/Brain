Benzodiazepines can be obtained by prescription or illegally and are associated with a high risk for misuse.&nbsp; Long-term use of benzodiazepines may result in tolerance, and, if abruptly discontinued, life-threatening withdrawal symptoms.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The estimated lifetime prevalence of benzodiazepine use disorder is &lt;1%.&nbsp; Benzodiazepine misuse (use without a prescription) is more common, with an estimated 12-month prevalence of 1.3% among adults.</p><br><br><p>Several factors increase the risk for developing benzodiazepine use disorder, including a history of receiving a prescription for a benzodiazepine, a personal and/or family history of substance use disorders, comorbid psychiatric conditions (bipolar I disorder, panic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, severe insomnia), a lower level of education, and impulsivity.</p>\n<h1>Pharmacology</h1><br><br><p>Benzodiazepines act on the <strong>GABA A receptor</strong>, enhancing the action of the natural inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.&nbsp; Benzodiazepine binding increases the frequency of chloride channel opening in the presence of GABA (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26055.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This increase in chloride permeability hyperpolarizes the neuronal membrane, rendering it less excitable, and results in the anxiolytic, muscle-relaxant, and anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines.<p></p><br><br><p>Benzodiazepines are typically divided into categories based on their half-lives (short [eg, midazolam], intermediate [eg, alprazolam, lorazepam, clonazepam], long [eg, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam]) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/45904.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The time to onset of action for each benzodiazepine varies based upon multiple factors such as half-life, absorption rate, and lipophilicity.<p></p><br><br><p>Metabolism of benzodiazepines occurs in the liver and is followed by urinary excretion.&nbsp; Most benzodiazepines are metabolized via CYP-mediated hepatic oxidative reduction (phase I) followed by glucuronide conjugation (phase II).&nbsp; However, certain benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam) undergo only glucuronide conjugation, which tends to be relatively preserved in elderly patients and in patients with liver disease.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Benzodiazepines bind to GABA interneurons in the ventral tegmental area, decreasing GABA response and inhibition on dopamine neurons.&nbsp; This <strong>increases dopamine activity</strong> in the mesolimbic pathway, enhancing reward perception and reinforcing benzodiazepine use (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L103046.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>With chronic benzodiazepine use, GABA A receptors become downregulated, leading to:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Tolerance</strong>, a phenomenon in which the same dose of a medication yields decreasing effects over time.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Withdrawal syndrome</strong>, which occurs when benzodiazepines are discontinued and the body is unable to balance opposing excitatory neurotransmitters (eg, glutamate).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Benzodiazepine intoxication</h1><h2>Clinical presentation</h2><br><br><p>Isolated benzodiazepine intoxication most commonly presents with the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Sedation.</li>\n\t<li>Slurred speech.</li>\n\t<li>Nystagmus.</li>\n\t<li>Ataxia and incoordination.</li>\n\t<li>Cognitive impairment (eg, attention, memory).</li>\n\t<li>Normal vital signs.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>If intoxication is severe (eg, due to a high dose) or if benzodiazepines are used with other CNS depressants (eg, alcohol, opioids), then respiratory depression and hypotension can occur.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosis</h2><br><br><p>Diagnosing benzodiazepine intoxication is based on history (eg, patient or witness reporting ingestion) and clinical findings.&nbsp; A urine drug screen is <em>not</em> recommended for diagnosis because it tests only for select benzodiazepines and cannot account for recency of use (ie, urine can remain positive for up to 2 weeks).</p>\n<h2>Differential diagnosis</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Alcohol intoxication</strong>:&nbsp; presents similarly to benzodiazepine intoxication, although with high levels of alcohol intake, clothing and breath would likely smell of alcohol.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Opioid intoxication</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32024.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; may also include sedation, ataxia, and slurred speech.&nbsp; However, respiratory depression and miosis are also expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lithium toxicity</strong>:&nbsp; can present with lethargy, ataxia, and slurred speech.&nbsp; However, gastrointestinal distress (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), tremor, and/or hyperreflexia would likely occur as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Management</h2><br><br><p>Routine testing includes fingerstick glucose, serum acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol levels, as well as ECG (QT prolongation).&nbsp; Additional work-up is dependent on clinical status (eg, brain imaging if history of trauma or focal neurologic findings).</p><br><br><p>Initial management focuses on supportive care (eg, assessing airway, breathing, and circulation).&nbsp; If exposure is limited to benzodiazepines alone, supportive care with close monitoring is typically sufficient.&nbsp; However, if coingestants are present, additional interventions may be necessary:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Naloxone:&nbsp; may be necessary for respiratory depression due to high risk for concurrent opioid intoxication.</li>\n\t<li>Flumazenil:&nbsp; functions as a competitive antagonist at the benzodiazepine binding site, and it can be used as an antidote to reverse benzodiazepine sedation.&nbsp; However, caution is advised because it may precipitate withdrawal and/or seizures in patients with a tolerance to benzodiazepines or in those who have a seizure disorder.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Benzodiazepine withdrawal</h1><br><br><p>Benzodiazepines exert their inhibitory effects via GABA receptors, which are downregulated with chronic use.&nbsp; Sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines leads to an excitatory state and withdrawal symptoms that can be <strong>life-threatening</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Clinical presentation</h2><br><br><p>The onset of benzodiazepine withdrawal depends on the half-life of the drug.&nbsp; Shorter-acting drugs (eg, alprazolam, lorazepam) produce earlier symptoms (within 12 hr), and longer-acting drugs (eg, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide) result in a later onset of withdrawal (within 2 days).&nbsp; Withdrawal symptoms may continue for several weeks, depending on the drug's half-life.&nbsp; A longer duration of use, shorter half-life, and higher dosage are associated with more severe withdrawal symptoms.</p><br><br><p>Withdrawal symptoms can include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Anxiety, irritability, and restlessness.</li>\n\t<li>Diaphoresis, hypertension, and tachycardia.</li>\n\t<li>Hand tremor.</li>\n\t<li>Nausea or vomiting.</li>\n\t<li>Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations.</li>\n\t<li>Insomnia.</li>\n\t<li>Seizures.</li>\n\t<li>Delirium or psychosis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diagnosis</h2><br><br><p>Diagnosing benzodiazepine withdrawal is based on clinical history (regular use with recent abrupt discontinuation) and examination findings (eg, tachycardia, diaphoresis, tremor).</p>\n<h2>Differential diagnosis</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Alcohol withdrawal</strong>:&nbsp; presents similarly to benzodiazepine withdrawal.&nbsp; Differentiation may depend on clinical history and/or collateral information, as well as liver function testing (expected aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio &gt;2:1).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Opioid withdrawal</strong>:&nbsp; may also include tachycardia, hypertension, and tremors.&nbsp; However, withdrawal typically involves mydriasis, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, piloerection, yawning, and diarrhea as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Management</h2><br><br><p>Routine testing includes fingerstick glucose (because hypoglycemia can present very similarly), with additional work-up depending on severity of symptoms (eg, electrolyte levels for dehydration or severe nausea/vomiting).</p><br><br><p>Initial management focuses on supportive care (assessing airway, breathing, and circulation).&nbsp; Benzodiazepines (usually a long-acting option) are administered depending on severity of symptoms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms with normal mental status</strong>:&nbsp; May not require hospitalization (ie, managed in emergency department).&nbsp; Oral benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam; lorazepam if liver impairment) are dosed regularly until improvement of symptoms.&nbsp; When symptoms are stable, a scheduled taper of the benzodiazepine is started; this may occur in an outpatient setting depending on a patient risk assessment and follow-up availability.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Severe withdrawal symptoms and altered mental status</strong>:&nbsp; Hospitalization is required.&nbsp; Intravenous benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam; lorazepam if liver impairment) are dosed repeatedly until symptoms improve.&nbsp; Phenobarbital may be considered if symptoms are refractory to multiple doses of benzodiazepines.&nbsp; After initial stabilization, withdrawal signs/symptoms are closely monitored and treatment is administered depending on severity (ie, symptom-triggered treatment).&nbsp; Typically, a standardized scoring system is utilized with thresholds to determine if medication is necessary.&nbsp; If symptoms continue to be controlled, a scheduled taper can be initiated.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients who take benzodiazepines daily (whether prescribed or illicitly) should be advised to avoid abrupt discontinuation.&nbsp; Strategies for preventing benzodiazepine withdrawal include using a longer-acting option and gradually tapering it over several weeks to months.</p>\n<h1>Benzodiazepine use disorder</h1><h2>Clinical presentation</h2><br><br><p>Benzodiazepine use disorder can develop due to recurrent use of benzodiazepines, which often occurs due to a desire to experience sedating, calming effects.&nbsp; With ongoing use, tolerance increases and withdrawal worsens, leading to increased use of benzodiazepines or similar-acting substances (eg, alcohol).</p><br><br><p>Typically, onset is in adolescence/young adulthood and starts with occasional use at social events/parties, often to counteract the effects of other substances (eg, stimulants), with progression involving increased use over time.&nbsp; A less common presentation is associated with prescribed use of benzodiazepines (eg, for anxiety disorders or insomnia).&nbsp; If increasing dosages are required, this may result in medication-seeking behaviors (visiting multiple doctors to obtain medication).</p><br><br><p>In addition to the psychosocial consequences of benzodiazepine use disorder, ongoing use is associated with an increased risk for falls (especially in elderly patients, this may result in hip fractures and other fall-related injuries), cognitive impairment (affecting coordination, concentration, and memory processing), and motor vehicle collisions.</p>\n<h2>Diagnosis</h2><br><br><p>Symptoms must be experienced in the same 12-month time frame and lead to significant impairment or distress.&nbsp; Severity of benzodiazepine use disorder is determined by the number of symptoms (mild: 2-3; moderate: 4-5; severe: ≥6), which include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Larger amounts used or longer use than planned.</li>\n\t<li>Unsuccessful attempts or an ongoing wish to curb use.</li>\n\t<li>Getting, using, or recovering from use being time-consuming.</li>\n\t<li>Cravings or a strong desire to use.</li>\n\t<li>Failures at work/school/home due to recurrent use.</li>\n\t<li>Continued use despite recurrent social/interpersonal problems.</li>\n\t<li>Social/occupational/recreational activities decreased due to use.</li>\n\t<li>Recurrent use in physically hazardous situations (eg, driving).</li>\n\t<li>Repeated use despite causing physical/psychological problems.</li>\n\t<li>Tolerance (needing a larger amount for the same effect or experiencing a reduced effect if taking same amount).</li>\n\t<li>Withdrawal symptoms or taking benzodiazepine (or a related substance such as alcohol) to relieve or avoid withdrawal.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In the setting of medically prescribed and supervised use of benzodiazepines (eg, to treat panic disorder), tolerance and withdrawal symptoms do not apply for meeting diagnostic criteria.</p>\n<h2>Management</h2><br><br><p>Benzodiazepine use disorder treatment involves carefully tapering at-risk or actively withdrawing patients off benzodiazepines and providing maintenance treatment (eg, psychosocial interventions) to prevent further use.</p><br><br><p><strong>Medically supervised tapering</strong> using a long-acting benzodiazepine can be performed in inpatient or outpatient settings, depending on the level of use and anticipated severity of symptoms (eg, daily high-dose use with prior history of withdrawal seizures requires an inpatient taper).</p><br><br><p>Psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions may prevent further benzodiazepine use and can be initiated during a medically supervised taper.&nbsp; Therapeutic modalities include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cognitive-behavioral therapy addresses psychological aspects of benzodiazepine use and helps patients develop coping strategies for triggers and cravings to reduce the risk for future use.</li>\n\t<li>Motivational interviewing enhances the patient's innate desire for recovery and reinforces adherence to treatment plans and recovery goals.</li>\n\t<li>Support groups include peer groups (eg, 12-step recovery groups) that offer a network of support and encouragement from others also in recovery.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Identifying and treating cooccurring conditions that may have contributed to use (eg, insomnia, anxiety disorders) may help reduce the risk for future benzodiazepine use.&nbsp; Prescribing benzodiazepines should be avoided for patients with a history of benzodiazepine use disorder if alternate treatment options are available.</p>\n<h2>Prognosis</h2><br><br><p>Benzodiazepine use disorder is typically a chronic condition with periods of alternating abstinence and return to use.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Benzodiazepine use disorder involves a pattern of problematic use resulting in distress and psychosocial impairment (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/120379.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Long-term benzodiazepine use may result in tolerance as well as life-threatening withdrawal symptoms if abruptly discontinued.&nbsp; Treatment consists of tapering the patient off benzodiazepines under medical supervision, as well as psychosocial interventions to prevent future use.&nbsp;
