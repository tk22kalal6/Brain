This feature allows the RBC to be easily deformable and traverse through tight spaces within the microcirculation.&nbsp; Maintenance of this shape requires scaffolding proteins (eg, <strong>spectrin</strong>, <strong>ankyrin</strong>, <strong>band 3</strong>), which support the cell membrane by linking it to the underlying cytoskeleton.</p><br><br><p>In hereditary spherocytosis, <strong>defective scaffolding proteins</strong> disrupt the vertical attachments between the cell membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton.&nbsp; As a result, the RBC progressively sheds its weakened cell membrane and develops a spherical shape (ie, spherocyte) that is far less flexible than its normal biconcave shape.&nbsp; These rigid spherocytes become sequestered in the spleen and are phagocytosed by splenic macrophages (ie, <strong>extravascular hemolysis</strong>).&nbsp; Continued RBC sequestration and hemolysis lead to splenomegaly and anemia over time.</p><br><br><p>Chronic hemolysis also leads to excess bilirubin production that overwhelms hepatic bilirubin conjugation and elimination (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24745.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The resultant hyperbilirubinemia leads to scleral icterus, jaundice, dark urine, and the eventual development of pigment (calcium bilirubinate) gallstones (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26052.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Although many variants in any of the 5 scaffolding protein genes have been associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it is generally inherited in an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> pattern and is most common in patients of northern European descent.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with hereditary spherocytosis have varying degrees of hemolysis, depending on the genetic variant.&nbsp; Hereditary spherocytosis may present as an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient.&nbsp; Alternately, patients can have symptoms of chronic extravascular hemolysis, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Anemia</strong>:&nbsp; Patients can have symptoms of anemia (eg, pallor, fatigue).&nbsp; Certain infections (eg, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus) can accelerate hemolysis (ie, hemolytic crisis), exacerbating the anemia and prompting medical evaluation.&nbsp; Because patients depend on accelerated RBC production to compensate for chronic hemolysis, certain infections associated with bone marrow suppression (eg, parvovirus B19) can result in severe drops in hemoglobin levels (ie, aplastic crisis).&nbsp; Anemia can also be exacerbated by nutritional deficiencies (eg, folate) or pregnancy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Jaundice</strong>:&nbsp; Excess bilirubin production results in scleral icterus and jaundice.&nbsp; In severe cases, jaundice may be present on the first day of life, requiring phototherapy.&nbsp; Over time, excess bilirubin can precipitate as calcium bilirubinate, forming pigmented gallstones.&nbsp; These patients are at increased risk for cholecystitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Splenomegaly</strong>:&nbsp; As spherocytes become sequestered in the spleen, patients can develop a palpable spleen.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Although de novo mutations can occur, patients often have a family history of hereditary spherocytosis.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnostic evaluation of suspected hereditary spherocytosis involves the following laboratory tests:</p>\n<h2>Complete blood count with reticulocyte count and RBC indices</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Decreased hemoglobin concentration</li>\n\t<li>Normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV):&nbsp;

EMA fluorescent dye binds band 3, a scaffolding protein.&nbsp; In hereditary spherocytosis, the EMA binding test shows decreased fluorescence due to loss of cell membrane surface area and associated band 3 attachment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Osmotic fragility test</strong>:&nbsp; RBCs are exposed to buffered saline solutions with varying osmolarity (ie, NaCl concentration).&nbsp; In hereditary spherocytosis, RBCs are more susceptible to lysis when exposed to hypotonic saline solutions due to a decreased surface area/volume ratio (less excess cell membrane available for RBC expansion as water diffuses into the cell from the hypotonic solution).&nbsp; Therefore, patients exhibit a higher percentage of hemolysis at any given NaCl concentration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Other inherited hemolytic anemias</strong>:&nbsp; Like hereditary spherocytosis, these disorders present with clinical findings of hemolysis (eg, anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly).&nbsp; RBC morphology can help distinguish these conditions:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Hemoglobin disorders (eg, sickle cell disease, thalassemia)</li>\n\t\t<li>RBC enzyme disorders (eg, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency): G6PD deficiency is characterized by episodic, not chronic, hemolysis.&nbsp; In addition, G6PD deficiency may have blister cells (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L81713.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Spherocytes are not expected on peripheral smear.</li>\n\t\t<li>Other RBC membrane disorders, including elliptocytosis (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13788.png\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Immune-mediated hemolytic anemias</strong> (eg, alloimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn, autoimmune hemolytic anemia):&nbsp; Antibodies bind RBC membrane surface receptors, resulting in hemolytic anemia.&nbsp; The opsonized RBCs enter the spleen and are recognized by macrophages that remove the immune complex and surrounding cell membrane.&nbsp; Loss of cell membrane surface area results in a spherical shape identical to the spherocytes in hereditary spherocytosis.&nbsp; However, immune-mediated hemolytic anemias can be distinguished from hereditary spherocytosis via a positive direct antibody (Coombs) test.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other causes of neonatal jaundice</strong> (eg, benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, breastfeeding failure jaundice):&nbsp; Hereditary spherocytosis can present at birth with indirect hyperbilirubinemia, so it can be difficult to distinguish from other causes of neonatal jaundice.&nbsp; Abnormal RBC morphology and severe, prolonged neonatal jaundice (&gt;1 week) raise suspicion for inherited hemolytic anemia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of hereditary spherocytosis is supportive while minimizing complications related to chronic hemolysis, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Monitoring:&nbsp; If hereditary spherocytosis is diagnosed at birth, hemoglobin levels should be closely monitored because some patients may require RBC transfusions during infancy.&nbsp; Older children and adults may require occasional RBC transfusions for acute drops in hemoglobin levels (eg, aplastic crises, hemolytic crises).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Folic acid supplementation</strong>:&nbsp; Because chronic hemolysis consumes folate, supplementation is recommended.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Splenectomy</strong>:&nbsp; Splenectomy is a definitive treatment for moderate to severe forms of hereditary spherocytosis.&nbsp; It significantly decreases hemolysis, thereby improving anemia and hyperbilirubinemia and reducing the incidence of bilirubin gallstones and cholecystitis.&nbsp; Splenectomy should be performed only after age 5 and after the pneumococcal, meningococcal, and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> vaccination series have been completed to minimize the risk for severe infection with encapsulated organisms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of hereditary spherocytosis varies with the severity of the disease.&nbsp; Although patients with mild disease can remain asymptomatic, those with more severe disease are at greater risk for complications, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Life-threatening anemia</strong>:&nbsp; Because patients depend on accelerated RBC production to compensate for the chronic hemolysis, certain infections associated with bone marrow suppression (eg, parvovirus B19) can result in severe drops in hemoglobin levels (ie, aplastic crisis), requiring RBC transfusions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pigment gallstones</strong>:&nbsp; Chronic hemolysis causes high hemoglobin turnover and excess bilirubin that overwhelms conjugation and elimination from the body.&nbsp; The resulting hyperbilirubinemia can contribute to pigment (calcium bilirubinate) gallstones over time.&nbsp; This can lead to acute cholecystitis requiring cholecystectomy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Asplenia</strong>:&nbsp; Patients with severe disease typically require splenectomy.&nbsp; Although this procedure significantly decreases hemolysis, thereby improving anemia and hyperbilirubinemia, asplenia itself increases the risk for other complications, including:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Thrombosis</strong>:&nbsp; The mechanism is multifactorial and may be contributed by reactive thrombocytosis following splenic removal (normally, a large percentage of circulating platelets are stored within the spleen).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Sepsis</strong>:&nbsp; Without normal splenic clearance of encapsulated organisms (eg, <em>Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>), patients are at lifelong increased risk for sepsis related to these organisms.&nbsp; The risk can be reduced with appropriate vaccinations and postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder in which defective red blood cell (RBC) membrane scaffolding proteins (eg, spectrin, ankyrin, band 3) disrupt attachments between the cell membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/67674.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
