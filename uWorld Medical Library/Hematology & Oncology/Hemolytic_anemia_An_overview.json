It can occur due to a variety of causes, which are broadly categorized into 3 mechanisms: blood loss, decreased RBC production, and increased RBC destruction.</p><br><br><p>This article focuses on the causes of increased RBC destruction, or hemolytic anemias.</p>\n<h1>Normal RBC homeostasis</h1><br><br><p>Normal RBCs have an average lifespan of around 120 days.&nbsp; During this time, the RBC must maintain a flexible, durable cell membrane that can withstand the physical stresses of continuous circulation.&nbsp; In addition, the RBC must maintain functional enzymes to sustain its metabolic needs.&nbsp; With normal degradation over time, the RBC gradually loses its ability to function.&nbsp; Approximately 1%-2% of circulating RBCs reach the end of their lifespan at any given time.&nbsp; These senescent cells are recognized by splenic macrophages, which engulf and remove them from circulation.</p><br><br><p>As these RBCs are removed, they are replaced by an equal number of newly formed RBCs to maintain physiologic homeostasis.&nbsp; This balance is regulated by erythropoietin (EPO), a growth factor that stimulates erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow to proliferate, differentiate, and mature into functional RBCs.&nbsp; EPO is secreted by the kidneys in response to tissue hypoxia, which is in part dependent on the amount of hemoglobin present.</p>\n<h1>Hemolysis</h1><br><br><p>Hemolysis is the premature destruction or removal of RBCs from circulation before they complete their normal lifespan.&nbsp; This destruction can arise from various causes through 2 main methods:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Extravascular hemolysis</strong> (most common):&nbsp; Occurs in the reticuloendothelial system (eg, spleen, liver).&nbsp; In this process, RBCs are damaged but remain structurally intact.&nbsp; On entering the reticuloendothelial system, they are recognized and phagocytosed by macrophages.&nbsp; Hemoglobin is degraded within the macrophages, a process that prevents the release of free hemoglobin into the circulation, where it could be toxic.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intravascular hemolysis</strong>:&nbsp; Occurs within the circulation.&nbsp; In this process, RBCs are damaged so severely that they rupture in circulation, releasing free hemoglobin that can be toxic (eg, contributing to vasoconstriction, oxidative stress, renal injury, thrombosis).&nbsp; To mitigate this toxicity, the protein haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin with high affinity, and the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex is rapidly cleared from circulation.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Both mechanisms can occur simultaneously in some conditions.&nbsp; Regardless of the pathway, hemolysis leads to a reduction in circulating hemoglobin with resultant hypoxia.</p><br><br><p>In response, the kidneys secrete EPO, which accelerates RBC production in the bone marrow.&nbsp; Within a few days, reticulocytes (immature RBCs) typically appear in the peripheral blood as evidence of this compensatory response.&nbsp; In mild hemolysis, compensatory EPO secretion and RBC production can maintain homeostasis.&nbsp; However, if RBC destruction outpaces the bone marrow's capacity for replacement, anemia develops.</p><br><br><p>The underlying causes of hemolysis can be intrinsic or extrinsic to the RBC.</p>\n<h1>Intrinsic RBC defects</h1><br><br><p>Intrinsic RBC defects include structural and metabolic abnormalities within the cell itself that increase its vulnerability to destruction.&nbsp; Intrinsic RBC defects are typically inherited and lead to ongoing (ie, chronic) extravascular hemolysis.&nbsp; The major categories of intrinsic RBC defects include RBC membrane abnormalities, metabolic abnormalities, and hemoglobinopathies.</p>\n<h2>RBC membrane abnormalities</h2><br><br><p>RBC membrane abnormalities affect the RBC membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton.&nbsp; An example is hereditary spherocytosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/40923.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which is caused by deficient RBC scaffolding proteins (eg, spectrin, ankyrin) that connect the cell membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton.&nbsp; Without this attachment, the RBC progressively sheds its membrane and develops a spherical shape (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22861.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Spherocytes are less flexible and therefore easily trapped in splenic fenestrations, leading to chronic extravascular hemolysis.&nbsp; Although the RBC's shape is abnormal, its average size remains generally normal (ie, normocytic).&nbsp; Increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is a unique feature that occurs due to membrane loss and subsequent concentration of cytoplasmic contents.<p></p>\n<h2>Metabolic abnormalities</h2><br><br><p>Metabolic abnormalities include enzyme deficiencies that impair cellular metabolism.&nbsp; The most common metabolic abnormalities are:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency</strong>:&nbsp; G6PD is an enzyme in RBCs that reduces NADP<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> to NADPH (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45559.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which is needed to regenerate reduced glutathione, a powerful antioxidant.&nbsp;

Examples include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Sickle cell disease</strong>:&nbsp; In sickle cell disease, a mutation in the gene for beta-globin leads to an abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) that can polymerize, particularly during hypoxic conditions, and elongate the RBC into a sickle shape (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22431.jpg\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;

This condition is characterized by impaired synthesis of at least one of the 4 alpha- or 2 beta-globin chains, skewing the ratio of alpha to beta chains.&nbsp; This imbalance causes hemoglobin to precipitate, leading to RBC membrane instability and eventual destruction.&nbsp; The presentation varies based on the degree of imbalance.&nbsp; Laboratory evaluation may demonstrate a disproportionately elevated RBC count (although the total hemoglobin mass is low); hypochromic (pale), microcytic (small) RBCs (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24283.jpg\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                );

These types of defects are typically acquired conditions that lead to acute episodes of hemolysis, including immune-mediated defects, mechanical destruction, certain infections and toxins, and hypersplenism.</p>\n<h2>Immune-mediated</h2><br><br><p>Immune-mediated extrinsic RBC defects occur due to antibodies against antigens on RBCs.&nbsp; These conditions can be broadly divided into autoantibody-mediated and alloantibody-mediated forms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Autoantibodies (autoimmune hemolytic anemia [AIHA])</strong>:&nbsp; AIHA occurs due to the presence of autoantibodies that bind common RBC antigens, leading to RBC destruction.&nbsp; AIHA predominantly leads to extravascular hemolysis, although intravascular hemolysis may also occur in severe cases.&nbsp; There are 2 main types of autoantibodies (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/79875.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Warm autoantibodies</strong> (ie, bind RBCs circulating at normal body temperature) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L40313.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Usually, these IgG autoantibodies form secondary to viral infections, autoimmune conditions, or drug exposures (eg, cephalosporins).&nbsp; In drug-induced AIHA, the drug binds proteins on the RBC surface and acts as a hapten to facilitate IgG attachment.&nbsp; This tags the RBCs for subsequent destruction by splenic macrophages.&nbsp; In some cases, splenic macrophages cause RBCs to lose some membrane and develop a spherical shape.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Cold autoantibodies</strong> (ie, bind RBCs circulating at cooler temperatures):&nbsp; These are usually IgM antibodies that bind RBCs when they circulate through peripheral areas (eg, ear lobes, extremities).&nbsp; These IgM antibodies also bind C3.&nbsp; As the RBCs return from the periphery and the blood warms, IgM detaches while C3 remains attached, leading to hemolysis.&nbsp; Cold AIHA is associated with intravascular agglutination in the extremities, causing acrocyanosis.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Alloantibodies</strong> (hemolytic transfusion reactions):&nbsp; Antibodies in the transfusion recipient target foreign antigens on donor RBCs.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction</strong>:&nbsp; This reaction occurs due to ABO incompatibility (eg, patient with type A blood receives type B blood), which can cause life-threatening rapid intravascular hemolysis.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction</strong>:&nbsp; This reaction involves antibodies that target less immunogenic antigens, resulting in a milder reaction.&nbsp; It usually occurs as an anamnestic response (ie, a rapid response in antibody production during a subsequent exposure to an antigen) that leads to extravascular hemolysis and mild symptoms, typically occurring a week after the transfusion.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mechanical destruction</h2><br><br><p>Causes of mechanical destruction, or microangiopathic hemolytic anemias<em>,</em> are nonimmune and involve intravascular hemolysis from extreme turbulence, mechanical stress, or microvascular abnormalities.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Thrombotic microangiopathy</strong> (TMA):&nbsp;

Complement fixation on RBCs is enhanced when the pH is low, which may occur during in sleep.<p></p><br><br><p>Manifestations of PNH therefore include hemolytic anemia and hemoglobinuria (particularly at night during sleep) and thrombosis (likely related to the release of hemoglobin and other prothrombotic factors from lysed RBCs and activated platelets).&nbsp; In some cases, PNH becomes clinically apparent only after concurrent bone marrow failure (ie, immune-mediated destruction of normal stem cells permits expansion of preexisting PNH clones).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Although various causes of hemolytic anemia exist, the clinical presentations share several common features, including anemia and jaundice (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L111824.png\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )<p></p>\n<h2>Anemia</h2><br><br><p>The severity of anemia depends on whether the hemolysis is acute or chronic.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Acute hemolysis:&nbsp; Patients are more likely to be symptomatic (eg, pallor, fatigue) due to a rapid, uncompensated drop in hemoglobin levels.</li>\n\t<li>Chronic hemolysis:&nbsp; Some patients are minimally symptomatic due to compensation, whereas others may require frequent transfusions.&nbsp; Because patients with chronic hemolytic anemia depend on accelerated RBC production to compensate, certain infections associated with bone marrow suppression (eg, parvovirus B19) can cause severe acute drops in hemoglobin (ie, aplastic crisis).&nbsp; Anemia can also be exacerbated by nutritional deficiencies (eg, folate) or pregnancy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hemolysis</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Jaundice:&nbsp; Hemolysis results in excess unconjugated bilirubin that overwhelms normal hepatic metabolism, leading to scleral icterus and jaundice (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16306.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Bilirubin gallstones:&nbsp; Over time, excess bilirubin can precipitate as calcium bilirubinate, forming pigmented gallstones, which increase the risk for biliary colic and cholecystitis.</li>\n\t<li>Splenomegaly:&nbsp; In extravascular hemolysis, increased RBC clearance by splenic macrophages causes red pulp hyperplasia and splenic enlargement.</li>\n\t<li>Effects of free hemoglobin (more likely with intravascular hemolysis):\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Hemoglobinuria:&nbsp; Free hemoglobin not bound to haptoglobin is filtered and excreted in the urine, resulting in dark urine.</li>\n\t\t<li>Back/abdominal pain:&nbsp; Free hemoglobin binds nitric oxide, triggering smooth muscle dystonia.</li>\n\t\t<li>Thrombosis:&nbsp; The release of free hemoglobin appears to contribute to thrombosis, seen in certain hemolytic disorders (eg, PNH).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Additional features unique to each condition are discussed in their respective articles.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnostic approach of hemolytic anemia begins with a thorough history (eg, recent exposures, family history) and physical examination (eg, jaundice, splenomegaly).&nbsp; Laboratory assessment can confirm the presence of hemolysis and provide additional information.</p>\n<h2>RBC indices and reticulocyte count</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Red cell indices include:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Mean corpuscular volume:&nbsp; Typically normal; in severe cases, the mean corpuscular volume may be increased due to significant reticulocytosis.</li>\n\t\t<li>MCHC:&nbsp; Increased MCHC (ie, &gt;36%) is a distinguishing feature of spherocytosis and AIHA; the spherical shape results in decreased surface area with increased concentration of cytoplasmic contents (eg, hemoglobin).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Reticulocyte count:&nbsp; Because EPO increases in response to anemia, the reticulocyte count is higher than the baseline 1%-2%.&nbsp; Reticulocytosis is consistent with accelerated RBC production, which is an expected compensatory response to hemolysis.&nbsp; Reticulocyte counts may not be appropriately elevated during hemolysis if concurrent bone marrow suppression (eg, parvovirus infection) has occurred.&nbsp; Conversely, an elevated reticulocyte count is not specific to hemolysis and can also be seen in other causes (eg, acute hypoxia, bone marrow recovery following transient aplasia).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In most cases, the white blood cell and platelet counts are normal.&nbsp; However, concurrent thrombocytopenia suggests a diagnosis of TMA.</p>\n<h2>Hemolysis testing</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Lactate dehydrogenase:&nbsp; Elevated.</li>\n\t<li>Unconjugated bilirubin:&nbsp; Elevated due to excess heme metabolism, which overwhelms hepatic conjugation.</li>\n\t<li>Haptoglobin:&nbsp; Decreased because it binds free hemoglobin, particularly in cases of intravascular hemolysis.</li>\n\t<li>Direct antibody (Coombs) test:&nbsp; Positive if hemolysis is antibody mediated (eg, positive for IgG in warm AIHA, positive for C3 in cold AIHA).</li>\n\t<li>Urinalysis (typically obtained if dark urine is suggestive of hemoglobinuria in intravascular hemolysis):&nbsp; It may be positive for blood (false-positive result due to the presence of heme, which reacts with the urine dipstick).&nbsp; However, microscopy shows no erythrocytes (ie, hemoglobinuria, not hematuria).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Peripheral blood smear</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>RBC morphology:&nbsp; Depends on the underlying cause (eg, spherocytes suggest hereditary spherocytosis&nbsp;or AIHA, schistocytes suggest shearing from MAHA or mechanical heart valves).</li>\n\t<li>White blood cell and platelet morphology:&nbsp; Typically normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Targeted testing</h2><br><br><p>Based on this initial evaluation, additional testing may be necessary to identify the underlying etiology of hemolysis (eg, hemoglobin electrophoresis for suspected hemoglobinopathies, G6PD enzyme assay for suspected G6PD deficiency, ADAMTS13 activity levels for suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP]).&nbsp; Bone marrow evaluation is not typically indicated for hemolytic anemia; if performed, it usually shows erythroid hyperplasia.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of hemolytic anemia depends on the underlying etiology and symptom severity.&nbsp; Management includes supportive care, disease-specific therapy, and long-term considerations:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Supportive care:&nbsp; In patients with acute hemolysis with a rapid decrease in hemoglobin levels, life-threatening anemia and hemodynamic instability require aggressive treatment.&nbsp; RBC transfusions are used to correct the anemia.&nbsp; RBC transfusions are more effective in intrinsic defects (eg, HS, thalassemia) because the donated RBCs lack the underlying defect.&nbsp; In extrinsic RBC defects (eg, AIHA), transfused RBCs are subject to the same destruction and are likely to hemolyze.</li>\n\t<li>Disease-specific therapy:&nbsp; Depending on the etiology of the hemolysis, additional treatment may be necessary.&nbsp; Such treatments may include splenectomy in conditions with severe chronic extravascular hemolysis, immunosuppression in antibody-mediated hemolysis, and therapeutic plasma exchange to replenish ADAMTS13 in TTP.</li>\n\t<li>Long-term considerations:&nbsp; Folic acid supplementation may be required due to folate deficiency with RBC turnover.&nbsp; In addition, patients who require frequent RBC transfusions should be monitored for iron overload (eg, serial ferritin levels).&nbsp; Chelation therapy should be considered to prevent further complications (eg, cirrhosis/liver failure, heart failure).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Hemolytic anemia occurs due to a variety of conditions characterized by premature destruction of red blood cells.&nbsp; Causes include conditions intrinsic or extrinsic to the RBC, and hemolysis may occur extravascularly or intravascularly.&nbsp; Clinical features include symptoms of anemia (eg, fatigue) and signs of hemolysis (eg, jaundice, splenomegaly).&nbsp; Laboratory testing consistent with a hemolytic process includes increased reticulocyte count, increased unconjugated bilirubin, increased LDH, and possibly decreased haptoglobin.&nbsp; Management strategies include supportive care (eg, packed RBC transfusions) and disease-specific treatments.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
