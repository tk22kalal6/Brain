Acute RVT is usually symptomatic, whereas chronic RVT is typically asymptomatic and detected incidentally.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The primary driver of RVT is <strong>hypercoagulability</strong>, which also predisposes to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE).&nbsp; In <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong>, the leading cause of RVT, the following 3 key mechanisms are thought to contribute to thrombotic risk:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Urinary loss of natural anticoagulant proteins (eg, protein C).</li>\n\t<li>Increased hepatic synthesis of procoagulant factors (eg, fibrinogen).</li>\n\t<li>Increased platelet activity (eg, increased thromboxane A<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> synthesis).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These changes tilt the hemostatic system toward thrombosis.&nbsp; In addition, hemoconcentration in the postglomerular circulation (due to fluid loss at the glomerulus) further increases the likelihood of RVT.</p><br><br><p>Additional risk factors include:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Malignancy:&nbsp; Renal cell carcinoma, which is a major contributor, both via hypercoagulability and direct tumor invasion into the renal vein.</li>\n\t<li>Thrombophilia:&nbsp; Inherited (eg, factor V Leiden) or acquired (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome).</li>\n\t<li>Extrinsic factors:&nbsp; Trauma (eg, renal biopsy, abdominal injury), oral contraceptive pills, or external compression (eg, retroperitoneal mass).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation and diagnosis</h1><h2>Symptoms</h2><br><br><p>RVT manifests differently depending on its acuity.</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Acute</strong> RVT typically presents with flank pain (renovascular congestion leading to capsular stretch) and hematuria (glomerular vessel damage from increased pressure).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic</strong> RVT is often insidious and asymptomatic, discovered incidentally during imaging for unrelated conditions or when complications arise (such as PE due to dislodgment of the thrombus into the inferior vena cava).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Most cases of RVT occur in the setting of nephrotic syndrome; therefore, in patients with this syndrome, there should be a high index of suspicion for RVT because typical presenting symptoms overlap with those of more common disorders (eg, nephrolithiasis).</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Acute unilateral RVT typically does not cause acute kidney injury (AKI) because glomerular filtration is maintained through the other kidney (ie, normal serum creatinine).&nbsp; Elevated <strong>lactate dehydrogenase</strong>, indicating renal infarction and necrosis, may be an important clue.&nbsp; Occasionally, RVT can present bilaterally and is accompanied by AKI.&nbsp; Evaluation for nephrotic syndrome should be pursued, if not yet diagnosed (eg, proteinuria &gt;3.5 g/day, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia).</p>\n<h2>Imaging</h2><br><br><p>Renal ultrasonography with Doppler and CT scan of the abdomen has low sensitivity and may demonstrate only an <strong>enlarged kidney</strong>, although Doppler ultrasonography can sometimes reveal a reversal of diastolic flow.&nbsp; The diagnosis is usually confirmed using CT/MR angiography; invasive renal venography may be needed in some cases.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of RVT depends on the presence of AKI, which, if present, requires urgent clot removal (eg, thrombolysis, thrombectomy); otherwise, <strong>anticoagulation</strong> alone is appropriate for both acute and chronic RVT.&nbsp; A typical regimen includes warfarin bridged with low molecular weight heparin.&nbsp; The underlying cause, including treatment of nephrotic syndrome or malignancy, should also be addressed.</p><br><br><p>In patients with membranous nephropathy who have not yet developed RVT, prophylactic anticoagulation is often recommended.&nbsp; In other causes of nephrotic syndrome, prophylaxis may be considered in the setting of severe hypoalbuminemia and a low bleeding risk.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/50315.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an occlusion of the renal veins most often associated with nephrotic syndrome, particularly membranous nephropathy.&nbsp; Additional risk factors include malignancy (particularly renal cell), inherited hypercoagulable states, and trauma.&nbsp; Acute RVT typically presents with flank pain and hematuria, whereas chronic cases are usually asymptomatic or can present with pulmonary embolism.&nbsp; In nephrotic syndrome, the underlying cause of RVT is hypercoagulability through urinary loss of anticoagulant proteins, increased hepatic synthesis of procoagulant factors, and heightened platelet activation.&nbsp; The condition is typically diagnosed via imaging with CT/MR angiography.&nbsp; Management focuses on anticoagulation, with thrombolysis or thrombectomy reserved for cases complicated by acute kidney injury.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
