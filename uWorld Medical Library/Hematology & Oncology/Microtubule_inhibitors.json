Microtubule inhibitors arrest cell division and are especially effective against rapidly proliferating cancer cells.&nbsp; These agents are fundamental components of many chemotherapeutic regimens treating a variety of malignancies.</p>\n<h1>Overview of chemotherapy</h1><br><br><p>Cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that have acquired the ability to evade the body's normal control mechanisms (eg, resisting apoptosis, escaping immune surveillance).</p><br><br><p>Various strategies have been developed to treat cancer, including different combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.&nbsp; Chemotherapy involves the use of certain drugs (ie, chemical agents) to prevent the further growth of or induce death in these proliferating cells.&nbsp; Chemotherapeutic agents achieve these goals through different mechanisms that target various cellular components, including nucleic acids (eg, damaging DNA), cellular enzymes (eg, inhibiting enzymes required to synthesize essential cell proteins), or cellular structural components (eg, preventing the assembly of microtubules).</p><br><br><p>An important principle of cancer treatment involves the use of multiagent therapy (ie, combining agents that have different mechanisms of action) to prevent resistance to single agents and increase the likelihood of cure.&nbsp; Chemotherapeutic agents can be categorized based on various features (eg, mechanism of action, chemical type); a common approach is to categorize the agents based on whether the mechanism of action depends on the cell-cycle status.&nbsp; Chemotherapeutic agents can therefore be broadly divided into cell-cycle–specific and cell-cycle–nonspecific agents.</p>\n<h2>Cell-cycle–specific agents</h2><br><br><p>Cell-cycle–specific agents require that cells enter the cell cycle because these agents are only effective during certain phases of the cycle (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26336.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; These agents are generally given over a prolonged period (eg, long infusion, divided doses over several days) to affect as many cells that enter the cell cycle as possible.&nbsp; Examples of these agents include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Antimetabolites</strong>:&nbsp; These are structured similarly to substrates required during nucleotide assembly and therefore interfere with biosynthesis.&nbsp; Antimetabolites work during S phase (ie, when DNA is duplicated) when they are substituted for the intended substrate, halting further DNA production.&nbsp; Agents include purine and pyrimidine analogues (eg, mercaptopurine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil) and folate analogues (eg, methotrexate).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Topoisomerase inhibitors</strong>:&nbsp; Topoisomerases are enzymes that transiently cut and reseal DNA to relieve supercoils that form when DNA unwinds during replication, repair, and transcription (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L51415.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Topoisomerase inhibitors block these critical enzymes, which are particularly active during late S and early G2 phase (when DNA replication errors are identified and repaired prior to cell division) phases, leading to nucleic acid breaks and cell death.&nbsp; These agents can inhibit topoisomerase II (eg, etoposide) or topoisomerase I (eg, irinotecan).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Microtubule inhibitors</strong>:&nbsp; Plant-derived agents that impair microtubule assembly and disassembly, processes required during <strong>M phase</strong> (ie, when a single cell splits into 2 cells via mitosis).&nbsp; Vinca alkaloids (eg, vincristine) inhibit microtubule assembly, and taxanes (eg, paclitaxel) inhibit microtubule disassembly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cell-cycle–nonspecific agents</h2><br><br><p>Cell-cycle–nonspecific agents work during any phase of the cell cycle and may usually be administered in a large bolus dose.&nbsp; Examples include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Alkylating agents</strong>:&nbsp; Heterogeneous group of agents that form DNA strand cross-linkages via the attachment of alkyl groups, ultimately leading to cell death.&nbsp; Examples include nitrogen mustards (eg, cyclophosphamide) and alkyl sulfonates (eg, busulfan).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antitumor antibiotics</strong>:&nbsp; Heterogeneous group of agents derived from microorganisms that have activity against the development of other types of living cells.&nbsp; Antitumor antibiotics commonly interfere with nucleic acids, preventing replication and transcription and triggering apoptosis.&nbsp; They can work by damaging DNA directly and/or indirectly.&nbsp; Agents include anthracyclines (eg, doxorubicin) and bleomycin.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>This article will focus on the microtubule inhibitors.</p>\n<h1>Normal microtubule function</h1><br><br><p>Microtubules are dynamic polymers composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers.&nbsp; Microtubules are involved in:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cytoskeleton formation.</li>\n\t<li>Intracellular transport of organelles and vesicles:&nbsp; Microtubules are an essential cytoskeletal component for axonal transport, providing a pathway for motor proteins (eg, kinesin, dynein) to carry organelles and other cellular products within the cell.&nbsp; This is particularly important in cells with long axons (eg, neurons) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L35445.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Mitotic spindle formation during cell division.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Microtubule inhibitor mechanisms of action</h1><br><br><p>Dysregulation of microtubule dynamics can impair mitosis and eventually trigger apoptosis.&nbsp; Highly mitotic cancer cells are particularly susceptible to microtubule inhibitors.&nbsp; These include microtubule-destabilizing and microtubule-stabilizing agents.</p>\n<h2>Microtubule-destabilizing agents (eg, vinca alkaloids)</h2><br><br><p>Microtubule-destabilizing agents (ie, <strong>vinca alkaloids</strong>) bind the beta-tubulin subunit of microtubules and <strong>inhibit tubulin polymerization</strong> (ie, <strong>inhibit microtubule assembly</strong>), leading to mitotic arrest.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Examples:&nbsp; Vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Microtubule-stabilizing agents (ie, taxanes)</h2><br><br><p>In contrast to vinca alkaloids, microtubule-stabilizing agents (ie, <strong>taxanes</strong>) <strong>promote tubulin polymerization</strong> (ie, <strong>inhibit microtubule disassembly</strong>) and thereby stabilize microtubules against depolymerization.&nbsp; This prevents the dynamic restructuring necessary for mitosis, leading to mitotic arrest.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Examples:&nbsp; Paclitaxel, docetaxel.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Microtubule inhibitors can also <strong>disrupt intracellular transport and signaling pathways</strong>, resulting in adverse effects.</p>\n<h1>Indications</h1><br><br><p>Microtubule inhibitors are utilized in the treatment regimen for a wide range of malignancies, including hematologic malignancies (eg, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma), CNS tumors, and other solid tumors (eg, Wilms tumor, Ewing sarcoma).</p>\n<h1>Adverse effects and monitoring</h1><br><br><p>The adverse effects of microtubule inhibitors are similar to the adverse effects of other chemotherapeutic agents.&nbsp; In general, these agents affect cells that are normally highly mitotic (eg, hematopoietic cells [causing cytopenias], intestinal enterocytes [causing nausea/vomiting] (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L55819.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), skin cells [causing alopecia]).<p></p><br><br><p>A unique adverse effect of microtubule inhibitors involves the inhibition of <strong>neurons</strong>, which rely on microtubules for the transport of cellular products between the neuronal cell body and axon terminals.&nbsp; <strong>Vinca alkaloids</strong>, for example, block tubulin polymerization in axons, disrupting axonal transport and leading to neurotoxicity (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84121.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Many patients develop <strong>peripheral neuropathy</strong>, which can affect sensory nerves (eg, progressive numbness and tingling in the extremities), motor nerves (eg, weakness, foot-drop), and autonomic nerves (eg, constipation).&nbsp; Patients may also experience loss of deep tendon reflexes.&nbsp; These effects can be managed with drugs used to treat neuropathic pain (eg, gabapentin) and physical therapy.&nbsp; Because of these neurotoxic effects, agents like vincristine are not administered intrathecally.<p></p><br><br><p><strong>Taxanes</strong> (eg, paclitaxel) have additional significant adverse reactions, including <strong>hypersensitivity reactions</strong>, <strong>arrhythmias</strong>, and elevated transaminase levels.&nbsp; Patients undergoing treatment with microtubule inhibitors should be closely monitored for these adverse effects (eg, routine neurologic examinations and laboratory assessment).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Microtubule inhibitors target the dynamic structures essential for cell division, making them potent agents against rapidly dividing cancer cells.&nbsp; Microtubule inhibitors can be broadly categorized into microtubule-destabilizing agents (eg, vincristine) and microtubule-stabilizing agents (eg, paclitaxel), each impairing microtubule functions necessary for mitosis.&nbsp; Adverse effects include myelosuppression and neuropathy.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
