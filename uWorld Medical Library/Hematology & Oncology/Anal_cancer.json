The risk is highest in individuals who engage in receptive anal intercourse, particularly men who have sex with men, and in those with advanced HIV infection (due to immunosuppression and a higher prevalence of persistent HPV infection).&nbsp; The most common histologic subtype is squamous cell carcinoma.&nbsp; Anal cancer often presents with bleeding, pain, and a sensation of anal fullness; physical examination classically shows a nodular, exophytic mass or an ulcerated lesion.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The majority of anal cancers are linked to oncogenic strains of <strong>human papillomavirus (HPV)</strong>, a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus transmitted through oral, vaginal, or anal sexual contact.&nbsp; HPV causes disease by infecting and replicating within squamous epithelial cells.&nbsp; Its oncogenic potential arises following integration into the host genome and subsequent expression of viral oncoproteins E6 and E7.&nbsp; These proteins inactivate the tumor suppressors p53 and Rb, respectively, disrupting cell cycle control and promoting neoplastic transformation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31100.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; HPV types 16 and 18 are most strongly associated with malignancy.<p></p><br><br><p>In addition, <strong>chronic inflammation</strong> and <strong>immunosuppression</strong> can further drive malignant progression in the anal epithelium.&nbsp; Chronic inflammation (eg, due to inflammatory bowel disease) promotes repeated cycles of injury and repair, generating DNA-damaging reactive species and fostering abnormal cell proliferation.&nbsp; Immunosuppression (eg, HIV infection) impairs immune surveillance, reducing the body's ability to eliminate precancerous or HPV-infected cells and allowing oncogenic changes to persist.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>HPV infection (especially types 16 and 18).</li>\n\t<li>Receptive anal intercourse.</li>\n\t<li>Multiple sexual partners.</li>\n\t<li>Chronic immunosuppression (eg, HIV infection, post-organ transplant).</li>\n\t<li>Smoking.</li>\n\t<li>History of cervical, vulvar, or vaginal dysplasia or cancer.</li>\n\t<li>Chronic inflammatory conditions (eg, Crohn disease, anal fissure) affecting the perianal area.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Most anal cancers are <strong>squamous cell carcinomas</strong> (SCCs), characterized histologically by large, eosinophilic, hyperchromatic squamous cells with scant cytoplasm arranged in irregular islands.&nbsp;

ASIL is classified as low-grade or high-grade based on the extent of nuclear atypia and mitotic activity seen on biopsy.&nbsp; Whereas low-grade ASIL may be monitored in select cases, treatment is strongly recommended for high-grade ASIL due to its potential for malignant progression.<p></p><br><br><p>Less common types of anal tumors include adenocarcinoma (arising from anal glands or rectal mucosa), perianal melanoma, and neuroendocrine carcinomas.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Symptoms of anal cancer may be subtle and nonspecific, often leading to delays in diagnosis.&nbsp;

On examination, a soft to firm, compressible mass may be palpable at the anal verge.&nbsp; However, ulcerated or nodular lesions and regional lymphadenopathy are not typical features.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anal fissure</strong>:&nbsp; Typically associated with severe, sharp pain during bowel movements and a small amount of bright red rectal bleeding.&nbsp; Lesions usually appear as linear tears, most commonly in the posterior midline, and generally heal within 6 weeks.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anal fistulas</strong>:&nbsp; Often develop as a complication of a previous anorectal abscess and are characterized by chronic purulent perianal drainage and intermittent rectal pain.&nbsp; They typically present as small, external openings near the anus, sometimes with induration or tenderness along the tract.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Condyloma acuminata</strong> (genital warts) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10187.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

Sexually transmitted infection causing painful genital ulcers with ragged edges, a gray-yellow exudate, and marked, tender inguinal lymphadenitis that can suppurate; painless lymphadenopathy is not characteristic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of anal cancer begins with a thorough history to assess for risk factors (eg, HIV, receptive anal intercourse), followed by a comprehensive physical examination that includes a digital rectal examination (DRE), anoscopy, and palpation of regional (eg, inguinal, femoral) lymph nodes.&nbsp; Any suspicious lesions in the anus or distal rectum should be biopsied for histopathologic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>The laboratory workup for anal cancer may include HIV and HPV testing due to the high association between anal cancer and these infections.&nbsp; Women who are diagnosed with anal cancer should have a thorough gynecologic evaluation (with biopsy as needed) to rule out associated HPV-related cervical cancer.</p>\n<h2>Imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Once anal carcinoma is confirmed via biopsy, imaging plays a critical role in staging and treatment planning.&nbsp; The primary goals are to assess the size and local extent of the primary tumor (T-staging), evaluate regional lymph node involvement (N-staging), and detect distant metastases (M-staging).&nbsp; Imaging modalities include MRI of the pelvis (preferred), CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, PET scan, and endoanal ultrasonography.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Most anal cancers are treated with chemotherapy and radiation (ie, <strong>chemoradiation</strong>) rather than surgery.&nbsp; Chemoradiation has a high cure rate and reduces the risk of surgically induced sphincter injury and dysfunction, a debilitating complication of operative excision.</p><br><br><p>Surgical intervention (eg, abdominoperineal resection) is generally reserved for salvage therapy in patients with persistent or recurrent disease following definitive chemoradiation.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for anal cancer is generally favorable with early detection and standard treatment, though outcomes vary significantly based on the stage at diagnosis.&nbsp; The 5-year survival rate for localized disease (cancer confined to the anal area) is approximately 80%.&nbsp; For cases with regional spread (involving nearby structures or lymph nodes), survival rate decreases to around 60%-70%.&nbsp; In patients with distant metastases (spread to organs such as the liver or lungs), the 5-year survival rate drops to approximately 30%.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Primary prevention strategies for anal cancer include safe sexual practices (eg, consistent condom use), <strong>HPV vaccination</strong> (recommended for all adolescents and at-risk adults) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31565.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ), and smoking cessation.<p></p><br><br><p>Regular screening (eg, digital rectal examinations) and, in some cases, anal cytology (analogous to Pap smears), may be considered for high-risk populations.&nbsp;
