Without pyruvate kinase, erythrocytes cannot generate sufficient adenosine triphosphate (ATP), resulting in chronic hemolysis.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The mature RBC is unique in that it lacks a nucleus and organelles, including mitochondria.&nbsp; As a result, RBCs rely exclusively on anaerobic glycolysis to produce ATP and are particularly vulnerable to defects in glycolytic enzymes (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L33830.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The most commonly affected enzyme is pyruvate kinase, which catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, which generates ATP.<p></p><br><br><p>In pyruvate kinase deficiency, impaired ATP production disrupts ion transport, leading to water and potassium loss.&nbsp; This disturbance affects membrane stability and contributes to the premature destruction of RBCs.&nbsp; Affected RBCs are removed primarily by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system, particularly the spleen (ie, <strong>extravascular hemolysis</strong>), which results in a <strong>chronic hemolytic anemia</strong>.</p><br><br><p>In addition, pyruvate kinase deficiency causes metabolic disturbances that lead to premature apoptosis of RBC precursors (ie, <strong>ineffective erythropoiesis</strong>).&nbsp; This early loss of RBC precursors enhances intestinal iron absorption and leads to iron overload.</p><br><br><p>An interesting protective feature of pyruvate kinase deficiency is the accumulation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27941.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), an upstream precursor of pyruvate.&nbsp; This leads to a rightward shift in the oxygen dissociation curve and more oxygen off-loading at the tissues (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14561.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Therefore, patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency are relatively more tolerant of anemia at any given hemoglobin level.<p></p><br><br><p>Several isoforms of the pyruvate kinase enzyme exist.&nbsp; Pyruvate kinase deficiency presenting with hemolytic anemia involves mutations in the gene that encodes the RBC-specific isoform (ie, <em>PKLR</em> gene).&nbsp; <em>PKLR</em> gene mutations do not affect isoforms of pyruvate kinase in other cell types, which continue to function normally.</p><br><br><p>Pyruvate kinase deficiency requires 2 pathogenic alleles (eg, homozygous and compound heterozygous) for symptoms to manifest and is therefore inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.&nbsp; It is the second-most common enzyme deficiency that affects RBCs; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Although pyruvate kinase deficiency is a lifelong hematologic condition, the initial presentation can vary, depending on the severity of hemolysis.&nbsp; This can range from fetal anemia with hydrops fetalis to mild anemia in adulthood.&nbsp; Clinical findings are usually related to:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Anemia</strong>:&nbsp; The severity can vary.&nbsp; Because the anemia is chronic and patients have increased 2,3-BPG, some may have minimal symptoms (mild fatigue), whereas others require ongoing packed RBC (pRBC) transfusions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic hemolysis</strong>:&nbsp; <strong>Jaundice</strong> may occur as early as the neonatal period, <strong>splenomegaly</strong> is due to hyperplasia of the splenic red pulp from increased RBC clearance by splenic macrophages, and <strong>bilirubin gallstones</strong> can lead to biliary colic and cholecystitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Transient aplastic crisis</strong>:&nbsp; As with other conditions with chronic hemolysis, pyruvate kinase deficiency relies on steady production of new RBCs.&nbsp; Acute illnesses (eg, parvovirus B19 infection) can suppress erythropoiesis, resulting in a rapid decline in hemoglobin and life-threatening anemia.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Growth impairment</strong>:&nbsp; Growth impairment can occur in severe cases, likely due to a multifactorial etiology involving anemia, skeletal effects of ineffective erythropoiesis, and endocrine dysfunction from iron overload.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Other inherited hemolytic anemias</strong>:&nbsp; Like pyruvate kinase deficiency, these disorders present with clinical findings of hemolysis (eg, anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly).&nbsp; RBC morphology can help distinguish these conditions, as follows:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Other RBC enzyme disorders</strong> (eg, G6PD deficiency):&nbsp; Characterized by episodic, not chronic, hemolysis.&nbsp; The complete blood count is normal between episodes of hemolysis.&nbsp; In addition, blister cells are often visualized on peripheral smear (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L81713.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Hemoglobin disorders</strong> (eg, sickle cell disease, thalassemia):&nbsp; Can be distinguished from by RBC morphology (eg, sickled RBCs (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22441.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), target cells (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L64457.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>RBC membrane disorders</strong>:&nbsp; Includes spherocytosis (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22864.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and elliptocytosis (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13788.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Immune-mediated hemolytic anemias</strong> (eg, alloimmune hemolytic disease of the newborn, autoimmune hemolytic anemia):&nbsp; Can be distinguished from pyruvate kinase deficiency via a positive direct antibody (Coombs) test.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other causes of neonatal jaundice</strong> (eg, benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, breastfeeding failure jaundice):&nbsp; Pyruvate kinase deficiency can present at birth with indirect hyperbilirubinemia, so it can be difficult to distinguish it from other causes of neonatal jaundice.&nbsp; Anemia and severe, prolonged neonatal jaundice (ie, &gt;1 week) raise suspicion for an inherited hemolytic anemia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Pyruvate kinase deficiency should be suspected in those with unexplained chronic anemia or a family history.&nbsp; Diagnostic evaluation involves:</p>\n<h2>Complete blood count and peripheral smear</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Decreased hemoglobin concentration:&nbsp; Due to chronic hemolysis.</li>\n\t<li>Normal mean corpuscular volume.</li>\n\t<li>Increased reticulocyte count:&nbsp; Due to compensatory RBC production.</li>\n\t<li>RBC morphology:&nbsp; Generally normal but may show echinocytes (ie, burr cells), which are erythrocytes with short, evenly-spaced projections (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13740.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Normal white blood cell and platelet morphology.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hemolysis testing</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increased lactate dehydrogenase:&nbsp; This increase is due to hemolysis.</li>\n\t<li>Increased indirect bilirubin:&nbsp; The rise is due to excess bilirubin production that overwhelms hepatic conjugation.</li>\n\t<li>Low/normal haptoglobin:&nbsp; With ineffective erythropoiesis, the premature death of RBC precursors releases free hemoglobin into plasma, lowering haptoglobin levels.&nbsp; However, the predominant RBC destruction occurs in splenic macrophages (extravascular hemolysis), which does not release free hemoglobin and does not lower haptoglobin.</li>\n\t<li>Negative direct antibody (Coombs) test:&nbsp; Hemolysis is not immune mediated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Confirmatory testing</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Enzyme assay:&nbsp; Decreased pyruvate kinase activity in RBCs is diagnostic.&nbsp; This test should be performed several months after the last transfusion to avoid a false-normal result.</li>\n\t<li>Genetic testing:&nbsp; Genetic testing is usually performed through genomic sequencing to identify a pathogenic variant in the <em>PKLR</em> gene.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Anemia</strong>:&nbsp; Folic acid supplementation is recommended due to increased RBC turnover and erythropoiesis.&nbsp; pRBC transfusions should be considered for symptomatic anemia.<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Mitapivat:&nbsp; Can activate pyruvate kinase enzymatic function and therefore reduce hemolysis.&nbsp; However, this treatment requires a genetic variant with some residual enzyme function.</li>\n\t\t<li>Splenectomy:&nbsp; May be considered in individuals who require frequent pRBC transfusions.&nbsp; However, risks are associated with splenic removal (eg, sepsis due to encapsulated organisms, venous thromboembolism).&nbsp; Therefore, splenectomy is individualized and performed after age 5, when the pneumococcal, meningococcal, and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> vaccination series has been completed to minimize the risk for sepsis.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hyperbilirubinemia</strong>:&nbsp; Phototherapy and/or exchange transfusion may be necessary during the neonatal period for severe hyperbilirubinemia.&nbsp; Cholecystectomy may be considered in patients with symptoms related to gallstones.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Iron overload</strong>:&nbsp; The overload is due to increased iron absorption related to ineffective erythropoiesis.&nbsp; This is further enhanced with pRBC transfusions.&nbsp; Patients require serial ferritin levels, and chelation therapy should be considered to prevent further complications (eg, cirrhosis, heart failure).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis depends on the degree of hemolysis.&nbsp; Patients with adequate compensatory erythropoiesis typically have mild symptoms and a normal life expectancy.&nbsp; Those with moderate to severe hemolytic anemia may have reduced quality of life related to complications (eg, gallstones, iron overload).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive enzymatic defect within the glycolytic pathway that primarily affects red blood cells and results in chronic hemolysis.&nbsp; Clinical manifestations include neonatal jaundice, anemia, splenomegaly, and gallstones.&nbsp; Management is mainly supportive, with splenectomy and transfusions in severe cases.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
