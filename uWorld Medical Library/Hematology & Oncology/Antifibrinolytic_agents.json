Therefore, antifibrinolytic agents stabilize existing clots and reduce bleeding.&nbsp; The 2 most commonly prescribed antifibrinolytic agents are tranexamic acid (TXA) and epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA).</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology of fibrinolysis</h1><br><br><p>Following vascular injury, hemostasis leads to the formation of a fibrin clot \n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L46070.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; As wound healing occurs, the clot dissolves through a process known as fibrinolysis \n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L39449.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The main component driving fibrinolysis is <strong>plasminogen</strong>, which is converted to its active form (plasmin) by specific enzymes (ie, <strong>tissue plasminogen activator</strong> [tPA], urinary plasminogen activator [uPA] [also known as urokinase]).&nbsp; Plasminogen binds lysine residues, which are found throughout the fibrin structure.&nbsp; On conversion to plasmin, plasminogen lyses fibrin, shredding it into soluble fibrin split products.&nbsp; These small pieces can be detected in the blood (ie, D-dimer), confirming recent or ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis.<p></p><br><br><p>Fibrinolysis is normally controlled by natural inhibitors to prevent premature clot breakdown, which can result in significant hemorrhage.&nbsp; However, hyperfibrinolysis can still occur due to multifactorial causes, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Deficient naturally occurring inhibitors:&nbsp; Fibrinolysis is normally regulated by several naturally occurring inhibitors (eg, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1], alpha-2 antiplasmin, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor [TAFI]).&nbsp; Certain conditions (eg, liver disease, malignancy) can lead to acquired inhibitor deficiency.&nbsp; Congenital inhibitor deficiency can also occur but is exceedingly rare.</li>\n\t<li>Excess plasminogen activation:&nbsp; Such activation can occur due to excess tPA or uPA, especially in patients with liver disease (tPA and uPA are normally metabolized by the liver).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Therefore, hyperfibrinolysis occurs more often as an acquired condition in patients with preexisting conditions (eg, liver disease, malignancy, trauma).&nbsp; Manifestations of hyperfibrinolysis develop after initial coagulation, so patients tend to have delayed bleeding (eg, following surgical procedures) instead of severe bleeding during the procedure.&nbsp; Hyperfibrinolysis-associated bleeding typically involves mucocutaneous sites (eg, oral bleeding, epistaxis) and is associated with elevated serum D-dimer levels.&nbsp; In addition, serum fibrinogen is usually depleted (due to consumption), and euglobulin clot lysis time (a measure of the time between clot formation and lysis) is decreased.</p>\n<h1>Mechanism of action</h1><br><br><p>To treat and prevent bleeding associated with excess fibrinolysis, a class of drugs known as antifibrinolytic agents was developed.&nbsp; The 2 main drugs are <strong>tranexamic acid (TXA)</strong> and <strong>epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA)</strong>.&nbsp; Both medications are synthetic analogues of the amino acid lysine and therefore work by <strong>binding plasminogen</strong>, preventing it from binding the lysine residues on fibrin clots.&nbsp; As a result, existing clots remain stable, and there is less bleeding.</p>\n<h1>Indications</h1><br><br><p>Antifibrinolytic agents are indicated in various clinical settings when the risk for bleeding from excess fibrinolysis is increased, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Perioperative bleeding</strong>:&nbsp; Major surgeries (eg, cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, major orthopedic surgeries) can lead to extensive bleeding, in part due to the depletion of clotting factors.&nbsp; Antifibrinolytic agents are administered to stabilize existing clots and minimize the risk for hemorrhage.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Major trauma</strong>:&nbsp; Trauma is associated with excess fibrinolysis, and TXA reduces mortality when given early (ie, within 3 hours of injury).&nbsp; For example, hyperfibrinolysis can worsen intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or cause delayed ICH in patients with traumatic brain injury; early antifibrinolytic therapy is recommended.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Obstetric hemorrhage</strong> (eg, postpartum hemorrhage):&nbsp; Antifibrinolytic agents are commonly used as adjunct therapy to stabilize clots.</li>\n\t<li>Epistaxis and hematuria, particularly in patients with an inherited bleeding disorder (eg, hemophilia, von Willebrand disease).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Adverse effects</h1><br><br><p>Antifibrinolytics are generally well tolerated and do not require routine monitoring of drug levels.&nbsp; Adverse effects are uncommon but can include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Thromboembolic events (eg, deep venous thrombosis, retinal artery occlusion):&nbsp; Likely related to clot stabilization.</li>\n\t<li>Seizures:&nbsp; Associated with high doses, likely due to GABA and glycine receptor antagonism in the CNS, lowering the seizure threshold.</li>\n\t<li>Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis):&nbsp; Can occur in some patients and are an absolute contraindication.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because these agents stabilize clots, they are contraindicated in patients with active thromboembolic disease (eg, cerebral thrombosis).&nbsp; Antifibrinolytic agents are also generally avoided in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation due to an increased risk for thrombosis.&nbsp; These agents are renally cleared and should be prescribed with caution in patients with renal impairment.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Antifibrinolytic agents (eg, tranexamic acid, epsilon-aminocaproic acid) are a class of drugs that can treat and prevent severe bleeding.&nbsp; They work by binding plasminogen, thereby preventing conversion to plasmin, which degrades existing fibrin clots.&nbsp; Antifibrinolytic agents are most commonly used to manage bleeding associated with surgical procedures, trauma, or other mucocutaneous bleeding events.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
