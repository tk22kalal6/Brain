This finely balanced process prevents excessive bleeding while avoiding inappropriate clot formation.</p><br><br><p>Following endothelial injury, a series of events occur to prevent excessive blood loss and allow for endothelium repair, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Vasoconstriction:&nbsp; Vasoconstriction occurs immediately to reduce blood flow.</li>\n\t<li>Primary hemostasis (ie, platelet plug formation):&nbsp; Platelets adhere to the exposed subendothelial matrix (containing collagen and tissue factor) with the help of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and aggregate to form a temporary hemostatic plug (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L23798.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This lays the foundation for the fibrin clot.</li>\n\t<li>Secondary hemostasis (ie, plasma coagulation):&nbsp; This process strengthens the platelet plug to form a stable fibrin clot.&nbsp; This involves a series of enzymatic reactions known as the coagulation cascade that results in the generation of thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L9709.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The coagulation cascade consists of 2 pathways that converge into a common pathway:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Extrinsic pathway:&nbsp; Following endothelial injury, exposed tissue factor activates factor VII.</li>\n\t\t<li>Intrinsic pathway:&nbsp; Contact with negatively charged surfaces (eg, subendothelium, certain foreign devices) activates factor XII, which then involves factors XI, IX, and VIII.</li>\n\t\t<li>Common pathway:&nbsp; Both pathways converge where factor X is activated to Xa.&nbsp; Factors Xa and Va convert prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin.&nbsp; Fibrin binds and stabilizes the platelet plug.</li>\n\t\t<li>Factor XIIIa:&nbsp; This factor cross-links fibrin to further stabilize the clot and allow for tissue repair.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Fibrinolysis:&nbsp; In this final step, the fibrin clot is broken down after the injured vessel has been repaired.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Whereas the classical coagulation cascade depicts separate, unidirectional pathways that converge at the common pathway, physiologic coagulation in vivo includes a few important additional details:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The extrinsic pathway is the primary pathway that is activated following vascular injury.</li>\n\t<li>Initially, factor VIIa generates only a small amount of thrombin.&nbsp; What leads to the formation of a stable fibrin clot is the positive feedback loop from thrombin (which activates factors VIII and V) and factor VIIa (which activates factor IX).&nbsp; This feedback loop generates the large amount of thrombin necessary to propagate fibrin formation downstream.</li>\n\t<li>Factors upstream of factor IX are not involved unless bleeding is severe, at which point thrombin can also recruit factor XI.</li>\n\t<li>Factor XII is not involved during physiologic coagulation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Inherited coagulation disorders</h1><h2>Hemophilias</h2><br><br><p>The most common inherited coagulation disorders involve deficiencies in factors VIII and IX, which are referred to as the hemophilias.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Factor VIII deficiency</strong> (hemophilia A):&nbsp; Factor VIII acts as a cofactor that brings factors IXa and X together, thereby amplifying the formation of factor Xa, which promotes the formation of fibrin clots.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Factor IX deficiency</strong> (hemophilia B):&nbsp; Factor IX (with factor VIII as a cofactor) activates factor X to Xa.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In the absence of either factor VIII or IX, activation of factor X and subsequent conversion of prothrombin into thrombin is severely limited, resulting in prolonged and potentially life-threatening bleeding.&nbsp; The genes encoding both factors are located on the X chromosome; therefore, hemophilia is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.</p>\n<h2>Other factor deficiencies</h2><br><br><p>Inherited deficiencies in other coagulation factors can also occur, although these conditions are much less common.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C):&nbsp; During physiologic coagulation, factor XI participates only when bleeding is severe, being recruited by thrombin and proceeding down the intrinsic pathway.&nbsp; Therefore, patients with factor XI deficiency have symptoms only in cases of severe bleeding (eg, surgery, major trauma).</li>\n\t<li>Factor XIII deficiency:&nbsp; Factor XIII cross-links fibrin at the end of coagulation, and its deficiency may cause bleeding shortly after birth, such as from umbilical stump bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.</li>\n\t<li>Factor I (fibrinogen) disorders:&nbsp; During coagulation, fibrinogen is converted to a fibrin mesh, which binds platelets and stabilizes the platelet plug.&nbsp; Inherited disorders in fibrinogen can lead to either reduced fibrinogen quantity or function.&nbsp; Generally, patients have bleeding tendencies, although paradoxic thrombosis can also occur.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Deficiency in the other factors (VII, V, X, and II [prothrombin]) is exceedingly rare and presents similarly to the other factor deficiencies.&nbsp; In addition, although mutations causing deficiency in factor XII can occur, they are not associated with bleeding symptoms because this factor is not required for physiologic coagulation like the other factors are.&nbsp; However, because it is essential for interacting with certain substrates used in coagulation tests (eg, aPTT), individuals with factor XII deficiency have a severely prolonged aPTT.</p>\n<h2>Von Willebrand disease</h2><br><br><p>Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is a bleeding disorder caused by a decreased quantity or a defective function of vWF.&nbsp; vWF is a glycoprotein that facilitates platelet adhesion in primary hemostasis.&nbsp; vWF also protects factor VIII from rapid degradation.&nbsp; Patients with severe vWD often have a degree of factor VIII deficiency and hemophilia-like bleeding.</p>\n<h1>Acquired coagulation disorders</h1><h2>Vitamin K deficiency</h2><br><br><p>Several coagulation factors rely on vitamin K for gamma-carboxylation to become functional (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/93117.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Therefore, patients with vitamin K deficiency can develop significant bleeding.&nbsp; Because vitamin K is synthesized by normal intestinal flora and absorbed from the intestinal tract, deficiency is seen primarily with malabsorption (eg, pancreatic insufficiency).&nbsp; Newborns are also at risk due to a sterile intestinal tract and poor placental transfer of vitamin K; therefore, supplemental vitamin K is administered routinely at birth.&nbsp; Broad-spectrum antibiotics can also deplete vitamin K<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>, a minor isoform, via disruption of the normal gut flora responsible for its synthesis, exacerbating deficiency.<p></p>\n<h2>Liver disease</h2><br><br><p>Because all coagulation factors are synthesized by the liver, patients with hepatic dysfunction can develop deficiencies, resulting in an increased propensity for bleeding.</p>\n<h2>Disseminated intravascular coagulation</h2><br><br><p>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a life-threatening systemic condition characterized by widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to the simultaneous consumption of platelets and coagulation factors and the formation of microvascular thrombi.&nbsp; This can result in thrombosis and concurrent severe bleeding.&nbsp; DIC typically occurs secondary to an underlying condition (eg, sepsis, trauma, malignancy) and requires urgent intervention.</p>\n<h2>Acquired inhibitors of coagulation</h2><br><br><p>Neutralizing antibodies can develop against coagulation factors in a variety of conditions (eg, during pregnancy, in autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, following frequent infusions of recombinant factor in hemophilia), resulting in abnormal bleeding.</p>\n<h2>Iatrogenic</h2><br><br><p>Supratherapeutic doses of anticoagulant therapy (eg, warfarin, heparin, direct oral anticoagulants) can result in severe bleeding.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Coagulation disorders have a pattern that tends to involve deep tissue bleeding into muscles and joints, along with deep ecchymoses.&nbsp; This contrasts with disorders of primary hemostasis (eg, platelet function disorders), in which the pattern primarily causes mucocutaneous bleeding (eg, epistaxis, heavy menstrual bleeding).</p><br><br><p>Patients whose disorders are inherited may have varying ages of presentation, depending on the disorder's severity.&nbsp; Those with mild conditions may be recognized only following trauma or surgery, when they have delayed and/or prolonged bleeding.&nbsp; Patients with more severe inherited conditions may be diagnosed in infancy (eg, prolonged bleeding after heel sticks or circumcision); severe spontaneous bleeding (eg, intracranial hemorrhage) may even occur.</p><br><br><p>Acquired coagulation disorders can present at any age, and patients may have concurrent illnesses (eg, systemic infections, gastrointestinal malabsorption, liver disease).</p>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>The evaluation of a possible bleeding disorder involves a thorough history with a focus on the location, duration, and clinical context (eg, newborns who did not receive vitamin K prophylaxis at birth, history of hepatic dysfunction, systemic illnesses that can trigger DIC).&nbsp; Medication exposure (eg, anticoagulants, antibiotics) and family history are also reviewed.&nbsp; Physical examination should focus on the bleeding pattern (eg, whether the muscles and/or joints are involved) and skin findings (eg, deep ecchymoses).</p><br><br><p>Initial laboratory testing generally includes complete blood count (CBC), PT, and aPTT:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>CBC</strong>:&nbsp; Determines if bleeding is related to thrombocytopenia, which is uncommon in most coagulation disorders.&nbsp; CBC can also help assess the severity of bleeding (ie, degree of anemia) and chronicity (eg, microcytosis may suggest iron deficiency due to chronic bleeding).</li>\n\t<li><strong>PT</strong>:&nbsp; Assesses the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways (factors VII, X, V, II [prothrombin], and I [fibrinogen]), ending when fibrinogen converts to fibrin.&nbsp; Factor VII is the only factor measured by PT that is not also measured by aPTT.&nbsp; Because factor VII has the shortest half-life (ie, hours) of all the factors, PT is the first test to show vitamin K deficiency.&nbsp; The PT is generally normal when the activity of all of these factors is at least 30%-40% of normal.&nbsp; A prolonged PT indicates a functional deficiency in ≥1 of these factors.</li>\n\t<li><strong>aPTT</strong>:&nbsp; Assesses the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways (factors XII, XI, IX, VII, X, V, II [prothrombin], and I [fibrinogen]), ending when fibrinogen converts to fibrin.&nbsp; The aPTT is generally normal when the activity of all measured coagulation factors is at least 30% of normal.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Taken with the history and physical examination, the results of these tests can help determine the likely cause of bleeding (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/105285.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Based on initial results, further evaluation may be required for diagnosis.&nbsp; Additional testing options for coagulation disorders include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Thrombin time:&nbsp; This test measures the final step in coagulation (ie, conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin).&nbsp; If thrombin time is prolonged, it is due to either abnormal fibrinogen (low quantity or dysfunction) or substances interfering with thrombin (eg, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors).</li>\n\t<li>Fibrinogen level (eg, fibrinogen functional activity):&nbsp; This test measures the amount of functional fibrinogen present.</li>\n\t<li>Mixing studies (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L8787.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Patients can develop neutralizing antibodies against coagulation factors, interfering with their function due to a variety of conditions (eg, pregnancy, systemic lupus erythematosus, hemophilia), resulting in bleeding.&nbsp; In these patients, the presence of a neutralizing antibody (ie, inhibitor) can be determined by performing a mixing study.&nbsp; This test is often used if there is a prolonged PT or aPTT to determine whether the prolongation is due to a factor deficiency or an antibody.</li>\n\t<li>Specific factor assays (eg, factor VII level):&nbsp; This assay measures factor levels and is expressed as percent activity.&nbsp; Almost all inherited bleeding disorders have a defect in a single coagulation factor.</li>\n\t<li>vWF panel:&nbsp; This tests for vWF antigen level, vWF activity (via ristocetin cofactor assay), and factor VIII levels (usually decreased in vWD because vWF is a carrier).</li>\n\t<li>D-dimer level:&nbsp; This test measures products specifically released during the proteolytic degradation of a fibrin clot.&nbsp; An elevated D-dimer level is a sensitive screening test for conditions with clot formation (eg, DIC, deep venous thrombosis).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The aPTT can be artificially prolonged for reasons that do not cause bleeding (eg, heparin contamination within the measured sample, antiphospholipid antibodies, which cause thrombosis instead of bleeding).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of coagulation disorders involves general supportive care for bleeding symptoms and specific treatment geared toward the underlying disorder.</p><br><br><p>The management of active bleeding ranges from general hemostatic measures to possible hemodynamic stabilization through vascular expansion (eg, intravenous fluids, blood product transfusions).&nbsp; Lifestyle modifications to reduce the bleeding risk are also recommended.&nbsp; Examples include limiting the use of medications that may increase the risk for bleeding (eg, aspirin), maintaining oral hygiene to reduce the risk of mucosal bleeding, and restricting certain contact sports (eg, boxing).</p><br><br><p>Additional treatment with specific therapies is dependent on the coagulation disorder.&nbsp; This can include providing the missing coagulation factor (eg, recombinant factor products), desmopressin for vWD, vitamin K supplementation, or treating the underlying condition (eg, DIC).&nbsp; Management strategies are discussed in separate dedicated articles.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Coagulation disorders are characterized by impaired hemostasis, resulting in inappropriate bleeding or clotting.&nbsp; Coagulation disorders that lead to bleeding tendencies can be inherited or acquired, and the bleeding pattern tends to involve deep tissue bleeding into muscles and joints, along with deep ecchymoses.&nbsp; The specific coagulation disorder can be identified via a detailed history, examination, and laboratory evaluation (eg, complete blood count, PT, aPTT), which can direct further specific work-up.&nbsp; Management involves general supportive care for bleeding and possible specific treatment depending on the underlying cause.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
