As a result, high serum concentrations of IgM and malignant cell infiltration can lead to a variety of systemic symptoms.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>In response to antigen stimulation, B cells in lymph node germinal centers normally undergo somatic hypermutation and class switching (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L67572.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; B cells that fail to produce high-affinity antibodies typically undergo apoptosis (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L71059.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Although this process is essential for effective humoral response, it is prone to errors and susceptible to genetic mutations that can lead to malignancy.&nbsp; The pathogenesis likely involves genetic mutations (eg, somatic mutation in <em>MYD88</em> gene, resulting in constant activation of nuclear factor-kappa B [NF-kB], a transcription factor that promotes B-cell growth) leading to the clonal expansion of post–germinal center IgM B cells that have not yet undergone class switching.<p></p><br><br><p>These clonal B cells produce <strong>high amounts of monoclonal IgM</strong>, a large immunoglobulin that exists primarily in covalently bonded pentamers (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L30183.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; High serum concentrations of IgM can lead to:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hyperviscosity syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Because of its large size, excess IgM increases serum viscosity and obstructs the microvasculature, impeding capillary circulation, particularly in the brain.&nbsp; Strokes or seizures can occur in severe cases.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bleeding</strong>:&nbsp; IgM interferes with platelet surface membrane glycoproteins, impairing their function and leading to mucosal hemorrhage (eg, nasal or oral bleeding).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neuropathy</strong>:&nbsp; IgM can act as an autoantibody against nerve components (eg, myelin-associated glycoprotein), resulting in peripheral neuropathy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Autoimmune hemolytic anemia</strong>:&nbsp; IgM can target erythrocytes for hemolysis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cryoglobulinemia</strong>:&nbsp; In cold temperatures, IgM can precipitate out of the serum, causing cryoglobulinemia that manifests as microvascular occlusion affecting the skin and extremities.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The malignant B cells can also infiltrate other hematopoietic tissues (eg, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow), resulting in lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and cytopenias due to impaired hematopoiesis.</p><br><br><p>Waldenström macroglobulinemia typically presents in older adults with a median age of 70 at the time of diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Approximately 25% of patients with Waldenström macroglobulinemia are asymptomatic; the disease is recognized during routine laboratory evaluation.&nbsp; Most patients develop a variety of symptoms as a consequence of high serum concentrations of monoclonal IgM, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hyperviscosity syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; This syndrome is present in nearly one-third of patients due to the high serum concentrations of IgM, leading to symptoms such as headache, dizziness, vertigo, nystagmus, ataxia, hearing loss, and vision impairment.&nbsp; Funduscopic examination may reveal retinal changes (eg, dilated, segmented, tortuous retinal veins that look like sausage links).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bleeding</strong>:&nbsp; Mucosal hemorrhage (eg, nasal or oral bleeding) commonly occurs due to impaired platelet function from IgM.&nbsp; This is worsened if thrombocytopenia is present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Peripheral neuropathy</strong>:&nbsp; Peripheral neuropathy presents as distal symmetric paresthesia and weakness that slowly progresses.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cryoglobulinemia</strong>:&nbsp; In cold temperatures, IgM precipitation may cause microvascular occlusion affecting the skin and extremities (eg, digital ischemia, livedo reticularis, retiform purpura).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Additional findings may include hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and generalized fatigue and weakness due to anemia.&nbsp; Some patients may have B symptoms (eg, unexplained fever &gt;38 C [100.4 F] for 3 consecutive days, drenching night sweats, weight loss &gt;10% of body weight over 6 months).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Baseline laboratory studies in Waldenström macroglobulinemia usually reveal cytopenias (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia), a <strong>large gamma gap</strong> (difference between total serum protein and serum albumin) reflecting increased immunoglobulin proteins, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.&nbsp; Peripheral blood smear may show <strong>rouleaux formation</strong> (or erythrocyte agglutination) due to elevated serum protein (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25480.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>The diagnosis requires the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Serum protein electrophoresis</strong> (SPEP) with immunofixation confirms the presence of a monoclonal IgM <strong>(M protein spike)</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bone marrow biopsy</strong> reveals &gt;10% infiltration by clonal B cells that appear like small mature lymphocytes with varying degrees of plasmacytic differentiation (ie, lymphoplasmacytic cells).&nbsp; These cells should express certain immunophenotype markers (eg, surface IgM, CD20).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The <strong><em>MYD88</em> mutation</strong> is present in &gt;90% of cases and can help distinguish this condition from other disorders producing monoclonal IgM.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis of Waldenström macroglobulinemia includes other conditions with monoclonal immunoglobulin and other B-cell malignancies:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance</strong> (MGUS):&nbsp; can produce monoclonal IgM, but serum IgM is &lt;3 g/dL.&nbsp; Bone marrow evaluation shows &lt;10% clonal B cells.&nbsp; Patients with MGUS are, by definition, asymptomatic.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Multiple myeloma</strong>:&nbsp; can cause an M protein spike on SPEP, but &lt;0.5% of multiple myelomas are associated with monoclonal IgM.&nbsp; Multiple myeloma can be distinguished from Waldenström macroglobulinemia by the presence of lytic bone lesions causing bone pain and/or a t(11;14) translocation.&nbsp; In addition, multiple myeloma does not have an <em>MYD88</em> mutation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia</strong> (CLL):&nbsp; is a mature B-lymphocyte malignancy that may present with lymphadenopathy and bone marrow involvement.&nbsp; Although CLL may have increased immunoglobulins, more often there is hypogammaglobulinemia.&nbsp; Also, CLL tends to be associated with a dramatic lymphocyte-predominant lymphocytosis (often &gt;100,000/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>) and has a different immunophenotypic pattern on flow cytometry.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other lymphomas</strong> (eg, mantle cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma):&nbsp; like Waldenström macroglobulinemia, mantle cell lymphoma and many other lymphomas can have hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and systemic B symptoms.&nbsp; Most lymphomas do not produce a monoclonal IgM, and <em>MYD88</em> mutations are more strongly associated with Waldenström macroglobulinemia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of Waldenström macroglobulinemia depends on the severity of symptoms and the extent of disease.&nbsp; Asymptomatic patients may be monitored without immediate treatment.&nbsp; Symptomatic patients may require:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Plasmapheresis</strong>:&nbsp; In patients with hyperviscosity syndrome (a medical emergency), prompt removal of serum IgM with plasmapheresis is indicated to reduce serum viscosity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong>:&nbsp; This treatment often includes agents such as bendamustine and rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Targeted therapy</strong>:&nbsp; Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is present in malignant B cells.&nbsp; It is normally involved in key intracellular signaling processes that affect the growth and survival of mature B cells.&nbsp; Drugs inhibiting BTK (eg, ibrutinib) can also be used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a chronic, indolent disease with a variable prognosis.&nbsp; With modern therapy, the median survival is approximately 5-10 years.&nbsp; Prognostic factors associated with worse outcomes include older age and low initial serum albumin levels.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a rare mature B-cell malignancy characterized by the excessive production of monoclonal IgM antibodies.&nbsp; The condition leads to a variety of systemic symptoms primarily due to the effects of high serum concentrations of IgM (eg, hyperviscosity syndrome, bleeding, peripheral neuropathy) and malignant cell infiltration of various tissues (eg, organomegaly, cytopenias).&nbsp; With modern therapy, the median survival is typically approximately 5-10 years.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
