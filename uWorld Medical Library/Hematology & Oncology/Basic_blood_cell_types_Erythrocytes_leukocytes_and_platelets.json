This article reviews the basic types of blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells (composed of granulocytes and agranulocytes), and platelets.&nbsp; Morphologic characteristics, functional roles, and common pathologic alterations are discussed.&nbsp; Hematopoiesis and cell lineages are explored in detail in a separate article.</p>\n<h1>Red blood cells</h1><br><br><p>Red blood cells (RBCs), or erythrocytes, are the most abundant blood cells, accounting for approximately 40%-45% of blood volume (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12612.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Their primary functions are to transport <strong>oxygen</strong> from the lungs to the tissues and to return carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation.&nbsp; Measuring 6-8 µm in diameter, RBCs are uniquely biconcave in shape, increasing the surface area available for efficient gas exchange.&nbsp; Gas exchange is facilitated by <strong>hemoglobin</strong>, an iron-containing protein that binds oxygen.&nbsp; RBCs <strong>lack a nucleus</strong> and organelles, allowing more space for hemoglobin but limiting them to a <strong>120-day lifespan</strong> before they are recycled by the spleen and liver.&nbsp; Erythropoiesis, the differentiation of RBCs from early progenitor cells, is stimulated primarily by erythropoietin produced by the kidneys.&nbsp; RBC pathology includes:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Anemia:&nbsp; Reduced RBC count or hemoglobin level decreases oxygen delivery.</li>\n\t<li>Polycythemia:&nbsp; Excessive RBC production increases blood viscosity, predisposing to thrombosis.</li>\n\t<li>Sickle cell disease:&nbsp; Abnormal hemoglobin distorts RBCs into a characteristic sickle shape, leading to vascular occlusion, hemolysis, and tissue damage.</li>\n\t<li>Thalassemia:&nbsp; Decreased hemoglobin alpha- or beta-chain production results in abnormal polymers that cause ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic hemolysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Granulocytes</h1><br><br><p>Granulocytes are a category of white blood cell (WBC) (leukocyte) characterized by cytoplasmic granules and a lobed nucleus that rapidly respond to injury or infection as a part of the <strong>innate immune response</strong>.&nbsp; They include neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, each containing specialized, preformed granules loaded with enzymes and inflammatory mediators for rapid defensive responses.&nbsp; Their production and activation are tightly regulated by specific colony-stimulating factors (eg, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) and interleukins.</p>\n<h2>Neutrophils</h2><br><br><p>Neutrophils (10-12 µm) are the most abundant granulocytes (comprising approximately 60% of WBCs) and contain <strong>multilobed nuclei</strong> (2-5 lobes) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L126345.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The nuclear segmentation increases as neutrophils mature, with young neutrophils having band-shaped (less segmented) nuclei.&nbsp; This segmental nature of the nuclei is the reason that mature neutrophils are sometimes referred to as polymorphonuclear leukocytes.<p></p><br><br><p>Neutrophils serve as first responders to <strong>bacterial infections</strong>, rapidly mobilizing to sites of invasion, where they phagocytize (ie, engulf) pathogens.&nbsp; Their segmented nucleus allows neutrophils to squeeze through tight spaces in blood vessel walls (diapedesis) to reach infection sites without damaging their DNA (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L35771.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This nuclear architecture also positions chromatin toward the cell periphery, maximizing central cytoplasmic space available for phagocytosis.&nbsp; Their characteristic neutral-staining granules contain powerful destructive enzymes, including <strong>myeloperoxidase</strong> and lysozyme.<p></p><br><br><p>Increased neutrophil counts (neutrophilia) are seen in infection or inflammation.&nbsp; Decreased neutrophil counts (neutropenia) can occur due to various reasons—including chemotherapy, severe infections, and vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font>/folate deficiency—increasing susceptibility to infections.</p>\n<h2>Eosinophils</h2><br><br><p>Eosinophils (12-17 µm) comprise approximately 2%-4% of WBCs and contain bilobed nuclei, resembling a pair of connected lobes (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L15407.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This bilobed nuclear structure facilitates cellular mobility and flexibility, allowing eosinophils to migrate efficiently into inflamed tissues.&nbsp; Their prominent eosinophilic (red-orange staining) granules contain cytotoxic molecules (eg, <strong>major basic protein</strong>, eosinophil peroxidase) optimized for combating <strong>parasitic</strong> infections by disrupting pathogen cell membranes.&nbsp; Eosinophils also regulate <strong>allergic reactions</strong> by modulating inflammatory responses.<p></p><br><br><p>Increased eosinophil counts (eosinophilia) suggest an allergic process (eg, asthma, hay fever), parasitic infection (eg, helminths such as <em>Ascaris</em>), drug reaction (eg, DRESS [<strong>D</strong>rug <strong>R</strong>eaction with <strong>E</strong>osinophilia and <strong>S</strong>ystemic <strong>S</strong>ymptoms]), or certain autoimmune disorders (eg, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis).</p>\n<h2>Basophils</h2><br><br><p>Basophils (12-15 µm), the rarest granulocytes (comprising &lt;1% of WBCs), have bilobed nuclei often obscured by dense, dark purple granules (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L126346.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; These large granules store <strong>histamine</strong> and heparin, critical mediators of allergic reactions and inflammation.&nbsp; The basophil's granule-packed cytoplasm enables rapid, controlled release of histamine to induce <strong>vasodilation</strong> and enhance immune cell access to affected tissues, facilitating a prompt inflammatory response.&nbsp; Increased basophil counts (basophilia) are rare but can be seen in certain types of malignancy (eg, chronic myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders).<p></p>\n<h1>Agranulocytes</h1><br><br><p>Agranulocytes, another category of WBCs, lack prominent cytoplasmic granules compared to granulocytes and are critical for <strong>cell-mediated immunity</strong> and antigen recognition.&nbsp; They consist of lymphocytes and monocytes.</p>\n<h2>Lymphocytes</h2><br><br><p>Lymphocytes (6-15 µm), constituting an estimated 20%-40% of WBCs, typically feature a large, round nucleus surrounded by a narrow rim of basophilic cytoplasm (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L126338.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This <strong>high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio</strong> allows for the storage of a <strong>large amount of genetic information</strong> essential for generating <strong>adaptive immunity</strong> processes (eg, antigen recognition, immune memory).&nbsp; Subtypes include <strong>B cells</strong> (producing specific antibodies through plasma cell differentiation), <strong>T cells</strong> (targeting infected or cancerous cells through cytotoxicity or helper functions), and <strong>natural killer cells</strong> (recognizing and eliminating virus-infected cells via perforin and granzyme release).&nbsp; Lymphocyte differentiation is driven by antigen exposure and cytokines (eg, IL-2, IL-7) that stimulate maturation into effector or memory cells (with heightened response capabilities on reexposure).<p></p><br><br><p>Lymphocytosis can be seen in viral infections and lymphoid malignancies (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia).&nbsp; In contrast, lymphopenia is seen in immunodeficiencies and, occasionally, certain viral infections (eg, HIV, COVID-19).</p>\n<h2>Monocytes</h2><br><br><p>Monocytes (12-20 µm), comprising approximately 3%-8% of WBCs, contain large, irregularly shaped, kidney-bean nuclei with <strong>abundant gray-blue cytoplasm</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L15401.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Their expansive cytoplasmic volume facilitates <strong>phagocytosis</strong> of pathogens and debris.&nbsp; On migration into tissues, monocytes differentiate into <strong>macrophages and dendritic cells</strong>—specialized antigen-presenting cells crucial for coordinating immune responses by processing and presenting antigens to T cells.&nbsp; The differentiation of monocytes is promoted by macrophage colony-stimulating factor.<p></p><br><br><p>Monocytosis can be seen in chronic infections (particularly bacterial infections [eg, tuberculosis]), chronic inflammatory conditions (eg, sarcoidosis), and certain malignancies (eg, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia).&nbsp; In contrast, monocytopenia is less common but may occur in hairy cell leukemia and as an adverse effect of certain medications (eg, chemotherapy agents).</p>\n<h1>Platelets</h1><br><br><p>Platelets (thrombocytes) are the <strong>smallest</strong> blood cells (2-4 µm) and are irregularly shaped fragments derived from <strong>megakaryocytes</strong> in the bone marrow (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L126428.png\" alt=\"image 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Their differentiation is regulated primarily by thrombopoietin produced by the liver.&nbsp; The small size of platelets and the <strong>lack of nuclei</strong> optimize rapid circulation and facilitate quick adhesion to damaged vessel walls, forming initial <strong>platelet plugs</strong>.&nbsp; Platelets contain numerous <strong>granules filled with clotting factors</strong> (eg, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor) and growth factors (eg, platelet-derived growth factor), enabling prompt secretion on activation to stabilize blood clots and promote tissue healing.&nbsp; With a <strong>7- to 10-day lifespan</strong>, their production and function are tightly regulated to prevent excessive bleeding or clotting.<p></p><br><br><p>Thrombocytopenia (low platelets) increases the risk for bleeding.&nbsp; Thrombocytosis (high platelets) may lead to thrombosis.&nbsp; Platelet dysfunction (eg, Bernard-Soulier syndrome, Glanzmann thrombasthenia) impairs clotting, even in the setting of normal counts, due to molecular defects in platelet adhesion or aggregation.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Blood consists of 3 main cell types, each with specialized functions.</p><br><br><p>Red blood cells (erythrocytes), the most abundant blood cells, are responsible for oxygen transport via hemoglobin.&nbsp; Common disorders include anemia (low red blood cell count), polycythemia (excess red blood cells), and sickle cell disease (abnormal hemoglobin).</p><br><br><p>White blood cells (leukocytes) are key to immunity and are divided into granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) and agranulocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes).&nbsp; Neutrophils fight bacterial infections, eosinophils combat parasites and allergies, and basophils release histamine in allergic responses.&nbsp; Lymphocytes (B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells) mediate adaptive immunity, whereas monocytes mature into macrophages and dendritic cells, aiding in pathogen clearance.&nbsp; Abnormal white blood cell counts can indicate infections, inflammation, or malignancies.</p><br><br><p>Platelets are small cell fragments essential for clotting; imbalances can lead to bleeding disorders (thrombocytopenia) or excessive clotting (thrombocytosis).</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
