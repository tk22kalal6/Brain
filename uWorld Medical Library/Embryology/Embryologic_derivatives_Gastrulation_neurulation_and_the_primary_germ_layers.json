Key to this process are gastrulation and neurulation, which lead to the formation of the <strong>3 primary germ layers</strong>—ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm—and the subsequent development of the central nervous system.</p>\n<h1>Gastrulation</h1><br><br><p>Gastrulation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L34556.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) marks the beginning of the embryonic stage of development.&nbsp; It is the process by which the <strong>blastocyst</strong>, a hollow ball of cells, reorganizes from a bilaminar disc into a <strong>trilaminar</strong> (3-layered) disc (<strong>ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm</strong>), from which all tissues and organs are derived.&nbsp; This process occurs during week 3 postfertilization and begins with the formation of the <strong>primitive streak</strong>, a structure that appears on the surface of the epiblast, the outer layer of the embryo.&nbsp; Epiblast cells migrate downward through the primitive streak to form the <strong>mesoderm</strong> and <strong>endoderm</strong> layers.&nbsp; A portion of epiblast cells also migrate cranially through the primitive node (the cephalic end of the primitive streak) to form a midline, mesoderm-derived cellular cord known as the <strong>notochord</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13399.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Neurulation</h1><br><br><p>The central nervous system develops via neurulation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L34681.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) during the third and fourth weeks.&nbsp; The notochord induces the overlying <strong>ectoderm</strong> to differentiate into the neuroectoderm and form the <strong>neural plate</strong>.&nbsp; As neurulation progresses, the edges of the neural plate elevate to form <strong>neural folds</strong>.&nbsp; Formation of the <strong>neural tube</strong> (precursor to the brain and spinal cord) occurs as neural folds migrate toward the midline and fuse by the end of week 4 postfertilization.&nbsp; Fusion begins in the cervical region and extends rostrally and caudally; the ends, or <strong>neuropores</strong>, close at the end of the fourth week.&nbsp; During this process, neuroectodermal cells adjacent to the crest of the neural folds separate from the surface ectoderm to form <strong>neural crest cells</strong>.&nbsp; Following neurulation and by the end of week 5 postfertilization, these neural crest cells migrate to distant sites and later develop into diverse tissues.<p></p>\n<h1>Germ layers and their derivatives</h1><h2>Ectoderm</h2><br><br><p>The ectoderm is the outermost germ layer and differentiates into structures primarily associated with the nervous system and skin.&nbsp; The ectoderm is composed of surface ectoderm, neural tube, and neural crest cells.</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Surface ectoderm</strong>:&nbsp; The surface ectoderm gives rise to the anterior pituitary as well as the epidermis and its appendages (eg, sweat glands):<br><br>\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Anterior pituitary (Rathke patch)</li>\n\t\t<li>Lens and outer layer of the cornea</li>\n\t\t<li>Inner ear sensory organs, olfactory epithelium</li>\n\t\t<li>Nasal and oral epithelial linings, salivary glands</li>\n\t\t<li>Epidermis, sweat and mammary glands</li>\n\t\t<li>Anal epithelium below the dentate line</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neural tube</strong>:&nbsp; The neural tube gives rise to neurons of the central nervous system and the neurohypophysis (posterior pituitary), retina, pineal gland, preganglionic autonomic fibers, astrocytes, and ependymal cells.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neural crest</strong>:&nbsp; Neural crest cells are multipotent, migratory cells that originate in the ectoderm at the margin of the neural tube and give rise to a diverse cell lineage, including the following:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Neural ganglia (eg, dorsal root ganglia, sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, enteric ganglia cells), adrenal medulla (eg, chromaffin cells)</li>\n\t\t<li>Melanocytes (melanin-producing cells)</li>\n\t\t<li>Schwann cells; pia and arachnoid mater</li>\n\t\t<li>Aorticopulmonary septum and endocardial cushions</li>\n\t\t<li>Branchial arches (bones and cartilage)</li>\n\t\t<li>Skull bones</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mesoderm</h2><br><br><p>The mesoderm is the middle layer of the embryo.&nbsp; It is divided into paraxial, intermediate, and lateral sections and gives rise to structures related to movement, support, and circulation (as well as the kidneys/ureters).</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Muscles:&nbsp; Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth</li>\n\t<li>Connective tissue:&nbsp; Bone, cartilage, blood, and lymph</li>\n\t<li>Serosal linings:&nbsp; Peritoneum, pleura, and pericardium</li>\n\t<li>Cardiovascular and lymphatic systems:&nbsp; Heart, blood vessels (eg, capillary endothelial cells), lymph nodes, spleen</li>\n\t<li>Urogenital system:&nbsp; Kidneys, ureters, internal genitalia</li>\n\t<li>Adrenal cortex</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Endoderm</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>The endoderm is the innermost layer of the embryo.&nbsp; The endoderm gives rise to:</li>\n\t<li>Structures derived from the inner lining of the primitive gut tube:&nbsp; These include the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, intestines) and the bulk of the liver and pancreas (outpouchings of the primitive gut tube).</li>\n\t<li>Bladder and (most of) urethra.</li>\n\t<li>Thyroid follicular cells (derived from the primitive tongue).</li>\n\t<li>Parafollicular (C) cells:&nbsp; Formerly thought to be of neural crest origin.</li>\n\t<li>Thymus, parathyroids.</li>\n\t<li>Middle ear epithelium.</li>\n\t<li>Lungs:&nbsp; Respiratory epithelium.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Some clinical correlates</h1><h2>Gastrointestinal system</h2><br><br><p>The gastrointestinal system illustrates the interplay between the cell layers.&nbsp; It is derived from components of each of the 3 layers:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Ectoderm:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The surface ectoderm gives rise to the oral epithelial linings and salivary glands.</li>\n\t\t<li>The neural crest gives rise to neural ganglia, including enteric ganglion cells.&nbsp; These cells are responsible for intestinal relaxation, and failure of neural crest cell migration to the distal colon during embryonic development leads to Hirschsprung disease.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Mesoderm:&nbsp; The peritoneum and spleen are derivatives of the mesoderm, which also gives rise to the smooth muscle component of the intestinal tract.</li>\n\t<li>Endoderm:&nbsp; Gastrointestinal derivatives of the endoderm include the liver, pancreas, and epithelial lining.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Although most intraabdominal organs are derived from the endoderm, the spleen is unique because it is derived from condensed mesenchymal tissue in the dorsal mesentery.&nbsp; Mesenchymal tissue arises from the mesoderm and is characterized by loosely associated cells surrounded by the extracellular matrix.</p>\n<h2>Nervous system</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>In humans, the notochord almost completely regresses, and its only major derivative is the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc.</li>\n\t<li>Vertebrae are derived from the paraxial mesoderm.</li>\n\t<li>Cutaneous neurofibromas (seen in neurofibromatosis type I) are benign nerve sheath neoplasms predominantly composed of Schwann cells, which are embryologically derived from the neural crest.</li>\n\t<li>Exposure to a teratogenic medication (eg, folic acid antagonist such as valproic acid) during neurulation interferes with caudal neural tube closure and causes a neural tube defect (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L23771.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Endocrine system</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Unlike the adrenal cortex, which is derived from mesoderm, the adrenal medulla is a neural crest derivative.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor, arises from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, which are neural crest cell derivatives.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The anterior pituitary is derived from the Rathke pouch, an evagination of the surface ectoderm that lines the fetal oral cavity.&nbsp; In contrast, the posterior pituitary (pars nervosa and pituitary stalk) is derived from the infundibulum, an extension of neuroectoderm from the diencephalon (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25960.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Craniopharyngiomas are benign tumors arising from the Rathke pouch.&nbsp; They occur commonly in children (eg, ages 5-14) and usually grow gradually over a period of years, causing slowly progressive symptoms (eg, optic chiasm compression leading to bitemporal blindness).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>The following table (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/40971.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) summarizes the important embryologic derivatives.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
