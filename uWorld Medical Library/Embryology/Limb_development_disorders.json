Disruptions in this process can result in limb development disorders that range in severity and presentation.</p>\n<h1>Normal limb growth and development</h1><br><br><p>At the end of week 4 of gestation, the upper and lower limb buds form from the ventrolateral wall of the embryo.&nbsp; Each limb bud contains a core of mesenchymal cells that is covered by ectoderm.&nbsp; The mesenchymal cells give rise to bones, tendons, and other connective tissues, and the ectoderm gives rise to skin.&nbsp; In addition, cells from segments of adjacent mesoderm (ie, somites) migrate to the limb buds and form muscles.&nbsp; These basic structures (eg, bones, muscles, skin) are established by the end of week 8 of gestation.</p><br><br><p>Segmental organization (proper positioning of structures) of the embryo from the cranial to the caudal direction is controlled by <strong><em>HOX</em> genes</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27304.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; <em>HOX</em> genes code for transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation and positioning in early embryogenesis.&nbsp; There is a spatial relationship between the location of the homeobox gene and its expression along the craniocaudal axis:&nbsp; Genes located near the 3′ end are expressed cranially, and genes located near the 5′ end are expressed caudally.&nbsp; <em>HOX</em> gene mutations (eg, gain-of-function, loss-of-function) can lead to improper sequencing of body segments, causing structures to develop in the wrong location, number, or shape.<p></p><br><br><p>Following craniocaudal segmental organization, limb growth and development are further regulated to ensure proper limb orientation, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Proximal-distal orientation</strong>:&nbsp; The apical ectodermal ridge (AER) is located at the distal limb bud and directs limb elongation by secreting growth factors (eg, fibroblast growth factor [FGF]) that induce rapid proliferation of adjacent mesenchymal cells.&nbsp; As the limb elongates, the mesenchymal cells that are farthest from the AER differentiate into muscle and cartilage.&nbsp; Limb elongation therefore occurs in a proximal-to-distal direction.&nbsp; The fingers and toes develop last, around week 6.&nbsp; At this time, the distal end of the limbs flattens, and regions of the AER undergo apoptosis to form 5 separate digits.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cranial-caudal orientation</strong> (ie, thumb to fifth finger):&nbsp; This orientation is regulated by the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), which is a cluster of cells located at the posterior side of the limb bud.&nbsp; The ZPA produces retinoic acid, which induces expression of the <strong><em>sonic hedgehog</em> (<em>SHH</em>) gene</strong>.&nbsp; The <em>SHH</em> gene directs digit patterning, including apoptosis of the AER.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ventral-dorsal orientation</strong> (eg, palm/flexor side to dorsal/extensor side):&nbsp; This orientation is regulated by several factors, including bone morphogenetic proteins expressed in the ventral ectoderm and the <strong><em>WNT7</em> gene</strong>.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These additional regulatory factors also interact with <em>HOX</em> genes to determine the types of bones in the limb (eg, radius vs ulna formation).&nbsp; Additional formation of the main limb structures includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Bone formation:&nbsp; Bones form from preexisting cartilaginous tissue, a process known as endochondral ossification.&nbsp; Bone formation begins around week 6, when mesenchymal cells condense into chondrocytes.&nbsp; Osteoblasts migrate to this cartilaginous structure and deposit bone matrices.&nbsp; Bone growth is maintained by FGF signaling and continues through birth.</li>\n\t<li>Limb muscle:&nbsp; During limb elongation, cells from somites migrate to the limb buds and compartmentalize into flexor and extensor muscle components.&nbsp; Meanwhile, peripheral nerve fibers, derived from the neural crest, begin innervating the muscles.</li>\n\t<li>Limb rotation:&nbsp; The upper and lower limb buds undergo rotations required for proper positioning.&nbsp; Around week 8, the upper limbs rotate laterally 90 degrees, resulting in the elbows pointing posteriorly; the lower limbs rotate medially 90 degrees, resulting in the knees pointing anteriorly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Congenital limb defect types</h1><br><br><p>Because limb development depends on the precise coordination of various signaling factors, many opportunities exist for abnormal development, leading to limb defects.&nbsp; Congenital limb defects can occur in isolation or be associated with other genetic syndromes.&nbsp; These defects can be categorized into the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Reduction defects include complete absence of a limb (amelia) and partial absence of a limb (meromelia).&nbsp; Reduction defects can occur due to loss of FGF signaling or exposure to certain drugs (eg, thalidomide) in utero.</li>\n\t<li>Duplication defects include <strong>polydactyly</strong> (presence of extra digits) and triphalangeal thumb (3 phalanges instead of 2).&nbsp; Duplication defects can occur due to the upregulation of <em>SHH</em> by the ZPA.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dysplasias</strong> (ie, abnormalities in limb shape, size, or structure) include <strong>syndactyly</strong> (fused digits) due to failed apoptosis.</li>\n\t<li>Disproportionate growth leads to <strong>brachydactyly</strong> (shortened digits) and <strong>arachnodactyly</strong> (elongated digits).</li>\n\t<li>Deformations occur due to external physical insults that interrupt and arrest development, including amniotic band entanglement and constriction of limbs, leading to amputations in utero.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Evaluation</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of a limb development disorder is based on clinical examination findings.&nbsp; Imaging (eg, radiographs) can help determine the extent of bony involvement in some defects.&nbsp; Depending on the specific defect, patients may benefit from genetic testing (eg, <em>HOX</em> gene panel sequencing, karyotyping, chromosomal microarray), particularly if multiple congenital anomalies suggest an underlying syndrome.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management involves a multidisciplinary approach, with pediatric genetics, orthopedic surgery, and plastic surgery working in consultation to restore function and cosmesis.&nbsp; Patients often benefit from physical and occupational therapies.&nbsp; Genetic counseling may also be considered.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Limb development is a highly coordinated process that involves the precise expression (both in time and location) of various signaling factors that are regulated by certain genes, including <em>homeobox</em> (<em>HOX</em>) genes.&nbsp; Disruptions in this process can result in limb development disorders that range in severity and presentation.&nbsp; Management of congenital limb development disorders may include imaging, genetic testing, and surgical intervention to restore function and cosmesis.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
