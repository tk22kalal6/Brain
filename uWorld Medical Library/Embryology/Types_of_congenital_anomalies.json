Uterine constraint (eg, uterine fibroids, breech position) is the most common deforming force, especially during periods of rapid fetal growth.</p><br><br><p>Examples of deformations include congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L88949.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and positional plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome).<p></p>\n<h1>Disruption</h1><br><br><p>Disruptions occur due to the arrested development or destruction of an otherwise normally developing structure, and an interrupted blood supply is the most common cause.&nbsp; Unlike deformations, which distort a structure, disruptions cause irreparable tissue loss.</p><br><br><p>Examples of disruptions include amniotic band syndrome due to constriction (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19920.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and intestinal atresia due to an intrauterine vascular accident.<p></p>\n<h1>Dysplasia</h1><br><br><p>Dysplasia refers to the abnormal organization of cells (ie, cellular architecture) within a particular type of tissue due to an underlying genetic defect.&nbsp; Dysplasias typically affect only one tissue type throughout the body.</p><br><br><p>Examples include skeletal dysplasias such as achondroplasia, a genetic disorder in which a mutation in the <em>fibroblast growth factor receptor 3</em> gene causes abnormal organization of chondrocytes during endochondral ossification.</p>\n<h1>Malformation</h1><br><br><p>Malformations occur due to an intrinsic defect in the embryologic development of a structure (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L92222.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Most malformations occur during organogenesis (ie, the first 8 weeks gestation) due to genetic (eg, trisomy 13, sonic hedgehog gene mutations) or environmental (eg, maternal alcohol use) factors.<p></p><br><br><p>Malformations can occur in isolation or as part of a group.&nbsp; Examples of isolated malformations include cleft lip/palate (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26003.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), congenital heart disease (eg, tetralogy of Fallot (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14009.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )), neural tube defects (eg, spina bifida), and polydactyly.&nbsp; Groups of malformations often occur in recognizable patterns, including syndromes, sequences, and associations.<p></p>\n<h2>Syndrome</h2><br><br><p>A syndrome is a group of malformations that consistently occur together and indicate a specific condition.&nbsp; For example, monosomy X causes Turner syndrome, which is characterized by short stature, webbed neck, and broad chest with widely spaced nipples (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14170.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In addition, syndromes may be inherited or occur sporadically, and the exact underlying genetic mutation may or may not be identified.<p></p>\n<h2>Sequence</h2><br><br><p>A sequence is a group of malformations that occur as a series of events.&nbsp; In Potter sequence, for example, reduced fetal urine production (eg, due to posterior urethral valves, renal agenesis, etc) leads to oligohydramnios, resulting in fetal compression and characteristic flat facies and limb deformities (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29810.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Association</h2><br><br><p>An association is a group of malformations that occur together more often than expected by chance alone, but the underlying pathogenesis is unknown.&nbsp; Vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities (VACTERL) are an example of an association of malformations with an unknown common etiology.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>A congenital anomaly is any structural defect that is present at birth but may be identified before birth.&nbsp; The major causes of congenital anomalies include deformation, disruption, dysplasia, and malformations.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
