Prostanoids are involved in a wide range of physiologic (and potentially pathologic) responses (eg, gastric mucosal protection, smooth muscle contraction/dilation, platelet aggregation, inflammation), acting locally within the tissue in which they are produced.&nbsp; COX enzymes exist in 2 isoforms with different roles: COX-1 and COX-2 (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24131.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>COX-1</h2><br><br><p>COX-1 is <strong>constitutively expressed</strong> in most tissues and is involved primarily in maintaining normal physiologic functions, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Gastrointestinal (GI) effects</strong>:&nbsp; In the GI tract, COX-1 synthesizes prostaglandins that protect GI mucosa by limiting gastric acid production, increasing mucosal blood flow, and increasing bicarbonate production.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Renal effects</strong>:&nbsp; Prostaglandin synthesis in the kidneys is normally low.&nbsp; However, with volume depletion, prostaglandin synthesis increases to dilate the afferent arteriole, thereby maintaining renal perfusion and preserving the glomerular filtration rate.&nbsp; Other functions of COX-1 include antagonizing the effects of antidiuretic hormone, resulting in decreased water reabsorption and increased excretion.&nbsp; Prostaglandins also promote renin production, which increases circulating aldosterone levels (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L42607.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Platelet effects</strong>:&nbsp; COX-1 produces thromboxane A<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> primarily in platelets, which promotes aggregation (eg, increased glycoprotein IIb/IIIa expression) and causes vasoconstriction (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L41111.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>COX-2</h2><br><br><p>In contrast to COX-1, COX-2 is an <strong>inducible enzyme</strong> that is normally undetectable in most tissues.&nbsp; Common effects of COX-2 include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Inflammation</strong>:&nbsp; COX-2 is upregulated primarily at sites of inflammation in response to cytokines (eg, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) secreted by immune cells.&nbsp; COX-2 induces the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins (eg, prostaglandin E<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>), which cause fever through effects on the hypothalamus, enhance inflammation, and mediate pain.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prostacyclin production</strong>:&nbsp; Production of prostacyclin occurs primarily in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells.&nbsp; Prostacyclin inhibits platelet aggregation and causes vasodilation, opposing the effects of thromboxane A<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Indications</h1><br><br><p>Inhibiting COX enzyme activity can reduce pain, inflammation, and platelet aggregation, which is indicated in many conditions.&nbsp; COX inhibitors work by inhibiting the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids.&nbsp; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the prototypical COX inhibitors and have several indications, including the management of:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pain (eg, musculoskeletal injuries, postoperative pain, gout).</li>\n\t<li>Fever.</li>\n\t<li>Autoimmune conditions (eg, rheumatoid arthritis).</li>\n\t<li>Arterial thromboses (eg, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke).</li>\n\t<li>Patent ductus arteriosus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Mechanism of action</h1><br><br><p>A variety of NSAIDs are available for use, each with its own pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action (eg, preferential inhibition of either COX enzyme).&nbsp; Clinical response may also vary due to pharmacogenetic factors, so the choice of agent may need to be individualized.&nbsp; Current options include nonselective COX inhibitors, selective COX inhibitors, and aspirin.</p>\n<h2>Nonselective COX inhibitors</h2><br><br><p>Nonselective COX inhibitors (eg, ibuprofen [short half-life], naproxen [long half-life])</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>COX-2 inhibition:&nbsp; Reduces <strong>pain</strong>, <strong>inflammation</strong>, and <strong>fever</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>COX-1 inhibition:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Decreases platelet aggregation</strong>:&nbsp; Platelet aggregation is used in those at risk for arterial thromboses (eg, coronary atherosclerosis); however, it increases the risk for bleeding.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Decreases gastric mucosal protection</strong>:&nbsp; Decreased prostaglandin production leads to increased gastric acid production, decreased mucosal bicarbonate production, and decreased mucosal blood flow.&nbsp; These effects contribute to the development of gastritis and ulceration (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25950.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Gastric mucosal changes may be seen within the first week of initiating NSAID therapy, particularly at high doses.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Reduces renal perfusion</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L47085.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and thereby prevent afferent arteriole dilation.&nbsp; Therefore, NSAID use can lead to a markedly decreased glomerular filtration rate, renal ischemia, and acute kidney injury in susceptible patients.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Selective COX-2 inhibitors</h2><br><br><p>Selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, <strong>celecoxib</strong>) preferentially inhibit COX-2, resulting in potent <strong>antiinflammatory effects</strong>, while sparing COX-1 activity and theoretically preserving platelet function and GI protection.&nbsp; These agents are recommended for those at risk for GI complications (eg, peptic ulcer disease).</p>\n<h2>Aspirin</h2><br><br><p>The majority of NSAIDs act reversibly; the exception is aspirin, which is <strong>irreversible</strong>.&nbsp; At <strong>low doses</strong>, aspirin predominantly <strong>inhibits COX-1</strong>, resulting in antiplatelet effects by irreversibly inhibiting thromboxane A<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> production for the duration of the platelets' lifespan (3-7 days).&nbsp; Therefore, aspirin has a prolonged antithrombotic effect and is commonly used to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary artery disease.</p><br><br><p><strong>Higher doses</strong> of aspirin significantly <strong>inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2</strong>, thereby also exhibiting antipyretic and analgesic effects.&nbsp; However, reversible NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) are more commonly used for these indications because of a better efficacy and safety profile.</p>\n<h1>Adverse effects and monitoring</h1><br><br><p>Both nonselective and selective COX inhibitors are associated with adverse effects, some of which were described earlier, due to their mechanism of action.&nbsp; The dose, the duration of therapy, and underlying patient comorbidities influence the likelihood of toxicity.</p>\n<h2>Hematologic</h2><br><br><p>Nonselective COX inhibitors inhibit thromboxane A<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>, impairing platelet aggregation and increasing bleeding risk.&nbsp; In patients undergoing long-term treatment with NSAIDs, complete blood counts should be routinely performed.&nbsp; Nonselective NSAIDs should be used with caution, particularly in patients at risk for bleeding (eg, thrombocytopenia, underlying bleeding disorders [eg, von Willebrand disease]).&nbsp; COX-2 selective agents have minimal impact on platelet function (COX-2 activity is not present in platelets).</p>\n<h2>Gastrointestinal</h2><br><br><p>NSAIDs inhibit the gastroprotective effects of prostaglandins, which can lead to <strong>GI bleeding</strong>, particularly at high doses and with prolonged durations of therapy.&nbsp; This risk rises with increasing age (particularly &gt;60), concurrent use of certain medications (eg, glucocorticoids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), and concurrent <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection.&nbsp; Patients should be monitored for symptoms (eg, dyspepsia, fatigue suggesting anemia from occult bleeding).&nbsp; The risk can be reduced by combining a nonselective NSAID with a medication that reduces gastric acid secretion (eg, proton pump inhibitor, misoprostol).</p><br><br><p>Hepatic toxicity is rare but has been reported, and serum transaminases should be monitored in patients prescribed long-term NSAID therapy.</p>\n<h2>Renal</h2><br><br><p>Both COX-1 and COX-2 are expressed in renal tissues, so both nonselective NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors can adversely affect the kidneys.&nbsp; NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with renal disease or those with reduced effective arterial volume (eg, cirrhosis, congestive heart failure).&nbsp; Baseline serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine should be assessed and monitored routinely if used long term.&nbsp; A few notable associated findings include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Acute kidney injury</strong>:&nbsp; NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and thereby prevent afferent arteriole dilation, leading to acute kidney injury in patients who rely on prostaglandins to maintain adequate renal perfusion (eg, intravascular volume depletion).&nbsp; NSAID-induced acute kidney injury is often diagnosed incidentally, and patients are generally asymptomatic but may have decreased urine output (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L47085.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Management involves discontinuing the NSAID and intravascular volume repletion to restore renal perfusion pressure.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acute interstitial nephritis</strong>:&nbsp; This type of nephritis is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate in the kidney interstitium and is associated with decreased renal function.&nbsp; The mechanism may be related to COX inhibition that causes disproportionate conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes, which recruit lymphocytes into the interstitium.&nbsp; Acute interstitial nephritis typically occurs after prolonged (ie, weeks) NSAID use.&nbsp; Classic findings include rash, fever, and eosinophilia (although the full triad is often not present), with urinalysis typically showing abundant white blood cells (WBCs) and WBC casts.&nbsp; Proteinuria can range from none to the nephrotic range (eg, &gt;3.5 g/day).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Analgesic nephropathy</strong>:&nbsp; Patients with long-term use of high-dose NSAIDs can develop chronic kidney disease due to analgesic nephropathy, which is characterized by the presence of:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Chronic interstitial nephritis</strong>:&nbsp; Nephritis can be visualized on biopsy as patchy interstitial inflammation with subsequent tubular atrophy and fibrosis, papillary necrosis, and scarring (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L865.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; NSAIDs concentrate in the renal medulla along the medullary osmotic gradient, with higher levels in the papillae.&nbsp; NSAIDs uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and increase oxidative stress, resulting in damage to tubular and vascular endothelial cells.&nbsp; Grossly, the kidneys appear shrunken with irregular contours and distortion of the caliceal architecture.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Papillary necrosis</strong>:&nbsp; Ischemic damage to the renal papilla can occur due to vasoconstriction of the vasa recta.&nbsp; Necrosis of the renal papilla with calcification is typical.&nbsp; Sloughing of the papilla can cause hematuria and present acutely as renal colic.&nbsp; Urine studies usually show hematuria, proteinuria, and pyuria with WBC casts, whereas urine culture is usually sterile.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fluid retention and electrolyte abnormalities</strong>:&nbsp; NSAIDs can disrupt the effects of prostaglandins on renal water regulation, leading to the net effects of fluid retention, edema, and hyponatremia.&nbsp; NSAIDs can also lead to hyperkalemia due to decreased aldosterone production.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cardiovascular</h2><br><br><p>NSAIDs, especially selective COX-2 inhibitors, are associated with an increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke), wherein the anticoagulant and vasodilatory effects of prostacyclin are inhibited while the platelet aggregation effects of thromboxane A<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> remain unopposed (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19145.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; NSAIDs are also associated with increased blood pressure, likely due to fluid retention.&nbsp; Alternate agents should therefore be considered for patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, particularly because many may already be taking aspirin for its antiplatelet effects.<p></p>\n<h2>Pregnancy risk</h2><br><br><p>NSAID use during pregnancy, particularly after 20 weeks gestation, should be avoided due to the associated risk to fetal kidneys and subsequent oligohydramnios.&nbsp; In addition, NSAIDs increase the risk for <strong>premature closure of the ductus arteriosus</strong> and are contraindicated after 32 weeks gestation.</p>\n<h2>Allergic reactions</h2><br><br><p>Allergic reactions ranging from urticaria to anaphylaxis have also been associated with NSAID use in some patients.&nbsp; If suspected, NSAIDs should be avoided afterward.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors are commonly used for the management of pain, inflammation, and fever.&nbsp; Nonselective COX inhibitors block both isoforms of the COX enzyme and are effective but associated with a high risk for gastrointestinal and renal side effects.&nbsp; COX-2 selective inhibitors offer gastrointestinal protection but are associated with increased cardiovascular risks.&nbsp; The individual agent's therapeutic benefits, pharmacokinetics, and potential adverse effects must be compared to patient-specific risk factors when selecting the agent of choice.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
