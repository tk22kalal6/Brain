They are indicated primarily for the treatment of hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those on medications that impair potassium excretion, such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (eg, ACE inhibitors).&nbsp; The use of potassium binders requires monitoring of potassium levels and renal function due to potential GI adverse effects and interactions with other therapies.</p>\n<h1>Relevant pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Potassium is the primary intracellular cation, with homeostasis maintained through renal excretion (~90%) and GI elimination (about 10%).&nbsp; In healthy individuals, the kidneys adjust potassium excretion via aldosterone-stimulated secretion in the distal nephron, responding to dietary intake and serum levels.&nbsp; Hyperkalemia (serum potassium &gt;5.0 mEq/L) occurs when this balance is disrupted, often due to reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in CKD, leading to impaired urinary potassium clearance.</p><br><br><p>In CKD, progressive nephron loss and tubular dysfunction limit potassium secretion, whereas factors such as metabolic acidosis, medications (ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists), and diabetes mellitus further worsen hyperkalemia.&nbsp; Untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening ECG changes and arrhythmias, including peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and ventricular fibrillation.</p>\n<h1>Mechanism of action and class effects</h1><br><br><p>Potassium binders reduce serum potassium by exchanging cations in the GI lumen, capturing potassium ions and promoting their excretion.&nbsp; Their mechanisms differ based on chemical structure and binding site:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS)</strong>:&nbsp; This cation-exchange resin swaps sodium for potassium primarily in the colon, with an onset of 2-6 hours.&nbsp; Its nonspecific binding can also capture calcium and magnesium, leading to electrolyte imbalances.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Patiromer</strong>:&nbsp; This calcium-based polymer exchanges calcium for potassium in the small intestine, with an onset of approximately 7 hours (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L60392.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Its high specificity minimizes nonpotassium cation binding.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC)</strong>:&nbsp; This crystalline silicate selectively traps potassium in exchange for sodium or hydrogen ions throughout the GI tract, with a rapid onset (~1 hr) due to its microporous structure.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These agents reduce serum potassium by 0.5-1.2 mEq/L, depending on dose and setting (acute vs chronic).&nbsp; They can be administered orally or, in some cases, rectally for acute settings.&nbsp; Potassium binders allow continuation of RAAS inhibitors that might otherwise be discontinued due to hyperkalemia risk.</p>\n<h1>Clinical indications</h1><h2>Hyperkalemia in CKD</h2><br><br><p>Potassium binders are a cornerstone for managing chronic hyperkalemia in CKD, especially when GFR falls below 30 mL/min.&nbsp; They help maintain potassium levels between 3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L, reducing arrhythmia risk and enabling optimal use of renoprotective medications (eg, ACE inhibitors).</p><br><br><p>Before these medications are started, patients should be evaluated for reversible causes of hyperkalemia such as dietary excess, medications, or acute kidney injury.&nbsp; If serum potassium levels remain elevated (&gt;5.5 mEq/L), binders are initiated.</p><br><br><p>Ongoing monitoring includes serial potassium checks because overcorrection can lead to hypokalemia.&nbsp; In dialysis patients, binders are used between sessions to control interdialytic hyperkalemia.&nbsp; Guidelines recommend binders when hyperkalemia persists despite conservative measures, with preferences for newer agents (eg, patiromer, SZC) over SPS due to better tolerability.</p>\n<h2>Acute hyperkalemia</h2><br><br><p>In acute settings (potassium level &gt;6.0 mEq/L with ECG changes), binders complement emergency therapies such as calcium gluconate (membrane stabilization), insulin-glucose (intracellular potassium shift), and hemodialysis.&nbsp; SPS can be administered rectally for faster action, although SZC's oral rapid onset is increasingly favored.&nbsp; Binders are not standalone treatments in life-threatening cases but reduce recurrence risk postintervention.</p>\n<h2>RAAS inhibitor–associated hyperkalemia</h2><br><br><p>Potassium binders allow sustained RAAS inhibitor use in heart failure or post–myocardial infarction settings, when discontinuation worsens prognosis.&nbsp; Patiromer and SZC are preferred due to lower GI toxicity compared to SPS.</p>\n<h1>Adverse effects</h1><br><br><p>Potassium binders are generally well tolerated but can cause GI issues, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Constipation or diarrhea:&nbsp; SPS may cause constipation or, rarely, intestinal necrosis (especially with sorbitol coadministration).&nbsp; Patiromer and SZC are associated with mild diarrhea or abdominal discomfort.</li>\n\t<li>Electrolyte imbalances:&nbsp; Sodium-based binders such as SPS and SZC can increase serum sodium levels, risking fluid overload in patients with heart failure.&nbsp; Patiromer exchanges calcium, potentially leading to hypomagnesemia with prolonged use.</li>\n\t<li>Drug interactions:&nbsp; Binders can reduce the absorption of other oral medications, so they should be administered separately by at least 3 hours.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Rare but serious effects include bowel obstruction or perforation with SPS.&nbsp; To minimize risks, patients' first doses should be low, and they should have frequent electrolyte monitoring; SPS should be avoided in patients with existing bowel disorders.&nbsp; Newer agents (patiromer, SZC) have lower GI toxicity profiles compared to SPS.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Potassium binders are key agents in the management of hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease or those requiring an ongoing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor.&nbsp; By binding potassium in the gastrointestinal tract and facilitating its elimination, they help maintain normal serum potassium levels, prevent arrhythmias, and enable continued use of cardioprotective medications (eg, ACE inhibitors).&nbsp; Although older agents sch as sodium polystyrene sulfonate remain available, newer binders such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate offer superior safety, tolerability, and efficacy, making them the preferred options in most clinical settings.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
