A thorough understanding of renal embryology is essential for the diagnosis and management of congenital renal anomalies.</p>\n<h1>Overview</h1><br><br><p>Renal development begins in early embryogenesis with the formation of the nephrogenic cord from intermediate mesoderm in the lower thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions.&nbsp; Renal development occurs in a cranial-to-caudal sequence and progresses through 3 sequential stages (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12373.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), as follows:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pronephros</strong> (weeks 3-4):&nbsp; Derived from intermediate mesoderm in the cervical region.&nbsp; The pronephros is composed of 7-10 groups of nephrotomes, or rudimentary, nonfunctional excretory units that regress before the end of the fourth week of gestation.&nbsp; The pronephric ducts persist temporarily and initiate formation of the mesonephric duct.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mesonephros</strong> (weeks 4-8):&nbsp; Derived from intermediate mesoderm in the thoracolumbar region.&nbsp; The mesonephros is composed of primitive renal corpuscles that drain into the mesonephric duct.&nbsp; The mesonephros regresses in females but persists as the wolffian ducts in males, giving rise to the ductus deferens and epididymis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Metanephros</strong> (weeks 5 to birth):&nbsp; Derived from intermediate mesoderm in the lumbosacral region.&nbsp; Development of the metanephros begins with the formation of the ureteric bud, an outgrowth of the mesonephric duct near its entrance into the cloaca.&nbsp; The ureteric bud induces formation of the metanephric blastema from the intermediate mesoderm of the sacral region.&nbsp; Reciprocal inductive signaling between the ureteric bud and the metanephric blastema induces their differentiation into structures of the upper urinary tract (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L88965.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Metanephric blastema</strong>:&nbsp; Gives rise to the renal parenchyma, including the glomeruli, proximal convoluted tubules, loops of Henle, distal convoluted tubules, and Bowman capsules.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Ureteric bud</strong>:&nbsp; Gives rise to the collecting system, including the collecting tubules and ducts, major and minor calyces, renal pelvis, and ureter.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ascent of the kidneys</h1><br><br><p>The bilateral metanephroi develop in the pelvis and ascend to a more cranial position in the retroperitoneal cavity near the adrenal glands because of the disproportionately rapid growth of the caudal portion of the embryo.&nbsp; In the pelvis, the metanephroi are supplied by a pelvic branch of the aorta.&nbsp; As the metanephroi ascend, they are supplied by a series of arteries that originate from progressively more cranial positions along the aorta.&nbsp; The caudal arteries generally degenerate as the metanephroi ascend.</p>\n<h1>Development of the ureters, bladder, and urethra</h1><br><br><p>During weeks 4-7 of gestation, the cloaca is partitioned anteriorly into the urogenital sinus and posteriorly into the hindgut.&nbsp; The cranial urogenital sinus forms most of the bladder; the caudal mesonephric ducts are incorporated into the bladder wall and form the trigone of the bladder.&nbsp; Moving caudally, the pelvic urogenital sinus gives rise to the prostatic and membranous parts of the urethra in males.</p>\n<h1>Clinical correlation</h1><br><br><p>A thorough understanding of renal embryology is essential for the diagnosis and management of congenital renal anomalies.&nbsp; Failed progression through any of these steps can result in a unique congenital anomaly with important clinical implications.&nbsp; The various congenital renal anomalies are discussed in a separate dedicated article.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Renal development is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple embryologic structures that contribute to the formation of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.&nbsp; During early embryogenesis, 3 distinct systems develop in a cranial-to-caudal sequence: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros.&nbsp; The metanephros gives rise to the definitive kidney, and abnormal development can result in a variety of congenital renal anomalies.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
