The kidneys normally play a crucial role in preserving acid-base homeostasis by reabsorbing bicarbonate (HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font>) and excreting hydrogen (H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>).&nbsp; In RTA, these processes are disrupted, leading to chronic metabolic acidosis.&nbsp; Despite a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the kidneys cannot effectively excrete acid or conserve bicarbonate.&nbsp; Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent complications such as growth retardation in children, kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, and progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p>\n<h1>Classification</h1><br><br><p>RTA is classified into 3 major types based on the specific defect in the renal tubules (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84320.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; While the pathophysiology differs among the types, all forms of RTA share a common feature: the kidney's <strong>inability to prevent metabolic acidosis</strong>.&nbsp; Under normal conditions, the kidneys filter HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font> at the glomerulus, reabsorb nearly all of it in the proximal tubule, and secrete H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> in the distal tubules, thereby regulating acid and base levels.&nbsp; The 3 specific types of RTA are as follows:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Distal RTA (type 1):</strong>&nbsp; The distal tubules are unable to adequately secrete H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>, resulting in acidosis.&nbsp; Impaired urinary acidification leads to alkaline urine, which promotes the formation of calcium phosphate stones.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Proximal RTA (type 2):</strong>&nbsp; The proximal tubules fail to reabsorb HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font> effectively, leading to its loss in the urine.&nbsp; To compensate, the body reduces HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font> filtration, but serum HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font> levels remain persistently low.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hyperkalemic RTA (type 4):</strong>&nbsp; A deficiency or resistance to aldosterone disrupts K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> and H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> secretion, resulting in hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><h2>Distal (type 1) RTA</h2><br><br><p>Type 1 RTA is characterized by defective H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> secretion in the distal tubules.&nbsp; This leads to the acid accumulation in the blood and an inability to acidify urine, resulting in a <strong>urine pH &gt;5.5</strong> (a key diagnostic finding).&nbsp; As the kidneys fail to excrete sufficient acid, patients may develop <strong>hypokalemia</strong> from increased K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> loss due to:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Decreased K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> reabsorption:&nbsp; Impaired H⁺ secretion disrupts H⁺-K⁺-ATPase pumps, which normally reabsorb K⁺ in exchange for secreting H⁺.&nbsp; When H⁺ secretion is defective, less K⁺ is reabsorbed, leading to urinary K⁺ losses.</li>\n\t<li>Increased K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> secretion:&nbsp; Increased Na⁺ reabsorption via epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) creates a negative luminal charge, promoting further K⁺ secretion through renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channels.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Etiologies include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Genetic mutations affecting the H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>-ATPase or chloride-bicarbonate exchanger</li>\n\t<li>Autoimmune diseases like Sjögren disease or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</li>\n\t<li>Medications such as amphotericin, ifosfamide, ibuprofen, and lithium</li>\n\t<li>Chronic obstruction or urinary tract anomalies</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Proximal (type 2) RTA</h2><br><br><p>Type 2 RTA is characterized by a defect in the proximal tubule's ability to reabsorb HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font>.&nbsp; Initially, this leads to urinary HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font> wasting (bicarbonaturia), resulting in metabolic acidosis.&nbsp; As systemic HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font> is depleted over time, the distal tubules are able to partially compensate for acidosis by increasing distal H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> secretion; this results in a <strong>urine pH &lt;5.5</strong> and a <strong>milder acidosis</strong> compared to distal RTA.</p><br><br><p>Patients with proximal RTA may also develop hypokalemia, which occurs due to increased K⁺ excretion driven by the body's response to HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>- </sup></font>and Na⁺ loss.&nbsp; The loss of HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>- </sup></font>and accompanying Na⁺ in the urine leads to mild volume depletion.&nbsp; This activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), resulting in aldosterone-mediated K⁺ secretion (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16602.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In addition, increased distal delivery of Na⁺ bound to HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font> leads to K⁺ secretion (through ROMK channels).<p></p><br><br><p>Etiologies include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Specific bicarbonate transport dysfunction:&nbsp; carbonic anhydrase mutations, HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>- </sup></font>transporter mutations, or medications (eg, acetazolamide, topiramate, antiretrovirals)</li>\n\t<li>General proximal tubular dysfunction:&nbsp; Fanconi syndrome—which can be caused by multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, amphotericin, and heavy metal toxicity—causes RTA in addition to phosphaturia and glycosuria</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Type 4 RTA (hyperkalemic RTA)</h2><br><br><p>Type 4 RTA is caused by either a <strong>deficiency in or resistance to aldosterone</strong> and is also known as hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism.&nbsp; It is characterized by impaired K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> excretion and H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> secretion in the distal tubules, which is dependent on aldosterone.&nbsp; Although metabolic acidosis is a shared feature among all RTAs, type 4 RTA is <strong>unique</strong> in that it causes <strong>hyperkalemia</strong>.</p><br><br><p>Etiologies include conditions that impair aldosterone synthesis or action, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>CKD, diabetes mellitus, and primary adrenal insufficiency</li>\n\t<li>Medications, such as ACE inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heparin, and potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, amiloride)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The symptoms of RTA can vary based on the type and severity of the condition but often include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Growth deficiencies in children due to chronic metabolic acidosis.</li>\n\t<li>Muscle weakness, fatigue, or cramps resulting from hypokalemia.</li>\n\t<li>Bone pain or fractures, as metabolic acidosis can lead to bone demineralization.</li>\n\t<li>Polyuria and dehydration, particularly in type 2 RTA, where bicarbonaturia can cause increased urine output.</li>\n\t<li>Kidney stones or nephrocalcinosis, seen in type 1 RTA.&nbsp; In addition to alkaline urine, calcium release from bones due to acidosis predisposes to calcium-phosphate precipitation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><h2>Nonanion gap metabolic acidosis</h2><br><br><p>Nonanion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA) is usually due to diarrhea or RTA.&nbsp; In the absence of diarrhea, RTA should be suspected when there is NAGMA with either hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, particularly in the setting of a normal GFR.&nbsp; <strong>Hyperkalemia</strong> is consistent with <strong>type 4 RTA</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>Hypokalemia</strong> narrows down the differential to either <strong>type 1 or 2 RTA</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Urine pH and urine anion gap</h2><br><br><p>Type 1 and type 2 RTA can be further distinguished with urine pH:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Type 1 (distal) RTA:&nbsp; Urine pH is <strong>&gt;5.5</strong> despite systemic acidosis, due to inability of the distal tubules to acidify urine by secreting H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>.</li>\n\t<li>Type 2 (proximal) RTA:&nbsp; Urine pH is usually <strong>&lt;5.5</strong> because the distal nephron can still secrete H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> (although pH may be &gt;5.5 initially due to heavy HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>- </sup></font>losses).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>If the diagnosis is not clear, the urine anion gap (UAG) ([Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>] + [K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>] − [Cl<font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font>]) helps by assessing urinary ammonium (NH<font size=\"2\"><sub>4</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>) excretion, which is increased in normal acid excretion but reduced in RTA.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Type 1 (distal) RTA:&nbsp; UAG is typically positive, reflecting impaired NH<font size=\"2\"><sub>4</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> excretion due to distal tubular dysfunction.</li>\n\t<li>Type 2 (proximal) RTA:&nbsp; UAG may initially be negative or normal but can turn positive as the condition progresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further evaluation</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Autoimmune screening:&nbsp; Type 1 RTA is frequently associated with autoimmune diseases like Sjögren disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and SLE.&nbsp; Testing for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and anti-SSA/SSB antibodies may be warranted if there is clinical suspicion.</li>\n\t<li>Serum renin and aldosterone levels:&nbsp; In type 4 RTA, assessing plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels can help diagnose causes of hypoaldosteronism, such as diabetic nephropathy or adrenal insufficiency.</li>\n\t<li>Genetic testing:&nbsp; For patients with a family history of RTA or early-onset disease, genetic testing can help identify mutations affecting H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>-ATPase pumps, carbonic anhydrase, or other related transporters.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>A brief summary of RTAs is provided in this table (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/81582.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of RTAs can be complex because it necessarily varies with the type of RTA, focusing on correcting metabolic acidosis using alkali therapy, addressing potassium disturbances, and preventing complications (eg, nephrolithiasis).&nbsp; In general, alkali (eg, potassium citrate) therapy is useful for type 1 (distal) RTA, thiazide diuretics help limit loss of bicarbonate in type 2 (proximal) RTA, and potassium-wasting diuretics (eg, furosemide) help control hyperkalemia in type 4 RTA.&nbsp; More specific details are presented below for completeness.</p>\n<h2>Type 1 (distal) RTA</h2><br><br><p>The mainstay of treatment is oral alkali therapy to <strong>neutralize the metabolic acidosis</strong> and <strong>prevent stone formation</strong>.&nbsp; Potassium citrate (potassium-containing alkali) is preferred because it helps address the hypokalemia that is often present and reduces the risk of nephrolithiasis (eg, urinary citrate is protective against calcium stone formation).</p>\n<h2>Type 2 (proximal) RTA</h2><br><br><p>Management also involves alkali replacement to <strong>correct metabolic acidosis</strong>.&nbsp; However, much larger doses of alkali are usually required compared to type 1 RTA because the proximal tubules continuously lose HCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font><font size=\"2\"><sup>-</sup></font>.&nbsp; Thiazide diuretics may be used to reduce alkali requirements by causing contraction alkalosis.&nbsp; Patients usually require significant potassium supplementation due to the combined effect of urine alkalinization and diuresis.</p>\n<h2>Type 4 RTA (hypoaldosteronism)</h2><br><br><p>The focus is on <strong>managing hyperkalemia</strong> through correcting any underlying cause of aldosterone deficiency or resistance (eg, fludrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency, discontinuing ACE inhibitors if possible), restricting dietary potassium, and potassium-wasting diuretics (eg, furosemide).&nbsp; If metabolic acidosis persists, low-dose alkali therapy can be given.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) represents a group of disorders where the kidneys fail to maintain acid-base balance due to specific defects in the renal tubules, despite a normal glomerular filtration rate.&nbsp; The 3 main types—distal (type 1), proximal (type 2), and hyperkalemic (type 4) RTA—each have distinct pathophysiological mechanisms leading to metabolic acidosis and either hypokalemia (types 1 and 2) or hyperkalemia (type 4).&nbsp; Clinical manifestations can include growth retardation in children, muscle weakness, bone demineralization, polyuria, dehydration, and kidney stones.&nbsp; Diagnosis relies on careful evaluation of blood and urine tests, including serum bicarbonate and potassium, urine pH, and the urine anion gap.&nbsp; Management strategies are tailored to the specific type of RTA, focusing on correcting metabolic acidosis using alkali therapy, addressing potassium disturbances, and preventing complications (eg, nephrolithiasis).</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
