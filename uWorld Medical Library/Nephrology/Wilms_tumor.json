Less common associated signs and symptoms that may also be present include <strong>hematuria</strong> (due to invasion of the renal pelvis), <strong>hypertension</strong> (due to compression of the renal artery and/or renin secretion by tumor cells), abdominal pain from tumor mass effect on nearby tissue, <strong>secondary varicocele</strong> from compression of venous drainage (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/47784.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ), and unexplained fevers.<p></p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><br><br><p>For patients who are at increased risk for developing Wilms tumor (eg, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome), early screening abdominal ultrasonography should be performed at regular intervals.</p><br><br><p>For children presenting with an abdominal mass, evaluation typically begins with <strong>abdominal ultrasonography</strong> (due to its lack of ionizing radiation).&nbsp; Ultrasonography can confirm the presence of a tumor and may also detect other causes of abdominal masses (eg, hydronephrosis).</p><br><br><p>If a tumor is detected, a CT scan or MRI of the abdomen should be obtained to provide further details of the tumor for staging and management decisions (eg, determine its relationship to surrounding organs for surgical planning, determine need for preoperative chemotherapy).&nbsp; Further staging workup is also performed, including CT of the chest (the lungs are the most common site for metastatic disease).</p><br><br><p>Laboratory testing is also obtained during initial workup, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Renal function panel and urinalysis:&nbsp; These are used to evaluate current renal status.</li>\n\t<li>Liver function testing:&nbsp; This may be abnormal if liver metastases are present.</li>\n\t<li>Coagulation testing:&nbsp; About 5% of patients newly diagnosed with Wilms tumor have an acquired form of von Willebrand disease.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The diagnosis of Wilms tumor requires tissue obtained from a surgical excision or biopsy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108483.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Histologically, Wilms tumor is characterized by <strong>triphasic differentiation</strong>, comprising of undifferentiated blastema, stroma, and epithelial components (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L114435.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The tumor cells may exhibit varying degrees of differentiation, and the presence of these components aids in further histological classification of the tumor for treatment planning.<p></p>\n<h1>Staging</h1><br><br><p>The staging for Wilms tumor is based on the anatomical extent of the tumor, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Stage I:&nbsp; Tumor is limited to the kidney and fully resected.</li>\n\t<li>Stage II:&nbsp; Tumor extends beyond the kidney (eg, invades soft tissue of renal sinus) but is still fully resected.</li>\n\t<li>Stage III:&nbsp; Residual tumor remains after surgical resection but is confined to the abdomen.</li>\n\t<li>Stage IV:&nbsp; Presence of distant involvement (eg, hematogenous spread to distant organs, involvement of lymph nodes beyond the abdominopelvic region).</li>\n\t<li>Stage V:&nbsp; Bilateral kidney involvement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The treatment for Wilms tumor depends on the patient's prognostic indicators and generally involves a multimodal approach, combining surgery, chemotherapy, and, in some cases, radiation therapy.&nbsp; Nephrectomy is typically performed to remove the affected kidney and surrounding tissues.&nbsp; Chemotherapy is administered to target any residual or metastatic disease but sometimes also provided prior to surgical resection to improve resectability.&nbsp; Radiation therapy may be indicated in patients with worse prognostic indicators.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The 5-year overall survival rate exceeds 90%, particularly for patients with localized disease.&nbsp; Prognostic indicators associated with an increased risk for relapse or death include anaplastic features (large, hyperchromatic [ie, dark-staining] nuclei with atypical mitotic figures), higher stage, and older age (historically, patients age &gt;2 had higher relapse rates).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Wilms tumor is a pediatric renal malignancy that originates from embryonic kidney cells with distinct clinical and pathological features (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/51036.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Treatment involves a combination of surgical excision, chemotherapy, and in some cases radiation therapy.&nbsp; Prognosis is excellent, with a 5-year overall survival rate of &gt;90%.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
