Dysfunctional T cells cause an overproduction of glomerular permeability factor (eg, IL-13) that damages the capillary wall of the glomerulus, leading to cytokine-mediated disruption of the actin cytoskeleton within podocytes, resulting in <strong>podocyte injury and effacement</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14468.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Podocyte effacement causes a loss of charge selectivity across the glomerular basement membrane, resulting in the selective loss of urinary anions (particularly albumin) and leading to massive proteinuria.&nbsp; The resulting hypoalbuminemia leads to decreased plasma oncotic pressure with renal sodium retention, resulting in acute-onset, gravity-dependent edema (eg, periorbital, scrotal, tibial).<p></p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The primary risk factor for MCD is age, because MCD accounts for up to 90% of the causes of nephrotic syndrome in children age 1-10.&nbsp; MCD can also be induced by other causes (ie, secondary MCD), including drugs (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), malignancies (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma), and autoimmune disorders.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients present with acute symptoms of nephrotic syndrome (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L35412.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Nephrotic range proteinuria</strong> (&gt;3.5 g/day in adults, &gt;50 mg/kg/day in children), often with foamy-appearing urine</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hypoalbuminemia</strong> (&lt;3.0 g/dL)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gravity-dependent, peripheral edema</strong></li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients typically first develop edema in the periorbital region, followed by the genitals and lower extremities.&nbsp; The edema may progress to generalized anasarca with ascites, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion.&nbsp; Other clinical manifestations may include hyperlipidemia (due to liver synthesis of lipoproteins in response to decreased oncotic pressure) and thromboembolism (due to loss of coagulation factors).</p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><br><br><p>When any nephrotic syndrome is suspected, it is confirmed by both of the following tests:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Nephrotic range proteinuria with a 24-hour urine protein collection:&nbsp; &gt;3.5 g/day in adults and &gt;50 mg/kg/day in children (or early morning protein-to-creatinine ratio &gt;2)</li>\n\t<li>Hypoalbuminemia:&nbsp; plasma albumin level &lt;3.0 g/dL</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Although the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is MCD, other potential causes of nephrotic syndrome (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) should be excluded.&nbsp; These tests include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Urinalysis with microscopy</li>\n\t<li>Complete blood count</li>\n\t<li>Serum electrolyte levels</li>\n\t<li>Serum BUN and creatinine levels</li>\n\t<li>Serum electrolyte levels</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Most patients with MCD have relatively normal laboratory testing; abnormal testing (eg, low serum complement levels, red cell casts on urine microscopy) are concerning for another etiology of the patient's nephrotic syndrome and should be further evaluated.</p><br><br><p>The diagnosis of MCD in pediatric populations is usually clinical and does <u>not</u> require biopsy or imaging in patients with classic findings.&nbsp; However, renal biopsy is indicated in pediatric patients with atypical presentations (eg, hypertension, hematuria, elevated creatinine) or treatment-resistant disease.&nbsp; In addition, all adults with nephrotic syndrome undergo biopsy due to increased likelihood of etiologies other than MCD (eg, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis).</p><br><br><p>If renal biopsy is performed, the characteristic microscopy findings of MCD include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Light microscopy that shows normal findings</li>\n\t<li>Immunofluorescence staining that shows no immunoglobulin or complement deposits</li>\n\t<li>Electron microscopy that shows <strong>podocyte effacement</strong> (diagnostic of MCD) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L83941.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Because primary MCD is likely immune-mediated, initial treatment is with <strong>corticosteroids</strong>.&nbsp; During treatment, urine protein levels are monitored to evaluate for treatment response and disease remission, which are defined as resolution of proteinuria and normalization of serum albumin concentration.&nbsp; The vast majority of patients respond to steroid therapy and achieve <strong>remission within several weeks to months</strong>.</p><br><br><p>A small percentage of patients do not respond to corticosteroid therapy.&nbsp; In these cases, patients may need further evaluation (eg, kidney biopsy) and/or change in treatment to a steroid-sparing, immunosuppressive agent (eg, mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitor [eg, tacrolimus]).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The most important prognostic factor in MCD is the initial response to corticosteroids.&nbsp; Corticosteroids are very effective in achieving remission; however, many patients with MCD will have at least one relapse, and some children will relapse frequently (several times in a year).&nbsp; Therefore, once initial remission is achieved, monitoring for proteinuria is required for early identification of relapse.&nbsp; Relapses typically remain steroid responsive; most children eventually have a progressive decrease in the number of relapses with age and often achieve permanent remission.&nbsp; Renal outcome is excellent with maintenance of normal renal function into adulthood.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Minimal change disease (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/73239.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.&nbsp; It occurs due to a T-cell-mediated injury of the glomerular podocytes, resulting in nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema.&nbsp; Most cases resolve in several months with corticosteroids.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
