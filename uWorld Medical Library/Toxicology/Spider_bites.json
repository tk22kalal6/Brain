It is found primarily in the central and southern United States, particularly in areas like Missouri, Kansas, Texas, and Oklahoma.&nbsp; It can also be found in South America; bites from South American <em>Loxosceles</em> species (eg, <em>L gaucho</em>) are associated with more dermal necrosis and systemic symptoms.&nbsp; The brown recluse prefers dark, secluded spaces such as attics, basements, closets, and woodpiles.</p>\n<h2>Black widow</h2><br><br><p>The black widow (<em>Latrodectus mactans</em>) is a shiny black spider known for the <strong>red hourglass marking</strong> on the underside of its abdomen.&nbsp; It is widespread across the United States, especially in the southern and western regions.&nbsp; Black widows typically inhabit areas such as woodpiles, garages, sheds, and other sheltered outdoor locations.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p><strong>Brown recluse venom</strong> contains several cytotoxic and <strong>hemolytic enzymes</strong>, the cutaneous manifestations of the venom are due primarily to phospholipase D, an unusual sphingomyelinase that hydrolyzes the phospholipid bilayer of the host cell membrane, resulting in subsequent cell lysis.&nbsp; This enzyme also activates the complement cascade in nearby capillaries, leading to capillary occlusion, tissue ischemia, and dermal necrosis.&nbsp; It is also believed to be primarily responsible for the platelet disorders, hemolysis, and acute kidney injury that can occur following a bite.</p><br><br><p><strong>Black widow venom</strong>, primarily composed of the <strong>neurotoxin</strong> alpha-latrotoxin, exerts its effects by inducing massive neurotransmitter release at nerve terminals.&nbsp; Alpha-latrotoxin binds to receptors on presynaptic neurons, which causes excessive release of neurotransmitters (eg, acetylcholine, norepinephrine) at neuromuscular junctions and synapses.&nbsp; The result is severe, sustained muscle contractions, intense pain, and autonomic dysfunction, which manifest as muscle cramps, abdominal pain, hypertension, tachycardia, and diaphoresis.&nbsp; Although rarely fatal, black widow envenomation can be severe, especially in children, the elderly, and those with preexisting health conditions.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><h2>Brown recluse</h2><br><br><p>Loxoscelism is the term for the clinical manifestations of brown recluse spider bites (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/66302.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Bites can be painful but are often initially painless, so spider identification rarely occurs.&nbsp; Burning pain due to local ischemia can start a few hours after the bite and become severe.&nbsp; Typically, a small red papule or plaque appears first that often develops central pallor and then heals in days to weeks without intervention.&nbsp; In some cases (~10%), a <strong>deep skin ulcer</strong> develops at the bite site (up to 10 days), with an erythematous halo and a necrotic center that can progress to an <strong>eschar</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L49354.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Systemic manifestations may appear over several days and include hemolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure.&nbsp; These complications are uncommon in the United States (&lt;1% of cases) but are more common with the South American species.</p>\n<h2>Black widow</h2><br><br><p>Latrodectism is the medical term for the clinical manifestations of black widow spider bites.&nbsp; Most bites are either initially asymptomatic or cause mild pain at the bite site.&nbsp; The bite often appears as a blanched circular patch with surrounding erythema and a central punctum.&nbsp; <strong>Local diaphoresis</strong> (involving the affected muscle groups) is a classic finding (occuring in ~20%); diaphoresis can also be generalized.&nbsp; Pain and intense muscle rigidity, typically adjacent to the bite or involving the torso, begins 30-120 minutes from the time of the bite (can be longer).</p><br><br><p><strong>Intense abdominal pain</strong> accompanied by a <strong>rigid abdominal wall</strong> is a hallmark of black widow bites.&nbsp; Other symptoms include tremor, weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, and local paresthesias.&nbsp; Tachycardia, tachypnea, and/or hypertension may also occur.&nbsp; Symptoms typically resolve in 24-72 hours without intervention.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>A definitive diagnosis of a spider bite can be made if the following criteria are present:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A spider was observed inflicting the bite.</li>\n\t<li>The spider was recovered and identified by a qualified person (eg, arachnologist, entomologist, clinical toxicologist).</li>\n\t<li>A skin lesion and/or systemic finding associated with the type of spider bite are present.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These criteria are fulfilled in a very small number of cases.&nbsp; In most patients, the diagnosis of a spider bite is based on history, physical examination, and geographic location.&nbsp; A presumptive diagnosis can be made if the clinical presentation aligns with loxoscelism or latrodectism, and with a history of bites from unseen or unidentified spiders in an area where brown recluse or black widow are known to reside or if the spider was observed and matches the description.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><h2>Brown recluse</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Infections</strong><br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Cutaneous infections</strong> (eg, from <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>):&nbsp; can present with papules, pustules, and localized areas of erythema.&nbsp; With most skin infections, classically initial swelling occurs with elevation (not depression and ulceration) of the central region.&nbsp; Lesions can be cultured to help differentiate the cause.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Lyme disease</strong>:&nbsp; can present with a lesion known as erythema migrans (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L95204.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which can appear similar to a spider bite.&nbsp; Serologic testing may differentiate the lesions if diagnosis is in doubt (although Lyme serologies may be negative in the early stages).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections</strong>:&nbsp; can present with painful lesions that are typically multiple but can also be singular.&nbsp; Tzanck staining for multinucleated giant cells and viral culture can differentiate herpes infection from spider bite.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Cutaneous anthrax</strong>:&nbsp; is characterized by a painless skin lesion that typically progresses from a pruritic papule to a necrotic black eschar after contact with infected animals (eg, sheep, goats).&nbsp; Patient risk factors can help differentiate between the conditions.&nbsp; Also, brown recluse lesions are typically more painful.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pyoderma gangrenosum</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/45197.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; is an idiopathic condition that can present with dark, blue-red papules that progress to necrotic ulcerating lesions with irregular borders (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44397.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Brown recluse bites typically have a well-defined round ulcer with smooth borders.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vascular ulcers</strong>:&nbsp; ulcers caused by conditions like chronic venous insufficiency, arterial insufficiency, or diabetes mellitus may resemble a brown recluse bite.&nbsp; However, these ulcers often present with distinct historical and physical findings that help differentiate them.&nbsp; For example, peripheral artery disease might be indicated by claudication symptoms, whereas physical exam findings might reveal adjacent skin changes or decreased pulses.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vasculitis</strong>:&nbsp; ulceration and tissue necrosis can occur in cutaneous vasculitis which are typically accompanied by systemic signs associated with connective tissue diseases (eg, malaise, joint pain), recent infections, or new medication use within the past 7-10 days.&nbsp; A skin biopsy is the most definitive method for diagnosing vasculitis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Black widow</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Tetanus</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/41723.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; typically presents with muscle rigidity, spasms, and lockjaw, often starting in the jaw and neck and spreading throughout the body.&nbsp; A black widow bite typically causes localized pain and muscle cramps that start at the bite site and may travel to the chest and abdomen.&nbsp; Autonomic dysfunction (eg, tachycardia, diaphoresis) can occur in both conditions but is typically more severe in tetanus.&nbsp; Tetanus has a more delayed onset following a wound, whereas symptoms develop rapidly after the black widow bite.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Strychnine poisoning</strong>:&nbsp; causes rapid onset, severe, diffuse, intermittent muscle spasms and rigidity, often starting with jaw clenching and progressing to full-body convulsions.&nbsp; A black widow bite typically leads to more localized pain and muscle cramps with physical evidence of a bite.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acute abdomen</strong>:&nbsp; typically presents with constant pain often associated with nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.&nbsp; However, black widow bites typically cause intermittent abdominal pain without other gastrointestinal symptoms.&nbsp; In addition, patients with a surgical abdomen tend to be tachycardic with low or normal blood pressure; patients with latrodectism are more likely to be hypertensive.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cocaine intoxication</strong>:&nbsp; can cause diffuse muscle pain, diaphoresis, and CNS effects (eg, hypertension).&nbsp; A black widow bite typically results in more localized pain near the bite site, often with visible evidence of the bite.&nbsp; The severity of muscle rigidity can also help differentiate between the two conditions.&nbsp; Although both can lead to rhabdomyolysis, the context and associated symptoms are key in distinguishing them.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Myocardial ischemia or infarction</strong>:&nbsp; the severe chest pain, hypertension, sweating, and nausea that may occur after a black widow bite.&nbsp; ECG and cardiac biomarkers can be utilized to differentiate between these conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Evaluation and management</h1><br><br><p>Initial treatment of both brown recluse and black widow bites involves <strong>local wound care</strong> (gently clean wound with soap and water) and <strong>pain control</strong> (for mild envenomation, oral analgesics are typically adequate; more severe envenomation may require intravenous opioids).&nbsp; Patients with only local symptoms do not typically require any laboratory evaluation.</p>\n<h2>Brown recluse</h2><br><br><p>Specific therapy for brown recluse bites, which can be associated with systemic effects, includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cold packs (possibly helpful to decrease cytotoxic/hemolytic enzymes), taking care not to freeze the skin.</li>\n\t<li>Antivenom, which is not available in the United states but is recommended in South America if a patient presents within 48 hours of the bite with evidence of necrosis.</li>\n\t<li>Wound care may include surgical debridement but should be delayed until necrosis has stopped advancing (usually at least 10 days); if performed too early, it may cause increased pain and wound breakdown.&nbsp; Other researched therapies (eg, dapsone, tetracycline, glucocorticoids, hyperbaric oxygen) have not demonstrated conclusive benefits.</li>\n\t<li>Patients found to have hemolytic anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor), rhabdomyolysis (eg, muscle pain), or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (eg, bleeding) as a complication of a bite should be hospitalized and managed appropriately.&nbsp; Appropriate laboratory evaluation would include complete blood count, coagulation studies, liver function tests, urinalysis, creatine phosphokinase, and renal function tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Black widow</h2><br><br><p>Specific therapy for black widow bites includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Muscle relaxants in oral form for mild envenomation can be considered but convincing evidence of their benefit is lacking.&nbsp; Moderate or severe envenomation may require intravenous benzodiazepines (eg, valium).&nbsp; Intravenous calcium has not been shown to be beneficial.</li>\n\t<li>Antivenom can be considered for severe envenomation but is usually difficult to obtain and unnecessary, and should be administered only after consultation with a regional poison control center.</li>\n\t<li>Laboratory findings are not required to confirm the diagnosis but are often obtained to rule out other potential causes of symptoms if the diagnosis is unclear (eg, abdominal muscle spasm from spider bite versus acute abdomen from appendicitis).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Complications</h1><h2>Brown recluse</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Wound complications</strong> such as skin necrosis and scarring can lead to significant disfigurement and functional impairment, especially on the hands and face.&nbsp; Large necrotic areas may require surgical intervention to promote healing and restore function.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cellulitis</strong> including secondary bacterial infection can occur, worsening the wound and potentially leading to systemic infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acute hemolytic anemia</strong> is typically self-limited.&nbsp; An elevated serum total bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase is suggestive of the condition.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rhabdomyolysis</strong>, or venom-induced muscle necrosis, leads to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream, potentially causing kidney damage, electrolyte imbalances or, in severe cases, acute renal failure.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)</strong> can occur when venom triggers widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to clot formation throughout the body followed by bleeding due to the consumption of clotting factors.&nbsp; This condition can result in multiorgan damage and requires immediate medical intervention.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Death</strong>, although rare, can occur due to overwhelming sepsis or multiorgan failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Black widow</h2><br><br><p>Rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury can occur with black widow bites but is uncommon.&nbsp; Wound complications typically do not occur, and death from black widow bites is very rare.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Envenomations from specific spider species like the brown recluse and black widow can pose significant health risks.&nbsp; Brown recluse venom primarily induces local tissue necrosisand can progress to systemic involvement that includes rhabdomyolysis, acute hemolytic anemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.&nbsp; Death from multisystem organ failure can occur.&nbsp; Black widow venom is neurotoxic, which can lead to severe muscle cramps, pain, and rhabdomyolysis.&nbsp; Clinical presentation, geographic location, and laboratory findings aid in diagnosis.&nbsp; Management is primarily supportive.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
