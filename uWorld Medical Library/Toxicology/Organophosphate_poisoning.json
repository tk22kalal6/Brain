Symptoms resulting from muscarinic hyperactivity include bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, miosis, bradycardia, and hypersalivation.&nbsp; Nicotinic overactivation leads to muscle weakness, paralysis, and respiratory failure.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Organophosphate poisoning can occur via oral, cutaneous, or inhalational routes.&nbsp; Potential sources include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Occupational exposure</strong>:&nbsp; farmers, pesticide applicators, and agricultural workers</li>\n\t<li><strong>Accidental ingestion</strong>:&nbsp; particularly children who gain inadvertent access to pesticides</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intentional ingestion</strong>:&nbsp; suicide attempts, especially in agricultural communities</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chemical warfare</strong> (eg, sarin, soman):&nbsp; used for military and terrorist attacks; colorless, tasteless, and often with a slight fruity odor</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Common organophosphate-based insecticides include parathion, malathion, and diazinon.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter released into the neuronal synapse to activate postsynaptic cholinergic (muscarinic and nicotinic) receptors.&nbsp; The effects are typically rapid in onset but short-lived due to quick degradation by acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine in the synapse.</p><br><br><p>Under normal conditions, stimulation of nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction triggers the firing of motor neurons and causes skeletal muscle contraction.&nbsp; Muscarinic receptor activation produces the following effects:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cardiovascular</strong>:&nbsp; vasodilation, bradycardia, and reduced contractility</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong>:&nbsp; increased contractility and secretory activity of the stomach and intestines, and relaxation of the sphincters</li>\n\t<li><strong>Urinary</strong>:&nbsp; increased contractility of the detrusor muscle and relaxation of the urinary sphincters</li>\n\t<li><strong>Eye</strong>:&nbsp; increased contractility of the pupillary sphincter (miosis)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Exocrine glands</strong>:&nbsp; secretion of salivary, lacrimal, bronchial, and sweat glands</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Organophosphates cause toxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase.&nbsp; Decreased acetylcholine degradation causes overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, resulting in a cholinergic crisis.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The clinical manifestations of excessive cholinergic activation (<strong>cholinergic crisis</strong>) include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Muscarinic effects</strong> (DUMBELS mnemonic)<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Diaphoresis, diarrhea</li>\n\t\t<li>Urination</li>\n\t\t<li>Miosis</li>\n\t\t<li>Bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, bradycardia</li>\n\t\t<li>Emesis</li>\n\t\t<li>Lacrimation</li>\n\t\t<li>Salivation</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nicotinic effects</strong>\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Muscle fasciculations</li>\n\t\t<li>Muscle weakness (prolonged membrane depolarization eventually inhibits contraction)</li>\n\t\t<li>Paralysis</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Central nervous system effects</strong> (acetylcholine in the CNS normally regulates memory, arousal, attention, and motivation)\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Agitation/confusion</li>\n\t\t<li>Seizures</li>\n\t\t<li>Respiratory depression/failure:&nbsp; due to decreased respiratory drive coupled with muscle weakness, bronchospasm, and bronchorrhea (excess mucus discharge)</li>\n\t\t<li>Coma</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning is made clinically based on the characteristic signs and symptoms of cholinergic toxicity (eg, miosis, respiratory distress, hypersalivation).&nbsp; Although an exposure history is helpful, it is not always known or provided.&nbsp; Many organophosphate compounds have a petroleum or garlic-like odor, which may help identify a recent exposure.</p><br><br><p>A trial of atropine is sometimes used when the diagnosis is unclear.&nbsp; Atropine competitively inhibits acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptor, which normally results in anticholinergic signs (eg, mydriasis, dry skin, tachycardia).&nbsp; Decreased anticholinergic signs following administration of a small dose of atropine (eg, 1 mg) support the diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The following conditions may mimic organophosphate poisoning:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Myasthenia gravis</strong>:&nbsp; This autoimmune condition damages postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.&nbsp; It is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness (with easy fatigability) that can progress to respiratory failure.&nbsp; However, muscarinic symptoms (eg, hypersalivation, bronchorrhea) are not expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Botulism</strong>:&nbsp; A bacterial toxin prevents presynaptic acetylcholine release.&nbsp; It leads to profound, generalized muscle weakness, but symptoms typically start in the cranial nerves (eg, blurred vision, ptosis) and progressively descend to upper extremities/trunk, then lower extremities.&nbsp; Signs of muscarinic overstimulation are not present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gastroenteritis</strong>:&nbsp; A viral or bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract can cause profuse vomiting and diarrhea, but miosis, bronchorrhea, and muscle weakness/flaccidity are not typical.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Red blood cell (RBC) acetylcholinesterase activity testing can help determine the percent of functional RBCs versus those inhibited by acetylcholinesterase.&nbsp; The results correlate with the degree of clinical toxicity, but this test is not widely available.</p><br><br><p>Additional laboratory testing typically performed in critically ill patients includes complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, arterial blood gas, and blood cultures.</p>\n<h1>Imaging</h1><br><br><p>There is no specific indication for imaging in organophosphate poisoning.&nbsp; However, x-ray of the chest should be performed to confirm proper endotracheal tube placement in patients requiring intubation for respiratory failure.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The goals of management of organophosphate poisoning include airway/respiratory stabilization and reversal of cholinergic receptor hyperstimulation.&nbsp; Treatment includes the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>100% oxygen (and possible intubation)</strong>:&nbsp; is required because bronchospasm and bronchorrhea, along with CNS depression and respiratory muscle weakness, often lead to respiratory failure requiring intubation.&nbsp; Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in patients with organophosphate poisoning.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Decontamination</strong>\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Oral ingestion (within 1 hour of arrival)</strong>:&nbsp; Administer activated charcoal (patient must be awake and protecting the airway) within an hour of arrival to bind compound and limit absorption.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Cutaneous exposure</strong>:&nbsp; Remove and discard contaminated clothing; irrigate skin thoroughly.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Atropine</strong>:&nbsp; competitively inhibits acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptor, reversing muscarinic effects.&nbsp; It does not act on nicotinic receptors to treat muscle paralysis.&nbsp; Large doses (often required) are titrated to achieve cessation of bronchospasm and drying of bronchial secretions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pralidoxime (2-PAM)</strong>:&nbsp; is a cholinesterase-reactivating agent that allows for degradation of excess acetylcholine and treats nicotinic and muscarinic effects of organophosphates.&nbsp; Pralidoxime should be given only <em>after</em> atropine because pralidoxime can cause transient acetylcholinesterase inhibition, which can momentarily worsen symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong>:&nbsp; should be administered as needed for management of seizures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for organophosphate poisoning can vary widely depending on multiple factors, including the severity of exposure (eg, amount ingested), the specific organophosphate involved (eg, some agents have higher toxicity), the timeliness and adequacy of medical treatment, and the severity of presenting symptoms (eg, respiratory failure).</p><br><br><p>Although organophosphate poisoning can be life-threatening, prompt administration of antidotes and supportive care can improve outcomes and may reduce the risk for a complication known as <strong>intermediate syndrome</strong>, which develops after resolution of cholinergic toxicity.&nbsp; This complication is characterized by proximal muscle weakness, decreased deep tendon reflexes, cranial nerve dysfunction, and respiratory muscle weakness.&nbsp; With supportive care, most patients experience resolution in a few weeks.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Organophosphate poisoning (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/54964.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) causes cholinergic toxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase at the synaptic junction.&nbsp; Overstimulation of the muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors by excess acetylcholine causes bradycardia, miosis, hypersalivation, bronchospasm, muscle weakness, and respiratory failure.&nbsp; Atropine and pralidoxime are the antidotes used to reverse cholinergic hyperstimulation.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
