This article provides an overview of lymph node anatomy and physiology, with particular emphasis on their structural organization and functional significance within the immune system.</p>\n<h1>Structure and function</h1><br><br><p>Lymph nodes have a complex internal architecture that facilitates their immune functions (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10621.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; An outer capsule composed of dense connective tissue encases and protects the node.&nbsp; Underneath are trabeculae, which are internal fibrous extensions that project inward from the capsule, providing structural support and creating compartments for cellular organization.&nbsp; Each lymph node contains a hilum, a concave region allowing passage of arterial and venous blood and containing efferent lymphatic vessels.<p></p><br><br><p>Each node is organized into 3 distinct but interconnected regions:&nbsp; cortex, paracortex, and medulla.</p>\n<h2>Cortex</h2><br><br><p>The cortex is the outer region of the lymph node.&nbsp; It primarily houses <strong>B lymphocytes</strong> and is organized into distinct structures:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Primary follicles</strong>:&nbsp; Consist of spherical collections of <strong>quiescent</strong> B cells awaiting antigen encounter.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Secondary follicles</strong>:&nbsp; Develop after antigen stimulation and contain <strong>germinal centers</strong> where B cells proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Subcapsular sinus</strong>:&nbsp; Filters incoming lymph from afferent vessels and contains specialized macrophages that capture and present antigens to lymphocytes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Paracortex</h2><br><br><p>The paracortex is located between the cortex and medulla and primarily houses <strong>T lymphocytes</strong> and dendritic cells.&nbsp; It contains high endothelial venules (HEVs) that allow lymphocytes to enter the node from the bloodstream (ie, via extravasation).&nbsp; The paracortex enlarges when there is an extreme immune response (eg, due to infection), causing lymphadenopathy.&nbsp; This region is underdeveloped in DiGeorge syndrome (ie, thymic hypoplasia affecting T-cell development).</p>\n<h2>Medulla</h2><br><br><p>The medulla is the innermost region, containing the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Medullary cords</strong>:&nbsp; House plasma cells and lymphocytes organized into rope-like structures.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Medullary sinuses</strong>:&nbsp; Contain reticular cells (synthesize fibers that create a supportive meshwork) and macrophages, draining filtered lymph into efferent vessels and removing remaining pathogens.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>The lymphatic system</h1><h2>Lymphatic fluid</h2><br><br><p>Lymph, a clear fluid consisting of interstitial fluid, proteins, lipids, lymphocytes, and other immune cells that have been collected from tissues throughout the body, enters the node via multiple afferent lymphatic vessels.&nbsp; Within the node, lymph is filtered as it passes through the cortex and medulla, removing pathogens and debris.&nbsp; The cleansed lymph then exits the node via 1 or more efferent lymphatic vessels at the hilum (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L8930.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; From there, it continues through the lymphatic system before eventually draining into the venous circulation.<p></p>\n<h2>Lymphatic vessels</h2><br><br><p>Lymphatic fluid flows through a complex network of lymphatic vessels.&nbsp; Fluid from the right upper extremity, right side of the head, portions of the heart and lungs, and the right thorax drains into the <strong>right lymphatic duct</strong>.&nbsp; The right lymphatic duct empties into the venous circulation at the junction of the right internal jugular vein and the right subclavian vein, forming the right brachiocephalic vein.</p><br><br><p>In contrast, the <strong>thoracic duct</strong> drains lymphatic fluid from the remainder of the body, including both lower extremities, the abdomen, the left thorax, the left upper limb, and the left side of the head and neck.&nbsp; The thoracic duct originates from the <strong>cisterna chyli</strong> in the abdomen and ascends through the thorax to empty into the venous circulation at the junction of the left internal jugular vein and the left subclavian vein, forming the left brachiocephalic vein.&nbsp; The left and right brachiocephalic veins merge to form the superior vena cava, which then drains directly into the right atrium of the heart (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73766.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Lymph node anatomy</h2><br><br><p>Lymph node anatomy for various structures is illustrated in the following figures:&nbsp;

Enlarged or tender lymph nodes frequently indicate localized infection, inflammation, or heightened immune activity in the drainage area.&nbsp; The pattern of lymph node involvement may help clinicians identify the source of infection or disease.&nbsp; Physical examination of lymph nodes (eg, evaluating size, consistency, tenderness, and mobility) offers valuable clinical insights.&nbsp; Nodes that are hard, fixed, or painless raise concern for malignancy, whereas tender, mobile nodes typically suggest inflammatory processes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Regional patterns</strong>:&nbsp; The location of affected nodes corresponds to their drainage territories:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Cervical lymphadenopathy may indicate head and neck infections or malignancies.</li>\n\t\t<li>Axillary nodes reflect upper extremity or breast pathology.</li>\n\t\t<li>Inguinal lymphadenopathy suggests lower extremity or genitourinary conditions.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Systemic disease markers</strong>:&nbsp; Persistent, generalized lymphadenopathy (affecting multiple nodal regions) may signal systemic conditions, including:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus).</li>\n\t\t<li>Hematologic malignancies (lymphomas, leukemias).</li>\n\t\t<li>Infectious diseases (HIV, tuberculosis, mononucleosis).</li>\n\t\t<li>Metastatic cancer.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Biopsy importance</strong>:&nbsp; Lymph node biopsy represents a critical diagnostic procedure when malignancy is suspected, providing definitive tissue diagnosis and staging information.&nbsp; Fine-needle aspiration or excisional biopsy may be performed depending on the clinical context.&nbsp; The <strong>sentinel lymph node</strong> (first node receiving drainage from a tumor site) is often evaluated to determine whether cancer has spread beyond the primary site, guiding treatment decisions, particularly in breast cancer and melanoma.&nbsp; This minimizes unnecessary extensive lymph node dissection and associated complications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Lymph nodes are organized into cortical B-cell zones, paracortical T-cell regions, and medullary cords/sinuses.&nbsp; They filter harmful substances, detect threats, and activate specific immune responses through coordinated lymphocyte interactions.&nbsp; Their streamlined structure ensures efficient immune surveillance while helping to maintain fluid balance.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
