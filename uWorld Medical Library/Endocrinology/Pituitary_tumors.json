These are neoplasms arising from the hormone-secreting cells of the anterior pituitary gland; they are classified as functioning or nonfunctioning (ie, do not secrete hormones).&nbsp; Other causes of sellar masses include benign tumors (eg, craniopharyngioma), malignant tumors (primary or metastatic), pituitary hyperplasia, and miscellaneous other lesions (eg, cysts, abscesses).</p><br><br><p>This article provides a conceptual approach to pituitary tumors, with a focus on pituitary adenomas; other types of suprasellar masses are discussed in the differential diagnosis section.</p>\n<h1>Mass effects</h1><br><br><p>Pituitary adenomas can be categorized by size:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Microadenomas:&nbsp; &lt;1 cm</li>\n\t<li>Macroadenomas:&nbsp; ≥1 cm</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Microadenomas</h2><br><br><p>Microadenomas often grow slowly, if at all; symptoms are usually due to endocrine effects (of the secreted hormones) rather than to mass effects.&nbsp; In the absence of active hormone secretion, small microadenomas can remain occult for extended periods before being incidentally identified on imaging done for other reasons.</p>\n<h2>Macroadenomas</h2><br><br><p>Macroadenomas, by contrast, can enlarge progressively and frequently present with mass effect symptoms.</p><br><br><p>The most common manifestation is <strong>visual defects</strong>.&nbsp; Adenomas (and other suprasellar masses) often grow superiorly because inferior spread is limited by bone.&nbsp; This superior growth can compress the central portion of the optic chiasm, where fibers from the nasal retina (which process the temporal visual field) cross so that the hemivisual fields from both eyes are processed in the same, contralateral hemisphere.&nbsp; Therefore, a lesion that impacts these crossing fibers classically produces <strong>bitemporal hemianopia</strong> (ie, decreased vision in the temporal fields) due to compression of the optic chiasm (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L89815.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Other neurologic manifestations include <strong>headaches</strong> and diplopia; in rare cases, macroadenomas present with pituitary apoplexy (sudden bleeding into an adenoma) or Parinaud syndrome (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/53729.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Hormonal effects</h1><h2>Hormonal hypersecretion or hyposecretion</h2><br><br><p>Adenomas can also be classified based on which of the pituitary hormones they secrete, including prolactin, growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and TSH:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Lactotroph (most common; also called prolactinoma):&nbsp; prolactin-secreting cells</li>\n\t<li>Somatotroph:&nbsp; GH-secreting cells</li>\n\t<li>Gonadotroph:&nbsp; FSH- and/or LH-secreting cells</li>\n\t<li>Corticotroph:&nbsp; ACTH-secreting cells</li>\n\t<li>Thyrotroph (rare):&nbsp; TSH-secreting cells</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These are described in more detail below.</p><br><br><p>Of all suprasellar masses, only pituitary adenomas can cause hormonal hypersecretion.&nbsp; However, any suprasellar mass can lead to hormonal hyposecretion due to compression of the surrounding pituitary (eg, central adrenal insufficiency).&nbsp; Note that prolactin secretion is controlled primarily by inhibitory dopaminergic fibers from the hypothalamus (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26372.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ); therefore, disruption of these pathways by any pituitary mass lesion can cause oversecretion and mild hyperprolactinemia.<p></p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation of a suprasellar mass</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of pituitary adenomas is based primarily on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.&nbsp; Any suprasellar mass requires <em>both</em> hormonal and radiologic evaluation.</p>\n<h2>Hormonal evaluation</h2><br><br><p>For patients with metabolic symptoms, endocrine testing should be completed prior to imaging unless emergent mass effect symptoms are present.&nbsp; In addition, testing for other pituitary hormones besides the primary hormone of the clinical syndrome is advised to detect cosecreting tumors and possible hypofunction of the surrounding pituitary (ie, due to compression of the surrounding cells).&nbsp; Recommended testing includes serum prolactin level, insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), ACTH and cortisol, thyroid function tests, and gonadotropins.</p><br><br><p>Nonfunctioning (nonsecretory) adenomas do not release appreciable amounts of physiologically active hormones.&nbsp; However, they may secrete peptides (eg, alpha subunit) that are useful in diagnostic evaluation, and immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens may show evidence of hormone production.&nbsp; Most (~80%) nonfunctioning adenomas represent gonadotroph adenomas, but they can arise from any cell type.</p>\n<h2>Radiographic evaluation</h2><br><br><p>MRI is the preferred imaging modality for pituitary tumors (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L66338.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ); CT scan can be considered if MRI is contraindicated.&nbsp; MRI can assess size and visualize compression of surrounding structures (eg, optic chiasm, cavernous sinus).&nbsp; A macroadenoma, if present, is likely to be the culprit lesion responsible for clinical symptoms; however, incidental microadenomas are common and may not be the source of symptoms.&nbsp; If compression of the optic chiasm is suspected, referral for formal visual field testing is also recommended.<p></p>\n<h1>Management principles</h1><br><br><p>Once a pituitary adenoma is identified, management options include (depending on neurologic/hormonal symptoms):</p>\n<h2>Observation</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>For small, nonfunctioning adenomas without symptoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Medical management </h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hormone replacement therapy, including levothyroxine and sex hormones (estrogen-progestin for women, testosterone for men), are prescribed as needed.</li>\n\t<li>Dopamine agonists (eg, cabergoline, bromocriptine) for hyperprolactinemia can effectively reduce prolactinoma size, even in large macroadenomas.</li>\n\t<li>Somatostatin analogues (eg, octreotide) are commonly used in the treatment of somatotroph and thyrotroph adenomas and can be effective in the management of prolactinomas, corticotroph adenomas, and gonadotroph adenomas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Surgery</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy is the primary surgical approach for pituitary adenomas (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L18091.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Transcranial approaches are occasionally used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Radiation therapy</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Used for residual or recurrent tumors, or when surgery is not feasible.&nbsp; Modalities include stereotactic beam therapy, fractionated external beam radiation, intensity-modulated radiation, and proton beam therapy.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The next few sections describe specific types of pituitary adenomas in more detail.</p>\n<h1>Prolactinoma</h1><h2>Pathophysiology</h2><br><br><p>Prolactinomas (the most common type of pituitary adenoma) represent a monoclonal expansion of lactotrophs with autonomous production of prolactin.&nbsp; High levels of prolactin suppress the production of GnRH in the hypothalamus, leading to decreased LH and FSH secretion from the anterior pituitary (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L83702.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Clinical presentation</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Women:&nbsp; anovulation/amenorrhea, infertility, occasional galactorrhea</li>\n\t<li>Men:&nbsp; decreased libido, impotence, hypogonadism</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Endocrine diagnosis</h2><br><br><p>Prolactin levels are elevated (usually &gt;100 ng/mL); FSH, LH, estrogen, and testosterone are suppressed.</p>\n<h2>Management</h2><br><br><p>Dopamine agonists (eg, bromocriptine, cabergoline) can suppress prolactin secretion and shrink tumor size; transsphenoidal surgery is not usually necessary but can be considered if dopamine agonists are ineffective or not tolerated.&nbsp; Surgery is also considered for women with very large adenomas (&gt;3 cm) who are considering pregnancy because the tumor may enlarge significantly when dopamine agonists are stopped during pregnancy.</p>\n<h1>Somatotroph adenoma</h1><h2>Pathophysiology</h2><br><br><p>Excessive GH secretion stimulates tissue growth, with additional physiologic effects mediated by IGF-1, produced in the liver in response to GH.&nbsp; The mammosomatotroph variant may also secrete prolactin.</p>\n<h2>Clinical presentation</h2><br><br><p>Acromegaly occurs in adults (enlargement of hands, feet, and facial features) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L30226.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), and gigantism occurs in children.<p></p>\n<h2>Endocrine diagnosis</h2><br><br><p>Serum IGF-1 levels are very sensitive and specific and are the preferred initial test.&nbsp; GH levels are highly variable due to a pulsatile secretion pattern, although a persistently elevated GH level following an oral glucose load can confirm the diagnosis if IGF-1 results are nondiagnostic.</p>\n<h2>Management</h2><br><br><p>Transsphenoidal surgery is preferred; somatostatin analogues (eg, octreotide) are prescribed if the tumor cannot be completely resected.&nbsp; Dopamine agonists and pegvisomant (GH receptor antagonist) can also be considered.</p>\n<h1>Gonadotroph adenoma</h1><h2>Pathophysiology</h2><br><br><p>Most gonadotroph adenomas are physiologically nonfunctioning; hormone secretion is inconsistent, and secretory product (eg, alpha subunit) may be biologically silent.</p>\n<h2>Clinical presentation</h2><br><br><p>Gonadotroph adenoma usually presents with mass effect symptoms.&nbsp; Endocrine symptoms (eg, infertility and menstrual irregularities in women, hypogonadism in men) are often due to hyperprolactinemia or deficiencies of other pituitary hormones rather than gonadotropin overproduction.</p>\n<h2>Endocrine diagnosis</h2><br><br><p>Alpha subunit, FSH (and FSH-β subunit), and LH (and LH-β subunit) levels may be elevated.</p>\n<h2>Management</h2><br><br><p>Asymptomatic tumors are often observed; symptomatic tumors are treated with transsphenoidal surgery.</p>\n<h1>Corticotroph adenoma</h1><h2>Pathophysiology</h2><br><br><p>Corticotroph adenomas cause excessive ACTH secretion, leading to increased cortisol production and secondary adrenal hyperplasia; they usually present as a very small (&lt;5 mm) pituitary microadenoma (often not visible on imaging).</p>\n<h2>Clinical presentation</h2><br><br><p>Cushing syndrome (moon face, buffalo hump, central obesity, striae, hypertension, hyperglycemia) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L87483.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) due to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma is termed Cushing disease.&nbsp; Hyperpigmentation may occur because melanocyte-stimulating hormone and ACTH are derived from the same precursor molecule (proopiomelanocortin) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L118254.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Endocrine diagnosis</h2><br><br><p>Initial tests include 24-hour urinary cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test; once hypercortisolism is confirmed by ≥2 separate tests, elevated or inappropriately normal serum ACTH level suggests corticotroph adenoma.</p>\n<h2>Management</h2><br><br><p>Transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line therapy; second-line options include radiation therapy, cabergoline, and adrenalectomy.</p>\n<h1>Thyrotroph adenoma</h1><h2>Pathophysiology</h2><br><br><p>Excessive TSH secretion leads to hyperthyroidism.</p>\n<h2>Clinical presentation</h2><br><br><p>Hyperthyroid signs and symptoms (eg, weight loss, tachycardia, tremor) occur with diffuse goiter.&nbsp; Lid lag may be present but true proptosis (specific for Graves disease) is not seen.&nbsp; Mass effect symptoms are common.</p>\n<h2>Endocrine diagnosis</h2><br><br><p>Serum TSH, triiodothyronine, and free thyroxine are elevated; alpha subunit levels are often also elevated.</p>\n<h2>Management</h2><br><br><p>Beta blocker (eg, propranolol) can reduce hyperthyroid symptoms, somatostatin analogs can reduce TSH secretion, and transsphenoidal surgery is performed for definitive treatment.</p>\n<h1>Null-cell adenoma</h1><br><br><p>This rare nonsecretory tumor cannot be assigned to any of the previous categories based on histopathology and immunohistochemical testing.&nbsp; Null-cell adenomas are typically asymptomatic until they become large enough to cause mass effects or hypopituitarism.</p>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pituitary apoplexy:</strong>&nbsp; Hemorrhage into the adenoma presents with thunderclap headache, visual field defects, and ophthalmoplegia (compression of oculomotor nerve [CN III]).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hypopituitarism:</strong>&nbsp; Deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones is due to compression or invasion of the surrounding gland or from treatment-related injury.&nbsp; Occult central adrenal insufficiency can cause adrenal crisis if not identified prior to surgery (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/57250.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hypogonadism and osteoporosis:</strong>&nbsp; Hypogonadism and osteoporosis can be due to compression of healthy gonadotrophs or suppression of GnRH by prolactin (either from prolactinoma or loss of normal dopamine regulation of prolactin secretion).&nbsp;
