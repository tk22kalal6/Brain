Prion protein (PrP) is found in both neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells and normally exists in an alpha-helical structure (PrPC).&nbsp; Prion diseases occur after a domain in this protein undergoes a conformational change from an alpha helix into a <strong>beta pleated sheet isoform</strong> (PrPSC), which confers the ability to induce similar conformational changes in other proteins.&nbsp; This beta sheet conformation is resistant to proteases and forms long, highly neurotoxic fibrils that accumulate intracellularly in neurons and form extracellular deposits.&nbsp; This results in <strong>noninflammatory spongiform neurodegeneration</strong> with widespread loss of neurons throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum.</p>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>On microscopy, there is spongiform degeneration of the gray matter, which is characterized by formation of microscopic vacuoles within the neuronal processes.&nbsp; This leads to widespread neuronal loss and reactive gliosis without associated inflammation.&nbsp; This may be evident on gross pathology as widespread atrophy involving both the cerebrum and cerebellum (in contrast to many other neurodegenerative diseases that spare the cerebellum).</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Most cases of CJD occur in patients age &gt;50 and are sporadic with no clearly identifiable cause.&nbsp; However, known risk factors for developing nonsporadic forms of CJD include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Genetic mutations in the prion protein (<em>PRNP</em>) gene (eg, genetic CJD)</li>\n\t<li>Medical procedures involving contaminated materials such as neurosurgical instruments, corneal transplants, dura transplants, or growth hormone administration (eg, iatrogenic CJD)</li>\n\t<li>Consumption of contaminated beef from cattle with prion disease (eg, variant CJD)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Clinical manifestations of CJD are diverse and often include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Neuropsychiatric decline</strong>, characterized by behavioral abnormalities, personality changes, and sleep disturbances (eg, insomnia, hypersomnia).&nbsp; Patients often decline rapidly to severe dementia and an inability to care for themselves.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Myoclonus</strong>, classically provoked by a startle and occurring in most patients with CJD at some point during the illness.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cerebellar signs</strong>, including nystagmus and ataxia (wide-based gait).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Upper motor neuron signs</strong> (eg, hyperreflexia, upgoing Babinski) due to degeneration of the corticospinal tracts.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Extrapyramidal signs</strong>, including bradykinesia and dystonia.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Although CJD has a long incubation period (estimated mean of 10 years), once symptoms occur, patients experience an inexorable decline (eg, loss of speech, loss of ability for self-care, coma) until death, which occurs less than 12 months after diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of CJD is made by a combination of clinical findings and other supportive tests:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>MRI of the brain often reveals hyperintensity (in DWI or FLAIR sequences) of the cerebral cortex (ie, cortical ribboning), putamen, head of the caudate, and thalamus (ie, hockey stick sign).</li>\n\t<li>Electroencephalography (EEG) can show a characteristic pattern of synchronous, periodic sharp wave complexes.</li>\n\t<li>CSF analysis may show elevated 14-3-3 protein, tau protein, and positive real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) test.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because CJD is noninflammatory, standard CSF findings are often unremarkable (ie, no white blood cells, normal glucose, normal or mildly elevated protein).&nbsp; Elevated 14-3-3 protein titers are a marker of neuronal cell death not specific for CJD, and elevated tau protein can also be seen in other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><br><br><p>Although not widely available, a RT-QuIC test can be performed, which has significantly greater sensitivity and specificity for CJD.&nbsp; In this test, abnormally folded proteins are isolated, amplified, and then incubated with normally folded proteins; a prion-induced conformational change in the normal proteins can then be observed in real time via fluorescence detection.&nbsp; A positive CSF RT-QuIC confirms a diagnosis of CJD.</p><br><br><p>Patients who die from probable CJD may undergo autopsy for definitive pathologic confirmation and to look for an identifiable source in possible acquired cases (eg, bovine transmission).</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Alzheimer disease</strong>:&nbsp; can present with cognitive decline; however, in contrast to CJD, Alzheimer disease has a gradual onset (years vs months).&nbsp; In addition, myoclonus and upper motor neuron signs are more characteristic of CJD.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Herpes simplex viral encephalitis</strong>:&nbsp; can present with rapidly worsening mental status.&nbsp; However, it typically manifests much faster (ie, &lt;1 week) than CJD and is usually accompanied by fever, headache, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Parkinson disease dementia</strong> (PDD) and <strong>Lewy body disease</strong> (LBD):&nbsp; can cause behavioral changes and cognitive impairment.&nbsp; However, PDD is typified by bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity, and LBD is characterized by hallucinations and parkinsonism.&nbsp; In addition, CJD typically worsens more rapidly than PDD and LBD.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Autoimmune encephalitis</strong>:&nbsp; can present with rapidly progressive behavioral changes, memory dysfunction, and abnormal movements.&nbsp; However, it typically occurs in conjunction with a tumor or after an infection; MRI, CSF, and EEG findings can differentiate this from CJD.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>There is no known treatment for CJD.&nbsp; Only supportive treatment is available, which should include symptom-based management, compassionate education, and referral to social services.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>CJD is invariably <strong>fatal</strong>, with a median survival time of 4-6 months from symptom onset (with most dying within 6-12 months).&nbsp; Early diagnosis can help in planning supportive care, but it does not alter the disease course.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/47159.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by prion proteins.&nbsp; It presents with rapid cognitive decline, myoclonus, cerebellar dysfunction, and upper motor neuron signs, among other neurologic symptoms.&nbsp; Diagnosis relies on clinical features, CSF analysis with positive RT-QuIC testing, EEG, and MRI findings.&nbsp; Pathology will show spongiform changes with neuronal loss and reactive gliosis without inflammation.&nbsp; Patients typically die within 6-12 months of symptom onset.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
