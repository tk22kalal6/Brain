Migraines start with a self-propagating wave of depolarization (from actively firing neurons) spreading across the cerebral cortex, followed by a period of brief neuronal suppression.&nbsp; This cortical depolarization and suppression are thought to be what causes positive (eg, bright spots, noises, paresthesia) or negative (eg, vision defects, hearing loss, numbness) auras prior to the onset of headache.</p><br><br><p>The depolarization eventually spreads to trigeminal nerve nociceptors, which extend to the meninges and intracranial vasculature, causing severe headache to develop.&nbsp; The activation of trigeminal afferents results in the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide involved in pain transmission.&nbsp; CGRP also causes local vasodilation and increased neurogenic inflammation, which can further sensitize trigeminal afferent fibers and increase pain (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59077.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Migraines can occur in children and adults (usually age &lt;50), with the typical presentation at age 20-40.&nbsp; Females are 2-3 times more at risk for having migraines than males, possibly due to cyclic increases and decreases in estrogen and progesterone.&nbsp; Migraines tend to run in families, suggesting a genetic predisposition.&nbsp; In addition, conditions such as depression, anxiety, and other pain disorders are commonly associated with migraines.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>A migraine can last anywhere from 4-72 hours (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L92477.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Common triggers include stress, fasting, dehydration, menses, and sleep deprivation.&nbsp; Migraines typically consist of 4 phases:&nbsp; prodrome, aura (not always present), headache, and postdrome:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Prodrome</strong>:&nbsp; Premonitory symptoms may precede the headache phase by hours to days and can include yawning, mood changes, food cravings, and irritability.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Aura</strong>:&nbsp; Auras are transient neurologic symptoms that typically occur prior to headache.&nbsp; Not all patients experience an aura, but when present, it can be visual (eg, vision loss, bright spots) or sensory (eg, numbness, paresthesia).&nbsp; Visual auras are the most common and are often described as a <strong>scintillating scotoma</strong> or <strong>bright, flashing lights</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21116.gif\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Auras typically last &lt;1 hour and resolve at the onset of headache pain.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Headache</strong>:&nbsp; The headache phase is characterized by a unilateral, moderate to severe pulsating (eg, throbbing, pounding) pain.&nbsp; It is often aggravated by routine physical activity.&nbsp; Nausea, vomiting, <strong>photophobia</strong> (eg, light sensitivity), and <strong>phonophobia</strong> (eg, sound sensitivity) are common during this phase.&nbsp; Patients often report that lying in a dark room and resting help reduce the pain.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Postdrome</strong>:&nbsp; Following resolution of the headache, many patients experience fatigue and difficulty concentrating for 1-2 days.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Children with migraines have similar symptoms to adults.&nbsp; However, unlike adults with migraine, children may have bilateral headaches and concomitant autonomic symptoms (tearing, nasal congestion).&nbsp; Photophobia and phonophobia may be difficult to determine in young children but can be inferred by actions (eg, avoiding bright sunlight).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of migraine is primarily clinical, based on the characteristic history and clinical features.&nbsp; Patients usually have headaches with several of the following key features:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Recurrent, lasting 4-72 hours</li>\n\t<li>Unilateral location (except in children, who may have bilateral headaches)</li>\n\t<li>Pulsating quality with moderate to severe intensity</li>\n\t<li>Aggravation by routine physical activity</li>\n\t<li>Accompanying nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and/or phonophobia</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Neuroimaging studies such as MRI or CT are not routinely indicated for the diagnosis of migraine.&nbsp; However, imaging should be performed in patients with warning signs that suggest a possible structural cause of headache (eg, brain tumor).</p><br><br><p><strong>Warning signs</strong> for migraine include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Differences compared to prior headaches (eg, significant increases in frequency or intensity, changes in location)</li>\n\t<li>Signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, early morning onset, worse when lying down, persistent nausea/vomiting, vision/gait changes, papilledema)</li>\n\t<li>Neurologic findings (eg, seizures, changes in consciousness, focal deficits)</li>\n\t<li>Precipitating events (eg, trauma)</li>\n\t<li>Sudden, explosive onset</li>\n\t<li>New headaches in patients age &gt;50</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for migraines can include (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/46083.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Tension headache</strong>:&nbsp; Unlike migraines, tension headaches typically present with bilateral, nonpulsatile pain without accompanying nausea or vomiting.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cluster headache</strong>:&nbsp; Although cluster headaches can cause a severe, unilateral headache, ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (eg, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, flushing, diaphoresis) are expected.&nbsp; In addition, cluster headaches are typically shorter and are not preceded by an aura.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sinusitis</strong>:&nbsp; Sinus headaches may mimic migraines but are typically associated with nasal symptoms (eg, congestion, drainage), cough, and anosmia.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension:</strong>&nbsp; This can present as recurrent, pulsatile headaches with nausea and vomiting.&nbsp; However, papilledema and persistent visual disturbances are usually seen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Migraines are typically managed with abortive medications for acute attacks and are sometimes managed with preventive medications to reduce the frequency of attacks (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31097.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Abortive management</h2><br><br><p>Abortive medications are often prescribed to take at the onset of symptoms.&nbsp; In patients who experience auras, medication is usually recommended to be taken as soon at the aura begins.&nbsp; These medications include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Simple analgesics</strong> (eg, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [eg, ibuprofen, naproxen]):&nbsp; These are first-line agents and work by inhibiting the production of inflammatory prostaglandins, thereby reducing pain and inflammation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Triptans</strong> (eg, sumatriptan, rizatriptan):&nbsp; Triptans can be used orally or intranasally for refractory headaches, and they can be taken with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for a greater effect.&nbsp; Triptans are serotonin receptor (5-HT1B/1D) agonists that decrease neurogenic inflammation and CGRP release.&nbsp; They can have a vasoconstrictive effect because they act on vascular serotonin receptors and, therefore, should be avoided in patients with significant coronary artery disease or history of stroke.&nbsp; Patients should only receive a maximum of 2 doses in 24 hours due to risk for severe vasoconstriction.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antiemetics</strong>:&nbsp; Antiemetic medications (eg, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) can reduce headache pain and help with nausea and vomiting associated with headaches.</li>\n\t<li><strong>CGRP antagonists</strong> (eg, ubrogepant, rimegepant):&nbsp; These medications are often taken by patients who cannot take or do not respond well to triptans.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Ergotamine derivatives, such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine tartrate, are used less commonly due to their potential adverse effects (eg, severe nausea, abdominal cramping) and interactions.&nbsp; However, they can be effective for some patients, particularly when other treatments have failed.</p><br><br><p>Abortive management of migraines in pregnancy is complicated due to limited therapeutic options (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L38332.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Acetaminophen is the preferred first-line option; patients also typically benefit from caffeine.&nbsp; In pregnant patients who do not improve with acetaminophen alone, a low-potency opioid (eg, acetaminophen-codeine), antiemetics (eg, promethazine), or caffeine/butalbital may be beneficial.<p></p>\n<h2>Preventive management</h2><br><br><p>All patients with migraine should also be counseled on therapeutic lifestyle measures such as sleep hygiene, routine meals, regular exercise, and management of migraine triggers to help prevent episodes.&nbsp; Preventive medication for migraines should be considered in patients who:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Have frequent (eg, &gt;4/month) or long-lasting (eg, &gt;12 hr) episodes</li>\n\t<li>Experience disabling symptoms that prevent regular activities</li>\n\t<li>Are unable to take or have had limited relief with abortive medications</li>\n\t<li>Overuse abortive medications</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Preventive medications are often started at low doses and slowly titrated up over months.&nbsp; First-line treatment often includes one of the following medications:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Beta blockers</strong> (eg, propranolol):&nbsp; Beta blockers are commonly used in patients who have concomitant hypertension or in pregnant patients (because of their safety profile).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tricyclic antidepressants</strong> (eg, amitriptyline, nortriptyline):&nbsp; These are often used in patients who have comorbid depression and anxiety.&nbsp; They can improve sleep quality so are also useful in patients with difficulty managing sleep hygiene.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antiseizure medications</strong>:&nbsp; Certain antiseizure medications, such as topiramate and valproate, have been found to be effective in reducing migraine frequency and severity.&nbsp; These medications are particularly useful in patients who have concomitant epilepsy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>CGRP monoclonal antibodies</strong> (eg, erenumab, fremanezumab):&nbsp; These medications specifically target the CGRP pathway, which plays a key role in migraine pathophysiology, thereby reducing the frequency and severity of attacks.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other therapies for patients who do not respond to first-line therapy include serotonin norepinephrine reductase inhibitors (eg, venlafaxine) or calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil).&nbsp; Cyproheptadine, which is a serotonin antagonist that can block calcium channels, is sometimes used in younger children as a preventive medication.&nbsp; Over-the-counter agents, including magnesium, feverfew, coenzyme Q10, and riboflavin, have also shown some benefit for patients with migraine.</p><br><br><p>Patients with chronic migraines refractory to preventive medications and those who cannot tolerate adverse effects of medications have procedural options, including occipital nerve blocks and botulinum toxin (Botox) injections (placed in specific muscles of the face, head, and neck).&nbsp; Botox inhibits the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain signaling, leading to a reduction in migraine frequency and severity.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Migraine is a chronic condition that can cause a significant negative impact on quality of life.&nbsp; With appropriate management strategies tailored to the individual patient, including acute and preventive treatments and lifestyle modifications, many patients can achieve improved symptom control and quality of life.&nbsp; However, some patients may continue to have recurrent, frequent attacks.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Migraines are a common, disabling disorder caused by cortical spreading depression with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), ultimately leading to pain.&nbsp; Migraines are characterized by recurrent, unilateral headaches with accompanying nausea, vomiting, and photophobia/phonophobia.&nbsp; An aura, or transient neurologic symptom (usually a scintillating scotoma), may precede the headache in some patients.&nbsp; Migraines are usually treated acutely with abortive medications such as simple analgesics (eg, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or triptans.&nbsp; For patients with frequent or disabling migraines, preventative medication is often prescribed.&nbsp; First-line preventative medications include beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, antiseizure medications, and CGRP monoclonal antibodies.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
