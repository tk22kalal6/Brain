The genetic mutations disrupt the integrity of myelin (in demyelinating types) or the structure and function of axons (in axonal types), leading to impaired nerve conduction and eventual muscle atrophy and weakness.&nbsp; CMT is broadly classified into subtypes 1-4 based on genetics and clinical manifestations, with type 1 being the most common.&nbsp; CMT type 1 is typically a demyelinating disorder.</p>\n<h1>Genetics</h1><br><br><p>CMT is one of the most common inherited neurologic disorders.&nbsp; The most common pathogenic variant (causing CMT type 1) is a duplication of the <strong>peripheral myelin protein 22 (</strong><em><strong>PMP22</strong></em><strong>) gene</strong>, causing overexpression of the protein.&nbsp; This is an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> mutation, so children of an affected parent have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation.&nbsp; The primary risk factor for developing CMT is a family history; however, mutations may also arise sporadically in individuals without a family history.</p>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Pathologically, CMT can involve demyelination, which manifests as Schwann cell dysfunction and myelin sheath abnormalities.&nbsp; Nerve biopsies show <strong>onion-bulb formations</strong>, representing Schwann cell demyelination and remyelination around axons.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Manifestations of CMT depend on the underlying genetic abnormality and subtype.&nbsp; Most cases present in <strong>childhood or adolescence</strong> with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Slowly progressive symptoms</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Symmetric distal muscle atrophy and weakness</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pes cavus</strong> (high arched foot).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Distal muscle weakness often presents as clumsiness with walking.&nbsp; Patients often have frequent ankle sprains or difficulty with exercise.&nbsp; Initial physical examination typically demonstrates muscle wasting most prominent in the foot and lower legs, foot drop, and/or areflexia.&nbsp; Pes cavus and <strong>hammer toes</strong> can also be seen due to weakness/wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the foot.</p><br><br><p>Because CMT type 1 is due to overexpression of myelin protein, peripheral nerves may sometimes hypertrophy and be palpable on physical examination.&nbsp; Sensory loss is usually present but mild; it can sometimes be detected by checking vibration perception and proprioception.</p><br><br><p>As the disease progresses, other features may become more prominent.&nbsp; Upper extremity involvement (ie, intrinsic musculature of the hands) typically occurs later in the disease course.&nbsp; As lower extremity weakness progresses, calf muscle atrophy becomes obvious, and the lower legs appear very thin, leading to a classic <strong>stork-leg deformity</strong>.&nbsp; Scoliosis and kyphosis may also develop from weakness of the paraspinal muscles.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies</strong>:&nbsp; X-linked inherited disorders caused by abnormalities in muscle dystrophin.&nbsp; Patients develop distal limb weakness but have a waddling gait and pseudohypertrophy (rather than atrophy) of the calf muscles.&nbsp; Sensory loss would not be expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Friedreich ataxia</strong>:&nbsp; An autosomal recessive disorder caused by a GAA repeat expansion that can present with lower extremity symptoms, but, usually, patients have a wide-based ataxic gait rather than foot drop.&nbsp; Lateral corticospinal tract involvement typically causes upper motor neuron signs, which are not present in CMT disease because it is a disorder of peripheral nerves.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Guillain-Barré syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; An immunologic polyneuropathy that classically presents with acute ascending weakness and areflexia that worsens over hours to days.&nbsp; However, this condition does not affect vibratory and position senses and usually resolves with supportive care.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Huntington disease</strong>:&nbsp; An autosomal dominant disorder caused by trinucleotide repeats (CAG) in the huntingtin gene, which results in severe neuronal loss in the caudate nucleus.&nbsp; This condition typically manifests in young adults with chorea, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral abnormalities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Patients with characteristic features of CMT (eg, progressive, distal motor and sensory neuropathy) on history and physical examination require further work-up to confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp; Most patients with suspected CMT disease typically undergo electrodiagnostic testing with <strong>electromyography</strong> and <strong>nerve conduction studies</strong>; results can show neuropathy with demyelination (eg, slowed conduction velocity) or axonal loss (eg, nerve potentials with low amplitude).&nbsp; If neuropathy is confirmed on electrodiagnostic testing, patients often undergo further <strong>genetic testing</strong> for CMT disease to identify the mutation.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>There is no cure for CMT, and treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and maintaining mobility.&nbsp; Patients are often placed in intensive rehabilitation programs with physical and occupational therapy to strengthen muscles and facilitate activities of daily living.&nbsp; Ankle-foot orthoses can support weakness in the feet.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>CMT is generally a very slowly progressive disorder, and its course varies widely based on the CMT subtype, genetic factors, and presence of supportive care.&nbsp; Most patients retain functional independence, although some may require assistive devices (eg, wheelchair) over time.&nbsp; Life expectancy is typically normal.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in genes coding for peripheral nerve axonal or myelin proteins.&nbsp; It is characterized by slowly progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, which can cause pes cavus and hammer toes.&nbsp; Sensory symptoms are usually mild.&nbsp; Diagnosis is by electrodiagnostic studies followed by genetic testing.&nbsp; Management is typically supportive.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
