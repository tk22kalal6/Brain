It is a genetic disorder caused primarily by mutations in the <em>MECP2</em> gene and occurs predominantly in females.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Most cases of Rett syndrome result from mutations in the <strong><em>MECP2</em> gene</strong> that is expressed in all tissues, with an abundance in the brain.&nbsp; The <em>MECP2</em> gene encodes the MeCP2 protein, which is involved in the epigenetic regulation of several target genes, particularly those critical to neuronal development.&nbsp; Pathogenic <em>MECP2</em> variants contribute to impaired synaptic maturation and cortical maintenance, resulting in arrested brain development without neuronal death.&nbsp; Therefore, the condition is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder (ie, symptoms manifest due to disrupted brain growth and development) rather than a neurodegenerative disorder (ie, symptoms manifest due to progressive neuronal damage/loss).</p><br><br><p>In the vast majority of cases, Rett syndrome occurs sporadically due to a de novo mutation in <em>MECP2</em>, which is located on the X chromosome.&nbsp; Rett syndrome appears to <strong>affect almost exclusively females</strong>, which may be explained by the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>De novo <em>MECP2</em> gene mutations appear to occur almost solely on the paternally-derived X chromosome.&nbsp; Therefore, males (whose single X chromosome is maternally derived) do not generally develop a de novo mutation.</li>\n\t<li>Due to the critical role of <em>MECP2</em>, many males who develop an <em>MECP2</em> mutation succumb to early lethality.&nbsp; In contrast, a mutation in females (46,XX) is not rapidly fatal because they have some functional <em>MECP2</em> from the corresponding normal X chromosome.&nbsp; Therefore, it is almost always females who survive to develop Rett syndrome.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>For the first 6 months of life, individuals with Rett syndrome typically have normal development.&nbsp; The earliest indicator of Rett syndrome may be a <strong>deceleration in head circumference</strong>.&nbsp; After age 6 months (particularly around 12-18 months), patients begin developing features of Rett syndrome, which may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Regression of verbal communicative skills</strong> (eg, using facial expressions or single words only);&nbsp; often occurs gradually but can sometimes be rapidly progressive (over the course of days)</li>\n\t<li>Loss of purposeful hand movements (eg, twisting of fingers, inability to feed self, stereotypical movements [hair pulling])</li>\n\t<li>Gait abnormalities (eg, lurching gait)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Decelerated growth</strong> (initially in head circumference, followed by height and weight; the brain stops growing after age 4)&nbsp; may be exacerbated by oropharyngeal dysfunction contributing to inadequate nutritional intake</li>\n\t<li>Seizures</li>\n\t<li>Abnormal autonomic nervous system regulation (contributing to cardiac electrical instability and a characteristic pattern of disordered breathing consisting of alternating episodes of hyperventilation and hypoventilation)</li>\n\t<li>Sleep disturbances (eg, waking up screaming)</li>\n\t<li>Autistic features (eg, lack of eye contact and social reciprocity)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Several other conditions may have overlapping features with Rett syndrome, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Autism spectrum disorder</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/34848.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Patients with Rett syndrome may have features of autism (eg, lack of eye contact, stereotypical movements).&nbsp; However, other features of Rett syndrome (eg, gait disturbances) are not expected in autism spectrum disorder.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Angelman syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; This is an imprinting disorder caused by the absence of the maternally inherited copy of the <em>UBE3A</em> gene on chromosome 15 (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L103470.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Patients with Angelman syndrome have a characteristic happy demeanor and can have repetitive hand flapping, a jerky gait, and seizures.&nbsp; Patients have immediate developmental delay rather than developmental regression.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cerebral palsy</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35640.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

In patients with clinical features suggestive of Rett syndrome, diagnostic evaluation should include <em>MECP2</em> gene analysis.&nbsp; A diagnosis is made if an <em>MECP2</em> mutation is found in patients with characteristic clinical features.&nbsp; Other studies to consider in the work-up of patients with developmental delay but normal <em>MECP2</em> gene may include gene analysis for other genetic disorders, MRI of the brain to evaluate for structural abnormalities, and serum amino acids and urine organic acids to evaluate for an inborn error of metabolism.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>After the initial presentation, patients with Rett syndrome generally have a period of rapid regression in the first few years of life.&nbsp; After this, there is a period of stability consisting of relative preservation of acquired skills, which can last several years.&nbsp; Patients may recover some nonverbal communication during this time.&nbsp; After age 10, motor skills may progressively worsen, manifesting as reduced strength and mobility with increased rigidity.&nbsp; Scoliosis is common as patients reach adolescence.</p><br><br><p>Many patients survive into adulthood with a median survival until approximately age 45.&nbsp; However, their quality of life may be significantly impaired, particularly in those with frequent seizures, difficulty with ambulation, and respiratory difficulties (a common cause of death in affected patients).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of Rett syndrome is primarily supportive and aimed at addressing symptoms and improving quality of life.&nbsp; This may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Physical, occupational, and speech therapy to address motor and communication difficulties</li>\n\t<li>Behavioral therapy to address sleep and behavioral challenges</li>\n\t<li>Antiepileptic medications to control seizures</li>\n\t<li>Nutritional support to improve growth</li>\n\t<li>Management of scoliosis</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Disease-modifying therapies (eg, trofinetide, a synthetic analogue of a naturally-occurring peptide) are also being developed to treat some of the symptoms (eg, abnormal breathing, nighttime behaviors, repetitive behaviors) seen in Rett syndrome.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Rett syndrome (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/64881.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that affects mostly females.&nbsp;
