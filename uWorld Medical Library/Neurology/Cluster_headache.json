Cluster headaches are a type of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, which are headache disorders characterized by short headaches in the trigeminal distribution with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Cluster headaches primarily occur in patients age 20-50 but occasionally present in childhood and adolescence.&nbsp; Males are 2-3 times more likely to have cluster headaches than females.&nbsp; Some patients may have a genetic predisposition (a family history of headache).&nbsp; Smoking is considered a significant risk factor for the development of cluster headaches.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The exact pathophysiology of cluster headaches is not completely understood.&nbsp; The pain is likely caused by the activation of trigeminal nociceptors and the autonomic nervous system.&nbsp; The regular, predictable clustering of attacks suggests involvement of the hypothalamus, which regulates circadian rhythms.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Cluster headaches are characterized by excruciating, unilateral, stabbing/burning pain around the eye or in the temporal region (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L92476.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Patients with cluster headaches often have hallmark accompanying features, including:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Ipsilateral autonomic symptoms, which can include partial Horner syndrome symptoms (eg, miosis, ptosis), lacrimation, conjunctival injection, and/or rhinorrhea</li>\n\t<li>Restlessness (eg, the need to move around)</li>\n\t<li>Headaches that <strong>start during sleep</strong></li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Cluster headaches can last anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours.&nbsp; They usually <strong>occur multiple times a day</strong> (often up to 8 times a day) <strong>over 6-8 weeks</strong>, with months to years of remission (eg, clustering).&nbsp; Many patients notice a predictable pattern either in the acute episodes (eg, at the same time of day) or in the recurrence of clusters (eg, in the same season).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of cluster headaches is primarily clinical, based on the characteristic history and clinical features.&nbsp; Key diagnostic features include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Pain lasting 15-180 minutes</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Presence of ipsilateral autonomic symptoms</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Restlessness</strong></li>\n</ul><br><br><p>MRI of the brain with contrast enhancement is commonly performed in the outpatient setting to rule out rare structural causes (eg, small pituitary or carotid tumors).&nbsp; In most patients, neuroimaging is normal.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for cluster headaches can include the following (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/46083.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Migraine headaches</strong>:&nbsp; Although migraines can also present with severe unilateral pain, autonomic symptoms are usually absent and episodes typically last longer than in cluster headaches.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Trigeminal neuralgia</strong>:&nbsp; Although trigeminal neuralgia can present with severe, stabbing pain in the face, the pain typically lasts only a few seconds and autonomic symptoms are usually not present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sinusitis</strong>:&nbsp; Sinus headaches may present with facial pain and rhinorrhea, but pain typically does not occur in discrete episodes.&nbsp; In addition, patients with sinusitis usually have other symptoms such as fever, facial pressure, and nasal congestion.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acute angle closure glaucoma</strong>:&nbsp; This may present with sudden-onset eye pain and redness, but patients usually also have vision loss, see halos around light, and have a fixed middilated (not constricted) pupil in the affected eye.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of cluster headaches is divided into abortive management of acute episodes and long-term preventative management.</p>\n<h2>Abortive management</h2><br><br><p>The most effective <strong>abortive management</strong> for cluster headaches is <strong>100% oxygen by face mask</strong>.&nbsp; This treatment, administered for 15 minutes, provides significant relief for most patients.&nbsp; The exact mechanism is unclear, but possibilities include effects on cerebral vasoconstriction and neurotransmitter modulation.&nbsp; Patients with partial or no response to oxygen therapy are often given subcutaneous or intranasal triptans and can be prescribed these for home use.</p>\n<h2>Long-term preventative management</h2><br><br><p>Given the high frequency and severity of attacks, home abortive medications such as sumatriptan may be limited in their ability to provide relief due to concern for the development of toxicity and rebound headaches.&nbsp; Therefore, many patients receive <strong>preventive treatment</strong> at the onset of a cluster period to mitigate symptoms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>First-line therapy is <strong>verapamil</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Second-line therapy includes lithium and topiramate.</li>\n\t<li>A short course of oral glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) is often given as an adjunct during the initial titration of verapamil to rapidly reduce the headache burden.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Preventative medication is usually continued for about 2 weeks after cluster headaches remit and then can be stopped.&nbsp; They are usually restarted at the start of the next cluster.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Cluster headaches are usually a lifelong and often debilitating condition.&nbsp; Although the prognosis varies among individuals, many patients experience episodic periods of remission interspersed with active clusters.&nbsp; However, the extreme severity of pain can cause increased risk for depression, which has been reported in up to 40% of patients with this disorder.&nbsp; Suicidal ideation is also more common in these patients.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Cluster headaches (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/57346.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are characterized by excruciating, unilateral periorbital pain and associated ipsilateral autonomic symptoms lasting 15-180 minutes.&nbsp; The episodes often occur in clusters (eg, at the same time of day or year) for several weeks, followed by long periods of remission.&nbsp; Diagnosis is clinical, but outpatient MRI of the brain with contrast is performed in almost all patients.&nbsp; Abortive treatment is usually with 100% oxygen by face mask in the hospital, and triptans may be prescribed for home use.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
