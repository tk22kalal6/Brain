Symptoms may include headache, nausea, dizziness, confusion, and/or changes in attention or emotion.&nbsp; Moderate to severe TBI typically involves serious intracranial injuries (eg, intraparenchymal hemorrhage), which lead to depressed mental status, significant neurologic deficits, and an increased risk for permanent disability or death.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>TBI results from a mechanical force exerted on the brain.&nbsp; Common etiologies include blunt force or penetrating trauma to the head, or acceleration-deceleration injuries, which occur when the brain shifts rapidly against the skull (eg, due to blast/explosion exposure, severe whiplash) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31000.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Injuries to the brain occur by 2 main mechanisms:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Primary injury</strong>:&nbsp; Occurs at the time of injury from the force of impact and involves direct damage to brain structures.&nbsp;

Risk factors for PCS include a history of multiple concussions or nonadherence to gradual return-to-play protocols.<p></p><br><br><p>PCS is a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms (eg, headache, dizziness, cognitive impairment, unstable moods) that persist beyond the expected recovery period, with exclusion of other potential causes (eg, psychiatric disorders, mass).&nbsp; MRI of the brain is often performed in patients with PCS to evaluate for structural pathology because it is more sensitive than CT scan for detecting subtle intracranial abnormalities.&nbsp; However, neuroimaging is often normal.</p><br><br><p>Management involves symptomatic care because most patients' condition improves within 3-6 months.&nbsp; Acute interventions may include headache management (eg, amitriptyline), cognitive-behavioral therapy (for insomnia or anxiety), vestibular therapy (for balance issues), or reassurance alone (if symptom severity is mild).&nbsp; Activity as tolerated should be encouraged.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><h2>Mild TBI (concussion)</h2><br><br><p>Most patients with a mild TBI recover well within 7-14 days, although some may develop PCS.&nbsp; Sustaining multiple concussions or suffering a second concussion before full recovery from the first can lead to severe, longer-lasting symptoms and may be associated with an increased risk for chronic headaches, neuropsychiatric disorders (eg, depression), and dementia.</p>\n<h2>Moderate to severe TBI</h2><br><br><p>The prognoses of moderate and severe TBIs vary widely.&nbsp; Some cases lead to death or brain death, whereas others result in long-term cognitive, motor, or psychologic impairments.&nbsp; Poor outcomes are more likely in patients with low GCS score at presentation, advanced age, severe structural injuries (eg, large hemorrhage), hypoxia, elevated ICP, and history of coagulopathy.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Prevention strategies for avoiding TBIs include proper helmet use during high-risk activities (eg, biking, skateboarding, playing contact sports), consistent use of seatbelts in motor vehicles, and fall-prevention strategies (eg, physical therapy, assistive devices) in the elderly or individuals with disabilities.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Traumatic brain injury represents a spectrum of conditions with varied clinical implications.&nbsp; Mild TBI (concussion) is a minor disruption in neurocognitive function without structural abnormalities and is characterized by headache, disorientation, and cognitive/emotional changes.&nbsp; It is managed with physical and cognitive rest with a gradual return to activity.&nbsp; Moderate to severe TBIs can lead to significant neurologic symptoms, irreversible neurocognitive deficits, and death.&nbsp; Management typically involves neurosurgical consultation and intensive care aimed at minimizing intracranial hemorrhage, intracranial pressure, and neuronal injury.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
