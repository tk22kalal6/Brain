Viral meningitis typically results from nonbacterial pathogens, including <strong>enteroviruses</strong> (eg, coxsackievirus, echovirus), <strong>herpesviruses</strong> (eg, herpes simplex virus [HSV], varicella-zoster virus), and <strong>arboviruses</strong> (eg, West Nile virus).&nbsp; Enteroviruses, particularly coxsackievirus and echovirus, are the most common causes of viral meningitis.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology</h1><br><br><p>Aseptic meningitis is more common than bacterial meningitis and can occur in individuals of all ages, though it frequently presents in young children.&nbsp; In the United States, enteroviruses are more common during the summer and fall months.&nbsp; Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, crowded living conditions, poor hygiene practices, and immunocompromised states.&nbsp; HSV can be associated with genital herpes infections (HSV-2 more than HSV-1).&nbsp; Arboviruses, such as West Nile virus, carried by mosquitoes, have emerged in various geographic regions, leading to seasonal spikes in viral meningitis cases.&nbsp; Varicella-zoster virus, the agent behind chickenpox and shingles, can cause viral meningitis in immunocompromised individuals or those experiencing shingles.&nbsp; HIV-associated meningitis primarily occurs during the acute phase of HIV infection.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Viral meningitis typically develops over the course of a few days.&nbsp; Common symptoms of viral meningitis include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Fever</li>\n\t<li>Headache</li>\n\t<li>Stiff neck (nuchal rigidity)</li>\n\t<li>Photophobia (sensitivity to light)</li>\n\t<li>Nausea</li>\n\t<li>Irritability and poor feeding in infants</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>HSV can be more severe, and patients may present with additional symptoms suggestive of encephalitis (eg, infection of the brain parenchyma); these may include altered mental status, focal neurological deficits, and seizures, which are otherwise uncommon symptoms in viral meningitis.</p>\n<h1>Diagnostic studies</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of viral meningitis is confirmed by lumbar puncture with CSF showing:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increased white blood cell count with predominantly lymphocytes (10-500 cells/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>)</li>\n\t<li>Normal to mildly elevated protein levels (&lt;150 mg/dL)</li>\n\t<li>Normal glucose levels (40-70 mg/dL)</li>\n\t<li>PCR testing to identify viral nucleic acids for specific pathogens</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with HSV meningitis may additionally have an increased red blood cell count in the CSF.</p><br><br><p>Blood tests may be performed to assess for viral serologies and detect systemic signs of infection (eg, CBC, CRP, procalcitonin).&nbsp; In most cases of viral meningitis, head imaging is not needed, unless encephalitis (eg, altered mental status, focal neurologic deficits)&nbsp; is suspected.</p>\n<h1>Management </h1><br><br><p>On initial presentation, viral meningitis may be hard to differentiate from bacterial meningitis.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>If there is concern for possible <strong>bacterial meningitis</strong>, <strong>empiric antibiotics</strong> should be started while awaiting lumbar puncture and culture results.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>In addition, if <strong>HSV infection</strong> is suspected (eg, encephalitis, vesicular skin lesions), empiric therapy with <strong>intravenous acyclovir</strong> should be started.&nbsp; If HSV meningitis is diagnosed, IV acyclovir should be continued, and patients may be switched to oral valacyclovir (for a 10-day total course) if they are able to go home.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>If lumbar puncture confirms <strong>viral meningitis other than HSV</strong>, medications (antibiotics and antivirals) can be discontinued.&nbsp; Treatment is primarily <strong>supportive</strong>, as specific antiviral therapy is not routinely indicated for most cases.&nbsp; Symptomatic management may include analgesics for pain and fever (eg,&nbsp; acetaminophen), antiemetics for nausea and vomiting, and fluids for hydration.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of aseptic meningitis is generally favorable, with most cases resolving without complications.&nbsp; The severity of symptoms and duration of illness can vary depending on the causative virus (with infections due to HSV and West Nile virus being more severe) and the overall health of the individual.&nbsp; Most patients recover completely without long-term sequelae.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Preventive measures for aseptic meningitis include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Practicing good hygiene, such as handwashing</li>\n\t<li>Avoiding close contact with infected individuals</li>\n\t<li>Vaccination against certain viruses known to cause meningitis (eg, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella)</li>\n\t<li>Preventing mosquito and tick bites (eg, with mosquito repellant, long-sleeve clothing) to avoid arboviral infections</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differentiation from bacterial meningitis</h1><br><br><p>Differentiating between viral meningitis and bacterial meningitis can be challenging but is essential due to differences in management and prognosis.&nbsp; Key differences include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>CSF findings</strong>:&nbsp; Viral meningitis typically presents with lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal or mildly elevated protein levels, and normal glucose levels in CSF analysis, whereas bacterial meningitis often shows neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein levels, and decreased glucose levels.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clinical course</strong>:&nbsp; Viral meningitis tends to have a milder and more indolent course compared to bacterial meningitis, which can progress rapidly and lead to severe complications if untreated.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Response to antibiotics</strong>:&nbsp; Antibiotic therapy is unnecessary for viral meningitis, whereas prompt administration of antibiotics is necessary for bacterial meningitis to prevent morbidity and mortality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary&nbsp;</h1><br><br><p>Viral meningitis occurs due to viral infection causing inflammation of the meninges.&nbsp; Enteroviruses are the most common cause.&nbsp; Viral meningitis typically causes mild symptoms of fever, nuchal rigidity, and headache that usually self-resolve without specific treatments.&nbsp; Patients usually have CSF findings of a lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose, and normal to mildly elevated protein; PCR testing for specific viral antigens may confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp; Treatment is usually supportive, except in the case of HSV where acyclovir is needed.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
