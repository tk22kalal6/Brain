Different types of primary tumors occur in adult patients versus pediatric patients.&nbsp; This article discusses the general pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of primary brain tumors and lists the common types of pediatric and adult tumors.&nbsp; Details of each type of adult and pediatric brain tumor are described in separate dedicated articles.</p><br><br><p>Metastatic brain tumors are secondary tumors that spread to the brain from cancer elsewhere in the body.&nbsp; This article also addresses the diagnosis and management of brain metastasis as well.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Brain tumors can be classified according to the cell type from which they originate.&nbsp; The brain comprises 2 major cell types: neurons and glial cells.&nbsp; Neurons, which transmit information throughout the brain using electrical signals and chemical messengers, rarely form tumors.&nbsp; Tumors more commonly originate from glial cells, which significantly outnumber neurons and normally provide support to maintain the health of the nervous system.</p><br><br><p>There are 3 main types of <strong>glial cells</strong>:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Astrocytes, the most common glial cell, help regulate the environment around neurons, contribute to nutrient exchange, and play a role in maintaining the blood-brain barrier.</li>\n\t<li>Oligodendrocytes produce myelin, a fatty substance that insulates nerve fibers and allows for faster signal transmission.</li>\n\t<li>Ependymal cells line the ventricles, fluid-filled cavities within the brain and spinal cord, and are involved in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Gliomas, one of the most common types of primary brain tumor, originate from these glial cell populations (eg, astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas).&nbsp; Tumors can also arise from the meninges (eg, meningioma), the protective layer that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord.&nbsp; Several other cell types can also cause tumors in the brain, including cells from the pituitary gland, the pineal gland, or those of embryonic origin (eg, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma).</p><br><br><p>The specific pathophysiology of brain tumors varies depending on the cell type from which they originate.&nbsp; Alterations in genes that control cell growth and division can lead to uncontrolled proliferation and tumor formation.&nbsp; Mutations in tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes are implicated in various brain tumors.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Brain tumors can present at various ages depending on the type of tumor.&nbsp; In children and young adults (eg, age &lt;30), primary brain tumors are the most common type, but in older adults (eg, age &gt;30), metastatic brain tumors are more likely.</p><br><br><p>Most primary brain tumors are sporadic, although there are a few known risk factors:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Family history</strong>:&nbsp; Having a close relative with a brain tumor slightly increases the risk.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Exposure to radiation</strong>:&nbsp; Exposure to large doses of imaging-related radiation (eg, multiple CT scans in children) or previous cranial radiation therapy (eg, for acute leukemia or primary brain tumors) increases the risk of developing secondary brain tumors (usually meningiomas) later in life.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Certain genetic conditions</strong>:&nbsp; Disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), NF2-related schwannomatosis, and tuberous sclerosis complex predispose individuals to brain tumors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Overall clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The clinical presentation of brain tumors varies depending on several factors, including tumor location, tumor size and growth rate, and patient age.&nbsp; Brain tumors are often clinically silent until they grow large enough to compress neurologic structures or raise intracranial pressure (ICP).&nbsp; Specific deficits, which are sometimes subtle and present after weeks to months, help with tumor localization.</p><br><br><p>Common symptoms of brain tumors can include the following:</p>\n<h2>Headaches</h2><br><br><p>Headaches are a frequent presentation for brain tumors, particularly in adults, occurring in about 50% of patients.&nbsp; The headaches are typically constant and dull.&nbsp; Characteristics of headaches that are <strong>red flags</strong> for a possible brain tumor include (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32372.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increasing frequency and severity</li>\n\t<li>Worsening with positions that raise ICP (eg, coughing, bending)</li>\n\t<li>Awakening at night</li>\n\t<li>New headaches in patients age &gt;50</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Seizures</h2><br><br><p>Seizures can be a presenting feature, especially if they begin focally.&nbsp; A first-time seizure is an indication for neuroimaging to assess for a brain tumor.</p>\n<h2>Focal neurologic deficits</h2><br><br><p>Weakness, hyperreflexia, speech or language difficulties, sensory disturbances, or visual deficits can occur depending on the affected brain region or compressed nearby structures.</p>\n<h2>Cognitive decline</h2><br><br><p>Memory deficits, impaired executive functions (eg, planning, inhibition, attention), and personality changes can be seen with tumors involving the frontal lobes or widespread involvement.</p>\n<h2>Signs of ICP</h2><br><br><p>Intracerebral neoplasms can raise the ICP through the following major mechanisms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Mass effect from large tumors</li>\n\t<li>Obstruction of normal CSF flow (eg, obstructive hydrocephalus)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients can experience a variety of symptoms of increased ICP, including headaches accompanied by persistent nausea/vomiting, papilledema (eg, swelling of the optic nerve), and abducens nerve palsy (ie, inability to abduct the eye).</p>\n<h1>Types of primary tumors</h1><h2>Adult brain tumors</h2><br><br><p>Common adult brain tumors include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Glioblastomas (eg, high-grade astrocytomas)</li>\n\t<li>Oligodendrogliomas</li>\n\t<li>Meningiomas</li>\n\t<li>Schwannomas</li>\n\t<li>Pituitary tumors</li>\n\t<li>Primary CNS lymphomas</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pediatric brain tumors</h2><br><br><p>Common pediatric brain tumors include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pilocytic astrocytomas</li>\n\t<li>Ependymomas</li>\n\t<li>Medulloblastomas</li>\n\t<li>Craniopharyngiomas</li>\n\t<li>Pineal gland tumors</li>\n\t<li>Choroid plexus papillomas</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><h2>Neuroimaging</h2><br><br><p>After a detailed history and neurologic examination with fundoscopy to assess for focal deficits and papilledema, imaging studies are usually performed to identify a suspected brain tumor.&nbsp; The gold standard imaging modality is <strong>MRI of the brain</strong> with contrast because it can provide detailed anatomical information about the tumor location, size, and characteristics.&nbsp; In the emergency department, CT scan is often performed first because it is fast and can evaluate for other etiologies of new focal deficits or seizures such as intracranial hemorrhage.&nbsp; It can also be helpful in patients with contraindications to MRI (eg, metallic implants).</p>\n<h2>Tissue sampling</h2><br><br><p>Confirmation of the type of primary brain tumor typically requires a tissue sample, which is most commonly obtained during surgical resection.&nbsp; If surgical resection is not possible or is of high risk (eg, due to location of the tumor, such as in the brainstem), biopsy may be an alternate option.</p>\n<h2>Immunohistochemistry</h2><br><br><p>Immunohistochemistry of the tissue samples uses tagged antibodies to identify cellular antigens of interest (eg, cytoskeletal proteins, surface molecules) that can help characterize primary brain tumors or determine the source of a metastasis if the primary site is clinically unknown, particularly for anaplastic/poorly differentiated tumors lacking architectural clues.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an intermediate filament protein normally expressed in glial cells; tumors of glial lineage are often positive for GFAP.</li>\n\t<li>Synaptophysin is a transmembrane glycoprotein normally found in the presynaptic vesicles of neurons and neuroendocrine cells; brain tumors with neuronal or neuroendocrine differentiation are typically positive for synaptophysin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of primary brain tumors depends on several factors, including tumor type, grade, location, and patient factors like age and overall health.&nbsp; The primary treatment modalities for brain tumors include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Surgery</strong>:&nbsp; This is the mainstay of treatment for primary brain tumors, particularly benign and low-grade malignant tumors.&nbsp; The goal of surgery is to achieve maximal safe resection, which involves removing as much of the tumor as possible while minimizing neurologic deficits.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Radiation therapy</strong>:&nbsp; Radiation therapy can be used after surgery to eradicate microscopic tumor remnants or as the primary treatment for inoperable or high-grade tumors.&nbsp; Different radiation therapy techniques are available, such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for precisely targeting small tumors and whole-brain radiation therapy for more widespread disease.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong>:&nbsp; Chemotherapy can be used in conjunction with surgery or radiation therapy or as a stand-alone treatment for certain tumor types.&nbsp; Specific chemotherapy regimens vary depending on the tumor type and grade.&nbsp; For example, temozolomide is an alkylating agent that disrupts DNA function in cancer cells and is used for glioblastomas.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Targeted therapy</strong>:&nbsp; Although still under development for brain tumors, targeted therapies for specific molecular abnormalities of cancer cells offer promising options for specific tumor types.&nbsp; For instance, drugs targeting epidermal growth factor receptor mutations may be used in some gliomas.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antiangiogenic therapy</strong>:&nbsp; These drugs target the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow and survive.&nbsp; Bevacizumab, an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor drug, has been used in some cases of recurrent glioblastoma.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Corticosteroids</strong>:&nbsp; Medications such as dexamethasone can help reduce inflammation and associated symptoms of increased ICP (eg, headaches, nausea).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antiseizure medications</strong>:&nbsp; These may be used to prevent or control seizures, a common complication of brain tumors.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clinical trials</strong>:&nbsp; Patients with brain tumors may be eligible to participate in clinical trials offering access to innovative therapies.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rehabilitation</strong>:&nbsp; Following surgery, radiation therapy, or other treatments, rehabilitation therapies like physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can be crucial for helping patients regain function and improve their quality of life.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>This list provides a general overview, and the specific treatment approach will be tailored to the individual patient and their unique circumstances.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of brain tumors varies widely depending on the specific tumor type, grade, and treatment response.&nbsp; Generally, benign tumors have a good prognosis with surgical resection.&nbsp; The prognosis for malignant brain tumors is often guarded, with survival rates depending on the tumor grade and other factors.&nbsp; Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes.</p>\n<h1>Tumors metastasizing to the brain</h1><br><br><p>Brain metastases are <strong>secondary tumors</strong> that develop in the brain after cancer originates elsewhere in the body.&nbsp; They represent the most common form of intracranial malignancy in adults, affecting a significant number of cancer patients.&nbsp; Brain metastases present similarly to primary brain tumors but have different imaging characteristics and management guidelines.</p>\n<h2>Primary sites of metastatic brain cancer</h2><br><br><p>Lung cancer is the most frequent source of brain metastasis, followed by breast cancer, tumors of unknown primary origin, melanoma, and colon cancer (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/55616.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Over 80% of patients diagnosed with brain metastasis already have a known diagnosis of cancer; however, the brain metastasis itself can be the presenting lesion (eg, manifesting as headaches, focal deficits, or seizures).&nbsp; These patients may have no prominent systemic symptoms.&nbsp; The most important part of the work-up for brain metastasis is identification and biopsy of the primary tumor site.<p></p>\n<h2>Features raising suspicion for brain metastasis</h2><br><br><p>Certain features on MRI can raise suspicion for metastasis as opposed to a primary brain tumor.&nbsp; These include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Location at gray-white matter junction</strong>:&nbsp; Neoplastic cells travel through the vasculature and lodge in the small-caliber vessels at the gray-white matter junction.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Presence of multiple lesions</strong>:&nbsp; The presence of multiple lesions scattered across different brain regions is more suggestive of metastasis than a single primary brain tumor.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Significant vasogenic edema</strong>:&nbsp; Extensive vasogenic edema, which is fluid buildup around the tumor, can be out of proportion to the size of the lesion itself, raising suspicion for metastasis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ring-enhancing lesions</strong>:&nbsp; These lesions appear as a solid mass with a ring-shaped area of enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Management of brain metastasis</h2><br><br><p>In the short term, glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone) are often prescribed for metastatic brain tumors to reduce swelling and palliate symptoms.&nbsp; Surgical resection of solitary brain metastasis is generally recommended in patients age &lt;65 with good functional performance status and stable (or undetectable) extracranial disease; this usually rapidly improves symptoms and increases survival by months to 2 years.&nbsp; Targeted radiation therapy (with SRS) may be used as an alternate therapeutic option (eg, for poor surgical candidates, surgically inaccessible lesions, or a few/small lesions).&nbsp; In addition, many targeted therapies may be available based on the molecular pathology of the lesion (eg, immunotherapy).&nbsp; Patients with good functional status are also typically encouraged to enroll in clinical trials for newer therapies.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Brain tumors are a diverse group of intracranial neoplasms with varying presentations, prognoses, and treatment approaches.&nbsp; Understanding the pathology, clinical features, and radiology findings of different brain tumors is essential for accurate diagnosis and optimal patient management.&nbsp; Early intervention and appropriate treatment strategies can improve outcomes and quality of life for individuals with brain tumors.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
