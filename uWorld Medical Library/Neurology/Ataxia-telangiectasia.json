Normally, the <em><strong>ATM</strong></em> <strong>gene</strong> encodes a kinase that detects nuclear DNA damage (eg, DNA breaks).&nbsp; In response, the ATM kinase phosphorylates regulatory proteins (eg, tumor suppressor gene products) that halt the cell cycle to allow for repair.&nbsp; The ATM kinase is also involved in mitochondrial DNA surveillance and repair, maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis.&nbsp; Without ATM kinase, cells are particularly sensitive to ionizing radiation and are more likely to continue replicating damaged nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.&nbsp; Over time, genetic mutations can accumulate within the cell, leading to cellular genomic instability that can result in cellular dysfunction and malignant transformation.</p><br><br><p>Ataxia-telangiectasia affects multiple organ systems, including the immune, neurologic, and vascular systems.&nbsp; The amount of retained ATM kinase activity determines symptom severity.&nbsp; Patients with entirely absent <strong>ATM kinase activity</strong> (ie, due to biallelic mutations) develop the most severe symptoms.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients often present in early childhood (ie, age 1-4) with features of immune, neurologic, and vascular disease.</p>\n<h2>Immune dysfunction</h2><br><br><p>Patients have <strong>combined B-cell and T- cell immunodeficiency</strong>.</p><br><br><p>Absent ATM kinase activity impairs normal DNA rearrangement in developing T cells, leading to thymic hypoplasia and T-cell immunodeficiency; therefore, patients are susceptible to opportunistic infections (eg, <em>Pneumocystis jiroveci</em> pneumonia).&nbsp; Failure to thrive is common due to chronic diarrhea and increased metabolic needs from recurrent infections.</p><br><br><p>B-cell maturation is also impacted, and patients develop recurrent sinopulmonary infections (eg, otitis media, pneumonia) with encapsulated bacteria (eg, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>) due to deficient opsonizing IgG and mucosal IgA.&nbsp; Peripheral lymphoid tissue (eg, lymph nodes, tonsils) is small/nonpalpable due to lymphopenia.</p>\n<h2>Neurologic disease</h2><br><br><p>Cerebellar degeneration (ie, loss of Purkinge and granule cells) and <strong>progressive cerebellar ataxia</strong> occur due to reduced ATM kinase activity.&nbsp; Gross motor development (eg, walking) is often delayed, and most patients experience fine and gross motor skill regression (ie, loss of previously achieved developmental milestones) in early childhood (ie, age 5).&nbsp; Loss of oral and ocular motor coordination leads to dysarthria and oculomotor apraxia (ie, uncoordinated head and eye movement).</p>\n<h2>Vascular disease</h2><br><br><p>Patients develop nests of dilated capillaries on the bulbar conjunctivae (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L9305.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and exposed skin (eg, face (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L7120.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), neck) after the onset of ataxia (eg, age &gt;3), resulting in <strong>oculocutaneous telangiectasias</strong>.&nbsp; Other skin lesions (eg, hypopigmented macules, melanocytic nevi) are also common.<p></p><br><br><p>In addition to this triad, patients may have <strong>endocrine dysfunction</strong>, which can lead to failure to thrive (also related to immunodeficiency and poor nutrition), delayed puberty, and insulin resistance.&nbsp; Premature aging (eg, skin atrophy, gray hair) due to cumulative DNA damage is also common.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>In cases of suspected ataxia-telangiectasia (ie, young child with progressive ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasis, recurrent infections), laboratory findings include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Alpha-fetoprotein</strong>:&nbsp; Markedly elevated in &gt;90% of patients, and therefore the most consistent laboratory abnormality among patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.&nbsp; The association between elevated alpha-fetoprotein and ataxia-telangiectasia is unknown, and the degree of elevation does not correlate with the severity of symptoms.</li>\n\t<li>Complete blood count:&nbsp; Shows <strong>lymphopenia</strong>, with T-cell lymphopenia more pronounced.</li>\n\t<li>Quantitative immunoglobulin analysis:&nbsp; Shows <strong>decreased immunoglobulin levels</strong>.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Confirmatory genetic testing should be obtained to identify the <em>ATM</em> gene mutation.&nbsp; Patients with severe T-cell deficiency may be recognized on routine newborn screening as having very few T cell receptor excision circles, a test that also screens for severe combined immunodeficiency.</p><br><br><p>Neuroimaging (eg, MRI of the brain) is usually normal at the time of diagnosis but may show cerebellar atrophy in older patients with advanced disease (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L444.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for ataxia-telangiectasia includes other chronic ataxic syndromes, although the combination of ataxia with immunodeficiency and telangiectasias is highly suspicious for ataxia-telangiectasia.&nbsp; A few conditions to consider include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cerebral palsy</strong>:&nbsp; Patients who present with ataxia at a young age (ie, absent ATM kinase) may be mistaken as having cerebral palsy.&nbsp; However, as the patient develops telangiectasias, the diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia becomes more apparent.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Friedreich ataxia</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25967.png\" alt=\"Friedreich ataxia\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">Friedreich ataxia</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Patients with delayed presentation (ie, retained ATM kinase activity) may be mistaken as having Friedreich ataxia, a chronic ataxic syndrome that occurs due to a trinucleotide repeat expansion affecting the mitochondrial protein frataxin.&nbsp; Impaired transport of mitochondrial iron leads to progressive ataxia in adolescence as well as cardiomyopathy, kyphoscoliosis, pes cavus, and glucose intolerance.&nbsp; However, immunodeficiency and telangiectasias are not seen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of ataxia-telangiectasia is multidisciplinary and supportive.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Combined B-cell and T-cell immunodeficiency</strong>:&nbsp; Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (eg, intravenous immunoglobulin) may be indicated for patients with hypogammaglobulinemia.&nbsp; Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered for patients with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, which can contribute to chronic lung disease (see below).&nbsp; Live vaccines are contraindicated, but all other vaccines are encouraged for patients and caregivers.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Progressive cerebellar ataxia</strong>:&nbsp; Physical and occupational therapy can help patients retain as much function as possible, but no therapies exist to delay the progression of disease.&nbsp; Patients with affected oral motor coordination may require a gastrostomy tube to avoid aspiration.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cancer surveillance</strong>:&nbsp; Patients are at increased risk for malignancy, especially hematologic malignancies.&nbsp; Patients should be instructed to seek medical attention for symptoms concerning for malignancy (eg, significant weight loss, persistent leg pain, unexplained fevers, persistent lymphadenopathy), and a low threshold should be observed to undergo further evaluation (eg, complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition to cancer surveillance, patients should be screened for endocrine dysfunction.&nbsp; Growth should be closely monitored, and growth hormone supplementation may be required in patients with poor growth despite optimal nutrition.&nbsp; Patients should be routinely screened for insulin resistance and may require exogenous insulin.&nbsp; In addition, diagnostic imaging that involves ionizing radiation (eg, CT imaging) should be avoided to minimize the risk of malignancy.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for ataxia-telangiectasia is poor due to progressive cerebellar ataxia, which results in severe neurologic disability by adolescence.&nbsp; Leading causes of death include infection and malignancy.&nbsp; Gene therapy is under development and may improve outcomes in the future.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which a mutation in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (<em>ATM</em>) gene for DNA surveillance and repair.&nbsp; Patients develop combined B-cell and T-cell immunodeficiency, progressive cerebellar ataxia, and oculocutaneous telangiectasias.&nbsp; In addition to this triad, patients are at increased risk for malignancy, which is one of the leading cases of death.&nbsp; The prognosis is poor, but early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management can improve quality of life.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
