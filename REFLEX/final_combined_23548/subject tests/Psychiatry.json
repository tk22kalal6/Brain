Although not exclusive to conversion disorder, it is frequently associated with it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConversion disorder, also known as functional neurological symptom disorder or dissociative disorder, involves the sudden and temporary loss of motor or sensory function without any underlying neurological cause. These symptoms often emerge in response to psychological stress or internal conflict, leading to the hypothesis that such conflicts are &ldquo;converted&rdquo; into neurological symptoms. Common presentations include paresis, non-epileptic seizures (NES), blindness, or anesthesia in the limbs. A notable gait disturbance in conversion disorder is astasia-abasia, characterized by a wildly ataxic, staggering gait with irregular trunk movements and erratic arm motions. Despite these dramatic symptoms, the patient may exhibit a nonchalant attitude, as seen with la belle indifference.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn conversion disorder, patients experience a primary gain by keeping internal psychological conflicts out of conscious awareness, which instead manifest as physical symptoms. Additionally, they may achieve secondary gain by being excused from responsibilities and receiving attention or support, which might not have been accessible otherwise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<i><b>Reference</b> : Kaplan and Sadock&rsquo;s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th Edition, Page no 453-456 .</i>",

Acute stimulant intoxication can manifest with symptoms such as agitation, irritability, aggression, and increased psychomotor activity. Physical examination may reveal tachycardia, hypertension, and mydriasis. When stimulants like cocaine cause psychotic symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations, it is classified as stimulant-induced psychotic disorder. Paranoid delusions and hallucinations are key features of stimulant-induced psychosis, with tactile hallucinations like formication specifically associated with cocaine use. The occurrence of these symptoms depends on the dose and duration of drug use, meaning not all patients will experience them.

These binge-eating episodes occur at least once a week and are present for at least 3 months. The patient fears gaining weight and has a relentless drive to be thin, however these patients tend to have normal BMI.<br />\r\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that is often seen between the ages of 10 and 30. Typical features are self-induced starvation, voluntary and unhealthy reduction in weight, intense drive for thinness, and fear of becoming obese.<br />\r\nBinge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder. It is characterized by rapid intake of abnormally large quantities of food over a short period of time, even when not hungry. There are feelings of guilt about the eating episodes, but these patients do not compensate in any way following the episodes of binge.
