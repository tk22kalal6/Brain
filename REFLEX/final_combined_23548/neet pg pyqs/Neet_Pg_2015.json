Maximum absorption occurs in the proximal small intestine because of the following reasons. Surface area: it has a large surface area for absorption due to its extensive folding, villi, and microvilli Length of transit: SI has a relatively long transit time, allowing sufficient contact time between the luminal contents and the absorptive surface Active transport of solutes: The active transport of solutes, such as sodium, across the intestinal epithelium creates an osmotic gradient. This gradient promotes the movement of water from the intestinal lumen into the epithelial cells Aquaporins: It is equipped with specialized water channels called aquaporins, which facilitate the rapid movement of water across the epithelial cells. While the small intestine is the primary site of water absorption, some water absorption also occurs in the large intestine (colon).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p><i>Reference- Ganong&#39;s Review of Medical Physiology Edition 26 th Page no 461</i></p>",

This limits diastolic expansion (filling) which results in a lower EDV (End Diastolic Volume) which reduces stroke volume, a major determinant of systolic blood pressure.</li>\r\n\t<li>The rising central venous pressure is evidenced by distended jugular veins while in a non-supine position. It is caused by reduced diastolic filling of the right ventricle, due to pressure from the adjacent expanding pericardial sac. This results in a backup of fluid into the veins draining into the heart, most notably, the jugular veins. In severe hypovolemia, the neck veins may not be distended.</li>\r\n\t<li>The suppressed heart sounds occur due to the muffling effects of the fluid surrounding the heart.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Clinical use</strong>: Although the full triad is present only in a minority of cases of acute cardiac tamponade, <strong>presence of the triad is considered pathognomonic for the condition.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em><strong>Reference</strong>: Harrison&#39;s Principles of Internal Medicine, 21st edition, Page no 2021.</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;",

This scarring interferes with normal endometrial growth and shedding, resulting in secondary amenorrhea, as observed in this patient. These intrauterine adhesions are referred to as<strong> uterine synechiae or Asherman syndrome.</strong></li>\r\n\t<li>In Asherman syndrome, there is no disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, so follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels remain within the normal range, <strong>typically between 4 and 25 IU/L</strong>, as seen in this patient.</li>\r\n\t<li>In contrast, with pituitary dysfunction, FSH levels are usually decreased. In cases of ovarian dysfunction, the loss of negative feedback from ovarian hormones (such as estrogen) on the pituitary and hypothalamus leads to increased FSH levels, often rising above 25 IU/L</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Asherman syndrome </strong>is characterized by a range of <strong>intrauterine scarring</strong>, which can include thin adhesions, dense bands, or complete obliteration of the uterine cavity. This condition typically results from <strong>endometrial damage</strong> following <strong>aggressive curettage, </strong>often related to miscarriage or elective abortion. It can also arise from other uterine surgeries, such as myomectomy or cesarean delivery, or from infections associated with intrauterine devices.</li>\r\n\t<li>Patients with Asherman syndrome may present with amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, or recurrent pregnancy loss due to inadequate placentation, depending on the extent of the scarring.</li>\r\n\t<li>On hysterosalpingography (HSG) or saline-infusion sonography,<strong> Asherman syndrome is identified by multiple filling defects</strong>.

      "solution": "Metal-on-metal (MoM) articulation is generally avoided in young females for several reasons:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Metal Ion Release: MoM implants can release metal ions, such as cobalt and chromium, into the bloodstream due to wear over time. These ions can accumulate in tissues, potentially causing local soft tissue reactions (metallosis), inflammation, and pseudotumor formation. In young females, the long-term exposure to these ions is a significant concern, particularly given their longer life expectancy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. Reproductive Health Concerns- There are concerns about the effect of metal ions on fertility and pregnancy. Elevated levels of metal ions in the bloodstream may pose a theoretical risk to a developing fetus. This is especially important in younger women who may still want to bear children.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Higher Failure Rates: MoM implants have shown higher revision rates due to mechanical wear, loosening, and tissue reactions compared to other bearing surfaces like ceramic or polyethylene. Given the younger patient&rsquo;s activity level and longer life expectancy, the risk of implant failure becomes more significant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions: MoM implants are associated with adverse local tissue reactions (ALTRs) and osteolysis (bone loss), which can complicate future revision surgeries. Young females are likely to outlive their implants, and having these complications can make future revisions more complex.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause of these risks, other materials like ceramic-on-ceramic or ceramic-on-polyethylene are generally preferred for young female patients.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<i>Reference-: Essential Orthopaedics by Maheshwari Edition 7th Page no 341</i>",
