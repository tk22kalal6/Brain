They usually arise in the<strong> peripheral zone </strong>of the gland. Most patients remain asymptomatic. Early prostate cancer may be found incidentally following TURP for clinically benign disease(T1a and T1b), T1c due to serum PSA screening, and <strong>T2 as a nodule on rectal examination</strong><span><strong>.</strong></span> Symptoms of Advanced cancer include bladder outlet obstruction, pelvic pain and haematuria, bone pain, malaise, joint pain, and anemia. They may present with renal failure. The workup includes a <strong>core biopsy </strong>of the prostate gland(minimum 12 cores) and an<strong> MRI </strong>to evaluate the local extension of the tumor.<strong> PSMA-PET</strong> (prostate-specific membrane antigen- PET) scan should be done to know the distant spread of cancer. </p>\n<p>Prostate cancer most commonly extends locally to the periprostatic tissue, seminal vesicles, and the base of the urinary bladder. Metastasis spreads via the lymphatics to the<strong> obturator nodes </strong>and <strong>the para-aortic nodes</strong>.

These secondary lesions<strong> heal spontaneously</strong> within weeks to months, although relapses can occur. Fever, malaise, and osteitis may accompany this stage. The late tertiary stage is characterized by gummata, most commonly in the skin, bones, and nose. This can lead to bowing of the tibia (Sabre tibia), saddle nose deformities, and destructive lesions of the nasopharynx and palate (Gangosa).</p>\n<p>As the organisms are closely related, serological tests used in syphilis are also employed in yaws. As with T. pallidum, T. pertenue is <strong>non-cultivable by conventional laboratory methods</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>The marked layer 1 is <strong>zona glomerulosa</strong> of the adrenal cortex and the primary hormone secreted by this layer is<strong> Aldosterone</strong>. The correct statements about it are<strong> 1,2,3.</strong></p>\n<p>Aldosterone secretion is <strong>stimulated</strong> by <strong>increased angiotensin II levels</strong> and<strong> increased plasma potassium levels. </strong>It stimulates the<strong> reabsorption of sodium</strong> from the principal cells of the collecting duct by increasing the expression of sodium channels (ENaC) and  Na+-K+ ATPase activity. It also increases the expression of Na+/K+/2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb and the Na+/Cl- symporter in the distal convoluted tubule.(Statement 1)</p>\n<p>The reabsorption of sodium generates an electrochemical gradient that facilitates chloride and water reabsorption. Aldosterone also <strong>stimulates potassium secretion </strong>by the late distal tubule and collecting ducts and <strong>secretion of hydrogen ions</strong> by the intercalated cells of the collecting duct. There is a loss of K+ lon with H+ ion in the urine leading to <strong>increased urinary acidity</strong>. (Statement 2)</p>\n<p>Though Na+ is retained initially, the plasma Na+ remains normal or only slightly elevated if at all, because water is retained with the osmotically active sodium ions. Consequently, ECF volume is expanded and the blood pressure rises. But at a certain point in ECF expansion, there is the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) which causes Na+ excretion despite increased secretion of aldosterone. This phenomenon is called the <strong>aldosterone escape phenomenon</strong>. Due to this, mineralocorticoids <strong>do not </strong>produce <strong>edema</strong> in <strong>normal individuals</strong> and patients with <strong>hyperaldosteronism</strong>. (Statement 5)</p>\n<p>However, the escape may not occur in <strong>certain disease states,</strong> and in these situations, continued expansion of ECF volume can lead to edema.</p>\n<p>Aldosterone secretion is <strong>increased </strong>by <strong>high potassium intake</strong>,<strong> low sodium intake</strong>, <strong>constriction of the inferior vena cava in the thorax</strong>, <strong>standing, and secondary hyperaldosteronism (</strong>in some cases of heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrosis). Standing for &gt;120 minutes leads to a fall in renal perfusion --&gt; increased renin secretion --&gt; increased <strong>Aldosterone</strong> secretion (Statement 3)</p>\n<p>Aldosterone <strong>does not </strong>cause hyperglycemia; this is the effect of <strong>cortisol</strong>, which increases blood glucose through gluconeogenesis. (Statement 4)</p>\n<p>The adrenal cortex consists of three zones. The outermost zone, zone 1, is known as the zona glomerulosa which secrete mineralocorticoids like<strong> aldosterone</strong> and <strong>deoxycorticosterone. </strong>Zone 2 is known as zona fasciculata, which secretes glucocorticoids like<strong> cortisol and corticosterone. </strong>Zone 3 is the<strong> </strong>zona reticularis, and secretes <strong>sex steroids </strong>like <strong>DHEA </strong>and<strong> androstenedione. </strong>The adrenal medulla, represented by zone 4 secretes the <strong>catecholamines epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. </strong>Image showing the histological section of the adrenal gland -</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2a13a9ae514d472ca2deeeb3177c0b85x1279x984.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

The<strong> glottis closes</strong> to prevent aspiration, and <strong>breathing </strong>is <strong>held in mid-inspiration</strong>. <strong>Abdominal muscles contract,</strong> <strong>increasing intraabdominal pressure,</strong> while the<strong> LES and esophagus relax</strong>, allowing gastric contents to be ejected.

The <strong>vomiting center,</strong> located in the <strong>medulla,</strong> receives signals from various sources, such as the gastrointestinal tract, vestibular system, and higher brain centers. It orchestrates the motor responses required for<strong> vomiting </strong>and  CTZ, located in the<strong> area postrema </strong>of the <strong>medulla,</strong> is <strong>sensitive </strong>to <strong>blood-borne toxins </strong>and <strong>drugs.</strong> It communicates with the vomiting center to trigger emesis in response to chemical stimuli.</p>\n<p>Other inputs involved include the<strong> vagus nerve </strong>and <strong>sympathetic nervous system</strong>, which transmit signals from the gut, as well as the <strong>vestibular nuclei </strong>for <strong>motion-induced vomiting.</strong></p>",

The drug of choice for long-term management of panic disorder is <strong>paroxetine, </strong>which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).</p>\n<p>A <strong>panic attack</strong> is an abrupt surge of <strong>intense fear</strong> or intense discomfort lasting from minutes to hours. <strong>Recurrent </strong>and<strong> unexpected panic attacks</strong>, at least one of which is associated with 1 month of either persistent concern or worry about additional attacks, or a change in behavior related to the attacks.</p>\n<p>An attack often begins <strong>with 10 minutes of rapid worsening of symptoms.</strong> This includes an extreme <strong>fear</strong> and a sense of <strong>impending doom</strong> and death along with <strong>tachycardia</strong>, <strong>palpitations</strong>, <strong>dyspnea</strong>, and <strong>sweating</strong>. The attack generally lasts for up to half an hour but in some cases may last for more than an hour. Between attacks, the patient may suffer from anticipatory anxiety about the next attack. </p>\n<p>DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder:</p>\n<p>A. <strong>Recurrent unexpected panic attacks</strong> which include <strong>≥4</strong> of the following </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palpitations</li>\n<li>Trembling</li>\n<li>Sweating</li>\n<li>Dyspnea</li>\n<li>Choking</li>\n<li>Chest pain</li>\n<li>Nausea, abdominal distress</li>\n<li>Chills, heat sensation</li>\n<li>Dizziness, light-headedness</li>\n<li>Paresthesias</li>\n<li>Derealization or depersonalization</li>\n<li>Fear of losing control</li>\n<li>Fear of death</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.

The attack is not attributable to substance abuse or any other medical condition.</p>\n<p>4. The attack cannot be explained by any other mental disorder. </p>\n<p>Treatment</p>\n<p>Presently, <strong>SSRIs</strong> are considered the first-line drugs for the treatment of panic disorder. <strong>Paroxetine</strong> is preferred due to its <strong>sedative</strong> <strong>effects</strong> which calm down patients immediately leading to better compliance. <strong>Citalopram</strong> or <strong>sertraline</strong> are viable alternatives as well. However, for an acute episode with severe symptoms, benzodiazepines like <strong>alprazolam</strong> should be started <strong>concurrently</strong> <strong>with SSRIs</strong> and slowly tapered off. This is because benzodiazepines have the most rapid onset of action. Pharmacotherapy should generally continue for <strong>8-12 months</strong> when it is found to be effective.</p>\n<p>Other than pharmacotherapy, <strong>cognitive</strong> and <strong>behavior therapies</strong> are also very effective treatments for panic disorder. These work especially well when used in combination with pharmacotherapy. These help in producing <strong>long-lasting remissions</strong> of symptoms.</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Alprazolam</strong> is a benzodiazepine with a <strong>high risk of psychological</strong> and <strong>physical</strong> <strong>dependence</strong> if used in the long term. Therefore it is used as an adjunct to SSRIs or psychotherapy and not used as a primary treatment.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Phenelzine</strong> is a <strong>monoamine oxidase</strong> inhibitor. MAOIs may require certain dietary restrictions and hence are used less often.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Imipramine</strong> is a tricyclic anti-depressant that can be used for panic disorder as a second-line drug. TCAs are used less often than SSRIs because they are associated with <strong>more adverse effects</strong> at the dosages required for the treatment of panic disorder. </p>\n<p> </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Anxiety disorders</h3><div>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Disorder&nbsp;</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Feature</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Panic disorder</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>1.

It is characterized by a circumscribed, <strong>smooth patch</strong> of <strong>hair loss</strong>. <strong>Exclamation mark hair strands </strong>are often seen at the margins of the bald patches during active phases of the disease. It is a T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease. It is associated with several autoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis, lupus erythematosus, vitiligo, and psoriasis.  </p>\n<p>It mainly affects the scalp, but can also affect the beard, eyebrows, and eyelashes. In some cases, this progresses to a total loss of <strong>scalp hair (alopecia totalis)</strong> or a loss of all hair on the <strong>body (alopecia universalis)</strong>. It preferentially affects pigmented hair and spares non-pigmented or white hair. This leads to a dramatic change in overall hair color, called going white overnight.  Classically, alopecia areata causes <strong>fine stippled pitting of the nails</strong>, but some cases show less well‐defined roughening of the nail plate (trachyonychia) or non‐specific atrophic dystrophy. </p>\n<p><strong>Intralesional corticosteroids</strong> are the<strong> initial </strong>treatment of choice for <strong>Patchy </strong>alopecia areata. A <strong>depot </strong>steroid (<strong>hydrocortisone </strong>acetate<strong> </strong>25 mg/mL or <strong>triamcinolone</strong> acetonide 5–10 mg/mL), administered by fine-needle injection into the upper subcutis.

      "solution": "<p>The difference in the urine concentrations between the two subjects is due to the presence of <strong>high urea</strong> in subject A, who is a bodybuilder. The <strong>impermeability </strong>of <strong>urea </strong>through the<strong> ascending loop</strong> makes the urine more <strong>concentrated</strong>. Individuals consuming a<strong> high-protein diet</strong>, like bodybuilders, produce <strong>more urea</strong> as <strong>nitrogenous waste </strong>than ordinary individuals. This <strong>increased urea</strong> plays a role in further increasing <strong>urine concentration</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Urea</strong> is <strong>permeable</strong> in the <strong>descending limb</strong> of the loop of Henle and is <strong>impermeable</strong> in the <strong>ascending limb</strong> of the loop of Henle. If this urea is reabsorbed via the descending limb of the loop of Henle without any control, it will result in life-threatening dehydration due to loss of osmolality in the renal medullary interstitium. Therefore, <strong>higher concentration</strong>s of urea in the renal medullary interstitium are maintained by the <strong>Vasa recta</strong>.</p>\n<p>Urea from the interstitium is taken up by the descending limb of the vasa recta, and the urea is given out by the ascending limb of the vasa recta. This ensures that <strong>high concentrations</strong> of urea <strong>remain</strong> in the <strong>medullary interstitium</strong>. This is called the <strong>counter-current</strong> <strong>exchange mechanism</strong>. Also, there is facilitated diffusion of urea from the inner medullary collecting duct into the renal medullary interstitium via specific urea transporters UT-A1 and UT-A3. One of these transporter, <strong>UT-A3</strong> transporter, is activated by <strong>ADH</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Factors</strong> which increase <strong>ADH secretion</strong> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased Osmotic pressure</li>\n<li>Decreased ECF (Extra-cellular fluid) volume</li>\n<li>pain</li>\n<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>\n<li>Angiotensin 2</li>\n<li>SIADH (Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The descending limb of the loop of Henle is more permeable to water and the differential permeability to water is not the reason for the difference in urine osmolality in this case. </p>\n<p>Option C: The clinical stem in the above question has no pointers toward factors that can increase ADH secretion (described above). Note that, increased ADH can increase urine osmolality, but it is not the reason for increased urine osmolality in the given question. </p>\n<p>Option D: In <strong>Central Diabetes Insipidus</strong>, wherein the posterior pituitary fails to produce ADH, and in <strong>Peripheral Diabetes Insipidus</strong>, the kidneys are not able to respond to ADH. In both these cases, low levels of ADH result in poorly diluted urine due to both reduced absorption of free water and inactivation of the<strong> UT-A3 urea transporter</strong>. The question stem does not mention any features of Diabetes Insipidus or low ADH levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Malnourished individuals with <strong>low protein consumption </strong>will have low urea and, hence, <strong>low osmolality urine</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>The given case scenario, with the family pedigree chart showing autosomal dominant inheritance points towards <strong>Huntington’s disease, </strong>and the genetic phenomenon seen here is <strong>anticipation</strong>. Anticipation refers to an earlier onset of disease in successive generations in a pedigree. </p>\n<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a degenerative disease of the striate neurons. It is<strong> </strong>caused by<strong> an autosomal dominant </strong>inheritance of a<strong> trinucleotide repeat (CAG) </strong>in the<strong> </strong>HTT gene located on <strong>chromosome 4</strong>. This results in<strong> </strong>jerky, hyperkinetic movements called <strong>chorea </strong>and<strong> dementia. </strong>It is commonly seen in the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> decades of life. Motor problems (the characteristic chorea) precede dementia. The HTT gene, on chromosome 4 encodes a protein called huntingtin. It has a stretch of <strong>repeats</strong> of the trinucleotide <strong>CAG.</strong> When the number of repeats is increased beyond normal, it is associated with Huntington's disease. More the repeats, earlier is its onset.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1285\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The <strong>caudate</strong> nucleus is dramatically<strong> atrophied</strong>, with accompanying atrophy of the putamen, and cortex. The lateral and 3<sup>rd</sup> ventricles may be dilated. There is a loss of striatal neurons in the caudate nucleus on microscopic examination. The medium-sized, spiny neurons that use GABA as their neurotransmitter, along with enkephalin, dynorphin, and substance P are affected. Protein aggregates containing huntingtin can be seen in the neurons of the striatum and cerebral cortex. <span>The chorea can be treated with dopamine-blocking agents like tetrabenazine.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> </strong>Each mitochondrion contains many copies of mtDNA, where deleterious mutations of mtDNA may affect a few, but not all the copies of mtDNA. Hence, individuals may <strong>harbor both wild-type and mutant mtDNA</strong>. This is known as <strong>heteroplasmy</strong>. Thus, when a cell containing both normal and mutant mtDNA divides, the proportion of the normal and mutant mtDNA in the daughter cells is variable. This explains why the expression of disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations is variable.</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Genetic heterogeneity </strong>refers to the phenomenon where mutations at several <strong>different loci</strong> produce the <strong>same trait</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Variable expressivity</strong> refers to a <strong>similar genotype but a varying phenotype</strong>.

Among the given options, pericardial knock is not a clinical feature of cardiac tamponade. It<strong> </strong>is a sign of constrictive pericarditis. </p>\n<p>Cardiac tamponade is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, leading to the impairment of diastolic relaxation of the cardiac chambers. This leads to a decline in cardiac output. The characteristic signs of cardiac tamponade include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pulsus paradoxus - </strong>This is a paradoxical reduction in the systemic blood pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) on inspiration. In tamponade, the increase in venous return to the right side (during inspiration) of the heart causes the interventricular septum to bow towards the left ventricle (fixed total heart volume), thereby reducing the left heart volume. This leads to a reduction in stroke volume and systemic blood pressure. </li>\n<li><strong>Beck's triad - </strong>This is a triad of findings in tamponade that consists of <strong>hypotension </strong>(90/56 mmHg), <strong>muffled heart sounds, </strong>and <strong>elevated jugular venous pressure. </strong>Features of JVP in tamponade include prominent x descent and absent y descent.<strong> </strong></li>\n<li><strong>ECG - </strong>ECG shows<strong> </strong>reduced voltage and electrical alternans. Electrical alternans is a specific finding caused by the anteroposterior swinging of the heart with each contraction. When the heart is nearer to the chest wall, the amplitude deflection on the ECG is increased; in contrast, when the heart moves away from the chest wall, the amplitude deflection is lower.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1c6c060940e3403eb77355813df0c89ax1280x1090.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Management of cardiac tamponade - In a patient with clinical features suggestive of tamponade, the best course of action is performing <strong>pericardiocentesis, </strong>preferably carried out under echocardiographic guidance. In cases of recurrent tamponade, a small catheter may be left in place to drain subsequent collections of fluid. </p>\n<p>Note - <strong>Constrictive pericarditis </strong>is characterized by a progressive fibrotic change in the pericardium that causes it to thicken and calcify. This leads to impaired cardiac contraction and filling. This gives rise to fatigue, elevated JVP (rapid y descent), ascites, and pulsus paradoxus.</p>\n<p>A notable finding on cardiac auscultation is the <strong>pericardial knock, </strong>which is an early diastolic sound. It is best appreciated over the left sternal border and/or the cardiac apex. It represents early and abrupt discontinuation of ventricular filling. </p>\n<p>ECG findings in constrictive pericarditis consist of non-specific T-wave abnormalities. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of Pulsus Paradoxus</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Physiological causes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Obesity</p>\n<p>Pregnancy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Cardiovascular causes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cardiac tamponade &ndash; most common cause</p>\n<p>Constrictive pericarditis ( in 1/3<sup>rd</sup> cases )</p>\n<p>Massive pulmonary embolism</p>\n<p>Severe CCF</p>\n<p>Hypovolemic shock</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Respiratory causes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Severe obstructive lung disease</p>\n<p>Acute severe asthma</p>\n<p>Severe emphysema</p>\n<p>Tension pneumothorax</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: JVP waveform and the abnormalities</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/18bbe4a977c84587903e8637a0d9303cx1280x1005.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>1) The <strong>a-wave</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial contraction</strong>.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prominent a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Pulmonary hypertension, right atrial thrombus/ mass, and tricuspid stenosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cannon a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Complete AV block, ventricular tachycardia, and premature atrial/ junctional/ ventricular beats</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Atrial fibrillation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) The <strong>c-wave</strong> corresponds to the <strong>bulging of tricuspid valve</strong> into right atrium during ventricular contraction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) The <strong>x-descent</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial relaxation</strong> during atrial diastole.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent x-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Severe tricuspid regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rapid x-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Cardiac tamponade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) The <strong>v-wave</strong> corresponds to the <strong>venous filling</strong> of right atrium.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dominant v-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Tricuspid regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5) The <strong>y-descent</strong> corresponds to the&nbsp;<strong>passive emptying of the right atrium</strong> into right ventricle.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prolonged y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Tricuspid stenosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rapid y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Constrictive pericarditis and isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Cardiac tamponade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "solution": "<p>From the given clinical scenario the likely diagnosis is <strong>tuberculosis verrucosa cutis. </strong>It is caused by exogenous inoculation of <strong><em>M.</em> <em>tuberculosis</em></strong> into the skin through open wounds or abrasions. Lesions appear at the site of inoculation. They appear as <strong>verrucous plaque</strong> which extends with a <strong>serpiginous outline</strong> with <strong>finger‐like projections</strong>. The <strong>center</strong> of the lesion may have a <strong>white atrophic scar.</strong></p>\n<p>It is also known as<strong> anatomist’s warts, prosector’s warts </strong>and <strong>verruca necrogenica. </strong> It occurs in a person who is already sensitized by <strong>previous exposure</strong> to TB. Thus it is a form of <strong>post-primary TB</strong>. Patients having this condition have good immunity against TB. Because of good immunity, they are <strong>effective</strong> in <strong>clearing</strong> the TB bacilli and thus, the lesion is <strong>paucibacillary</strong>. This condition is treated with anti-tubercular drugs. </p>\n<p>Other options- </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option A- <strong>Lupus vulgaris</strong> originates from an underlying focus of tuberculosis, typically in a bone, joint, or lymph node, or maybe from the hematogenous and lymphatic spread. It presents as a <strong>slowly enlarging plaque</strong> with an <strong>elevated border</strong> and <strong>central atrophy</strong>. The edges of the lesion gradually extend in some areas and <strong>heal with scarring</strong> in others. In India, the buttocks, and trunk are more frequently involved. <strong>Apple jelly nodules</strong> are demonstrated on <strong>diascopy.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The below image shows Lupus vulgaris: </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/32adfa20edc84314940a464e684a529ax720x413.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p class=\"p1\">Option C- <strong>Lichen scrofulosorum</strong> is a type of<strong> tuberculid</strong>.

The poison obtained from these seeds is <strong>strychnine.</strong> Strychnine acts at the <strong>ventral horn</strong> by <strong>blocking</strong> the postganglionic <strong>glycine receptor</strong> sites in the <strong>spinal cord </strong>and<strong> brainstem.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Glycine</strong> is an<strong> inhibitory</strong> <strong>neurotransmitter</strong> that acts at the <strong>postsynaptic membranes of ventral horn</strong> motor neurons. Hence, the blockade of these receptors by strychnine results in unopposed muscle contraction, resulting in the classical clinical features.

There is usually <strong>lymphocytic leukocytosis</strong>, <strong>low glucose </strong>concentration, and <strong>elevated levels of proteins</strong>. <strong>Acid-fast bacilli</strong> are <strong>not frequently seen</strong> <strong>on</strong> the <strong>direct smear</strong> of the CSF sediment. <strong>CSF culture</strong> remains the <strong>gold standard</strong> for diagnosis. However, <strong>CB-NAAT</strong> (a type of <strong>nucleic acid amplification</strong> method) is the <strong>initial diagnostic test of choice</strong> because of its <strong>high sensitivity</strong> and <strong>quicker results </strong>compared to culture.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1407\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Imaging studies (CT and MRI) may show <strong>hydrocephalus</strong> and abnormal enhancement of <strong>basal cisterns</strong> or ependyma.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: CSF findings in meningitis</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Glucose&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>(mg/dL)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Protein</strong><br /><strong>(mg/dL)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>WBC (per&nbsp;&mu;L)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Normal</strong></td>\n<td>40-85</td>\n<td>15-45</td>\n<td>\n<p>&lt;5</p>\n<p>60-70% lymphocytes, &le;30% monocytes / macrophages</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bacterial</strong></td>\n<td>&lt;40</td>\n<td>&gt;100</td>\n<td>\n<p>&gt;1000</p>\n<p>&uarr;&uarr;PMNs (&ge;80%)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Viral</strong></td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>20-80</td>\n<td>\n<p>25-500</p>\n<p>Predominantly lymphocytes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tuberculous</strong></td>\n<td>&lt;50 <br />in 75% cases</td>\n<td>100-200</td>\n<td>\n<p>25-100</p>\n<p>Predominantly lymphocytes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fungal</strong></td>\n<td>&darr; to normal</td>\n<td>150-300</td>\n<td>\n<p>40-600</p>\n<p>Lymphocytes or PMNs, depending on specific organism</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Parasitic</strong></td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>50-200&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>150-2000</p>\n<p>&uarr;&uarr; Eosinophils (&ge;50%)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: CNS infections and regions commonly affected</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>INFECTION</strong></td>\n<td><strong>REGION COMMONLY AFFECTED</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tubercular meningitis</td>\n<td>Basal part of the brain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tubercular encephalitis</td>\n<td>Intra parenchymal granulomas</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Meningovascular Neurosyphilis</td>\n<td>Base of the brain and meninges covering the cerebral convexities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paretic neurosyphilis</td>\n<td>Frontal lobe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tabes dorsalis(syphilis)</td>\n<td>Dorsal column of spinal cord</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HSV encephalitis</td>\n<td>Temporal and frontal lobes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Varicella-zoster infection</td>\n<td>Dorsal root ganglia, Trigeminal ganglia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cytomegalovirus</td>\n<td>Choroid plexus and paraventricular subependymal regions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poliomyelitis</td>\n<td>Anterior horn cells of spinal cord</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JC virus</td>\n<td>Oligodendrocytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rabies</td>\n<td>Hippocampus cerebellum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HIV</td>\n<td>Subcortical regions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aspergillosis/ Mucormycosis</td>\n<td>Blood vessel walls, Intraparenchymal abscesses or granulomas</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cryptococcosis</td>\n<td>Intra parenchymal abscesses or granulomas(soap bubble appearance)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Toxoplasmosis</td>\n<td>Cerebral cortex(near grey matter-white matter junction)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cerebral malaria</td>\n<td>Blood vessels of brain</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
