OTC deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder. Clinical manifestations vary in severity from lethargy to encephalopathy and coma.

There is no hyperammonemia, which is seen in OTC deficiency.

Since the PHEX gene is responsible for inactivating FGF-23, there is an increased FGF-23 in XLH. Increased FGF-23 inhibits phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney and causes phosphaturia. It also inhibits 1-α-hydroxylase, leading to decreased production of activated vitamin D.<br><br>Patients with XLH present with clinical features suggestive of rickets such as short stature and genu valgus, genu varum or windswept deformity.

The maximum dose limit for occupational radiation workers is 30 mSv in a year provided the cumulative dose in a block of 5 years does not exceed 100 mSv. <br><br>Acute Radiation Syndromes (ARS) is an acute illness that is caused by exposure of the entire body to a high dose of penetrating radiation in a very short period of time. It is also known as radiation toxicity or radiation sickness. It consists of three syndromes:<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><span class=\"yXiDJXic\">Synd</span><span class=\"QCpdKhYs\">rom</span><span class=\"XjPpjeGM\">e</span>  </strong></td>\n<td><strong><span class=\"EkmvlqPD\">Rad</span><span class=\"eDPGlcIT\">iati</span><span class=\"LReDLaqC\">on</span> <span class=\"QMXdMCEQ\">dose</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"fxJYcxSE\">Hema</span><span class=\"KDawtaYH\">topo</span><span class=\"KDawtaYH\">ie</span><span class=\"lNrOlVwL\">tic</span> <br/><span class=\"vDjpMfvf\">(B</span><span class=\"qlxJTMro\">one</span> <span class=\"VCQQkGVB\">ma</span><span class=\"xBaHjOrb\">rrow</span><span class=\"ichwvjbT\">)</span></td>\n<td> &gt;<span class=\"JtuwIdoC\">0.7</span> <span class=\"qlxJTMro\">Gy</span>  <br/><br/></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"qYIqPiTI\">Gast</span><span class=\"OrsDlzVY\">roin</span><span class=\"bOXfpsGG\">te</span><span class=\"utYynLEp\">st</span><span class=\"oFJjvgtO\">in</span><span class=\"qYIqPiTI\">al</span> </td>\n<td> &gt;<span class=\"bSuzcGJj\">10</span> <span class=\"OrsDlzVY\">Gy</span>  <br/><br/></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"HMrDNMHr\">Card</span><span class=\"LBCwrhWe\">iova</span><span class=\"CnqGQvXs\">scul</span><span class=\"sCvlSkge\">ar/</span> <span class=\"fMTykffL\">Ce</span><span class=\"JtuwIdoC\">ntr</span><span class=\"LAjAVrQI\">al</span> <span class=\"MoUgYhAu\">nerv</span><span class=\"FKEDrIhy\">ous</span> <span class=\"maUwkKyt\">sy</span><span class=\"ovzlTHgP\">stem</span> </td>\n<td> &gt;<span class=\"dadGibMl\">50</span> <span class=\"jzKNrNfU\">Gy</span>  </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Stages of ARS include: <br><br>* Prodromal phase - manifests with non-specific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.

In severe cases, this phase may be absent.<br><br>* Manifest illness phase - symptoms are seen as per the radiation dose.

It is a benign condition but it is locally invasive and it shows the malignant transformation.<br><br>Some of the common sites of endometriosis are ovaries, pelvic peritoneum, pouch of Douglas, uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, and sigmoid colon. <br><br>Patients with endometriosis mainly present with progressively increasing secondary dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, infertility, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain.<br><br>MRI is the diagnostic tool, it shows the characteristic hyperintensity on T1 weighted images and hypointensity on T2 weighted images. Laparoscopy confirms the diagnosis.<br><br>Medical management of endometriosis:<br><br>* Gestrinone is an anti-estrogenic, anti-progestational, and mildly anabolic drug that reduces sex-hormone-binding globulin to release free testosterone. It also decreases the LH surge. It causes regression of lesions and amenorrhea. It is a 19-nortestosterone derivative similar to danazol, but with fewer side effects. <br><br>* Combined oral contraceptives are used for symptom control and alleviating disease. These also cause menstrual cycle regulation and delay pregnancy. <br><br>* Oral progestogens exert an anti-estrogenic effect and cause decidualization and endometrial atrophy. This causes disease regression. It doesn't prevent ovulation, thus is suitable for women who are trying to conceive. <br><br>* Mirena IUCDs reduce dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. It is a single-sitting treatment with minimal side effects. <br><br>* Aromatase inhibitors like letrozole are anti-estrogens given for disease regression. <br><br>* Anti-inflammatory drugs like mefenamic acid and naproxen relieve dysmenorrhea.<br><br>Therapeutic procedures:<br><br>* Aspiration of peritoneal fluid from the cul-de-sac removes PGE2, relieves dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and improves fertility <br><br>* Destruction of endometriotic lesions <3cm with diathermy, Nd-YAG laser, or CO2 vaporization can be attempted. <br><br>* Larger lesions and chocolate cysts can be excised. <br><br>* Laparoscopic breaking of adhesions relieves dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain.

      "solution": "The above mechanism is explained by the Bainbridge reflex.<br><br>Tachycardia, in response to increased venous return, is suggestive of Bainbridge reflex. During inspiration, there is an increased venous return due to reduced intrathoracic pressure. This leads to right atrial distension. The stretch receptors of the atria transmit the afferent signals via the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain. The efferent signals are transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to result in tachycardia and increase the strength of heart contraction. Thus, this reflex helps prevent damming of blood in the veins, atria, and pulmonary circulation.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Bezold–Jarisch reflex: Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibers in the cardiopulmonary region causes profound brady­cardia, hypotension, and a brief period of apnoea followed by rapid shallow breathing. It is seen in cases of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion due to the increased synthesis of oxygen free radicals. <br><br>Option C: Cushing reflex: When there is increased intracranial pressure, the blood supply to Rostral Ventro-Lateral Medulla (RVLM) neurons is compromised. The local hypoxia and hypercapnia cause an increase in discharge from the neurons, producing hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respiration. <br><br>Option D: J reflex: The stimulation of the J-receptors (C receptors/juxta-pulmonary capillary receptors) due to hyperinflation of the lung causes reflex apnea followed by a rapid increase in breathing rate, bradycardia and hypotension.",

These cells are stellate mesenchymal pacemaker cells with smooth muscle-like features. In the stomach and small intestine, they are located in the outer circular muscle layer near the myenteric plexus, in the colon, they are at the submucosal border of the circular muscle layer. The BER is seen in all sites of gastrointestinal smooth muscle except in the esophagus and proximal stomach.<br><br>The rate of BER in various sites is as follows:<br><br>* Stomach: 4/min<br><br>* Duodenum: 12/min<br><br>* Distal ileum: 8/min<br><br>* Cecum: 2/min<br><br>* Sigmoid colon: 6/min<br><br>Spike potentials on BER:<br><br>The BER does not cause contraction of the smooth muscle. However, when the BER is superimposed by the spike potentials, it increases muscle tension. The depolarizing portion of each spike is due to Ca2+ influx, and the repolarizing portion is due to K+ efflux. Important neurotransmitters that affect BER are<br><br>* Acetylcholine causes an increase in the number of spike potentials and muscle tension.<br><br>* Epinephrine causes a decrease in the number of spike potentials and muscle tension.<br><br>The function of the BER is to coordinate peristaltic and other motor activity, such as setting the rhythm of segmentation, contractions can occur only during the depolarizing part of the waves.

In this technique, chromosomes are stained using Giemsa stain. It is the most common technique used in cytogenetics to produce a visible karyotype.<br><br>G banding is based on differential staining of the GC-rich and AT-rich areas of the chromosome. Heterochromatin regions which are AT-rich DNA and relatively gene-poor stain more darkly. Whereas, euchromatin regions that are GC-rich (and more transcriptionally active) incorporate less Giemsa stain and appear as light bands in G-banding. <br><br>The image below shows the G banding of chromosomes.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/36fcbead313f487c82d7117565f4d54cx765x600.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Various techniques are used in karyotyping to study chromosomes. Staining with various compounds produces various results and helps us to understand the chromosomes better.<br><br>Common techniques used are:<br><br>* Q banding - fluorescence staining with quinacrine mustard<br><br>* G banding - Giemsa staining after partial denaturation of chromatin<br><br>* R banding - reverse Giemsa staining.

The staining of these constitutive heterochromatins is done by C-banding using silver salt staining.

Ex: Many countries in South Asia, and Africa are in this phase. <br><br>Stage 3: Late expanding population - There is a further fall in the death rate, with the birth rate beginning to fall. The population is still increasing due to a net increase in births. India has entered this phase.<br><br>Stage 4: Low stationary population - There is a low birth and low death rate, and this can result in a stationary population. It can also result in zero population growth like in Austria (1980-85). Other examples: the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Belgium recorded a growth rate of 0.1 in 1980-85.
