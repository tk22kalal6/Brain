      "solution": "<p><strong>NRG-1</strong> (Neuregulin-1) is not a marker for <strong>gastrointestinal stromal tumors</strong> (GISTs).</p>\n<p><strong>GIST</strong> are the most common <strong>mesenchymal</strong> tumor of the <strong>abdomen,</strong> the <strong>stomach</strong> being the most common site. They arise from the <strong>interstitial cells</strong> of <strong>Cajal,</strong> the pacemaker cells of the GIT. GIST is seen in the <strong>5th</strong> to <strong>6th decade</strong> of life and has an <strong>equal preponderance</strong> among males and females. Most patients present with <strong>haematemesis, melena,</strong> or <strong>vague abdominal</strong> pain. The most common indications for surgery include <strong>bleeding</strong> and <strong>obstruction.</strong></p>\n<p>The GIST may occur in a <strong>sporadic</strong> form or as part of <strong>familial syndromes.</strong> In sporadic GIST, the most common mutations seen are gain-of-function mutation in KIT (75-80%) and PDGFRA mutation (8%). Microscopically, GIST has <strong>elongated spindle cells</strong> or plumper epithelioid cells, or a mixed pattern.</p>\n<p>The below image shows the microscopy of GIST composed of bundles, or fascicles, of spindle-shaped tumor cells.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a9bf9b67e36847358296aa149b9b4ea8x1280x1033.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Succinate dehydrogenase</strong> (SDH)-deficient GIST is a subset of wild-type GIST seen with Carney triad or Carney-Stratakis syndrome. </p>\n<p><strong>Imatinib</strong> can be used to treat GIST with mutations in <strong>KIT</strong> or <strong>PDGFRA.</strong> Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) - deficient GIST is imatinib-resistant, so sunitinib, sorafenib, or regorafenib can be used instead. </p>\n<p>During surgical resection of GIST, care must be taken to prevent capsule rupture, which causes <strong>seeding</strong> of <strong>nearby tissues</strong> leading to <strong>relapse</strong> in <strong>100%</strong> of the <strong>cases.</strong> If capsule rupture occurs, adjuvant therapy with imatinib is indicated regardless of tumor extent.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>KIT (CD117):</strong> This is the most well-known marker for GISTs. About 85% of GISTs show mutations in the KIT gene, leading to the expression of the KIT protein on the cell surface. KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and its activation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of GISTs.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>SDH (Succinate</strong> Dehydrogenase): SDH mutations are associated with a subset of GISTs, particularly those that are KIT and PDGFRA wild-type. Loss of SDH function is characteristic of this subgroup, and SDH deficiency can be demonstrated through immunohistochemistry.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>PDGFRA</strong> (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha): Mutations in the PDGFRA gene account for approximately 5-10% of GISTs. Similar to KIT, PDGFRA is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and mutations in this gene can lead to the development of GISTs.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)</h3><p><strong>M/C mesenchymal tumor</strong> of GIT arising from <strong>interstitial cells of Cajal</strong> (pacemaker cells of GIT). <strong>Stomach is the m/c site.</strong></p>\n<p>GISTs express:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>c-KIT (CD117)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>PDGF receptor A</strong></li>\n<li><strong>CD34</strong></li>\n<li><strong>SDH</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clinical Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peaks at 60 years of age.</li>\n<li>M/C symptom: Upper GI<strong> bleeding</strong></li>\n<li>Other symptoms: Pain, lump, perforation, incidental finding</li>\n<li><strong>Carney's Triad:</strong> Sporadic GIST, Paraganglioma, Pulmonary chondroma</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Management:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IOC for <strong>primary </strong>GIST:<strong> CECT </strong>abdomen</li>\n<li>IOC for <strong>recurrent </strong>GIST:<strong> PET-CT</strong></li>\n<li><strong>IHC </strong>markers: <strong>CD117/C-KIT </strong>(M/C), <strong>DOG 1</strong> (most specific), CD 34</li>\n<li>Route of metastasis: Hematogenous</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following image shows microscopy of GIST composed of spindle-shaped tumor cells:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/303296bfa2ad4afcbbed1a6e4a12a671x1280x1033.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Fletcher's</strong> classification (<strong>Tumor size</strong> &amp; <strong>No. of mitotic figures</strong>) is used to classify the tumors according to their malignancy risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Prognosis</strong> is determined by: Mitotic index, tumor size &amp; location of tumor (Stomach GISTs are less aggressive).</li>\n<li><strong>Complete surgical resection</strong> is the mainstay treatment.

It <strong>accumulates in macrophages</strong> and gets deposited as <strong>needle-shaped crystals</strong> in many tissues including subcutaneous fat. </p>\n<p>Clofazimine is used as a component of multidrug therapy (MDT) for <strong>leprosy</strong>. Because of its <strong>anti-inflammatory</strong> properties, it is valuable in <strong>lepra reactions</strong>. Occasionally, it is used as a component of a combination regimen for extensive drug resistant TB (<strong>XDR-TB</strong>). </p>\n<p>Adverse effects - </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Skin</strong> - The major disadvantage is <strong>reddish-black discoloration</strong> of skin, especially on exposed parts. Discoloration of hair and <strong>body secretions </strong>may also occur. Dryness of the skin, itching and scaling are often troublesome. Acneform eruptions and phototoxicity have been noted. <strong>Conjunctival pigmentation</strong> may create cosmetic problems. </li>\n<li><strong>GI symptoms</strong> - Nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, weight loss and enteritis with intermittent loose stools can occur, particularly when higher doses are used to control lepra reaction. Deposition of clofazimine crystals in the <strong>intestinal submucosa</strong> may produce gastrointestinal symptoms. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clofazimine is to be avoided during early pregnancy and in patients with liver or kidney damage. </p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>Ofloxacin</strong> is a fluroquinolone. As a component of MDT, it has been found to hasten the bacteriological and clinical response, where it is cidal to <em>M.leprae</em>. Its side effects include <strong>nausea</strong>, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. <strong>CNS side effects</strong> like dizziness, anxiety and insomnia are also seen. <strong>Tendinitis</strong> is another adverse effect seen with the use of fluoroquinolones.</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Dapsone </strong>exerts its antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of PABA incorporation into folic acid by <strong>folate synthase</strong>. Apart from being used in leprosy, dapsone is also used for the prophylaxis of <em>T. gondii. </em>The anti-inflammatory effects are the basis for therapy of <strong>dermatitis herpetiformis</strong>, linear immunoglobulin A bullous disease, and relapsing chondritis. Mild <strong>hemolytic anemia</strong> is common, especially in those with <strong>G-6-PD deficiency</strong>. Isolated instances of reversible <strong>peripheral neuropathy</strong>, <strong>drug fever</strong>, hematuria, <strong>pruritus</strong>, psychosis, and a variety of skin rashes have been reported.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Rifampicin</strong> interrupts RNA synthesis by binding to a subunit of mycobacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Apart from being used to treat leprosy, it is used in the management of <strong>tuberculosis</strong>, <strong>brucellosis</strong>, and prophylaxis of <em>Meningococcal</em> meningitis. <strong>Hepatitis</strong> is a major adverse effect. Other side effects include pruritus with rash, <strong>redness </strong>and watering of eyes,<br /><strong>flu-like</strong> symptoms and abdominal cramps. <strong>Urine</strong> and secretions may become <strong>orange-red</strong>.</p>",

Failure of canalization leads to the formation of mucocolpos; this may be recognized in early infancy. However, the anomaly often continues unrecognized until puberty. It presents with <strong>amenorrhoea</strong> in the <strong>presence</strong> of<strong> secondary sexual characters</strong>, <strong>cyclic </strong>abdominal discomfort, <strong>retention </strong>of urine and a <strong>suprapubic bulge</strong> caused by <strong>hematocolpos</strong>. Examination of the external genitalia reveals the presence of a telltale <strong>bluish bulging membrane</strong> in the region of the hymen.</p>\n<p>A simple<strong> cruciate incision </strong>followed by an excision of the hymenal tags allows the drainage of the retained menstrual blood.

The collection of all the primary transcripts synthesized in the nucleus by RNA polymerase II is known as heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). The <strong>pre-mRNA</strong> components of hnRNA undergo extensive co- and <strong>posttranscriptional</strong> modification in the nucleus and become <strong>mature mRNA</strong>. These modifications usually include the following :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Addition of a 5′ cap - </strong>This is the first of the processing reactions for pre-mRNA. The cap is a <strong>7-methylguanosine</strong> attached to the 5′ terminal end of the mRNA and is <strong>resistant</strong> to most nucleases. Creation of the cap requires the removal of the γ-phosphoryl group from the 5′ triphosphate of the pre-mRNA, followed by the addition of guanosine monophosphate. <strong>Methylation </strong>of this terminal G occurs in the cytosol and is catalyzed by guanine- 7-methyltransferase. Additional methylation steps may occur (options A and B).</li>\n<li><strong>Addition of a 3′-poly-A tail -</strong> Most eukaryotic mRNA have a chain of 40 to 250 adenylates (adenosine monophosphates) attached to the 3′ end. This poly-A tail is added by the nuclear enzyme, polyadenylate polymerase. The poly-A tail terminates eukaryotic transcription. In addition, it helps <strong>stabilize</strong> the mRNA, facilitates its exit from the nucleus, and aids in translation. </li>\n<li><strong>Splicing -</strong> Maturation of eukaryotic mRNA usually involves removal from the primary transcript of RNA sequences (<strong>introns</strong>) that do not code for protein (endonuclease cleavage). The remaining coding (expressed) sequences, the <strong>exons</strong>, are <strong>joined together</strong> to form the <strong>mature mRNA</strong>. The process of removing introns and joining exons is called <strong>s</strong>plicing. The molecular complex that accomplishes these tasks is known as the <strong>spliceosome </strong>(option D).</li>\n</ul>",

Patients present commonly by <strong>3-4 months </strong>of age with <strong>hypoglycemia</strong> (leading to <strong>seizures</strong>), <strong>lactic acidosis</strong>, and <strong>hepatomegaly</strong>. Affected children often have a <strong>doll-like face</strong> with fat cheeks, relatively thin extremities, short stature, and a protuberant abdomen due to massive hepatomegaly. The <strong>kidneys</strong> are also enlarged, whereas spleen and heart are not involved. Laboratory findings include hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, <strong>hyperuricemia</strong>, and <strong>hyperlipidemia</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Pompe's disease</strong> (type II glycogen storage disorder) occurs due to a mutation in <strong>alpha-1,4-glucosidase</strong> (also known as <strong>acid maltase</strong>), a lysosomal enzyme. A defect in this enzyme leads to the <strong>accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes </strong>of peripheral, voluntary muscles and progresses to involve the <strong>cardiac muscle</strong> and diaphragm. Clinical features include <strong>hypotonia</strong> (floppy baby syndrome), <strong>cardiomyopathy</strong>, hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive. <strong>Myozyme</strong> can prevent worsening or can reverse cardiac and skeletal abnormalities.</p>\n<p><strong>Cori disease</strong> (type III glycogen storage disorder) occurs due to a deficiency of the <strong>glycogen debranching enzyme</strong>. The features of Cori disease include <strong>hypoglycemia</strong>, <strong>hepatomegaly</strong>, and hyperlipidemia but with normal blood lactate and uric acid levels. Muscle weakness and atrophy can also occur in these patients. Liver biopsy shows the accumulation of glycogen in the form of <strong>limit-dextrins </strong>(branched structures).</p>\n<p><strong>McArdle disease</strong> (type V glycogen storage disorder) typically presents during late childhood or in the second decade of life. The <strong>muscle</strong> <strong>glycogen phosphorylase </strong>enzyme deficiency interferes with <strong>ATP generation</strong> by glycogenolysis in the muscles. This causes muscle glycogen accumulation. Symptoms are <strong>exercise intolerance</strong> associated with <strong>muscle cramps</strong>. This leads to severe muscle damage resulting in a massive release of <strong>myoglobin</strong> in the blood. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Glycogen Storage Diseases</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/782e85c36f0648698a222dca988adfabx1280x1863.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Enzyme deficiency</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type 0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glycogen synthase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Early death</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type Ia</p>\n<p><strong>Von Gierke's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glucose-6- phosphatase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hepatomegaly and renomegaly&nbsp;due to glycogen accumulation</p>\n<p>Severe fasting hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Growth failure</p>\n<p>Lactic acidosis</p>\n<p>Hyperuricemia</p>\n<p>Hyperlipidemia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type Ib</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Endoplasmic reticulum glucose-6- phosphate transporter</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Same as Von Gierke's disease</p>\n<p>Recurrent infections due to impaired neutrophil function</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type II</p>\n<p><strong>Pompe's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lysosomal &alpha;1,4:1,6 glucosidase</p>\n<p>(Acid maltase)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle weakness</p>\n<p>Death by age ~ 2 years (infantile variant)</p>\n<p>Cardiomegaly and heart failure</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type III</p>\n<p><strong>Cori's/Forbes disease</strong></p>\n<p>(Limit dextrinosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glycogen debranching enzyme</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle weakness</p>\n<p>Fasting hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Hepatomegaly due to accumulation of branched-chain polysaccharide (limit dextrins)</p>\n<p>Growth retardation</p>\n<p>Normal lactate and uric acid levels</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type IV</p>\n<p><strong>Andersen disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glycogen branching enzyme</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Failure to thrive</p>\n<p>Hepatomegaly due to accumulation of polysaccharides with few branch points</p>\n<p>Death at age ~ 5 years</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type V</p>\n<p><strong>McArdle disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle glycogen phosphorylase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exercise-induced cramps</p>\n<p>Renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria</p>\n<p>Second wind phenomenon</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type VI</p>\n<p><strong>Her's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Liver glycogen phosphorylase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Generally benign</p>\n<p>Mild hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Hepatomegaly</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type VII</p>\n<p><strong>Tarui's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle phosphofructokinase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exercise-induced muscle cramps and weakness</p>\n<p>Growth retardation</p>\n<p>Hemolytic anemia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "<p>Anaphylaxis is characterised by all of the above features except for hypertension. It causes hypotension.</p>\n<p>Anaphylaxis is a <strong>severe,</strong> potentially <strong>life-threatening allergic reaction</strong> that occurs rapidly and affects the whole body. It is characterized by a sudden release of <strong>histamines</strong> and other chemicals from the <strong>immune system</strong> in response to an <strong>allergen,</strong> such as certain foods, medications, insect stings, or latex. The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to a few hours after exposure to the allergen.</p>\n<p>Clinically, anaphylaxis can present with a combination of symptoms that typically include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Respiratory</strong> Symptoms: Patients often experience wheezing and respiratory distress due to bronchoconstriction. Other signs may include shortness of breath, coughing, and a feeling of tightness in the chest.</li>\n<li><strong>Skin</strong> Symptoms: Urticaria (hives) and angioedema (swelling of the skin and mucous membranes) are common. These skin reactions usually develop rapidly, often within minutes to two hours of exposure to the allergen.</li>\n<li><strong>Cardiovascular</strong> Symptoms: Hypotension (low blood pressure) is a key indicator of anaphylaxis. Patients may also experience tachycardia (increased heart rate) and, in severe cases, shock.</li>\n<li><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> Symptoms: Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps can occur, particularly if the anaphylaxis is triggered by food allergens.</li>\n<li><strong>Neurological</strong> Symptoms: Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness can occur due to the sudden drop in blood pressure and reduced oxygen supply to the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Specific diagnostic <strong>criteria</strong> for anaphylaxis include the presence of <strong>acute</strong> onset <strong>symptoms</strong> involving the <strong>skin, mucosal</strong> tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula), plus <strong>respiratory compromise</strong> (e.g., <strong>dyspnea, wheezing-bronchospasm, stridor,</strong> reduced peak expiratory flow), or <strong>hypotension</strong> or associated symptoms of <strong>end-organ dysfunction</strong> (e.g., hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence). Alternatively, it can be diagnosed if <strong>two or more</strong> of the following occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen: involvement of the <strong>skin-mucosal</strong> tissue, <strong>respiratory</strong> compromise, <strong>hypotension</strong>, or persistent <strong>gastrointestinal</strong> symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt treatment</strong> is critical in <strong>managing anaphylaxis.</strong> The <strong>first-line</strong> treatment is the immediate administration of <strong>intramuscular epinephrine,</strong> which counteracts the effects of histamines and other chemicals released during the reaction. Additional treatments may include <strong>antihistamines, corticosteroids,</strong> and <strong>bronchodilators</strong> to manage symptoms and prevent further complications.</p>\n<p>Patients with a history of <strong>anaphylaxis</strong> are typically advised to carry an <strong>epinephrine auto-injector </strong>at all times and to seek emergency medical care immediately if they experience symptoms of anaphylaxis. Long-term management may involve identifying and avoiding known allergens, as well as potentially undergoing allergen immunotherapy in certain cases.</p>",

An ultrasound can <strong>assess for complications</strong> of gallstones, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) or obstruction of the bile ducts.

M. tuberculosis recruits a host protein <strong>coronin</strong> to block the fusion of phagosome and lysosome. Th1 response to M. tuberculosis is mounted about three weeks following the infection. The antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present mycobacterial antigens to the T-cells in the lymph nodes and release <strong>IL-12</strong> and <strong>IL-18</strong> to cause the differentiation of <strong>T-cells</strong> into <strong>Th1</strong> cells. Th1 cells produce <strong>IFN-γ.</strong> IFN-γ is the critical step in the body's defense against M. tuberculosis.

Proptosis, eyelid retraction, restricted myopathy, and perhaps compressive optic neuropathy are clinical manifestations that could potentially be used for diagnosis.</p>\n<p>The mechanism proposed for this is the acute precipitation of a hypothyroid state which leads to an increase in TSH secretion. This leads to stimulation of the r<strong>etro-orbital fibroblasts and adipocytes</strong> which have the receptor for TSH. </p>\n<p>An <strong>abnormal protrusion of the globe</strong> is called proptosis. Exophthalmometry measures protrusion of the apex of the cornea from the outer orbital margin (with the eyes looking straight ahead). An <strong>absolute protrusion of &gt;20 mm </strong>or a difference of &gt;2 mm between the two eyes is labelled as proptosis.</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Cavernous hemangioma</strong> is the most <strong>common primary benign orbital tumor in adults</strong>. They are composed of large, dilated vascular channels; are more infiltrative; frequently involve deep structures; and do not spontaneously regress. On histologic examination, the mass is sharply delineated but unencapsulated with large, cavernous blood-filled vascular spaces, separated by connective tissue stroma.</p>\n<p>Option B: The type of proptosis seen in orbital varix is <strong>non-pulsatile, intermittent, and reducible proptosi</strong>s. On activities such as forward bending or lowering of the head, turning the head forcefully, hyperextension of the neck, and coughing, the varices fill up, causing proptosis, and then, they regress on shifting to a non-dependent position.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Retinoblastoma </strong>is the <strong>most common intraocular malignancy in children</strong>. It is associated with mutations in the RB1 gene at chromosome 13q14.  White pupillary reflex or leukocoria is the most common presenting feature, followed by a squint which is usually convergent. Histopathology of the tumor shows small round cells with large nuclei. Microscopic features includes Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes(highly specific of retinoblastoma), Homer-Wright rosettes, pseudorosettes, and fleurettes formation.

Therefore, while cardioversion is a treatment option for some patients with AF, it is <strong>not universally indicated</strong> for all cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Atrial fibrillation</strong> (AF) is a <strong>supraventricular tachycardia</strong> caused by ectopic foci or small reentry circuits within the atria. It has an <strong>atrial</strong> rate of <strong>400-600/min</strong> and a <strong>ventricular</strong> rate of <strong>100-160/min.</strong> </p><p>Risk factors for developing AF include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age-</strong> usually above <strong>60</strong> years of age</li>\n<li><strong>Underlying heart</strong> disease</li>\n<li><strong>Hypertension</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Diabetes</strong> mellitus</li>\n<li>Obesity</li>\n<li>Sleep apnea</li>\n<li><strong>Post-cardiac surgery</strong></li>\n<li>Inflammatory pericarditis</li>\n<li><strong>Acute alcohol</strong> consumption</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features include heart rate typically ranges from <strong>110-160</strong> beats/minute.

However, digoxin is not always the first-line treatment for rate control.</p>\n<p>Option D: The difference between the <strong>pulse rate</strong> (PR) and the <strong>heart rate</strong> (HR) can indeed be used to diagnose atrial fibrillation. This discrepancy, known as a pulse deficit, occurs because <strong>not all heartbeats</strong> result in a <strong>palpable pulse</strong> due to the <strong>irregular</strong> and often <strong>rapid ventricular response.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: CHA2DS2-VASC scoring for risk of stroke  & need for oral anticoagulation in AF</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Components</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Points</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>C &ndash; Congestive heart failure</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>H - Hypertension</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A &ndash; Age &gt; 75 years</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>D &ndash; Diabetes Mellitus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>S &ndash; Stroke/TIA/TE</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\">VASc-Vascular disease (prior MI, Peripheral Arterial Disease,</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">or aortic plaque)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;A- Age 65&ndash;74 years</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;S- sex category (i.e., female sex)</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>CHADS2 score</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Antithrombotics </strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Aspirin or no antithrombotics</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Aspirin or oral anticoagulant</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&gt;1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Oral anticoagulant</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

The PDHC is a protein aggregate of multiple copies of three enzymes, <strong>pyruvate decarboxylase</strong> (E1), <strong>dihydrolipoyl transacetylase</strong> (E2), and <strong>dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase</strong> (E3). Each catalyzes a part of the overall reaction.</p>\n<p>A deficiency of the <strong>E1 component</strong> of the PDHC is the most common biochemical cause of <strong>congenital lactic acidosis</strong>. The deficiency results in a decreased ability to convert pyruvate to acetyl CoA, causing pyruvate to be shunted to <strong>lactate</strong> via lactate dehydrogenase. This creates particular problems for the brain, which relies on the TCA cycle for most of its energy and is particularly sensitive to acidosis. Symptoms include <strong>neurodegeneration</strong>, <strong>muscle spasticity</strong>, and, in the neonatal-onset form, early death. The inheritance pattern is <strong>X- linked dominant</strong>, with both males and females affected. Although there is no proven treatment for PDHC deficiency, <strong>dietary restriction of carbohydrates</strong> and supplementation with<strong> thiamine</strong> may reduce symptoms in select patients. </p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase </strong>deficiency results in <strong>maple syrup urine disease</strong>.

Clinically, DHTR presents with symptoms such as a <strong>failure</strong> of <strong>rise</strong> in <strong>hemoglobin</strong> levels despite transfusion, increased levels of <strong>indirect bilirubin,</strong> and <strong>elevated lactate dehydrogenase</strong> (LDH) levels, indicative of <strong>ongoing hemolysis.</strong> While DHTR is generally less severe than acute reactions, it can still cause significant morbidity and necessitates careful monitoring and management.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Blood Transfusion Reactions</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><span><strong>Immunological Transfusion Reactions</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Reaction<br /></strong></span><span><strong>(Onset)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span><strong>Mechanism</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Presentation</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Management</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Anaphylactic transfusion reaction</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>(Seconds-minutes)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Common in<strong> IgA</strong> deficient recipients&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Shock, respiratory distress, angioedema</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Stop transfusion immediately, give epinephrine</p>\n<p><span>Prevention &ndash;

      "solution": "<p>From the given graph is it evident that with anti CD8  the increase in graft survival is negligible compared to the control, however with anti CD4 the graft survival doubles. When anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 are coadministered, the survival becomes four times that of control. From this, it can be inferred that<strong> both CD4 and CD8 cells take part in allograft rejection</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Rejection</strong> is a process in which <strong>T lymphocytes</strong> and <strong>antibodies</strong> produced against graft antigens react against and destroy tissue grafts. The major antigenic differences between a donor and recipient that result in the rejection of transplants are differences in <strong>HLA alleles</strong>. Following transplantation, the recipient’s T cells recognize donor HLA antigens from the graft by two pathways. The graft antigens are either presented directly to recipient T cells by graft antigen-presenting cells (APCs), or the graft antigens are picked up by host APCs, processed, and presented to host T cells. These are called the <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>indirect</strong> pathways of recognition of alloantigens. Both lead to the activation of <strong>CD8+ T cells</strong>, which develop into <strong>cytotoxic T lymphocytes</strong> and <strong>CD4+ T cells</strong>, which become cytokine-producing effector cells, mainly <strong>Th1 cells</strong>. </p>\n<p>Graft rejection is classified into hyperacute, acute, and chronic, based on clinical and pathologic features : </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hyperacute rejection</strong> is mediated by <strong>preformed antibodies</strong> specific for antigens on <strong>graft endothelial</strong> cells. </li>\n<li><strong>Acute rejection</strong> is mediated by <strong>T cells</strong> and antibodies that are activated by alloantigens in the graft. </li>\n<li><strong>Chronic rejection</strong> is an indolent form of graft damage that occurs over months or years, leading to progressive loss of graft function. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Methods of increasing graft survival :</p>\n<p>In<strong> kidney</strong> transplants, there is substantial benefit if all the polymorphic <strong>HLA alleles</strong> are <strong>matched</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>The depth of compression should be <strong>at least 5cm</strong> to ensure high-quality CPR in an adult cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p>The foundation of CPR is <strong>high-quality chest compressions</strong>. Compressing the chest pumps blood <strong>from the heart to the brain </strong>and then to the rest of the body. Each time the compressions are stopped, the blood flow from the heart decreases significantly. Once resumed, it takes several compressions to bring the blood flow back up to the levels present before the interruption.</p>\n<p>The <strong>components </strong>of high-quality chest compressions in adults are as follows :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Position victim</strong> - Position the victim face up on a <strong>firm, flat surface</strong>. This allows compression of the heart to create adequate blood flow.</li>\n<li><strong>Compression-to-ventilation ratio</strong> - <strong>Single rescuers </strong>should use the compression-to-ventilation ratio of <strong>30 compressions to 2 breaths </strong>when giving CPR to victims of any age.</li>\n<li><strong>Compression rate</strong> - Compress at a rate of <strong>100 to 120/min</strong>. This rate is the same for compression in all cardiac arrest victims.</li>\n<li><strong>Compression depth</strong> - Compress the chest <strong>at least 5cm</strong>. Compressing the chest more than 6 cm in adults may decrease the effectiveness of the compression and cause injuries. Using a CPR-quality feedback device can help reach the optimal depth.</li>\n<li><strong>Chest recoil</strong> - Allow the chest to <strong>recoil completely </strong>after each compression. This allows blood to flow into the heart. To help ensure complete recoil, <strong>avoid leaning</strong> on the chest between compressions. Chest compression and chest reoil times should be about equal.</li>\n<li><strong>Interruptions in chest compressions</strong> - Minimize interruptions in chest compression. the proportion of time that rescuers perform chest compressions during CPR is called chest compression fraction (CCF).

      "solution": "<p><strong>Ultrasound contrast agents</strong> are gas-filled microbubbles that are administered intravenously to the systemic circulation. Hence, considered as low risk in patients with renal impairment.</p>\n<p>Ultrasound contrast agents are used to enhance the visibility of blood vessels, organs, and tissues during ultrasound imaging. These agents typically consist of tiny <strong>gas-filled microbubbles</strong> encapsulated within a shell. When injected intravenously, they flow through the bloodstream and resonate in response to ultrasound waves, producing strong echoes that enhance the ultrasound image.</p>\n<p><strong>Perflutren/Optison </strong>is an ultrasound contrast agent. <strong>Levovist </strong>(consisting of galactose microparticles, air bubbles, and palmitic acid) is another example of an ultrasound contrast agent. Sulfur hexafluoride with a phospholipid shell is also used as an ultrasound contrast agent.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Gadolinium contrast</strong> used in MRI is predominantly excreted through the kidney. In renal failure, it gets accumulated in the body and releases gadolinium ions. Since the ion is toxic, the body tries to contain it by fibrosis resulting in multisystem painful fibrosis called <strong>nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Iodinated ionic contrast agents</strong> increase the risk of <strong>Contrast-induced nephropathy(CIN)</strong>. Hence alternative imaging methods, without iodinated contrast media, should be chosen in patients with considerably impaired renal function (CKD 4 or 5).</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Non-ionic contrast agents</strong> have a lower risk of causing adverse reactions compared to ionic contrast agents. They are generally <strong>better tolerated</strong> by patients, with fewer incidences of allergic reactions and nephrotoxicity.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate</strong> are antidotes used to treat cyanide toxicity.</p>\n<p>Cyanide acts by inhibiting the activity of enzyme systems like <strong>cytochrome oxidase</strong> and <strong>carbonic anhydrase.</strong> It inhibits the<strong> final step of oxidative phosphorylation,</strong> preventing the synthesis of ATP and its usage as an energy source. Cyanide <strong>reduces the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity </strong>and combines with the ferric iron atom of intracellular cytochrome oxidase, inhibiting oxygen intake for cellular respiration. </p>\n<p>Treatment primarily aims at <strong>reversing the cyanide-cytochrome combination </strong>by providing nitrites which convert haemoglobin to <strong>methaemoglobin.</strong></p>\n<p>Cyanides combine with methaemoglobin to produce <strong>non-toxic cyanmethaemoglobin</strong>, which, in the presence of rhodanase and sulphate donors such as <strong>thiosulphate,</strong> transforms cyanide to <strong>thiocyanate,</strong> which is <strong>eliminated in the urine.</strong></p>\n<p>The Cyanide kit contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>21 <strong>amyl nitrite </strong>pearls</li>\n<li>Two 10 ml vials of <strong>3% sodium nitrite </strong></li>\n<li>Two 50 ml vials of <strong>sodium thiosulphate.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using a handkerchief, a <strong>0.2 ml ampoule of amyl nitrite</strong> is broken and held over the patient's nose for <strong>15 to 30 seconds</strong> of every minute, until sodium nitrite infusion is started.</p>\n<p>IV administration of <strong>0.3 g of sodium nitrite in 10 ml of sterile water</strong> is given slowly over a <strong>5-minute interval</strong>. Sodium nitrite forms methaemoglobin (Hb-Fe2+), then competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion, thus protecting cytochrome oxidase. Folllowing this, <strong>25 g of sodium thiosulphate in 50% solution</strong> is given i.v. over a period of 10 minutes. It converts cyanide to <strong>non-toxic thiocyanate,</strong> which is excreted in urine.</p>\n<p>Other antidotes such as Hydroxocobalamin (Vit B12) and Dicobalt EDTA can also be used. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Specific antidotes for poisoning</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ANTIDOTE</strong></td>\n<td><strong>POISONING</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4-methyl pyrazole</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>100% oxygen </strong></td>\n<td>Carbon monoxide, cyanide, methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ammonium chloride </strong></td>\n<td>Phencyclidine, amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Amyl nitrate </strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide, hydrogen sulphide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Atropine</strong></td>\n<td>Carbamate and organophosphorus poisoning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bupropion</strong></td>\n<td>Nicotine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium disodium edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, magnesium, nickel, uranium, zinc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium gluconate </strong></td>\n<td>Precipitates fluorides, magnesium and oxalates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Chlorpromazine</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Deferoxamine</strong></td>\n<td>Iron, aluminium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diazepam</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine, chloroquine, alcohol withdrawal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dicobalt edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dimercaprol (BAL)</strong></td>\n<td>Antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and gold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diphenhydramine</strong></td>\n<td>Phenothiazines and related drugs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disodium calcium edetate</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMPS *, (Unithiol)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Mercury</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMSA ** </strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>D-Penicillamine (Cuprimine) </strong></td>\n<td>Copper, lead, mercury, chromate, nickel, zinc, arsenic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ethanol</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fab fragment</strong></td>\n<td>Digoxin, digitoxin, oleander tea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Flumazenil</strong></td>\n<td>Benzodiazepine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Glucagon</strong></td>\n<td>Propranolol and other beta-blockers toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hydroxocobalamin</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Labetalol hydrochloride</strong></td>\n<td>Hypertensive crisis due to cocaine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methionine</strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methylene blue</strong></td>\n<td>Methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>N-acetylcysteine </strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol, acetaminophen toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nalorphine</strong></td>\n<td>Morphine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Naloxone (Naltrexone)</strong></td>\n<td>Narcotic, opiates, CNS depressants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nicotinamide</strong></td>\n<td>Vacor poisoning, phenylurea pesticide toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pancuronium bromide</strong></td>\n<td>Neuromuscular blocking agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Penicillamine</strong></td>\n<td>Copper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Physostigmine salicylate </strong></td>\n<td>Coma, convulsions from anticholinergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pralidoxime (2-PAM) </strong></td>\n<td>Organophosphorus insecticides, nerve agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Propranolol</strong></td>\n<td>Cocaine intoxication, beta adrenergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Protamine sulphate </strong></td>\n<td>Heparin overdose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prussian blue</strong></td>\n<td>Thallium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pyridoxine (Vit.

It is associated with states of <strong>chronic inflammation</strong> due to either autoimmune diseases (<strong>Sjögren’s syndrome</strong> or <strong>Hashimoto’s thyroiditis</strong>) or chronic infections with organisms like <em>H. pylori </em>(<strong>gastric</strong>), <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> (<strong>skin</strong>), <em>C. psittaci</em> (<strong>conjunctiva</strong>), <em>C. jejuni</em> (<strong>intestines</strong>), and <strong>hepatitis C </strong>virus.</p>\n<p>The essential pathologic feature of MALT lymphoma is the presence of lymphoepithelial lesions, which result from the invasion of mucosal glands and crypts by the neoplastic lymphocytes. These cells are positive for <strong>CD19</strong>, <strong>CD20</strong>, and CD79a and negative for CD5 and CD10. Recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities include<strong> t(11;18)</strong>, t(14;18), t(1;14), t(3;14), and trisomy 8. The t(11;18) is most common, occurring in up to 50% of MALT lymphomas.</p>\n<p>Unlike other indolent B-cell lymphomas, MALT lymphomas present most commonly with stage I or II disease.

It involves mainly the <strong>proximal small intestine</strong>, resulting in <strong>malabsorption</strong>, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. IPSID is associated with <strong>excessive plasma cell differentiation</strong> and produces <strong>truncated alpha heavy chain</strong> proteins lacking the light chains. Early-stage IPSID responds to <strong>antibiotics </strong>(30–70% complete remission).

      "solution": "<p><strong>Myelodysplastic syndrome</strong> (MDS) is more commonly seen in <strong>males</strong> than females.</p>\n<p>The MDS is a heterogeneous group of hematologic disorders characterized by both <strong>cytopenias </strong>due to bone marrow failure and a high risk of development of <strong>acute myeloid leukemia</strong>. Anemia due to <strong>ineffective erythropoiesis</strong>, often with <strong>thrombocytopenia</strong> and <strong>neutropenia</strong>, is seen.</p>\n<p>MDS is a disease of the elderly; the mean age at onset is older than <strong>70 years </strong>(option C). There is a slight <strong>male</strong> predominance (option A). <strong>Secondary</strong> or <strong>therapy-related </strong>MDS is <strong>not age-related </strong>(option B). It occurs as a late toxicity of cancer treatment; <strong>radiation </strong>(option D) and the radiomimetic <strong>alkylating agents</strong> such as busulfan, nitrosourea, or procarbazine (with a latent period of 5–7 years); or the <strong>DNA topoisomerase inhibitors</strong> (2-year latency). Acquired <strong>aplastic anemia</strong>, <strong>Fanconi anemia</strong>, and other constitutional marrow failure diseases can evolve into MDS.</p>\n<p><strong>Anemia</strong> dominates the early course. Most symptomatic patients complain of the gradual onset of fatigue and weakness, dyspnea, and pallor. <strong>Platelets</strong> also are <strong>large</strong> and lack granules. In functional studies, they may show marked abnormalities, and patients may have bleeding symptoms despite seemingly adequate numbers. Neutrophils are <strong>hypo-granulated</strong>; have <strong>ringed</strong>, or abnormally segmented nuclei; contain <strong>Döhle bodies</strong>; and may be functionally deficient. Circulating <strong>myeloblasts</strong> usually correlate with marrow blast numbers, and their quantity is important for <strong>classification</strong> and <strong>prognosis</strong>. </p>\n<p>The <strong>bone marrow</strong> is usually <strong>normal</strong> or <strong>hypercellular</strong>, but in about 20% of cases, it is sufficiently hypocellular to lead to confusion with aplastic anemia. The following are commonly observed: dyserythropoietic changes (especially nuclear abnormalities) and <strong>ringed sideroblasts</strong> in the erythroid lineage; hypogranulation and <strong>hyposegmentation </strong>in granulocytic precursors, with an increase in myeloblasts; and megakaryocytes showing reduced numbers of or disorganized nuclei. </p>\n<p>Only <strong>hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</strong> offers a cure for MDS. The hypomethylating agents <strong>azacitidine</strong> and <strong>decitabine</strong> are frequently used in bone marrow failure clinics. <strong>Lenalidomide</strong>, a thalidomide derivative with a more favorable toxicity profile, is particularly effective in reversing anemia in MDS patients with 5q– syndrome.</p><p><strong>Luspatercept</strong>, which affects transforming growth factor β - mediated suppression of erythropoiesis, has been approved by the FDA for anemia in MDS. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Bone Marrow Changes in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)</h3><p>The myelodysplastic syndrome can lead to dysplasia of the erythroid series, myeloid series, and megakaryocytes.</p>\n<p>Dysplasia of erythroid series:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Megaloblastoid maturation&nbsp;</strong>- Abnormally large erythroid cells</li>\n<li><strong>Nuclear budding abnormalities&nbsp;</strong>- Nucleus with abnormal shape</li>\n<li><strong>Ring sideroblasts&nbsp;</strong>- Erythroblasts with stainable iron in the cytoplasm&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5a79f916cf5b46d2a1ad0f781dddef8dx798x599.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dysplasia of myeloid series:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Neutrophils with a decreased number of secondary granules</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pseudo-Pelger-Hüet cells</strong>- neutrophils with only <strong>two nuclear lobes</strong></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8fff2b32c6624e1da540ca3d292db163x359x512.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dysplasia of the megakaryocytes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\">Megakaryocyte with single nuclear lobe</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pawn ball megakaryocytes</strong>- cells with multiple separate nuclei</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/bc059ad7c9c0487cad202d46105ccdafx512x465.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>If only one lineage is affected, then it is called single lineage dysplasia.
