There is rapid and irregular atrial activation which is transmitted through the atrioventricular node. The conducted ventricular rate is usually rapid and <strong>irregularly irregular</strong>. It can vary from <strong>110-160</strong> beats/minute. A <strong>pulse deficit</strong> is an important clinical finding associated with the condition.

The latter is done by intravenous administration of class III antiarrhythmic - <strong>ibutilide</strong>. In a stable patient, <strong>ventricular rate control</strong> is the primary aim. This is done by intravenous or oral administration of <strong>beta-blockers</strong>. <strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong> such as verapamil and diltiazem can also be used. </p>\n<p>If the current episode duration is <strong>&gt;48 hours</strong>, cardioversion can precipitate thromboembolic complications. In such cases, cardioversion should be carried out only after <strong>3 weeks</strong> of anticoagulation. It has to be continued for 4 weeks after cardioversion. Another option is to evaluate the presence of a thrombus in the left atrial appendage. This can be done either by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or high-resolution CT.</p>\n<p>If the duration is &lt;48 hours and there are no high-risk factors, cardioversion can be done. <strong>The CHA2DS2-VASc</strong> scoring system is used to assess stroke risk. </p>\n<p><strong>Warfarin</strong> is recommended in patients with rheumatic<strong> mitral stenosis</strong> or mechanical heart valves who present with atrial fibrillation.

The psychiatrist should start her on <strong>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRI).</strong></p>\n<p>BDD is characterized by <strong>persistent preoccupations</strong> about one or more <strong>perceived defects </strong>or <strong>flaws</strong> in<strong> one’s appearance,</strong> but the defects or flaws are negligible or not even observable to others. In response to their appearance concerns, individuals with BDD demonstrate a range of mental acts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comparing themselves with others</li>\n<li><strong>Checking</strong> in the mirror</li>\n<li>Camouflaging their perceived flaws</li>\n<li>Avoidance- from minor social avoidance to being housebound.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>specific focus </strong>of BDD <strong>on appearance </strong>serves to differentiate it from other conditions characterized by repetitive behaviours.</p>\n<p>The treatment for BDD typically involves a combination of <strong>SSRIs</strong> and <strong>psychotherapy</strong>. SSRIs, such as <strong>fluoxetine</strong> and <strong>clomipramine</strong>, have been shown to reduce symptoms in many patients, helping <strong>alleviate</strong> the <strong>obsessive thoughts</strong> and <strong>anxiety</strong> associated with BDD.</p>\n<p>Psychotherapy, particularly <strong>cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)</strong>, is crucial as it addresses the distorted self-image and underlying emotional issues. CBT helps patients reframe their thoughts about appearance and develop healthier coping strategies.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that while <strong>surgical interventions</strong> may be sought by patients, they are often<strong> ineffective</strong> and can lead to further dissatisfaction and distress. Therefore, focusing on mental health treatment is essential. Regular follow-ups and a supportive therapeutic relationship can significantly enhance the effectiveness of treatment.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Start on atypical antipsychotics:</strong> Antipsychotics are generally not the first-line treatment for BDD. They may be considered in cases with comorbid psychotic symptoms, but this patient does not exhibit hallucinations or delusions.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Give fitness for surgery: </strong>Giving fitness for surgery would be inappropriate and potentially harmful. Surgery is not the solution for BDD, as patients typically remain dissatisfied with the results and continue seeking more surgeries.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Initiate insight-oriented psychotherapy: </strong>While psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is effective for BDD, insight-oriented psychotherapy (focused on understanding unconscious conflicts) is less effective than targeted approaches like CBT in managing this condition.</p>",

Beta-blockers are first-line therapy for rate control for Atrial fibrillation in patients without acute heart failure.</p>\n<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular tachycardia caused by ectopic foci or small reentry circuits within the atria. It has an <strong>atrial rate </strong>of <strong>400-600/min</strong> and a <strong>ventricular rate</strong> of <strong>100-160/min</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Risk factors</strong> for developing AF include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age</strong>- usually above <strong>60</strong> years of age</li>\n<li><strong>Underlying heart disease</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Hypertension</strong></li>\n<li>Diabetes mellitus</li>\n<li>Obesity</li>\n<li>Sleep apnea</li>\n<li>Post-cardiac surgery</li>\n<li>Inflammatory pericarditis</li>\n<li><strong>Acute alcohol consumptio</strong>n. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features include heart rate typically ranging from <strong>110-160 beats/minute</strong>.

Reversion to sinus rhythm can be done electrically or using medications.

It is present in fruit sprays, copper and gold <strong>mineral deposits</strong>, weed killers, insecticides, rat poisons, wallpapers, and artificial flowers.</p>\n<p>There are several types of arsenic poisoning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fulminant</strong> - When massive doses are rapidly absorbed, death occurs in 1–3 hours due to shock and peripheral vascular failure.</li>\n<li><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> - This is the most common form of acute poisoning and resembles <strong>bacterial food poisoning.</strong> There is a constriction in the throat and difficulty in swallowing. The stools are dark-colored, foul smelling, and bloody initially and later take a colorless odorless watery form similar to the rice-water stools of cholera.</li>\n<li><strong>Chronic </strong>poisoning - It occurs due to repeated daily exposure. The main features include <strong>finely mottled, raindrop pigmentation</strong> that appears on the skin of flexures, temples, eyelids, and neck.

In <strong>marasmus</strong>, patients exhibit <strong>dry, wrinkled skin</strong>, <strong>slow-growing brittle hair,</strong> and <strong>nails</strong>, often accompanied by growth retardation.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Acute copper poisoning</strong> is due to inhalation of a large amount of copper dust or fumes, which leads to <strong>upper respiratory tract irritation</strong>, conjunctivitis, and sinus irritation.

The majority of the cases <strong>persist</strong> into adult life. The hyperactivity may sometimes disappear, but the <strong>decreased attention span</strong> and <strong>impulse-control problems</strong> usually <strong>persist</strong>. Patients with ADHD are vulnerable to <strong>conduct disorder</strong>, <strong>antisocial behaviour</strong>, substance use disorders, and mood disorders.</p>\n<p>ADHD is a <strong>neuro­ psychiatric condition</strong> characterized by a pattern of <strong>diminished attention span and increased impulsivity or hyperactivity. </strong>The <strong>prefrontal cortex</strong> of the brain has been implicated in its etiology and <strong>dopamine</strong> is the main neurotransmitter. </p>\n<p>ADHD can begin during <strong>infancy</strong> but is usually rec­ognized between <strong>1-3 years</strong> of age. ADHD was known as minimal brain dysfunction earlier. The characteristics of children with ADHD, in order of frequency, are</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hyperactivity</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Attention deficit</strong> (short attention span, distractibility)</li>\n<li><strong>Impulsivity</strong> (action before thought, abrupt shifts in activity, lack of organization)</li>\n<li>Memory and thinking deficits</li>\n<li>Specific learning disabilities</li>\n<li>Speech and hearing deficits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to <strong>DSM-5 </strong>criteria, a diagnosis of ADHD requires symptoms to be present <strong>before age 12</strong>, persist for at least <strong>six months</strong>, <strong>negatively impact</strong> social, academic, or occupational activities, and occur in two or more settings. <strong>Pharmacotherapy</strong> is the<strong> first-line treatment</strong>, with CNS stimulants like <strong>methylphenidate</strong> and <strong>amphetamine</strong> salts being the most effective due to their mild side effects. Non-stimulant options include atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine. Additionally, <strong>psychosocial interventions</strong>—such as academic organization skills, parent training, behaviour modification, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and social skills training—are used as adjuncts to medication.</p>\n<p><span>Note: <strong>Conduct disorder</strong> is characterized by a <strong>persistent pattern</strong> of <strong>behaviour</strong> that violates the basic rights of others and <strong>disregards societal rules</strong>. The severity of the behaviours can lead to emergencies, especially if they are alarming to parents. Individuals with severe and chronic symptoms may later be diagnosed with <strong>antisocial personality disorder</strong> after age 18. Treatment typically involves <strong>behaviour modification </strong>strategies and, if necessary, placement in a corrective institution.</span></p>\n<p><span>Other options:</span></p>\n<p><span>Option A: <strong>Selective mutism</strong> refers to the <strong>lack of speaking</strong> (being mute) in one or <strong>more specific social situations</strong>, commonly in school, but speaking well in other situations, commonly at home. The child may be either <strong>completely silent</strong> at school or maybe just <strong>whispering</strong>. Rarely, a child may be silent at home but communicate normally at school.</span></p>\n<p><span>Option B: <strong>Separation anxiety disorder</strong> is characterized by <strong>developmentally inappro­priate</strong> and <strong>excessive anxiety</strong> when the patient is separated from their attachment figure. It is a normal developmental phenomenon in infants. It peaks between <strong>9 months </strong>and 18 months and usually <strong>diminishes</strong> by <strong>two and a half years of age</strong>. </span></p>\n<p><span>Option D: <strong>Binge-eating disorder</strong> is the <strong>most common eating disorder</strong>. It is characterized by <strong>rapid intake</strong> of abnormally <strong>large quantities</strong> of food over a short period of time, even when not hungry. There are feelings of <strong>guilt</strong> about the eating episodes, but these patients do not compensate in any way following the episodes of binge.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>",

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario of a patient with <strong>hypertension </strong>and <strong>diabetes,</strong> and <strong>frontal bossing</strong>, <strong>thick palms </strong>and <strong>soles</strong>, and <strong>gaping of central incisors</strong> is suggestive of <strong>acromegaly</strong>. <strong>Age-specific IGF-1 levels are used as a screening test in this condition.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The confirmation o</strong>f acromegaly is done by administering <strong>75g of oral glucose l</strong>oad to the patient<strong>. </strong>Normally, GH should be<strong> suppressed to less than 0.4 ug/L </strong>after the oral glucose load<strong>. A failure of suppression of growth hormone confirms the diagnosis of acromegaly.</strong></p>\n<p>Acromegaly is a result of <strong>growth hormone hypersecretion</strong> due to a <strong>pituitary adenoma</strong>. It can also occur due to extra pituitary lesions. If growth hormone hypersecretion occurs before the fusion of the growth plates at puberty, it leads to<strong> gigantism</strong>.</p>\n<p>Acral bony overgrowth in acromegaly manifests as <strong>frontal bossing</strong>, <strong>increased hand and foot size</strong>, <strong>mandibular enlargement</strong>, prognathism, and widened space between incisors. Soft tissue swelling results in <strong>increased heel pad thickness</strong>, coarse facial features, and a large fleshy nose. Generalized visceromegaly is seen including <strong>cardiomegaly</strong>, <strong>macroglossia</strong>, thyroid enlargement, etc. Serious complications include <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong>, <strong>obstructive sleep apnoea</strong>, and increased risk of <strong>colonic polyps</strong> and cancer.</p>\n<p>The physiological<strong> actions of the growth hormone</strong> are mostly <strong>mediated through IGF-1</strong>, which is synthesized in the liver. Since the growth hormone is released in a pulsatile manner, serum IGF-1 levels are usually measured to assess growth hormone activity. Serum <strong>IGF-1</strong> level is<strong> decreased</strong> in <strong>pituitary failure</strong>, defect or blockade of GH receptor. Since the low-calorie state is associated with growth hormone resistance, IGF-1 is also decreased in conditions such as <strong>cachexia</strong>, <strong>malnutrition</strong>, and <strong>sepsis</strong>. Serum IGF-1 level is <strong>increased </strong>in <strong>acromegaly.</strong></p>\n<p>Acromegaly can be treated by<strong> transsphenoidal resection </strong>of the tumor<strong>. </strong>It can also be managed medically by using<strong> octreotide (a somatostatin analog), pegvisomant (Growth Hormone receptor antagonist),</strong> dopamine agonists,<strong> </strong>or<strong> radiation.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: A f<strong>ailure of suppression</strong> to <strong>&lt;0.4ng/ml</strong> using ultrasensitive assays or to <strong>&lt;1ng/ml</strong> using standard assays after an oral glucose load is used as a <strong>confirmatory test.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: Since the <strong>growth hormone </strong>is released in a <strong>pulsatile</strong> <strong>manner</strong>, measurements of a single GH level are not used in the diagnosis of acromegaly.</p>\n<p>Option D: Though, <strong>GH levels &gt; 40 ng/ml</strong> indicate <strong>poor prognosis</strong> but it is <strong>not </strong>routinely done to assess the severity of acromegaly. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Tests for Acromegaly</h3><p><strong>Screening test</strong>:</p>\n<p>The <strong>single</strong>&nbsp;best test for the diagnosis of acromegaly is the measurement of serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (<strong>IGF-1</strong>).

The image is that of septal perforation; <strong>SMR</strong> (Submucosal resection ) has a higher likelihood of causing the same. </p>\n<p><strong>Septal perforation</strong> can occur after nasal surgery. Features depend on the size of the perforation. Smaller perforations can present with whistling while the larger perforations will present with epistaxis and crust formation. Therefore, <strong>septoplasty</strong> has become a more favored treatment of DNS than SMR due to its conservative approach. </p>\n<p><strong>Septoplasty</strong> is a <strong>conservative</strong> technique in the surgical correction of septal deformity. The key advantage is that it can be carried out as a daycare procedure, most of the bone and cartilage are retained, and complications are less. The deformed septum may corrected by various techniques like scoring the concave side, shaving, and wedge excision. Sometimes realignment by joining straight pieces of the septum outside the nose and replacing them can be done which is called extra-corporeal septoplasty.</p>\n<p><strong>The indications for an SMR are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>DNS causing symptoms of nasal obstruction and recurrent headaches.</li>\n<li>DNS causing obstruction of paranasal sinuses and middle ear, resulting in recurrent sinusitis and otitis media.</li>\n<li>Recurrent epistaxis from a septal spur.</li>\n<li>As a part of septorhinoplasty, for cosmetic correction of external nasal deformities.</li>\n<li>As a preliminary step in hypophysectomy or vidian neurectomy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in children below 17 years of age, during acute respiratory infection, bleeding diathesis, untreated diabetes, or hypertension.</p>\n<p>In this procedure, mucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flaps are raised on <strong>both sides of the septum</strong>.

The <strong>AIN</strong> is a <strong>purely motor branch</strong> of the <strong>median nerve </strong>that affects specific muscles in the forearm, the<strong> flexor pollicis longus</strong> and <strong>flexor digitorum profundus </strong>leading to difficulty in performing tasks requiring fine motor control, such as the <strong>\"OK\" sign</strong>. Among the options provided, the <strong>abductor pollicis brevis</strong> is uniquely and <strong>consistently innervated</strong> by the<strong> recurrent motor branch</strong> of the <strong>median nerve</strong>, making it susceptible to dysfunction in conditions affecting the median nerve.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The <strong>opponens pollicis</strong> is innervated primarily by the <strong>lateral terminal branch</strong> of the <strong>median nerve</strong>, with some contributions from a branch of the deep terminal branch of the <strong>ulnar nerve</strong>. While it plays a role in thumb opposition, it is not consistently affected in anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) syndrome, which primarily impacts deeper flexor muscles like the flexor pollicis longus. Therefore, it is less likely to be the cause of the patient’s inability to perform the \"OK\" sign.</p>\n<p>Option B: The <strong>palmar interossei</strong> muscles are innervated by the deep branch of the <strong>ulnar nerve</strong>. Because they do not receive any innervation from the median nerve, they are not implicated in AIN syndrome. Their primary function involves the <strong>adduction</strong> of the fingers.</p>\n<p>Option C: The <strong>flexor pollicis brevis</strong> has dual innervation: the superficial head is supplied by the<strong> recurrent branch</strong> of the<strong> median nerve</strong>, while the deep head is innervated by the deep branch of the <strong>ulnar nerve</strong>.

Iron in our gut exists in 2 forms, they are <strong>non-heme</strong> and <strong>heme</strong> iron. Luminal non-heme iron is mostly in the <strong>Fe<sup>3+</sup> (ferric)</strong> state and is reduced to <strong>Fe<sup>2+</sup> (ferrous)</strong> iron by <strong>ferrireductases</strong> such as duodenal <strong>cytochrome B</strong>. <strong>Fe<sup>2+</sup></strong> iron is then <strong>transported</strong> across the apical membrane by <strong>divalent metal transporter 1 </strong>(DMT1). Heme iron is moved across the apical membrane into the cytoplasm through heme transporters such as heme carrier protein 1 and heme oxygenase 2.</p>\n<p>In the duodenal cells, Fe<sup>2+</sup> iron can be transported to the blood or stored as mucosal iron. Fe<sup>2+</sup> form of iron is transported from the cytoplasm into circulation by the protein <strong>ferroportin</strong>. A protein called hephaestin is associated with ferroportin 1. It is not a transporter itself, but it facilitates basolateral transport.</p>\n<p>Once in circulation, <strong>Fe<sup>2+</sup></strong> is again oxidized back to <strong>Fe<sup>3+</sup></strong> iron by <strong>hephaestin</strong> and <strong>ceruloplasmin</strong>. The newly absorbed Fe<sup>3+</sup> iron binds rapidly to transferrin and is delivered to red cell progenitors in the marrow. <strong>Hepcidin</strong> is a protein secreted from the <strong>liver</strong> that plays a major role in the <strong>regulation</strong> of iron absorption. When the body’s iron stores are adequate, it downregulates the expression of ferroportin and thereby decreases iron absorption. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4ae665fab06e4f708d72192d07616568x1280x1098.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Free serum iron</strong> is <strong>toxic</strong> to cells.

This <strong>enhances wound healing</strong> by preventing the formation of unnecessary cavities. Drains are prophylactic in elective surgeries and therapeutic in emergency surgeries. Drains can be -</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open</strong> - They are based on the principle of <strong>gravity </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Semi-open</strong> - Their action is based on <strong>capillary effect</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Closed</strong> - They carry out their actions through <strong>suction</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Suction drains are commonly used in chest, <strong>breast</strong>, abdominal, thyroid, and plastic surgeries. They remove intraperitoneal secretions, anastomotic leaks, and blood from hemorrhage at the surgical site. Romo Vac drain<strong> </strong>is a <strong>negative suction drain </strong>closed drain kept in the subcutaneous tissue. Romo Vac drain is indicated in modified radical mastectomy, subcutaneous swelling excision, and amputations. </p>\n<p>Special types of drains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chest drains</strong> (option A) are connected to an underwater seal to aid the exit of air from the pleural cavity. They are used in pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and hemothorax. </li>\n<li>After surgical exploration of the bile duct, the sphincter of Oddi goes into spasm. To facilitate drainage of bile, a <strong>T tube</strong> may be used. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Drain insertion site care</strong>: The site of insertion of the drain is kept clean by drying and patting the drain insertion site with a clean towel after bath. The dressing is changed daily with folded gauze pieces placed below and above the drain site. </p>\n<p><strong>Removal of drains</strong>: The catheter at the site is milked for residual collections. It is then clamped and the suture holding the catheter is cut. The tube is then gently pulled out and any clots at the perforation end are removed. The time of removal of drains for various conditions is given below. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drains used in surgeries like <strong>thyroidectomy</strong> are usually removed within <strong>24 hours</strong>. Their main purpose is to cover postoperative bleeding. </li>\n<li>In a <strong>mastectomy</strong>, a drain is placed for <strong>5 days</strong> to collect serous collections.</li>\n<li>Drains used to cover the <strong>colorectal anastomoses</strong> are placed for <strong>5-7 days.</strong></li>\n<li>Common bile duct<strong> T-tube drains</strong> are usually placed for<strong> 10 days.</strong></li>\n<li>Drains for infections are removed when the infection subsides or when the content of the drain is minimal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the drain is removed, a folded gauze is placed over the drain insertion area. The dressing can be removed after 24 hours. The patient may be given an antibiotic ointment to apply over the area for a week.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The following image shows an <strong>underwater seal drain</strong>.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5b165b3d60ea41feba1d9e11a1ca49eax600x1759.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C: A Penrose drain is a flexible, soft, latex tube used to drain fluid from a surgical site after surgery.

Tattoos may be made to cover the injection marks.</p>\n<p>It<strong> inhibits</strong> the uptake of <strong>dopamine, norepinephrine</strong>, and <strong>serotonin</strong>.</p>\n<p>At lower doses, it leads to alertness but at higher doses, it produces stereotyped behavior, involuntary actions, and paranoia. There is a <strong>transient euphoria</strong>. Tactile hallucinations (<strong>Magnan's symptom</strong> or <strong>cocaine bugs</strong>) are characteristic. </p>\n<p>There is a dose-dependent <strong>increase in heart rate </strong>and<strong> blood pressure</strong>. It causes <strong>dilation of pupil</strong>s and is associated with chills and perspiration. In severe cases,<strong> intracranial bleeding </strong>due to increased blood pressure, and <strong>myocardial infarction</strong> due to coronary vasospasm can occur. Ultimately, the patient goes into a stage of depression with loss of reflexes, paralysis of muscles, cardiorespiratory failure, and coma.  </p>\n<p>Management -  Administration of activated charcoal and gastric lavage with warm water and potassium permanganate in case of ingestion. <strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> to control heart rate/seizures. <strong>Amyl nitrite</strong> is the<strong> antidote</strong> given via inhalation. <strong>Thiamine 100 mg IV </strong>and <strong>Naloxone 2 mg IV </strong>can also be given.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Chlorpheniramine</strong> is an effective <strong>H1 antagonist</strong> that tends to be mildly sedative, making it suitable for daytime use.

Re-evaluation should be done after birth and in cases presenting with <strong>symptoms of recurrent UTI, palpable flank mass or pain, urinary obstruction, and in cases of failure to thrive</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the hydronephrosis is persistent, its <strong>severity</strong> is <strong>graded</strong> by the extent of the dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system and parenchymal thickness. It needs to be ascertained whether the other kidney is involved, the lower ureter is dilated, the bladder wall is thickened, and whether emptying of the bladder is incomplete.

Additionally, a temporary stent and a drain may be inserted. It is necessary to do further serial ultrasounds and <strong>MAG-3 imaging </strong>in order to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation.

These inexpensive alcohols may be improperly distilled or adulterated, leading to <strong>methanol contamination</strong>.

It is often associated with systemic conditions like <strong>rheumatoid arthritis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Episcleritis is <strong>benign, recurrent</strong>, inflammation of the episclera, involving the overlying <strong>Tenon's capsule</strong> but not the underlying sclera. It is <strong>more common</strong> in <strong>women</strong> than in men. It is an <strong>allergic reaction</strong> to an <strong>endogenous toxin</strong>. Clinically, two types of presentations may occur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simple </strong>episcleritis is characterized by <strong>sectorial </strong>or diffuse inflammation of the episclera.</li>\n<li><strong>Nodular</strong> episcleritis is characterized by a <strong>pink</strong> or <strong>purple flat nodule</strong> surrounded by injection, usually situated 2-3 mm away from the limbus. The nodule is firm, and tender and can be <strong>moved separately</strong> from the sclera, and the overlying conjunctiva also moves freely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Management</strong> of episcleritis typically includes <strong>topical NSAIDs</strong>, <strong>corticosteroid eye drops, cold compresses,</strong> and <strong>artificial tears</strong>. For recurrent cases, <strong>systemic NSAIDs</strong> may be required. <strong>2.5% phenylephrine</strong> can be used to <strong>differentiate </strong>episcleritis and scleritis.

It is a response to <strong>prolonged exposure </strong>to <strong>ultraviolet rays, dry heat,</strong> etc. This condition can be treated symptomatically with <strong>tear substitutes</strong> for dry eye symptoms and patients are advised to <strong>avoid ultraviolet rays</strong>. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7ece235899d645ebb8c7e76a806ece0ax360x272.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D: <strong>Scleritis</strong> refers to an <strong>inflammation</strong> of the <strong>sclera proper</strong>. It usually occurs in <strong>elderly patients</strong> (40-70 years) involving <strong>females </strong>more than males.

In addition to hemophilia B, it’s important to note <strong>hemophilia A</strong>, which is caused by a deficiency in<strong> factor VIII</strong>. Hemophilia A is also inherited in an <strong>X-linked recessive</strong> manner, presenting similar clinical features to hemophilia B, such as <strong>prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT)</strong> and <strong>normal prothrombin time (PT)</strong>. Both conditions require different <strong>factor assays</strong> for accurate diagnosis, but both lead to increased bleeding risks. Treatment options, including <strong>recombinant factor infusions</strong> for both hemophilia A and B, are essential for managing the conditions and minimizing complications.</p><hr><h3>Related

It is endemic in the USA, in the states bordering the <strong>Ohio River valley</strong> and the lower <strong>Mississippi River</strong>. In India, it is reported from the region of <strong>West Bengal</strong>, along the Ganga River.

The various clinical types include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pulmonary histoplasmosis</strong> - Acute form presents with mild flu-like illness, pulmonary infiltrates in the chest X-ray with <strong>hilar</strong> or <strong>mediastinal lymphadenopathy. </strong>Chronic cavitary histoplasmosis may be seen in smokers with underlying structural lung disease.</li>\n<li><strong>Mucocutaneous histoplasmosis</strong> - Skin and oral mucosal lesions may develop secondary to pulmonary infection.

      "solution": "<p>The image 3 given above shows yellow plaques and nodules on the mucosa are suggestive of <strong>pseudomembranous colitis</strong>. It is usually caused by <em><strong>Clostridium difficile</strong></em>. The pathogenesis is mediated by the enterotoxins -<strong> toxin A</strong> and toxin B.</p>\n<p><em>Clostridium difficile</em> is a gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that causes<strong> <em>Clostridioides </em>(formerly <em>Clostridium</em>)<em> </em><em>difficile</em> infection</strong> after ingestion of spores of the organism. The more severe form of the condition is known as <strong>pseudomembranous colitis</strong> (PMC). Enzyme immunoassay to detect <strong>glutamate dehydrogenase</strong> is<strong> less specific</strong> compared to<strong> toxin detection</strong> for diagnosis. So a combination of the two can be used for diagnostic confirmation.</p>\n<p>The condition is most commonly associated with <strong>prolonged antimicrobial use</strong>, which interferes with the commensal colonic microflora. The most commonly implicated antibiotics are cephalosporins, ampicillin, and <strong>clindamycin.</strong> The spores are spread by contact with the <strong>feces</strong> of affected individuals or asymptomatic carriers. It can persist on surfaces for months. Risk factors include <strong>poor hand hygiene</strong>, old age, and gastrointestinal surgery.</p>\n<p>The spores germinate in the small intestine and produce two toxins—<strong>toxin A</strong> (enterotoxin) and <strong>toxin B</strong> (cytotoxin). These interfere with the epithelial-cell barrier function and result in diarrhea and <strong>pseudomembrane</strong> formation. The pseudomembranes appear as small whitish-yellow plaques initially which later coalesce to involve the entire colon wall. It contains <strong>necrotic leukocytes</strong>,<strong> fibrin</strong>, and <strong>cellular debris</strong>. The<strong> anamnestic IgG response</strong> determines which patients develop the disease or remain asymptomatic. </p>\n<p>Symptoms include<strong> diarrhea</strong>, fever, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis is based on a combination of <strong>clinical criteria</strong> and detection of <strong>toxin</strong> or the <strong>organism</strong> in stool samples. This can be done by <strong>nucleic acid amplification testing</strong> (NAAT) methods such as <strong>polymerase chain reaction</strong> (PCR) or by <strong>culture</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Discontinuation</strong> of any ongoing antimicrobials and adequate hydration are general measures that are recommended. <strong>Oral fidaxomicin</strong> or <strong>vancomycin</strong> is the first-line treatment. Oral metronidazole can be used when these are not available.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Familial Adenomatosis Polyposis </strong>(image 1)is caused due to a germline loss of function mutation of the tumor suppressor gene, <strong>APC</strong>(adenomatous polyposis coli) on the <strong>5</strong>th chromosome leading to <strong>multiple adenomas in the GI tract</strong> with 100% risk of malignant conversion associated with congenital retinal pigment epithelium hypertrophy. Variants of FAP are Gardner and Turcot syndromes. Its features are described in the pearl attached.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Esophageal varices </strong>(image 4) are tortuous <strong>dilated veins </strong>within the mucosa and submucosa of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach. Variceal hemorrhage is an emergency that can be treated medically by inducing splanchnic vasoconstriction or endoscopically by sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade, or variceal ligation. It commonly occurs due to portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Ulcerative colitis</strong> (UC) (image 2) which is characterized by continuous inflammation of the colon, <strong>pseudopolyps</strong>, biopsy findings of crypt distortion, ulceration, and infiltration of inflammatory cells until the submucosal layer of the intestinal wall. Diagnosis can be made by colonoscopy followed by a biopsy. </p>\n<p>UC is a type of <strong>inflammatory bowel disease</strong> that primarily affects the rectum and extends proximally to involve the colon. Patients typically present with diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, crampy abdominal pain, and mucus discharge. They may also present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss.</p>\n<p>The presentation of UC differs from that of Crohn's disease, which is characterized by transmural inflammation of the intestine.

It is known for its <strong>bitter-sweet taste</strong> and is absorbed mainly through<strong> ingestion</strong> rather than skin contact. Upon ingestion, ethylene glycol is <strong>metabolized</strong> in the <strong>liver</strong> to several toxic metabolites, including <strong>glycolic acid</strong> and <strong>oxalic acid</strong>, which contribute to its harmful effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Initially</strong>, ethylene glycol poisoning can cause symptoms such as <strong>vomiting, lethargy</strong>, and <strong>ataxia</strong>, progressing to severe effects including tachycardia, tachypnea, and <strong>circulatory collapse</strong> within <strong>12-24 hours</strong>. As the condition progresses, typically within one to three days, patients may experience hypocalcemia, <strong>oliguria, tubular necrosis</strong>, and <strong>acute kidney injury (AKI</strong>). A notable feature of ethylene glycol poisoning is the formation of <strong>calcium oxalate crystals</strong> in the<strong> urine</strong>, which can lead to <strong>renal failure</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>postmortem findings</strong> often include <strong>cerebral edema, chemical meningoencephalitis</strong>, and significant damage to the liver and kidneys. <strong>Oxalate crystals</strong> may be observed in the <strong>brain, spinal cord</strong>, and kidneys, further confirming the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>For treatment, immediate measures include <strong>gastric lavage, activated charcoal</strong>, and administration of ethanol or <strong>4-methyl pyrazole (fomepizole)</strong>, which inhibit the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to prevent further metabolism of ethylene glycol into toxic compounds. Additional treatments such as <strong>intravenous sodium bicarbonate</strong> and <strong>calcium gluconate</strong> are used to address metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia, respectively, while <strong>hemodialysis</strong> is indicated in <strong>severe</strong> <strong>cases</strong> with significant renal impairment or high serum ethylene glycol concentrations.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Methyl alcohol (Methanol)</strong> and Ethylene glycol poisoning can present very similarly.
