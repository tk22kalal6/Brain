      "solution": "<p>This patient presents with longstanding <strong>epigastric pain, bloating,</strong> anorexia, and acid reflux and has a past medical history of <strong>peptic ulcer disease.</strong> The given histopathology slide shows <strong>lymphoepithelial lesions</strong> suggestive of a <strong>gastric MALToma.</strong> This suggests that the patient has had chronic gastritis, and the most common cause of <strong>chronic unremitting gastritis</strong> is an underlying untreated <strong>Helicobacter pylori</strong> infection. The next step in his management would be to prescribe <strong>antibiotics</strong> to treat an underlying <strong>Helicobacter pylori</strong> infection as this bacteria has been strongly implicated in the causation of gastric MALTomas. </p>\n<p>H. pylori eradication therapy leads to <strong>loss</strong> of the <strong>inflammatory stimulus</strong> which is responsible for causing the <strong>recruitment</strong> of <strong>lymphocytes</strong> to the <strong>gastric epithelium.</strong> Thus patients with chronic gastritis with known peptic ulcer disease are <strong>presumed</strong> to have been <strong>colonised</strong> by <strong>H.</strong> pylori and require treatment with antibiotics. This also helps in tumor staging, as, if the patient <strong>does not respond</strong> to <strong>antibiotics,</strong> it is indicative of a <strong>higher</strong> grade of <strong>MALToma</strong> which would require more aggressive management. </p>\n<p><strong>Extranodal marginal</strong> B-cell lymphomas usually arise at the sites of <strong>chronic inflammation.</strong> Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is not present in the normal stomach but can be <strong>induced,</strong> typically as a result of <strong>chronic gastritis.</strong> H. pylori infection is the most <strong>common inducing factor</strong> of MALT and is often found in association with <strong>MALTomas.</strong> The presenting complaints are similar to <strong>adenocarcinoma</strong> and include <strong>abdominal pain, dyspepsia,</strong> and <strong>anorexia.</strong></p>\n<p>Histologically, MALTomas show <strong>dense lymphocytic infiltrate</strong> in the <strong>lamina propria.</strong> The neoplastic lymphocytes infiltrate gastric glands to create <strong>lymphoepithelial lesions.</strong> MALTomas express B-cell markers like <strong>CD19</strong> and <strong>CD20,</strong> but not CD5 or CD10. 25% of the cases are positive for <strong>CD43.</strong> Eradication of H. pylori with antibiotics has shown to be an <strong>effective therapy</strong> for <strong>MALToma.</strong> Surgical resection has no role in the treatment unless there has been some complication like perforation or uncontrollable bleeding. Chemotherapy is indicated only if the patient does not respond to antibiotic therapy. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types Of Gastric Ulcers</h3><p>This is the classification given in Harrisons 20th ed, Principles of Internal Medicine.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp; Type Of Ulcer</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Location</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Acid Production</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Surgical Management</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type I</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gastric body</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low</td>\n<td>Distal Gastrectomy Billroth Type 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type II</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Antrum</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;Low to Normal</td>\n<td>Distal Gastrectomy and Vagotomy/PPI</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type III</td>\n<td>Within 3cm of the pylorus; Accompanied by duodenal ulcers</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;Normal or High</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Distal Gastrectomy and Vagotomy/PPI&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type IV</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cardia</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Pouchet, Csendes Procedure</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The other classification is Modified Johnson's Classification which is as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Modified Johnson classification</strong> for gastric ulcer</p>\n<p>I.

PUJO is a congenital condition where there is a narrowing or blockage at the junction where the ureter meets the renal pelvis. This obstruction leads to dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces leading to <strong>hydronephrosis</strong> on the affected side. </p>\n<p>PUJO can arise due to various factors, including intrinsic obstruction caused by a segment with poor peristalsis due to <strong>muscular hypoplasia</strong>. Other contributing factors include a higher level of insertion of the ureter into the renal pelvis and the presence of crossing aberrant vessels at the PUJ. These conditions collectively lead to impaired urine flow from the kidney, resulting in hydronephrosis.

This is because once a patient is diagnosed and treated, the impact of underdiagnosis or hidden cases on individual treatment outcomes is minimal. Treatment effectiveness depends more on factors such as <strong>drug efficacy, patient adherence,</strong> and <strong>healthcare delivery</strong> rather than the overall prevalence of the disease in the population.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p>Option 1: <strong>Accuracy of reported prevalence rates:</strong> Reported prevalence rates are heavily influenced by the number of diagnosed cases compared to the total number of cases (both diagnosed and undiagnosed). If a disease has a <strong>significant hidden burden</strong> (undetected cases), the reported prevalence rates will <strong>underestimate the true prevalence</strong> in the population.</p>\n<p>Option 2: <strong>Effectiveness of targeted screening programs:</strong> Targeted screening programs rely on accurate <strong>knowledge of disease prevalence</strong> to effectively identify <strong>individuals at risk</strong>. If prevalence rates are underestimated due to the iceberg phenomenon (many undiagnosed cases), screening programs may miss a substantial portion of the population who could benefit from early detection and intervention.</p>\n<p>Option 3: <strong>Timeliness of treatment initiation:</strong> Timely initiation of treatment is critical for many diseases to prevent complications and improve outcomes. However, if a large number of cases are undiagnosed, delays in diagnosis can occur. This delay can lead to delayed treatment initiation, allowing the disease to progress unchecked in individuals who are not yet diagnosed. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0bc171ac344f4c69ae5e07529257efdcx1280x1252.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "<p>Emptying of the stomach is not inhibited, but rather increased by the secretion of <strong>gastrin</strong>. Gastrin promotes emptying of the stomach by <strong>stimulating</strong> the motor functions of the stomach, especially the <strong>pyloric pump</strong>.</p>\n<p>After food enters the duodenum, the duodenal entero-gastric nerve reflexes ensure the inhibition of emptying of the stomach. This mainly includes 3 pathways. They are, via the <strong>enteric nervous system</strong> directly from the duodenum, via extrinsic nerves that go to the prevertebral <strong>sympathetic ganglia</strong> and then back through the sympathetic fibres to the stomach and finally via the <strong>vagus nerve</strong> that inhibits the excitatory signals to the stomach at the level of the brainstem. These reflexes <strong>inhibit </strong>the<strong> pyloric pump</strong> propulsive contractions and also <strong>increase </strong>the<strong> tone</strong> of the <strong>pyloric sphincter.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gastrin</strong> is a hormone secreted by <strong>G cells</strong> located in the pyloric glands of the stomach. It is released into the blood, following which it is transported to the <strong>enterochromaffin-like cells</strong> of the <strong>stomach</strong>, resulting in the release of <strong>histamine</strong>, which stimulates gastric hydrochloric acid secretion.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Increased acidity</strong> of <strong>chyme</strong> inhibits the emptying of the stomach by irritating the entero-gastric inhibitory reflexes of the duodenum. It prevents the subsequent release of stomach contents into the duodenum until the acidic chyme that is already present is neutralised.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Distension of the duodenum</strong> inhibits the emptying of the stomach via the enteric nervous system.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Cholecystokinin</strong> secretion decreases the motility of the stomach as a result of its inhibitory effect on gastrin. It is a hormone that is released from the mucosa of the jejunum and is sensitive to the presence of fats in the duodenum.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Source and actions of gastrointestinal hormones</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Action</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gastrin</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>CCK</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Secretin</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>GIP</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Motilin</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>G cells in the stomach (antrum)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>I cells of duodenum and jejunum</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>S cells deep in the mucosa of upper small intestine</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>K cells in mucosa of duodenum and jejunum</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 749\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Mo cells of the duodenum and jejunum</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Acid secretion</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gastric emptying</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Pancreatic HCO<sup>3-</sup></strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Pancreatic enzymes</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Insulin release</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gall bladder contraction</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Biliary&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>HCO<sup>3-</sup></strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gastric motility</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Intestinal motility</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Mucosal growth</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Exocrine pancreas growth</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><strong>KEY</strong></p>\n<p>S&rarr;Stimulates</p>\n<p>I&rarr; Inhibits</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Factors regulating gastric emptying</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Factors that Increase gastric emptying</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Factors that Decrease gastric emptying</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Distension of the stomach</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Distension of the duodenum</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Food rich in carbohydrate</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Food rich in fats &gt; proteins</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Stimulation of parasympathetic nervous system</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Stimulation of sympathetic nervous system</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Presence of fat in duodenum</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>High acidity (low pH) of the duodenal chyme</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Isotonic chyme</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypertonic &gt;&gt;hypotonic duodenal content</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Breakdown products of protein digestion in the duodenum</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Presence of any irritation in the duodenal mucosa</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gastrin</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>CCK, Secretin, GIP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

The <strong>depth</strong> of the sand bed is about <strong>1 metre</strong> and has graded gravel below it.</li>\n<li>As the filtration is done, the alum-floc which has not precipitated is held back by the sand bed.

In such patients, the anticoagulants or dual antiplatelet therapy will be stopped a few days prior to surgery, and the patient will be started on a <strong>short-acting anticoagulant,</strong> such as <strong>low-molecular-weight heparin</strong>.

The rationale behind stopping blood thinners like <strong>warfarin </strong>is due to its<strong> longer half-life</strong> and the risk of bleeding during the surgery. <strong>LMWH </strong>has a <strong>short half-life</strong>, doesn’t need any monitoring, and its effect is <strong>easily reversible</strong>, hence it is used for bridging.</p>\n<p>LMWH should be stopped<strong> 24 hours before</strong> surgery in the case of <strong>general anesthesia</strong> and <strong>12 hours before</strong> surgery if it's going to be done under <strong>regional anesthesia</strong> to allow normalization of coagulation by the time of surgery.

In such patients, the continuation of aspirin until the time of surgery leads to <strong>increased bleeding</strong> during major noncardiac surgery. Therefore, <strong>aspirin</strong> is discontinued temporarily <strong>3 days before </strong>surgery, and the P2Y12 inhibitor like <strong>clopidogrel</strong> is discontinued <strong>5 to 7 days </strong>before surgery.</p>",

The adult worms <strong>block</strong> the <strong>lymphatic vessels</strong> leading to <strong>inflammation</strong> and <strong>granuloma formation.</strong> This causes hard <strong>pitting</strong> or <strong>brawny edema.</strong> It can present as lymphadenitis, lymphedema, hydrocele, and elephantiasis.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Ascaris lumbricoides</strong> is also an <strong>intestinal nematode</strong> and infects through rhabtidiform larvae.

Increased ventilation is due to the<strong> less negative</strong> <strong>intrapleural</strong> pressure compared to the apex, thereby making the intrapulmonary intrapleural pressure difference less at the base.

      "solution": "<p>Increased <strong>baroreceptor</strong> <strong>discharge</strong> leads to the production of vasodilation, venodilation, bradycardia, and <strong>hypotension</strong> not hypertension.</p>\n<p>Baroreceptors&nbsp;are<strong>&nbsp;s</strong><strong>tretch receptors</strong>&nbsp;located in the heart and the adventitia of the blood vessels. They&nbsp;are&nbsp;<strong>stimulated</strong>&nbsp;by the stretching of the walls of the blood vessels when there is an&nbsp;<strong>increased </strong>volume or<strong> blood pressure</strong>&nbsp;in the vessel. They are important in the<strong> immediate management</strong> of blood pressure. They are of two types - carotid sinus and aortic arch receptors (high-pressure regions) and cardiopulmonary receptors (low-pressure regions).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An increase in blood pressure stimulates the baroreceptors. These&nbsp;signals are transmitted through small&nbsp;<strong>Hering&rsquo;s nerves</strong>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<strong>glossopharyngeal nerves</strong>&nbsp;and then to the&nbsp;<strong>nucleus tractus solitarius </strong>(NTS)&nbsp;in the <strong>medulla</strong>. These signals&nbsp;release glutamate and activate the <strong>caudal ventrolateral medulla </strong>(CVLM). This in turn&nbsp;<strong>inhibits&nbsp;</strong>the<strong> rostral ventrolateral medulla</strong>&nbsp;(RVLM) considered the&nbsp;<strong>vasoconstrictor center&nbsp;</strong>for the brain and the heart.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, this pathway also&nbsp;<strong>excites</strong>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>vagal</strong>&nbsp;parasympathetic center. The&nbsp;<strong>stimulation of the vagus</strong>&nbsp;results in a&nbsp;<strong>slowing&nbsp;</strong>of<strong>&nbsp;impulse generation&nbsp;</strong>in the&nbsp;<strong>SA node&nbsp;</strong>and a&nbsp;<strong>slowing&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>conduction&nbsp;</strong>velocity in the&nbsp;<strong>AV node.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>These neural changes produce <strong>vasodilation,</strong> venodilation, <strong>hypotension, bradycardia,</strong> and a <strong>decrease</strong> in cardiac <strong>output</strong>.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b88b2bf9e18948c3b58a1f13fac38130x1280x1674.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7d9c069030ec4966b9f092e578ab799cx1280x2026.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
