This enzyme plays a dual role — it’s part of both the TCA cycle, where it catalyses the oxidation of succinate to fumarate, and the ETC, where it helps transfer electrons from FADH₂ to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone).<br><br>This complex bypasses Complex I and transfers electrons from FADH₂ to Q.

In this condition, a single kidney has two ureters — one draining the upper pole and the other draining the lower pole of the kidney. According to this rule, the ureter from the upper renal segment inserts into the bladder in an inferior and medial position compared to the ureter from the lower segment, which inserts in a more superior and lateral position.<br><br>The upper ureter is considered ectopic and the lower ureter is considered orthotopic. Ectopic ureters are more prone to obstruction. Orthotopic ureters are more prone to reflux due to perpendicular entry into bladder musculature rather than oblique entry.<br><br>According to Weigert Meyer's rule of congenital complete duplication of the ureter:<br><br>* The ureter that inserts inferiorly and medially (typically draining the upper pole) is more prone to obstruction. This is because it often ends in an ectopic location (such as the urethra, vagina, or even below the sphincter in females) and lacks a normal, oblique tunnel through the bladder wall, making it more vulnerable to functional obstruction. <br><br>* In contrast, the superior and lateral ureter (draining the lower pole) is more commonly associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). This happens because its insertion is usually anatomically higher and more lateral, leading to a shorter submucosal tunnel in the bladder wall, which reduces the anti-reflux mechanism. <br><br>(EASY TO REMEMBER - LOWER pole LATERAL upper)<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/63daa46e98e546b0a893abba3ab3146bx1280x1470.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

Stem-cell depletion resulting in anemia is seen in Fanconi anemia, not hemolysis-induced anemia.<br><br>The given vignette describes a patient with anemia with low haptoglobin levels and elevated LDH levels. Low haptoglobin is seen in hemolytic anemias due to the complexing of the haptoglobin with extracorpuscular hemoglobin, which is increased in MAHA. LDH levels are elevated further suggestive of RBC hemolysis. The peripheral smear has two significant findings, schistocytes and helmet cells, as shown below:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ffb7c78c9fdb46bfaa79adce770ec26dx932x818.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Schistocytes are fragmented red cells that are smaller than the red cell itself and have sharp angles and spurs. They are typically seen in cases of red cell fragmentation such as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia(MAHA), cardiac hemolytic anemia due to valve shearing, etc. Helmet cells and triangle cells are specific shapes of fragmented RBCs seen in MAHA.<br><br>MAHA is observed as the clinical picture in conditions where intravascular hemolysis of RBCs occurs usually due to a mechanical disturbance in the flow of blood, causing shearing and fragmentation of RBCs. MAHA picture is seen in:<br><br>* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)( Option C)<br><br>* Hemolytic uremic syndrome<br><br>* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)<br><br>* HELLP syndrome (Option B)<br><br>* Malignant Hypertension (Option A)<br><br>In all these conditions, the primary mechanical factor responsible for RBC lysis is usually microthrombi in the vessel walls that cause shear stress on RBCs. In malignant hypertension, an additional contribution is from the elevated blood pressure.<br><br>In TTP, there is a deficiency of vWF metalloproteinase ADAMTS13 causing aggregation of large vWF multimers that activate platelets, create thrombi, occlude vessels, and cause MAHA. Clinical pentad of fever, MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and neurological and renal manifestations are seen.<br><br>In DIC, specific triggers cause mass activation of tissue factors leading to numerous microvascular thrombi, and occlusion of the vessels causing MAHA. A consumptive coagulopathy also occurs with concomitant excess fibrinolysis.<br><br>HELLP syndrome is seen in pre-eclampsia and includes hemolysis, low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes and is basically a hypertensive emergency in pregnancy inducing an MAHA picture. In malignant hypertension, there is a diffuse endothelial injury that causes thrombus formation, microvascular occlusion and MAHA. <br><br>Fanconi anemia (Option D) is an autosomal recessive defect in the gene responsible for homologous DNA repair. It is characterized by developmental abnormalities like short stature and skeletal anomalies, hypoplasia of the spleen and kidney with increased risk of marrow failure and leukemia.

On examination of the patient, the following will be noted:<br><br>When the patient tries to look to the right, the left eye's medial rectus functions normally, so it turns inward as expected. However, the right eye’s lateral rectus is paralyzed due to abducent nerve palsy, so it cannot turn outward. As a result, the right eye fails to follow the movement and remains near the primary position, but because of the unopposed action of the medial rectus, it is slightly turned inward, causing esotropia in the primary gaze.<br><br>During the cover test, when the normal (left) eye is covered, the brain shifts fixation to the affected (right) eye. Since the right eye was already deviated inward at rest, it must now move outward to look directly at the target.

If the pH exceeds 8.5, chlorine is unreliable as a disinfectant, as about 90% of the hypochlorous acid that is formed gets ionized to hypochlorite ions.<br><br>Most waters have a pH between 6 to 7.5.<br><br>Pearl PM1598: Chlorination of Water<br><br>* Chlorination is widely used for the large-scale purification of drinking water.<br><br>* It is bactericidal and moderately virucidal but not sporicidal, except in high doses.<br><br>* It oxidizes iron, manganese, and hydrogen sulphide. It also destroys some taste and odour producing components. It controls algae and slime organisms and aids in coagulation.<br><br>* The action of chlorine:<br><br>* Hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid are formed when chlorine is added to water. Hypochlorous acid ionizes to form hydrogen and hypochlorite ions.<br><br>* H2O + Cl2 → HCl + HOCl\n HOCl → H + OCl<br><br>* The disinfecting action of chlorine is predominantly due to hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid is the most effective form of chlorine and it is almost 70 – 80 times more effective than hypochlorite ions.<br><br>* Chlorine acts best in water that has a pH of around 7.<br><br>* Principles of chlorination:<br><br>* The water to be disinfected must be clear of turbidity as turbidity impedes efficient chlorination.<br><br>* The chlorine demand of water is the difference between the amount of chlorine added to the water and the amount of residual chlorine remaining at the end of a specific period of contact (usually 60 minutes) at a given temperature and pH of the water. This has to be estimated before chlorination is done.<br><br>* The point at which the chlorine demand of water is met is called the breakpoint. It is beyond this that residual free chlorine begins to appear.<br><br>* Contact period of free chlorine for at least one hour is required to kill bacteria and viruses.<br><br>*  Minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0.5 mg/litre for one hour. Free residual chlorine provides a margin of safety against microbial contamination that occurs in storage or transport.<br><br>* The sum of the chlorine demand of the specific water plus free residual chlorine of 0.5 mg/litre constitutes the correct dose of chlorine to be applied.<br><br>* Methods of chlorination:<br><br>* Chlorine gas: It is the first choice as it is cheap, quick and efficient in action, and easy to apply. Special chlorinating equipments like Paterson’s chloronome are used for the application of chlorine gas.<br><br>* Chloramines: These loose compounds of chlorine and ammonia give more persistent forms of residual chlorine. They have slow action and thus are not widely used.<br><br>* Perchloron or high test hypochlorite (H.T.H.): It is a calcium compound that has 60 – 70% of available chlorine.<br><br>* Break point chlorination:<br><br>* The point at which the chlorine demand of water is met is called the breakpoint. <br><br>* Free chlorine (HOCl and OCl) appears when chlorine is added beyond the breakpoint.<br><br>* In other words, at the breakpoint, if chlorine is added, then all the combined chlorines would have been completely destroyed and free residual chlorines begin to appear.<br><br>* This corresponding dosage to achieve the appearance of free residual chlorine is called breakpoint dosage and this method is called breakpoint chlorination.<br><br>* It is also called controlled superchlorination<br><br>* Superchlorination followed by dechlorination is used to disinfect highly polluted waters whose quality fluctuates greatly.<br><br>* Orthotolidine (OT) test:<br><br>* It is a test for chlorination and determines free and combined chlorine in water, rapidly and accurately.<br><br>* The reagent used is analytical grade Orthotolidine dissolved in a 10% solution of hydrochloric acid.<br><br>* When added to water that contains chlorine, it turns yellow with varying intensity. This is faster in the presence of free chlorine and slower in the presence of combined chlorine.<br><br>* Orthotolidine - arsenite (OTA) test:<br><br>* This is a modification of the OT test which nullifies the errors due to interfering substances like iron, nitrites, manganese, etc.<br><br>* It determines free and combined chlorine separately.<br><br>Pearl PM1610: Horrock’s Apparatus<br><br>* Horrock’s Apparatus is used to estimate the chlorine demand of water.<br><br>* This is widely used in the disinfection of wells to find out how much bleaching powder is required.<br><br>* Contents of this water-testing apparatus:<br><br>* 6 white cups of 200 ml each and one black cup with a circular mark<br><br>* 2 metal spoons (each holds 2g of bleaching powder)<br><br>* 7 glass stirring rods and 1 special pipette<br><br>* Two droppers<br><br>* Starch-iodide indicator solution<br><br>* Procedure:<br><br>* Use 2g of bleaching powder to create a thin paste in the black cup. It is now called the Chlorine stock solution.<br><br>* The six white cups are filled with the water to be tested<br><br>* Add one drop of the stock solution to the 1st cup, two drops to the 2nd cup, three drops to the 3rd cup, and so on till adding six drops to the 6th cup.<br><br>* Stir the cups and wait for half an hour.<br><br>* Add 3 drops of starch-iodide indicator to each cup<br><br>* Development of blue color in the apparatus indicates free residual chlorine. <br><br>* The first cup which develops this color gives an estimate of the amount of bleaching powder needed to disinfect 455 Litres of the sample water.<br><br>* Chlorine demand or the dose of bleaching powder required is given by (n x 2) g for 455 liters of water, i.e., (n x 2) g of bleaching powder is required to disinfect 455 liters of water. Here, n represents the position of the cup (1, 2, 3, etc.) that was first to show a distinct blue color.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/bed65d5582c142b8ab4533128373dcabx383x287.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

This is followed by a paresis that resolves in a few hours. This picture is consistent with a focal seizure which spreads in the form of jacksonian march and followed by Todd's paresis.<br><br>Focal seizure is a type of seizure limited to one area of the brain. It may undergo secondary generalization but begins from one focus in the brain. It can be divided into focal seizures with impaired awareness and intact awareness. Focal seizures show up as epileptiform spikes in a background of normal activity. <br><br>In the beginning, changes in somatic sensations such as paraesthesias, visual symptoms like hallucinations and flashes of light, dysequilibrium, and autonomic symptoms like flushing, sweating, and piloerection may herald the start of a focal seizure. Lesions in the temporal and frontal lobes can manifest with olfactory and auditory phenomena and bizarre sensations termed auras.<br><br>In focal seizures with intact awareness, as in this case, show motor symptoms, often in a sequential fashion known as Jacksonian march where the motor symptoms are initially restricted to a small area, say fingers, and then spread to include more muscle groups. This indicates the spread of seizure activity to adjacent brain areas.<br><br>Another distinguishing feature is Todd's paresis, which is a transient, localized paresis for minutes to hours following the seizure episode which usually spontaneously resolves with no residual deficit. It is an important stroke-mimic. The seizure is also known to continue for days and is often refractory to medical treatment, a condition known as epilepsia partialis continua. <br><br>Treatment involves the identification of the focus responsible for the seizure activity and its specific management along with antiepileptic drugs. In this case, the patient is taking ATT, hence he may have a tuberculoma in the brain and requires imaging to rule it out. Other common intracranial space-occupying lesions causing focal seizures are neurocysticercosis, malignancies etc<br><br>First line drugs for focal seizure include carbamazepine, lamotrigine,oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine,phenytoin and levitiracetam.<br><br>Other Options:<br><br>Option A: Hemiplegic migraine is also a stroke mimic causing temporary paresis but typical Jacksonian muscle march is not seen there. This condition is often familial.<br><br>Option B: Cataplectic attacks are seen in narcolepsy where any sudden emotional outbursts such as laughing or crying result in sudden loss of muscle tone resulting in the patient collapsing to the ground. Consciousness is retained and the patient recovers in seconds to a few minutes.<br><br>Option C: Clumsy hand type of lacunar stroke is a lacunar stroke syndrome, properly termed \" Clumsy hand-dysarthria\" syndrome where a lacunar infarct results in dysarthria and clumsiness of the hand or arm. The lesion is believed to be in the genu or ventral pons. It does not present with flashes of light or Jacksonian march and is not reversible in hours.",

End-systolic pressure is much higher, and the ventricle must generate significantly more pressure to eject blood through the narrowed valve.<br><br>Option C: The loop is widened, and LV end-diastolic volume is markedly increased due to volume overload from backflow of blood in aortic regurgitation. There is no true isovolumetric contraction or relaxation, as blood is constantly flowing back into the ventricle during diastole. Stroke volume increases, but the LV has to deal with both the forward and regurgitant volume, increasing myocardial workload.<br><br>Option D: In this loop, end-diastolic volume increases slightly, and there's no isovolumetric contraction, as blood leaks back into the atrium in mitral regurgitation. The loop has a blunted, more rounded shape. The afterload is reduced because blood is ejected both into the aorta and back into the left atrium.

      "solution": "The fetal anomaly seen in this antenatal ultrasound is gastroschisis.<br><br>Gastroschisis is a congenital anomaly whereby there is a full-thickness ventral abdominal wall defect usually to the right side of the umbilical insertion associated with herniation of the bowel loops through the defect into the amniotic cavity. It is seen in 1:2000 births and is associated with younger maternal age, the average age being 20 years. <br><br>Associated anomalies like jejunal atresia are sometimes seen. There is usually no aneuploidy and survival rates when surgically managed are very good. Gastroschisis on an antenatal ultrasound is evidenced by the cauliflower-shaped protrusion from the fetus's abdomen, which is the herniated bowel loops without an omental covering freely floating in the amniotic fluid, as shown below:<br><br>This condition can be diagnosed in an ultrasound as early as the late first trimester. It may be complicated by fetal growth restriction.

Longer exposure in utero to amniotic fluid can cause trauma to the intestines. The intestines are also not fully rotated and these factors increase the risk of intestinal volvulus, postnatal intestinal dysfunction with delayed mobility, and prolonged need for hospitalization and enteral feeding.<br><br>Gastroschisis also increases the risk of intestinal transplant and short bowel syndrome in children. Treatment involves surgically placing the herniated viscera back in the abdominal cavity followed by repair of the wall defect. Silastic spring-loaded silo or staged repair may be done where immediate surgery cannot be undertaken.<br><br>An important differential diagnosis is Omphalocele in which there is usually persistence of physiological herniation of the gut. On AN USG, a smooth mass is seen to protrude from the abdomen. Post delivery, the neonate is seen to have a mass covered by the peritoneum and amnion containing the viscera.

Cholangiocarcinoma should be ruled out in case of a suspected mass in the biliary tract that is causing the obstruction. Hence the next best step would be to perform an endoscopic inspection with biliary brush cytology. <br><br>Primary sclerosing cholangitis is an autoimmune condition characterized by inflammatory strictures involving the intra and extra-hepatic biliary tree. It is a progressive condition that leads to secondary biliary cirrhosis.<br><br>The common age group of primary sclerosing cholangitis is 30-45 years. Men are affected twice as commonly as women. 2/3rd of these cases are associated with ulcerative colitis. It is also associated with Riedel’s thyroiditis and retroperitoneal fibrosis. There is also a strong predisposition to cholangiocarcinoma, gall bladder carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. Thus, annual screening for these cancers is mandatory. <br><br>Clinical features of a patient with PSC include:<br><br>* Intermittent jaundice<br><br>* Fatigue<br><br>* Weight loss<br><br>* Pruritus<br><br>* Abdominal pain<br><br>Liver function tests show a cholestatic pattern with an elevation of ALP and GGT and smaller rises in the aminotransferases.

They are also not sensitive to detecting the mass and hence, are not indicated to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma. <br><br>Option B: Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage is done as a part of palliative treatment in unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. This is done to relieve obstructive features like jaundice and pruritis. <br><br>Option D: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy of the mass is not done as it increases the risk of bile duct injuries and biliary leak.",

These antibodies also bind to the platelet Fc receptors and promote thrombosis. Features of HIT are usually seen after 5-10 days of starting heparin and are more common in females than in males. The platelet count usually drops to less than ≤100,000/μL or decreases to ≥50% compared to the levels before the initiation of heparin.

Platelet transfusions can exacerbate thrombosis by providing additional platelets that may be activated by heparin-PF4 antibodies.<br><br>Option B: Discontinue unfractionated heparin and start warfarin is incorrect. Warfarin alone increases thrombosis risk in acute HIT due to its transient depletion of protein C and S (natural anticoagulants). Warfarin must be overlapped with a non-heparin anticoagulant (e.g., direct thrombin inhibitor) until platelets recover (>150,000/μL) to avoid catastrophic thrombosis (e.g., venous limb gangrene).

Chronic Q-fever tends to occur months or years after the initial infection and can manifest as Q-fever endocarditis, infected prosthesis, infected aneurysms, and bone infections.<br><br>On TEE, endothelium-covered nodules are seen as vegetations on the valves, and new-onset valve regurgitation may be seen. Diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion due to non-specific features and must be considered in all cases of culture-negative endocarditis.<br><br>Diagnostic methods include culture, which requires a level 3 biosafety cabinet, and hence is not done in routine practice or by DNA detection using PCR. IFA(indirect fluorescent antibody test) is the most preferred test that identifies antibodies and can differentiate acute and chronic infections.<br><br>The treatment of choice is with doxycycline, which may be substituted for trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole in pregnancy. Doxycycline is given for acute Q-fever as 100mg BD for 14 days. For chronic Q-fever, doxycycline + hydroxychloroquine is given.

There is no zoonosis. It is associated with unhygienic conditions like wars and slum areas. It is also termed five-day fever and is caused by Bartonella quintana.<br><br>Option D: Endemic typhus is caused by Rickettsia typhi and transmitted by Xenopsylla, the flea. The reservoir of the infection is rats. It is a mild sporadic fever that is not of great public health importance. The disease presents with fever and chills.

Hence, repeat HIV testing must be conducted at 3 months and again at 6 months post-exposure to rule out infection.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: 2-drug PEP is incorrect as current guidelines recommend starting 3 drugs rather than 2 drugs immediately.<br><br>Option B: A delay in initiating the prophylaxis may increase the chances of seroconversion.<br><br>Option D: This option is incorrect as the recommended regimen includes 3 drugs and the duration is 28 days.",

It results from defects in the NADPH oxidase complex, a critical enzyme in phagocytes responsible for producing reactive oxygen species (ROS).<br><br>Without functional NADPH oxidase, phagocytes cannot generate superoxide radicals or hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), which are essential for killing engulfed pathogens. This leads to defective intracellular killing, making patients highly susceptible to recurrent infections, particularly with catalase-positive organisms like Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia, Aspergillus, Candida, Salmonella, and Nocardia.<br><br>The dihydrorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometry test, which detects ROS production, is the current gold standard diagnostic tool; the absence of fluorescence indicates impaired NADPH oxidase activity. The older nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test also shows a negative result in CGD due to the same functional defect.<br><br>Management of CGD involves long-term prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals, with bone marrow transplantation as a potentially curative option in severe cases.

They are smaller than mosquitoes. Their body and wings are densely clothed with hair. Their wings are up-right and lanceolate in shape and their legs are longer compared with the size of the body. They hop about and do not fly much. The species of sandfly responsible for transmitting the disease kala-azar is Phlebotomus argentipes. <br><br>Kala-azar is a chronic and potentially fatal disease if left untreated. It presents with prolonged fever, weight loss, massive hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia due to bone marrow suppression and splenic sequestration. The disease is endemic in parts of South Asia, East Africa, and South America. Diagnosis is often supported by rapid antigen tests (e.g., rK39), and confirmation may involve the detection of amastigotes in tissue samples. Amphotericin B is the first-line drug used in India. <br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option A: Aedes mosquito exhibits hunchback, wings are unspotted, has long legs and scaled wings with a prominent proboscis; transmits dengue, and chikungunya.  It has white stripes on the body and is often and referred to as the “Tiger mosquito”.<br><br>Option C: Tsetse flies or glossinae are the blood-sucking flies that resemble the common houseflies. They are yellow or dark brown in color. When folded, their wings overlap each other like the blade of a scissor. They have a non-retractile proboscis which is rigid and adapted for piercing the skin and sucking the blood. They are vectors for trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness and are only found in regions in Africa.<br><br>Option D: Mansonia mosquitoes are big, black or brown mosquitoes with speckling on their wings and legs. They breed in ponds and lakes containing certain aquatic plants, especially the floating types like Pistia stratiotes and water hyacinth. The disease transmitted by the mansonia species of mosquito is Brugian filariasis.",

It involves the creation of a direct communication between the posterior chamber and the trabecular meshwork, allowing aqueous humor to drain out of the eye. <br><br>An important consequence of PI is that the iris stops bowing forward into the trabecular meshwork, facilitating aqueous drainage. PI is usually performed using an Nd: YAG laser and the opening is at least 150-200 microns for best results. The hole is made in the mid-periphery of the iris in the 11 or 1 o'clock position.

After immediate antagonism of the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia with calcium gluconate, the next step in management of hyperkalemia is rapid reduction of plasma K+ concentration using intravenous insulin.<br><br>The earliest ECG change with hyperkalemia is usually the peaking (“tenting”) of the T waves. With further increases in the serum potassium concentration, the QRS complexes widen, the P waves decrease in amplitude and may disappear, and finally, a sine-wave pattern leads to asystole unless emergency therapy is given. <br><br>The steps of management of hyperkalemia are as follows - <br><br>* Immediate antagonism of the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia: Calcium raises the action potential threshold and reduces excitability, without changing the resting membrane potential, thereby reversing the depolarising blockade due to potassium. 10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate should be infused intravenously over 2-3 minutes with cardiac monitoring. Effects start in 1-3 mins.<br><br>* Rapid reduction of plasma K+ concentration by redistribution into cells: Insulin shifts K+ into the cells; 10 units of intravenous regular insulin followed by 50 ml of 50% dextrose. Effects start in 10-20 minutes. β2-agonists with insulin have additive effects on potassium concentration. 10-20 mg of nebulised albuterol in 4 ml of normal saline, inhaled over 10 minutes. Effects start at 30 mins<br><br>* Removal of potassium: Cation exchange resins such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) exchange Na+ for K+ in the GI tract and increase faecal excretion of K+. 15-30 g of powder in a suspension with 33% sorbitol. Novel intestinal potassium binders have recently become available for the management of hyperkalemia. These agents lack the intestinal toxicity of SPS and are preferred over SPS for the management of hyperkalemia. Hemodialysis is the most reliable and effective method.<br><br>Therapy with intravenous saline may be beneficial in hypovolemic patients with oliguria and decreased distal delivery of Na+, with the associated reductions in renal K+ excretion. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Potassium bicarbonate or potassium citrate  administration is done in cases of hypokalemia. ST depression, prominent U waves, and prolonged repolarization are the ECG changes seen in hypokalemia.<br><br>Option C: Constant intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate or 900 mg of calcium in 1 L of 5% dextrose is used in the treatment of persistent hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia causes prolongation of the QT interval. There is a lengthening of the ST segment, while the T wave (which correlates with the time for repolarisation) remains unaltered.<br><br>Option D: Hypercalcemia causes shortening of the QT interval and a decrease in the ST segment duration. Initial therapy of significant hypercalcemia begins with volume expansion because hypercalcemia invariably leads to dehydration; 4–6 litres of intravenous saline may be required over the first 24 hours.",

      "solution": "Aprepitant is the drug preferred for delayed-onset vomiting after cancer chemotherapy.<br><br>Nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy occur in two phases:<br><br>* The acute phase is seen within 24 hours and occurs in almost all patients receiving chemotherapy. In response to chemotherapeutic agents, the enterochromaffin cells in the small intestine secrete serotonin, which acts on the 5HT3 receptors and causes vomiting. This phase is treated by 5HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron, granisetron, and palonosetron.<br><br>* The delayed phase is seen on days 2-5 and occurs only in some patients. It occurs in response to stimulation of NK-1 receptors by substance P. 5HT3 antagonists are not effective against the delayed phase, and NK-1 receptor antagonists are used in these patients. <br><br>NK-1 receptor antagonists include aprepitant and its parenteral formulation, fosaprepitant, rolapitant, and netupitant. These drugs are usually administered in combination with 5HT3 antagonists and dexamethasone for highly emetogenic chemotherapy. A fixed-dose combination of netupitant and palonosetron has been approved to cover both the acute and delayed phases of post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Granisetron is a 5HT3 receptor antagonist, and is a very effective drug for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced postoperative nausea and vomiting. Granisetron is metabolised predominantly by the liver by the CYP3A family.<br><br>Option C: Domperidone predominantly antagonises the D2 receptor without major involvement of other receptors. It has prokinetic activity and is used to treat nausea and vomiting.<br><br>Option D: Metoclopramide involves 5HT4 receptor agonism, vagal and central 5HT3 antagonism, and possible sensitisation of muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle, in addition to dopamine receptor antagonism. It is used to treat nausea and vomiting that often accompany gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes, such as gastroparesis.",
