      "solution": "The given clinical scenario with histopathology showing golden-brown asbestos bodies with knobbed or beaded ends is due to asbestos exposure. All of the given conditions are caused by exposure to asbestos except anthracosis. Anthracosis is a coal-induced pulmonary lesion seen in coal miners, urban dwellers, and tobacco smokers.<br><br>Asbestosis is a diffuse interstitial fibrosing disease of the lung that occurs due to asbestos exposure. The disease usually manifests after a minimum of 10 years of exposure. Asbestos-related diseases include:<br><br>* Localised fibrous plaques or diffuse pleural fibrosis<br><br>* Recurrent pleural effusions<br><br>* Parenchymal interstitial fibrosis <br><br>* Lung carcinoma<br><br>* Mesotheliomas<br><br>* Laryngeal, ovarian, and colon carcinomas<br><br>* Increased risks for systemic autoimmune diseases<br><br>Clinically, dyspnea and cough can be seen. They can progress to respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and even death. Chest radiograph can show irregular linear densities in the lower lobes, and in late stages, can show a honeycomb pattern.<br><br>Histopathology shows diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and asbestos bodies. These appear as golden brown fusiform or rod-shaped beaded structures with a translucent centre that is made of asbestos fibres coated by a proteinaceous material. They arise when asbestos gets phagocytosed by macrophages. Iron-protein complexes may coat other inorganic particulate matter to form ferruginous bodies.<br><br>The image below shows asbestos bodies.<br><br><img

A swelling is formed due to fluid stagnation in the layers of the scalp beneath the girdle of contact. This is known as caput succedaneum. The swelling is diffuse, boggy, and not limited by the suture lines. No treatment is required as it resolves spontaneously within one week after birth.<br><br>Cephalohematoma is a subperiosteal haemorrhage. It occurs following instrumental delivery. It does not cross suture lines. The swelling appears only several hours after birth. Most cephalohematomas are resorbed within 3 to 4 weeks, depending on their size.<br><br>Subgaleal haemorrhage is a collection of blood under the aponeurosis of the scalp. It occurs mostly in vacuum-assisted deliveries due to tears of the emissary veins which connect to the dural venous sinuses. It can occur in hereditary coagulopathies and is associated with skull fractures. There can be severe blood loss leading to hypovolemia and shock.<br><br>Epidural haemorrhage is usually traumatic in origin. Blood collects between the inner skull and the dura mater.

This is due to the defective catabolism of arginine.<br><br>Gyrate atrophy is an autosomal recessive condition and is caused by a mutation in the OAT gene (chromosome 10q) that encodes the main ornithine degradation enzyme, ornithine aminotransferase. Catabolism of arginine involves the conversion of arginine to ornithine, followed by the transamination of ornithine to glutamate-γ-semialdehyde by ornithine δ-aminotransferase. Mutations in ornithine δ-aminotransferase cause elevated plasma and urinary ornithine levels, which lead to gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina.<br><br>The patient presents with myopia and nyctalopia in adolescence, with a subsequent gradual worsening of vision.

Inflammasome activates caspase 1 and helps in the release of the biologically activated forms of IL-1. Along with caspase 1, caspases 4 and 5 also induce cell death. Unlike classical apoptosis, pyroptosis is characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Options A, B and C: Apoptosis- The intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic death receptor-initiated pathways converge to activate a caspase cascade that mediates the final phase of apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway activates caspase 9, whereas the extrinsic pathway activates caspases 8 and 10. These caspases then activate caspase 3 and caspase 6. Activated caspases cause DNA degradation and nuclei fragmentation.<br><br>Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent distinct pathway of cell death induced by lipid peroxidation.

Like necrosis, it is characterized by loss of ATP, cellular and organelle swelling, the release of lysosomal enzymes, and rupture of the plasma membrane.

This distension activates the atrial stretch receptors, which transmit the afferent signals to the medulla via the vagus nerve.

It can also be activated during myocardial infarction and on exposure to radioactive dyes during coronary angiography. This reflex is characterized by profound brady­cardia, hypotension, and a brief period of apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing. <br><br>Option B: Pulmonary chemoreflex is due to the stimulation of the J-receptors (C receptors/juxta-pulmonary capillary receptors) which are stimulated when there is hyperinflation of the lung. This produces reflex apnea followed by a rapid increase in breathing rate, bradycardia, and hypotension.<br><br>Option D: Cushing's reflex is seen when the intracranial pressure is raised where the blood supply to ventrolateral medulla neurons is compromised.

This leads to the accumulation of cholesterol esters and triglycerides in most of the visceral organs, leading to the above symptoms. Patients present in the first few weeks of life with failure to thrive, vomiting, abdominal distention, steatorrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and hyperlipidemia with extensive bilateral calcifications of the adrenal glands.<br><br>LAL deficiency can present in two forms- Wolman disease and cholesterol ester storage disease. Cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD) is less severe and usually presents late in adulthood, whereas Wolman disease presents within the first few weeks of life and results in death within the first 6 months of life. <br><br>Wolman disease can be diagnosed by measuring LAL activity in peripheral leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts.<br><br>Treatment involves enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with Sebelipase alfa which was recently approved by the FDA. It is given every other week at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight and has the potential to prolong survival in patients with CESD and save lives in those with severe Wolman syndrome.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Abetalipoproteinemia is a hypolipoproteinemia caused by a defect in the MTTP gene that catalyzes the transfer of triglycerides to nascent ApoB particles in the ER. It is associated with severe fat malabsorption/ steatorrhea from birth. There is a decrease in the plasma levels of cholesterol (<50 mg/dL) and triglycerides (<20 mg/dL). As a result, there is marked accumulation of triglycerides in the intestinal villous enterocytes due to the absence of chylomicron and VLDL formation. <br><br>Option B: Farber disease results from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase. Thus, ceramide accumulates in various tissues, especially the joints. Symptoms include painful joint swelling and nodule formation, resembling rheumatoid arthritis within the first year of life.<br><br>Option D: Tangier’s disease is a hypolipoproteinemia caused by a mutation of the ABCA1 gene. Low HDL levels are seen.

Straight Leg Raising Test (SLRT) or Lasegue sign<br><br>This is done to assess nerve root irritation in the lumbosacral area.  The patient is made to lie on the back with the head extended, with hips and legs in the neutral position. The affected leg is then passively and slowly raised by the ankle with the knee fully extended. The examiner stops further leg elevation when pain is elicited. Normally, it should be possible to raise the limb to 80–90 degrees. The SLRT test is positive if the patient develops pain when the leg is between 30 and 60/70 degrees from horizontal. The pain should be radicular type and radiating to the back of the thigh or to the calf.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/21c521e2b1604f82adf915631ce0d66cx1279x1414.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>2.

Crossed SLRT (or well-leg raising test or Fajersztajn sign)<br><br>When SLRT is performed on the unaffected side, the patient may feel pain on the affected side.

Low tidal volume ventilation has shown mortality benefits in the treatment of this condition.<br><br>ARDS refers to an acute onset and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema that occurs due to endothelial injury in the pulmonary capillaries due to inflammation. The diagnostic criteria for ARDS include:<br><br>* PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 300 mmHg<br><br>* Acute onset (within 1 week of a clinical insult)<br><br>* Chest radiograph shows diffuse bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema<br><br>* Absence of any left atrial hypertension (ie, pulmonary edema is not due to a cardiac cause)<br><br>Conditions associated with direct lung injury like pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, pulmonary contusion, near-drowning and toxic inhalational injury are associated with ARDS. Systemic conditions causing indirect lung injury and ARDS include sepsis, severe trauma (head injury, burns, multiple bone fractures), multiple blood transfusions, and pancreatitis.<br><br>The chest radiograph of a patient with ARDS will show diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema that can be difficult to distinguish from left ventricular failure. <br><br>The main treatment strategy that has been shown to reduce mortality in patients is low tidal volume ventilation (6 mL/kg of predicted body weight). Conventional tidal volume ventilation leads to overdistension injury because the lung in ARDS is already consolidated and any attempt to push more air through it will lead to barotrauma. Apart from this, high PEEP, prone position, selective use of neuromuscular blockade, and use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)  may also be useful.

This condition is transient and resolves in 2 to 6 weeks, even if the patient is not treated.<br><br>This condition is also known as painful subacute thyroiditis, de Quervain thyroiditis, and migratory thyroiditis (this is because the pain can shift to different locations in the thyroid). It is subacute granulomatous thyroiditis that occurs secondary to viral infections. Many viruses, such as mumps, influenza, coxsackie, adenoviruses, and echoviruses, have been clinically implicated in this condition. Peak incidence is observed at 30-50 years, and women are generally affected three times more often than men.<br><br>The histopathology image depends on the stage of the disease. The earlier picture shows the presence of granulomas in the thyroid gland. Aggregates of lymphocytes, activated macrophages, and plasma cells, and damaged thyroid follicles can be seen. Multinucleate giant cells encircle pools of colloid, hence the name granulomatous thyroiditis. Clinically, it presents as a painfully enlarged thyroid and is sometimes accompanied by fever.<br><br>It has three distinct phases:<br><br>* Thyrotoxic phase<br><br>* Hypothyroid phase<br><br>* Recovery phase<br><br>There may be raised inflammatory markers, absent thyroid antibodies, serum T4 may be high, normal or slightly raised, and I123 uptake of the gland is low. The thyroid hormone levels are increased from the release of the preformed hormone from the damaged thyroid cells, and not from excessive production, and therefore, antithyroid medications are not effective. The low iodine uptake and the tenderness of the thyroid confirm the diagnosis of subacute (painful) thyroiditis.<br><br>It is treated with large doses of aspirin, NSAIDs, steroids, and/or beta-blockers to relieve the observable clinical symptoms. Antithyroid drugs do not have any role. In case the hypothyroid phase is prolonged, levothyroxine can be used.<br><br>Other options: <br><br>Options A, B and D: Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease that presents as painless enlargement of the thyroid associated with some degree of hypothyroidism in middle-aged women. Hurthle cells are seen in Hashimoto thyroiditis.<br><br>The slide shows the picture of Hashimoto thyroiditis, with<br><br>* Follicular destruction<br><br>* Reduced colloid with increased interstitial connective tissue<br><br>* Small lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration<br><br>* A well-developed germinal centre may be seen<br><br>* Atrophied thyroid follicles, lined by epithelial cells, which contain eosinophilic granular cytoplasm.

This is followed by oxidation, organification, and coupling reaction.<br><br>Steps in synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone: <br><br>* Iodide uptake: The basolateral sodium-iodide symporter (Option 3) actively takes up I- (iodide) from the circulation into the follicular cells. The process of concentrating iodide in the cell is known as iodide trapping. Iodide is then transported into the colloid through a pendrin (chloride-iodide) transporter (Option 5).<br><br>* Thyroglobulin synthesis: Thyroglobulin (Tg), is a large glycoprotein rich in tyrosine residues. It is synthesized by the thyrocytes and secreted into colloids.<br><br>* Iodination of thyroglobulin: This is regulated by the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) enzyme. TPO has three functions: <br><br>* Oxidation (Option 1): TPO oxidizes iodine in the presence of H2O2 <br><br>* Organification (Option 4): TPO links tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin with iodine (I2) to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT), diiodotyrosine (DIT)<br><br>* Coupling reactions (Option 2): TPO combines iodinated tyrosine residues to make MIT + DIT = T3 (triiodothyronine), DIT + DIT = T4 (tetraiodothyronine)<br><br>* Storage: Thyroid hormones are bound to thyroglobulin and stored in the follicular lumen as colloids. The colloid has hormone reserves for 2-3 months<br><br>* Release: Iodinated thyroglobulin is cleaved by lysosomal proteolytic enzymes in the colloid from the thyroid cells. This releases thyroxine and triiodothyronine into the peripheral blood. <br><br>* Peripheral T3 conversion: T4 undergoes deiodination in extrathyroidal tissue to form T3, which is the active form of the hormone.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e457ac295ff24185aded01a37f9e93edx1200x1687.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

Histones are subjected to a wide range of specific posttranslational modifications. These modifications are dynamic and reversible. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are best understood.<br><br>Acetylation typically occurs on lysine residues located in the amino-terminal tails of histone proteins and is consistently associated with active transcription or the potential for gene activation. This modification reduces the positive charge on the histone tails, thereby weakening their interaction with the negatively charged DNA. As a result, the chromatin structure becomes more relaxed, allowing greater access to the underlying DNA.<br><br>These covalent modifications of histones also serve as docking sites for other regulatory proteins, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. These complexes often contain specific structural domains that recognize and bind to histones modified by coregulatory enzymes. Once recruited, these complexes can reposition, remove, or alter nucleosomes, further increasing access to nearby DNA regions.<br><br>Chromatin modifiers (which add or remove chemical groups) and chromatin remodelers (which shift or restructure histones) cooperate to \"open\" gene promoters and regulatory elements. This enables the binding of key transcriptional components, such as transcriptional activators, RNA polymerase II, and general transcription factors (GTFs), facilitating gene expression.<br><br>Conversely, histone deacetylation carried out by transcriptional corepressors typically leads to chromatin compaction and reduced gene accessibility.",

Hence, Ca2+ ions replace the sites on albumin that were bound by H+, decreasing ionic Ca2+. The decreased transient ionic calcium due to increased binding of Ca2+ to albumin causes sensory and  motor symptoms. It could be prevented by a rebreathing bag, which prevents the excess washout of CO2, hence balances the pH from becoming alkaline. <br><br>Patients with hypocalcemia may present with a range of symptoms depending on the severity and duration of calcium deficiency. While mild hypocalcemia may be asymptomatic, moderate to severe hypocalcemia is typically associated with neuromuscular irritability, leading to paresthesias in the fingers, toes, and around the mouth. Physical signs include a positive Chvostek’s sign—twitching of the facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped and a positive Trousseau’s sign, demonstrated by carpal spasm upon inflating a blood pressure cuff above systolic pressure for several minutes. In severe cases, hypocalcemia may cause carpopedal spasms, seizures, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, and prolongation of the QT interval on ECG. These features are characteristic and clinically significant in the diagnosis and management of hypocalcemia.",
