The lateral surface is covered by a sheet of fascia which forms the hemicapsule of the tonsil which is an extension of the pharyngobasilar fascia. The paratonsillar vein lies in the loose areolar tissue on the lateral surface of the capsule, which is the plane of dissection during a tonsillectomy, hence there is a risk of damaging the vein during tonsillectomy. The structures lateral to the vein form the tonsillar bed. <br><br>The main arterial supply to the tonsils is from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery.

The tonsils and tonsillar fossa are supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve.

However, when hypoalbuminemia is present, the anion gap can be falsely low, as albumin is a major unmeasured anion.

If a patient has low albumin (hypoalbuminemia), the AG must be adjusted. For every 1 g/dL decrease in albumin below the normal level (4.5 g/dL), add 2.5 mmol/L to the uncorrected AG. For example, if a patient has an albumin level of 2.5 g/dL (2 g/dL below normal) and an uncorrected AG of 15, you calculate the corrected AG by adding 5 mmol/L (2.5 × 2 = 5) to the uncorrected AG.

There are two indications for the device:<br><br>* As bridging treatment<br><br>* As destination treatment<br><br>Bridging treatment refers to a temporary setup whereby individuals who need a cardiac transplant are provided with a LVAD until a suitable donor can be identified and recepient can be declared fit for transplantation. Bridge or temporising measures are required frequently as donor hearts are few and the demand for them is high.<br><br>Destination treatment is a newer approach with LVAD as a permanent solution to cardiac problems. With advancement in technology, LVAD complications have reduced significantly along with a reduction in the bulk and increase in the portability and servability of the device, so new versions of LVAD are aiming to be the final solution rather than a bridge. LVAD in the future may replace cardiac transplant in a select patient population. <br><br>A typical patient requiring LVAD includes any of the following features: with multiple hospitalizations for drug-resistant heart failure requiring inotropic support, with NYHA 3-4 symptoms with possible end organ damage due to poor perfusion. Examples of LVADs are HeartMate 2, HeartMate 3, etc. <br><br>An LVAD essentially comprises a pump and tubing connecting this pump to the left ventricle and the aorta.

The pathophysiology for the same is amniotic fluid embolism causing pulmonary vasoconstriction and right ventricular failure.<br><br>Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is an obstetric emergency caused by the entry of amniotic fluid, fetal cells, or debris into the maternal circulation. It typically occurs during labor, delivery, or immediately after delivery. Amniotic fluid emboli occlude pulmonary circulation, causing intense pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased pulmonary artery pressures. This leads to acute right ventricular failure (RVF) and reduced pulmonary blood flow, impairing oxygenation and causing sudden hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The failing RV cannot pump blood effectively, causing systemic hypotension and cardiogenic shock.<br><br>The diagnosis is clinical and the classic triad of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) includes abrupt hemodynamic collapse, respiratory distress, and consumptive coagulopathy (DIC). The diagnostic criteria for amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) include:<br><br>* Onset occurs during labor or within 30 minutes of placental delivery.<br><br>* Abrupt hypotension, respiratory distress, or cardiac arrest.<br><br>* Coagulopathy: Presence of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).<br><br>* No fever ≥38°C, ruling out infectious causes.<br><br>Treatment is supportive and includes immediate cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation if needed.

It is most commonly seen in the age group of 4-8 years. The incidence is more in boys than girls. It is usually unilateral disease but can occur bilaterally in 10% of the cases. Risk factors include low birth weight, passive smoking, family history, low socioeconomic status, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Perthes disease is associated with thrombophilia, protein C and S deficiencies.<br><br>The disease is characterized by the disruption of blood flow to the femoral head due to which the bone goes for osteonecrosis and stops growing. The lateral epiphyseal artery, a branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery is involved. Over time, healing and fibrosis occur by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and weakening of the femoral head. <br><br>Clinical features include pain and limping. Pain aggravates on doing any activity and relieves by rest. Physical examination reveals pain on passive movement of the hip and abduction with internal rotation movement is limited.<br><br>Xray findings depend on the stages <br><br>* Initial phase: Medial joint space widening and increased density in the ossific nucleus<br><br>* Fragmentation phase: Alternating patches of sclerosis and fibrosis<br><br>* Re-ossification phase: Complete removal of necrotic bone.

The symptoms include epigastric and lower abdominal pain, diarrhoea (rarely bloody), vomiting, flatulence and distention, weight loss, and increased blood and iron loss.<br><br>Chronic infection leads to growth retardation and nutritional deficiencies. Some patients, particularly young children, may develop rectal prolapse.<br><br>Around 0.005 ml of blood is lost per day per worm. In heavy infections, as much as 4 to 5 ml can be lost per day per worm. Treatment includes mebendazole or albendazole.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Trichinella spiralis is sometimes also known as pork worm since the infection is acquired by consuming raw or undercooked pork. The larvae more commonly infect active muscles like the diaphragm, tongue, intercostals, extraocular muscles,<br><br>Option C: Enterobius vermicularis, also known as pinworm, lives in the cecum and appendix. Infection is by ingestion of eggs or autoinfection. Detection of eggs by NIH swabs and cellophane scotch tape method. <br><br>Option D: Ascaris lumbricoides is the largest nematode infecting humans. The infective form is the embryonated egg containing rhabditiform larva.

The y axis (e.g., 100, 200, etc.) indicates the degree of receptor response based on ligand binding. In the absence of any ligand, the receptor maintains a basal (constitutive) activity level, set arbitrarily at 100 units (because even without an agonist, some receptors are in the Ra (active) state and producing a response).<br><br>The affinity of a drug determines the concentration needed to form a specific number of drug-receptor associations. A higher affinity means less concentration is required compared to a drug with a lower affinity. In contrast, intrinsic activity refers to the drug's ability to induce functional changes in the receptor.<br><br>* Agonists have both affinity and maximal intrinsic activity (IA = 1), like adrenaline, histamine, and morphine (but there is no concept of \"supramaximal IA\", as no drug can exceed a receptor's maximum capacity). Full agonists shift the equilibrium toward Ra, increasing activity significantly (e.g., 200 units).<br><br>* Partial agonists have affinity with submaximal intrinsic activity (IA between 0 and 1); examples include dichloroisoproterenol (β-adrenergic receptor) and buspirone (5-HT1A receptor). Partial agonists also shift the balance toward Ra, but to a lesser extent (e.g., 150 units).<br><br>* Competitive antagonists, such as propranolol, atropine, and naloxone, have affinity but no intrinsic activity (IA = 0). These bind equally to Ra and Ri, maintaining the basal activity at 100 without increasing or decreasing it.<br><br>* Inverse agonists bind to a receptor and reduce its basal activity (IA between 0 and -1). Unlike antagonists, which only block receptor activity, inverse agonists actively suppress it. These selectively bind Ri (inactive state), shifting the equilibrium left and reducing the receptor’s constitutive activity.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/bab171a78a86473abe1ae67eb54c70b2x1280x1252.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

Even irrigating the wound with cetrimide + chlorhexidine solution can be done. This process eliminates the residual virus in the wound.<br><br>* Suturing- Bite wounds are not sutured generally. If suturing is necessary, it is done after 24-48 hours under the cover of local infiltration of the rabies immunoglobulin which is generally done in category III wounds.<br><br>* Other measures- Local

This stage is known as rest pain.

      "solution": "Based on the clinical presentation of an adolescent who is diabetic and has cardiomegaly presenting with dysarthria and ataxia and neurological assessment showing absence of deep tendon reflexes(DTR), bilateral Babinski signs positive with no loss of muscle tone, most likely points to Friedreich's ataxia.<br><br>Friedreich's ataxia is the most common inherited ataxia, representing half of all hereditary ataxia cases, and occurs as a classic form or one associated with a Vitamin E deficiency syndrome. Onset is before 25 years of age. Clinical presentation, which is akin to non-compressive myelopathy, includes the following features:<br><br>* Progressive ataxia( staggering gait and frequent falls)<br><br>* Titubation(involuntary head nodding) <br><br>* Ataxic dysarthria<br><br>* Preferential lower limb involvement<br><br>* Skeletal deformities like Scoliosis, pes cavus, pes equinovarus<br><br>* Heart problems: cardiomegaly, hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, and conduction defects<br><br>* Early onset diabetes mellitus due to beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance<br><br>* Neurological assessment showing absent DTR, bilateral extensor plantar response, weakness(more distal than proximal), preserved muscle tone in trunk and lower limbs<br><br>* Nystagmus and loss of fast saccadic eye movements<br><br>* Some cases may have varying degrees of mental retardation<br><br>Imaging with MRI shows spinal cord atrophy including sclerosis and degeneration of spinocerebellar, lateral corticospinal, and posterior tracts, some atrophy of the cerebellum and cerebral gyri, and loss of large myelinated fibers in peripheral nerves.<br><br>Diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing for an abnormally high number of trinucleotide repeats \" GAA\" in the first intron of the Frataxin gene. Expansion of trinucleotide GAA repeats, ( normally 7-22, increased to 200-900 in disease) results in loss of function mutation in the Frataxin gene, responsible for iron homeostasis in mitochondria. Very low levels of frataxin mRNA expression cause mitochondrial iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and damage resulting in the disease.<br><br>Treatment is usually symptomatic. Vitamin E supplementation is beneficial in a small subset of patients with concomitant deficiency.<br><br>Other Options:<br><br>Option A: Syringomyelia is a cavitatory expansion of the spinal cord's central canal. It is frequently associated with Arnold-Chiari malformation and the location is usually a lower cervical level.  Clinically presents in adolescence with cervico-thoracic scoliosis, central cord syndrome with cape-like dissociative loss of sensation in upper limbs( pain and temperature lost while touch and vibration are preserved), areflexic weakness of upper limbs, muscle wasting in lower neck, shoulder and arms,  trigeminal sensory impairment, etc.<br><br>Option B: Subacute combined degeneration of the cord occurs due to Vitamin B12 deficiency and involves posterior columns and lateral spinothalamic and corticospinal tracts. Clinical features are tingling and numbness of distal extremities with eventual loss of sensation, Babinski positive and loss of reflexes. There is no diabetes or cardiomegaly. Diagnosis is confirmed by peripheral smear, CBC and vitamin B12 assays.<br><br>Option C: Acute transverse myelitis is an extensive spinal cord inflammation and demyelination resulting in sensorimotor and autonomic(bladder/bowel symptoms) spinal cord dysfunction. It occurs acutely after vaccination or infections and subacutely in multiple sclerosis patients.<br><br>Pearl PM2077: Neuropathic Disorders<br><br>Hereditary neuropathic disorders <br><br>* Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Most common hereditary neuropathy)<br><br>* Tangier disease<br><br>* Friedreich’s ataxia<br><br>* Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy<br><br>* Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP)<br><br>* Hereditary Neuralgic Amyotrophy (HNA)<br><br>* Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy (HSAN)<br><br>* Fabry’s disease (angiokeratoma corporis diffusum)<br><br>* Refsum’s disease<br><br>Causes of acquired neuropathies<br><br>* Primary or AL amyloidosis<br><br>* Diabetic neuropathy<br><br>* Hypothyroidism<br><br>* Sjögren’s syndrome<br><br>* Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<br><br>* Scleroderma, Sarcoidosis<br><br>* Infectious (VZV,CMV,EBV,Hepatitis, HIV, Diphtheria, Leprosy) <br><br>* Inflammatory bowel disease<br><br>* Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP)<br><br>Pearl PM2051: Difference between various causes of ataxia<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Friedreich's </strong><strong>ataxia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong> Tabes </strong><strong>dorsalis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong> SACD</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tract </td>\n<td>\n<p>Posterior column</p>\n<p>Pyramidal </p>\n<p>Spinocerebellar tracts </p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Posterior column</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Posterior column</p>\n<p>Pyramidal </p>\n<p>Peripheral nerves</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vibration sense</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent</p>\n</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n<td>Absent </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Proprioception</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent</p>\n</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pain/Temperature</td>\n<td>\n<p>Present</p>\n</td>\n<td>Present</td>\n<td>Present</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deep tendon reflex</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent</p>\n</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n<td>Present.

CLL is the most common leukemia of adults in the western world. The median age of diagnosis is 60 years. The most common genetic anomalies seen are deletions of 13q14.3, 11q, and 17p and trisomy 12q. Loss of tumor-suppressor genes in chromosome 13 results in overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2.<br><br>The growth of CLL/SLL cells is confined to the proliferation centers (pathognomonic for CLL/SLL), where the tumor cells receive critical factors from the surrounding environments, such as NF-κB for cell survival, MYC for cell growth, and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling pathway.<br><br>The tumor cells express CD19, CD20, CD23, and CD5. Smudge cells are also characteristic of CLL. Clinical features include easy fatiguability, weight loss, anorexia, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and hemolytic anemia.

Its terminal branches(crow feet) do not usually reach until the antrum.

      "solution": "The incorrect statement is \"High medullary blood flow helps in the countercurrent mechanism\" as high medullary blood flow reduces the concentration ability by washing out the solutes.<br><br>The kidney's ability to concentrate urine depends not only on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) but also on the hyperosmolarity of the renal medulla. This hyperosmolarity is critical for the counter-current multiplication mechanism, which allows water to be reabsorbed from the collecting ducts under the influence of ADH.<br><br>If medullary blood flow increases excessively, it can \"wash out\" the solutes that create the osmotic gradient in the medullary interstitium. This reduces the osmolarity of the medulla, impairing the kidney's ability to reabsorb water effectively. Consequently, the counter-current mechanism becomes less efficient, leading to a decreased ability to concentrate urine.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: The countercurrent multiplier in the loop of Henle is an active process. The descending and ascending limbs have selective permeabilities for water & solutes and are responsible for establishing an osmotic gradient. The movement of Na+ and Cl− out of the thick ascending limb is through active transport.<br><br>Option B: The thick ascending limb is impermeable to water but actively transports Na⁺, K⁺, and Cl⁻ into the medullary interstitium. This helps generate the osmotic gradient necessary for water reabsorption in the collecting ducts.<br><br>Option C: Recirculation of urea plays an important role in maintaining the medullary interstitial gradient  Urea moves from the inner medullary collecting ducts into the medullary interstitium via facilitated diffusion.<br><br>Image showing the counter-current mechanism in the kidney:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b34e70c723ba42f68ae76843be1bb584x1280x1806.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM1335: Renal tubule characteristics<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">\n<p><strong>Segments </strong></p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">\n<p><strong>Active NaCl Transport </strong></p>\n</td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">\n<p><strong>Permeability </strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>H<sub>2</sub>0</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>NaCl</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Urea</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Proximal tubule</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>++</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>++</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Thin descending limb</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>++</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Thin ascending limb</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Thick ascending limb</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>++</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Distal tubule</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+ADH</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Cortical collecting duct</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+ADH</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Inner medullary collecting duct</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+ADH</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>+ADH</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>KEY: ADH, antidiuretic hormone; NaCl, sodium chloride; 0, minimal level of active transport or permeability; +, moderate level of active transport or permeability; ++, high level of active transport or permeability; +ADH, permeability to water or urea is increased by ADH.",

      "solution": "A pet bird shop owner with cough and dyspnea for the last 3 weeks, with diffuse ground glass opacities on HRCT, CD4+/CD8+ ratio < 1 is likely suggestive is hypersensitivity pneumonitis. <br><br>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) occurs due to inhalational exposure to a number of antigens, causing inflammation of the alveoli and the small airways. The cause of the inflammation is dysregulated Th1 and Th17 immune response (type IV hypersensitivity). Antigens derived from fungal, bacterial, mycobacterial, bird-derived, and chemical sources have all been implicated in causing HP. Bird fancier’s lung must be considered in patients with history of pet birds and is precipitated by exposure to antigens derived from feathers, droppings, and serum proteins. <br><br>HP has been divided into 3 forms depending on the clinical manifestations:<br><br>* Acute HP manifests within 8 hours of exposure to the antigen. The symptoms include fever with chills, malaise, and dyspnea. There is complete resolution of the symptoms within hours to days if there is no further exposure to the antigen. <br><br>* In subacute HP, the systemic and pulmonary symptoms develop insidiously over a few weeks, like in this patient. Complete resolution of symptoms is seen here as well, but it takes a longer time. <br><br>* Chronic HP presents with an even slower course — with cough, dyspnea, weight loss, and clubbing of digits. Unlike other forms, there is permanent impairment of the airways to some extent in chronic HP. This is irreversible and does not respond to the removal of inciting agents from the patient's environment. <br><br>In subacute HP, HRCT shows poorly defined centrilobular nodules, background ground-glass opacification and lobular areas of air trapping. In chronic HP, ancillary findings such as coexisting areas of mosaic attenuation and air trapping. Furthermore, fibrosis can manifest as reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing. Although subpleural honeycombing may be observed, unlike idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the bases of the lungs are typically spared. Either obstructive or restrictive patterns may be seen on pulmonary function testing. Detection of IgG antibodies against specific antigens is an adjunctive investigation in the diagnosis of HP.<br><br>Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage shows a CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio < 1 in most cases of HP. Lung biopsy shows the formation of noncaseating granulomas, but they are poorly defined.<br><br>The mainstay of treatment of HP is avoidance of the offending antigen. However, in subacute and chronic forms of the disease, there is a role of steroids as well. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Sarcoidosis is characterized by well-defined noncaseating granulomas, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio of >1 in BAL. Furthermore, the presence of a clear-cut risk factor (exposure to birds) in this patient makes the diagnosis more likely to be HP.<br><br>Option B: Tuberculosis will present as upper lobe infiltrates with cavitation on CT scan. The sputum smear microscopy will be positive for acid-fast bacilli and nucleic acid amplification test.<br><br>Option D: Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis is characterized by a necrotizing granulomatous small vessel vasculitis with a history of bronchial asthma and peripheral eosinophilia. CT findings typically include bilateral peripheral parenchymal opacification (shown in image below), bronchial wall thickening and pulmonary nodules.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/eb5a8684a1544823b0c2b922ad39ad52x770x385.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM0009: Named lung diseases<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Bagassosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>Pneumoconiosis due to sugarcane</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Byssinosis (brown lung disease/ Monday fever)</td>\n<td>Pneumoconiosis due to cotton fiber</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Farmer’s lung</td>\n<td>Pneumoconiosis due to Thermophilic actinomycetes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bird Fancier’s lung</td>\n<td>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by bird droppings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chalicosis (flint disease) </td>\n<td>In stonecutters, due to inhalation of fine particles of stone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Caplan’s syndrome</td>\n<td> RA + pneumoconiosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lofgren's syndrome</td>\n<td>An acute presentation of sarcoidosis, consisting of arthritis, erythema nodosum, and bilateral hilar adenopathy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bornholm’s disease (epidemic pleurodynia)</td>\n<td>associated with Coxsackie B virus</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Pearl PM0149: HRCT Findings in Interstitial Lung Diseases<br><br>ATS/ERS Classification of Interstitial Lung Disease (2024)<br><br>1.

Hence, the most important diagnostic investigation for this patient is cystourethroscopy. <br><br>It facilitates the visualization of any abnormality on the surface of the bladder and aids in taking biopsy samples. It is also used for transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) and to follow up on patients with carcinoma in situ.<br><br>Bladder carcinoma is characterized by painless, gross hematuria, which is the most important symptom. It might lead to the formation of clots and subsequent urinary retention. Increased frequency and discomfort during urination may also be seen. Bladder carcinoma can lead to pelvic pain due to extravesical spread, loin pain due to hydronephrosis, and suprapubic pain due to nerve involvement.<br><br>Smoking and exposure to urothelial carcinogens such as benzidine and naphthylamine are some of the most important risk factors. Bladder cancer is also increasingly prevalent in people working in the textile, leather, and dye industries.  <br><br>Depending upon the depth of invasion, bladder carcinoma is classified into 3 types:<br><br>* Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (70%) are exophytic tumors that grow into the bladder cavity.<br><br>* Muscle-invasive bladder cancers are large irregular ulcers with a broad base.<br><br>* Flat, non-invasive carcinoma in situ is characterized by the presence of irregularly arranged cells that have large nuclei.<br><br>Urine cytology that shows the presence of malignant cells is highly sensitive. Complete urinary tract imaging with CT and MRI is used to assess extravesical spread and metastasis.

Not for initial diagnosis.<br><br>Option B: Non-contrast CT and MRI are used for the clinical staging of the disease prior to treatment options like TURBT. It can also be used to detect renal cancer, but it is unlikely as there is no palpable mass, no flank pain, and no USG masses.<br><br>Option D: Intravenous urography studies show a filling defect.

Tetanizing frequency is equal to 1/contraction period. The contraction period is the time taken from the latent period to the maximum force of contraction.<br><br>In this case, the time tracer was taken using a 100Hz tuning fork, which means it recorded 100 waves per second. Therefore, the duration of each wave in the time tracer is 0.01 seconds.<br><br>In the image given in the question, between the point B (end of latent period) to point C (maximum force of contraction), there are about 4 waves. Hence, the duration of contraction = 4 x 0.01 = 0.04 seconds. Substituting the value in the formula, we get: Tetanizing frequency = 1/0.04 sec = 100/4 = 25 Hz.<br><br>There are two types of tetanus: complete tetanus, in which no relaxation occurs between stimuli, and incomplete tetanus, in which incomplete relaxation occurs between the summated stimuli. <br><br>When a repeated stimulus to a muscle fiber occurs before relaxation, it produces an additional contraction of the muscle. The second contraction adds to the first contraction, increasing the total strength of the contraction. This phenomenon is known as a summation of contractions.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/9ddd2f0f140a4827a82e6786fa25e5cax1280x3196.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

The given clinical scenario of the patient with the renal biopsy showing amyloid deposits (apple green birefringence under polarised light) suggests a diagnosis of reactive systemic amyloidosis. <br><br>Reactive systemic amyloidosis (previously called secondary amyloidosis) is seen as secondary to a chronic inflammatory condition. While tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and chronic osteomyelitis were the predominant underlying diseases before, rheumatoid arthritis and other connective tissue disorders are now seen more frequently. Reactive amyloidosis can also occur in association with solid tumours such as renal cell carcinoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. <br><br>During inflammation, increased levels of cytokines like IL-1 and IL-6 stimulate the production of serum amyloid-associated (SAA) protein in the liver. SAA is normally degraded to soluble end products by action of monocyte-derived enzymes. Some patients have a defect in this enzymatic pathway or have a genetic structural defect in the structure of the SAA molecule itself. These patients are at high risk of developing reactive systemic amyloidosis due to AA protein deposition.<br><br>Patients with amyloidosis initially have non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss, and light-headedness. In time, manifestations related to the end-organ affected develop. This includes proteinuria due to renal involvement, which can progress to cause uremia and renal failure. Cardiac amyloidosis may present as congestive heart failure or arrhythmias. Amyloidosis of the tongue may cause dysphagia and speech difficulty.<br><br>The diagnosis depends on the histological demonstration of amyloid in the tissues. The most common sites for taking biopsies are the kidney (when renal manifestations are present) or rectal or gingival tissues. Abdominal fat aspirate can also be done for systemic amyloidosis.

ETS-TMPRSS2 fusion is the most common genetic alteration observed in the prostate and about half of all prostate cancers show this rearrangement. <br><br>Prostate adenocarcinoma occurs in the prostatic epithelium after exposure to risk factors such as androgen stimulation, chronic inflammation, germline MYC variants, a Western diet, and polymorphisms in glutathione-S-transferase, which is responsible for detoxifying polycyclic hydrocarbons.<br><br>These risk factors contribute to the acquisition of hallmark mutations that act as driver and passenger mutations for neoplasm. The usual order in which these mutations is believed to occur is as follows:<br><br>* TMPRSS-ETS fusion, Critical telomere shortening and GSTP1 gene hypermethylation result in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia(PIN), a recognized precursor lesion for carcinoma.<br><br>* Loss of p27 results in conversion of PIN to localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate.<br><br>* PTEN loss combined with activation of telomerases results in metastatic carcinoma of the prostate.<br><br>*  Aggressive prostate cancers result from further mutations in TP53, MYC, Androgen receptor and RB. Androgen receptor mutations make these tumours resistant to hormonal therapy and also make them independent of solely androgen receptor stimulated growth.<br><br>Advanced prostate cancer has a propensity for osteoblastic (bone forming) metastasis as shown in the above CT scan.

Class switching refers to the genetic recombination event in which the heavy-chain constant segment of the IgM gene is replaced with a different constant segment that leads to a different type of antibody being produced (e.g. IgG, IgA, IgE, etc.).<br><br>Mutation in the gene that codes for CD40 ligand will impair class switching of the IgM antibodies to any other antibody type, and this results in relatively higher levels of IgM. Frequent infections of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract result from lower levels of other antibodies. Elevated IgM antibodies can sometimes react with blood cells, causing autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.

      "solution": "The correct answer is that both assertion and reason are true and reason explains the assertion.<br><br>The assertion states that activating mutations in FGF23 cause hypophosphatemia due to phosphaturia. This statement is true and can be substantiated by Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets(ADHR), a rare condition where activating mutations in FGF23 cause reduced serum phosphorus levels due to phosphate loss in urine.<br><br>FGF23 is responsible for hypophosphatemia by at least two mechanisms. Like PTH, it causes reduced phosphate reabsorption in the PCT due to reduced expression of phosphate transporters in the apical membrane.<br><br>Secondly, it reduces the hydroxylation of vitamin D precursors to their active form, reducing active Vitamin D levels in the body and resulting in hypophosphatemia. <br><br>The reason states that control of serum phosphate is determined mainly by renal tubular reabsorption. This statement is also true. The control of serum phosphate is by renal tubular reabsorption by various phosphate transporters like NaPi-2a and NaPi-2c. Filtered load of phosphate is 4-6 g/d and fractional excretion of phosphate is generally in the 10-15 percent range.<br><br>Dietary levels of phosphate are reflected in serum phosphate levels. Normal serum phosphate level in turn, is maintained by the kidney as urinary phosphate excretion is not constant and varies with dietary intake.<br><br>Higher phosphate absorption in the intestine causes an increase in serum levels of FGF23 which in turn induces phosphaturia by altering apical expression of phosphate transporters. Reduced dietary intake reduces urinary phosphate excretion by a similar mechanism. Hence, renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate, which is controlled by FGF23, is the controller of serum phosphate levels.  The assertion is explained by the reason.<br><br>Other evidence of the role of FGF23 in phosphate metabolism is:<br><br>* In X-linked Hypophosphatemic rickets(XLH), mutations in the PHEX gene cause overexpression of FGF23 and high serum FGF23 levels, which in turn induce phosphaturia resulting in hypophosphatemia.<br><br>* In Tumour Induced Osteomalacia(TIO), some tumours produce FGF23 which causes renal phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia.",

In surgeries done in a sitting position, the jugular venous compression can restrict air entry into chest circulation.<br><br>* Improve patient oxygenation by administration of 100% oxygen. It also reduces embolus volume by eliminating nitrogen. Nitrous oxide should be discontinued even after minor embolic events to prevent the air from reaching left-sided circulation.<br><br>* Air entry to the right side of the heart may be relieved by a partial left lateral decubitus position. Aspiration of air from the right atrium can be tried by the use of a Bunegin-Albin multi-orifice catheter.<br><br>* Maintain optimum fluid status and stabilize the patient with inotropes or pressors if needed.<br><br>* In case of massive VAE with cardiac decompensation, initiate rapid cardiopulmonary resuscitation with chest compression.<br><br>* To decrease the severity of the disease, initiate anticoagulation therapy with heparin. The usage of steroids is controversial as steroids do not have any effect on cytotoxic brain edema resulting from air embolism.<br><br>VAE refers to the entrapment of exogenously delivered gas or air into the venous vasculature resulting in systemic effects. It may occur during surgeries like sitting neurological procedures (posterior cranial fossa surgeries), obstetrics, and orthopedic surgeries. Other causes include mechanical insufflation during laparoscopic surgeries, iatrogenic air entry during venous catheterization and dysbarism. <br><br>VAE should be considered when unexplained hypotension or a sudden fall in end-tidal CO2 level occurs intraoperatively in high-risk cases. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the most sensitive device for detecting intracardiac air embolus.",

These lymphocytes constitute the white pulp of the spleen.<br><br>* Penicilli - The arteriole then divides into a number of straight vessels that are called penicilli.<br><br>* Ellipsoid - Each of the penicilli shows a localized thickening of its wall that is called an ellipsoid. The ellipsoid consists of concentric lamellae formed by the aggregation of fibroblasts and macrophages.<br><br>* Ampulla - Distal to the ellipsoid, the vessel dilates to form an ampulla, the walls of which become continuous with the reticular framework.<br><br>* Red pulp - As a result, blood flows into spaces lined by reticular cells, coming into direct contact with lymphocytes there. The part of splenic tissue, which is infiltrated with blood in this way is called the red pulp.<br><br>* Sinusoids - Blood from spaces of the red pulp is collected by wide sinusoids that drain into veins in the trabeculae.<br><br>The splenic artery after entering the hilum of the spleen divides into about five branches that enter the organ independently.

If entangled an iridectomy is performed.<br><br>* If the foreign body is in the lens, a few days should be allowed to elapse for the aqueous to act upon the lens fibers. Aspiration is then performed and the foreign body is removed with the lens matter.<br><br>* If the foreign body lies on the retina, and if accurate localization has been attained, it is removed directly by intra-vitreal forceps as part of a complete vitrectomy. Laser photocoagulation of the surrounding retina is also done to prevent a late retinal detachment.",
