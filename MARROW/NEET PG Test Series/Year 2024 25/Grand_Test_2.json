It is more commonly seen in<strong> females </strong>between<strong> 45 to 65 years</strong> of age. In the majority of cases, it is caused by the presence of circulating <strong>autoantibodies</strong> against<strong> thyroglobulin</strong> and <strong>thyroid peroxidase</strong>.</p>\n<p>Morphologically, there is a diffuse and symmetrical enlargement of the thyroid gland, with an intact capsule.

However, in some patients, <strong>transient thyrotoxicosis</strong> may occur due to the release of thyroid hormones from disrupted thyroid follicles known as <strong>hashitoxicosis</strong>. Free T4 and T3 levels are elevated and TSH and radioactive iodine uptake are decreased in this phase. As hypothyroidism occurs, T4 and T3 levels fall, and TSH increases. Patients are also more susceptible to developing other autoimmune diseases like <strong>type 1 diabetes </strong>and<strong> systemic lupus erythematosus</strong>.  </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Options B and C: <strong>Orphan Annie Eye nuclei</strong> (nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin and a ground-glass appearance) and <strong>pseudo-inclusions</strong> (nuclear membrane grooves) are characteristic of <strong>papillary carcinoma of the thyroid</strong>, which is the <strong>most common</strong> form of thyroid cancer. Other histological hallmarks include <strong>branching papillae</strong> covered by a single to multiple layers of cuboidal epithelial cell and <strong>psammoma bodies</strong> (concentrically calcified structures within the papillae). This type of cancer has an excellent prognosis, with a 10-year survival rate in 95% of cases.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a91495940f4f4437840356f87c3954efx1280x1159.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D. Multinucleate giant cells are found in <strong>granulomatous thyroiditis</strong>. Granulomatous thyroiditis, also known as <strong>De Quervain thyroiditis</strong>, occurs due to viral infection, most often upper respiratory tract infection. The virus destroys thyroid follicles, inciting cytotoxic T lymphocyte reaction against the thyroid antigens. <strong>Thyroid pain</strong> is the most common symptom. In some cases, there may be transient thyrotoxicosis lasting for 2-6 weeks.

Specific stains like methenamine silver, toluidine blue O, or Giemsa can show the cysts.

It is actually <strong>extranodal marginal zone B cell</strong> <strong>lymphoma</strong> of <strong>gut</strong> <strong>mucosa</strong>-associated lymphoid tissue. It is usually primary GI lymphoma (4% of gastric lymphoma); of non-Hodgkin’s B cell type. The most common cytogenetic abnormality seen in MALT lymphomas is <strong>t(11;18). </strong>The <strong>most common</strong> site is the <strong>stomach</strong>. <strong>Helicobacter pylori</strong> infection is the causative agent commonly. MALToma can be associated with <strong>Type B </strong>symptoms like fever, night sweats and weight loss.</p>\n<p>Histologically, MALTomas show <strong>dense lymphocytic infiltrate</strong> in the <strong>lamina propria</strong>. The neoplastic lymphocytes infiltrate gastric glands to create lymphoepithelial lesions. MALTomas express <strong>B-cell markers</strong> like <strong>CD19</strong> and <strong>CD20</strong>, but not CD5 or CD10.</p>\n<p>On endoscopy, MALToma shows <strong>diffuse mucosal thickening </strong>which may ulcerate. <strong>Eradication of H. pylori with antibiotics </strong>has shown to be an effective therapy for MALToma. <strong>Surgical resection</strong> has no role in the treatment unless there has been some complication like <strong>perforation </strong>or<strong> uncontrollable bleeding</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Gastric adenocarcinoma</strong> is the <strong>most common variant</strong> of stomach malignancies as it constitutes more than 90% of all gastric cancers.

It is characterized by the translocation of the <strong>C-MYC gene</strong> on <strong>chromosome 8</strong>. This leads to increased MYC protein levels. The translocation most commonly seen in Burkitt's lymphoma is <strong>t(8;14)</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Gastrointestinal tumor</strong> (GIST) is a <strong>mesenchymal</strong> tumor of the abdomen.

The microscopic appearance of GIST consists of thin <strong>elongated cells</strong> (spindle cell type), or plumper, <strong>epithelial-appearing cells</strong> (epithelioid type). Most commonly an admixture of the two is seen. </p>",

It results from a deficiency of the metalloprotease <strong>ADAMTS13,</strong> which normally cleaves multimers of vWF.

The <strong>late distal tubule and collecting duct</strong> are <strong>similar</strong> anatomically and functionally.</p>\n<p>In the<strong> proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)</strong>, sodium, water, and chloride are mainly reabsorbed here along with <strong>glucose</strong>, <strong>amino acids</strong>, and other solutes. The total solute concentration or&nbsp;<strong>osmolarity remains the same</strong> all along the proximal tubule due to the high permeability to water.</p>\n<p>The <strong>thin descending limb</strong>&nbsp;of the <strong>loop of Henle</strong> is <strong>permeable to water</strong>, <strong>urea</strong>, and sodium. The tubular fluid becomes <strong>hypertonic&nbsp;</strong>in this segment. The <strong>thick ascending limb&nbsp;</strong>reabsorbs Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;by a <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;co-transporter</strong>. <strong>Some of the K<sup>+</sup></strong> that is reabsorbed <strong>leaks back</strong> into the lumen, creating a potential difference with more positivity in the lumen. This <strong>lumen positivity</strong> is responsible for the <strong>absorption of divalent ions like Ca<sup>+2&nbsp;</sup>and Mg<sup>+2</sup></strong>. The thick ascending limb is virtually<strong> impermeable to water.&nbsp;</strong>Since some of the solutes are reabsorbed and water is not reabsorbed, it <strong>dilutes</strong> <strong>the tubular fluid</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Early distal convoluted tubule (DCT)</strong> reabsorbs Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> by the <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> co-transporter</strong>. This segment is also <strong>impermeable to water</strong>. Because of the relative solute reabsorption, there is <strong>dilution</strong> <strong>of the tubular fluid</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>late distal tubule</strong> and <strong>collecting duct</strong> have <strong>two kinds of cells</strong> as mentioned above. <strong>Principal cells</strong> <strong>reabsorb Na<sup>+</sup> and secrete K<sup>+</sup></strong> into the lumen. The Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption is through <strong>epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channels (ENaC)</strong>. The expression of ENaC is mediated by <strong>aldosterone</strong> and thus increases whenever there is activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> is balanced by the secretion of K+ into the lumen.</p>\n<p>The <strong>water permeability</strong> of the principal cells is<strong> controlled by ADH</strong>. When <strong>ADH</strong> levels are <strong>high</strong>, <strong>aquaporin 2</strong> channels are <strong>inserted</strong> in the luminal membrane of the principal cells, leading to <strong>water reabsorption</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Intercalated cells</strong> <strong>reabsorb K<sup>+</sup> and secrete H<sup>+</sup></strong> by an <strong>H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> counter-transporter</strong>.
