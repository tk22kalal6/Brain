But when we have a look at uptodate, things start to get clear. Neck is part of the shaft and is the most common site for fracture. This is also confirmed by Campbell orthopedics. As this is an orthopedics question the best answer is neck of the metatarsal. The best answer to the question is in the following order:</p>\n<p><strong>Neck of the shaft &gt; Neck &gt; Shaft</strong></p>\n<p>March fracture is the neck of the shaft fracture of 2nd and 3rd metatarsal resulting from long, continued or often repeated stress like prolonged walking or running in people not accustomed to it. Thus it may occur in army recruits freshly committed to marching hence the name March Fracture.</p>\n<p>It heals spontaneously , so its treatment is symptomatic.</p>",
