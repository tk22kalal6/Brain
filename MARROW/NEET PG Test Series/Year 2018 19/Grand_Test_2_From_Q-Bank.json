This plot can be used to calculate K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> as well as to determine the mechanism of action of enzyme inhibitors. The <strong>x-intercept</strong> represents -1/K<sub>m</sub> while the <strong>y-intercept</strong> represents 1/V<sub>max. </sub></p>\n<p>In non-competitive inhibition, <strong>V<sub>max</sub> decreases</strong> (or 1/V<sub>max</sub> increases) but <strong>K<sub>m</sub> </strong>is<strong> unchanged. </strong>Hence the graphs of inhibited and uninhibited reactions have the <strong>same x-intercepts</strong> (converge at the same -1/K<sub>m</sub>) but <strong>different y-intercepts.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>An <strong>allosteric</strong> inhibitor alters the conformation of an enzyme upon binding. Enzymes affected by allosteric inhibitors exhibit a <strong>sigmoid</strong>, not hyperbolic, relationship between V<sub>0</sub> and [S].</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7187f911d2c5404f83a485541b950554x710x280.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
