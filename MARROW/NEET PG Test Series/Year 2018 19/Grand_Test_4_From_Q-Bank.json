The acidic contents of the stomach play a major role in absorption. Once it reaches the brush border of the absorbing cell, the ferric form is converted to ferrous form by <strong>ferrireductase</strong>. This ferrous form is then transported into the cell by <strong>divalent metal transporter type 1 (DMT-1). </strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Once inside the cell, iron may be <strong>stored</strong> as <strong>ferritin</strong> or transported to plasma through <strong>ferroportin</strong>. During the transport, iron is converted back into the ferric form by <strong>hephaestin</strong> and <strong>ceruloplasmin. </strong>The iron in plasma is then <strong>transferred</strong> to the required tissues with the help of protein <strong>transferrin. </strong>Iron is a major content of<strong> hemoglobin, </strong>myoglobin, cytochrome P-450 group of enzymes, components of electron transport chain, and ribonucleotide reductase.</p>\n<p><strong>Hepcidin</strong>, a protein secreted from the liver plays a major role in the regulation of iron absorption.
