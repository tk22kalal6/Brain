      "solution": "<p>Patients with <strong>cystic fibrosis </strong>(CF) can present with <strong>hypokalemia</strong> and <strong>not hyperkalemia</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Excess production of sweat</strong> in CF leads to a significant<strong> loss</strong> of <strong>chloride</strong> ions from the extracellular fluid (ECF). The <strong>depletion of chloride</strong> from the ECF causes an&nbsp;<strong>intracellular shift&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>potassium</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;activation of renin-aldosterone</strong> system,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>leading to <strong>hypokalemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>The excessive depletion of sodium chloride in CF also affects the acid-base balance. It leads to <strong>increased reabsorption of bicarbonate</strong> by the kidneys through the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger on the intercalated cells. This process is known as <strong>contraction alkalosis&nbsp;</strong>(option D) and results in <strong>hyponatremic hypochloremic alkalosis.</strong></p>\n<p>Cystic fibrosis, also known as mucoviscidosis, is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder caused by a mutation in the <strong>cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator</strong> (CFTR) gene on <strong>chromosome</strong> <strong>7q</strong>. This gene is responsible for encoding <strong>ATP-gated chloride channels</strong> in the apical membranes of epithelial cells, which regulate the flow of ions across various epithelial membranes in the body, including sweat glands, respiratory airways, and pancreatic ducts. The defect in CFTR leads to<strong> elevated salt concentrations in sweat</strong> and the production of <strong>thick, viscous secretions</strong> in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.</p>\n<p>Diagnostic tests for CF include the <strong>sweat chloride test&nbsp;</strong>(option A), where an increased chloride concentration<strong> (&gt;60 mEq/L)</strong> is considered <strong>diagnostic</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels</strong> (option B) are also measured for newborn screening, as they tend to be<strong> elevated</strong>&nbsp;in CF. <strong>Genetic testing</strong> for CFTR gene mutations is considered the <strong>gold standard</strong> and should be performed for all <strong>suspected</strong> cases. In<strong> equivocal </strong>cases, <strong>nasal transepithelial potential difference</strong> can be estimated as an additional diagnostic test.</p>\n<p>The <strong>criteria for diagnosis</strong> is the presence of <strong>c</strong><strong>linical symptoms</strong>&nbsp;affecting at least <strong>one</strong> organ system (respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary)&nbsp;<strong>or </strong>a&nbsp;<strong>positive&nbsp;newborn screening</strong>&nbsp;<strong>or</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>a&nbsp;<strong>sibling</strong>&nbsp;with cystic fibrosis, along with evidence of&nbsp;<strong>dysfunction</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<strong>CFTR gene</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>t</strong><strong>wo positive sweat chloride test</strong> results obtained on separate days&nbsp;<strong>or </strong>identification of&nbsp;<strong>two CFTR mutations</strong>&nbsp;by genetic testing&nbsp;<strong>or </strong>an&nbsp;<strong>abnormal</strong>&nbsp;measurement of&nbsp;<strong>nasal potential</strong> <strong>difference</strong>).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The image below shows the organs involved in cystic fibrosis:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0f05fc955e954de0b5e10544c2b5a402x480x342.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

It usually occurs due to impaired excretion of bilirubin&nbsp;due to <strong>obstructive biliary</strong> pathology or <strong>hereditary syndromes. </strong>The diagnosis can be made by elevation of serum direct bilirubin levels, hepatic enzymes (<strong>Alkaline phosphatase</strong> specifically raised in cholestasis) and <strong>absent urinary urobilinogen</strong>. Obstruction of biliary ducts may be intrahepatic or extrahepatic and can be localised by imaging techniques. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bilirubin is the breakdown product of heme metabolism which is formed in the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver. It is insoluble in water and is known as <strong>unconjugated</strong> (indirect) bilirubin. It is transported to the liver after binding to <strong>albumin,&nbsp;</strong>where&nbsp;it undergoes conjugation with glucuronic acid. The final product is known as <strong>conjugated bilirubin</strong> (direct bilirubin) which drains into the duodenum. On reaching the colon, the unconjugated form is acted upon by <strong>bacterial beta glucuronidases&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;reduced into colorless<strong> urobilinogen</strong>. Almost 90% is excreted through faeces as&nbsp;<strong>stercobilinogen</strong>, and the remaining will undergo <strong>enterohepatic cycling</strong>. A small fraction of this escapes hepatic uptake and will be excreted in the urine as&nbsp;<strong>urobilinogen.</strong></p><p>Normally, urine bilirubin is absent. However, in obstructive jaundice, bilirubin cannot drain to the intestine to be converted into urobilinogen. Thus, fecal urobilinogen becomes absent, which gives the characteristic <strong>steatorrhea</strong>. The presence of urine bilirubin is an indication of post-hepatic obstruction and presents as <strong>cola/dark-colored urine.</strong>&nbsp;Increase bilirubin deposition in the skin, resulting in <strong>yellowish discoloration</strong> and may lead to pruritus.</p>\n<p>Serum bilirubin can be measured using the&nbsp;<strong>van den Bergh reaction</strong>. The bilirubin is exposed to diazotized sulfanilic acid with/without alcohol and total and direct bilirubin levels are measured respectively.

Remarkably, subclones within tumors appear to diverge genetically in a fashion that is very similar to the manner in which new species are thought to emerge in complex ecosystems; a cardinal example of the latter are the finches on the Galapagos Islands that inspired Darwin, in part, to propose evolution as the origin of the species.</p><p>The image below shows Darwin&rsquo;s sketch of the evolution of Galapagos finches.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/19cbafe60c114543ba6169234bb3c007x643x1077.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
