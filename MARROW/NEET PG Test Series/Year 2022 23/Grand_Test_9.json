Class switching refers to the <strong>genetic recombination</strong> event in which the heavy-chain <strong>constant segment </strong>of the<strong> IgM gene</strong> is <strong>replaced</strong> with a different constant segment that leads to a <strong>different </strong>type of <strong>antibody</strong> being produced (e.g. IgG, IgA, IgE, etc.).</p>\n<p>Mutation in the gene that codes for CD40 ligand will impair class switching of the IgM antibodies to any other antibody type, and this results in relatively higher levels of IgM. Frequent infections of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract result from lower levels of other antibodies. Elevated IgM antibodies can sometimes react with blood cells, causing autoimmune <strong>hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia</strong>, and <strong>neutropenia.</strong> In others, <strong>IgM-producing plasma cells</strong> may proliferate and <strong>infiltrate</strong> the <strong>gastrointestinal mucosa.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The <strong>adenosine deaminase (<em>ADA</em>)</strong> gene is deficient in the autosomal recessive variant of severe combined immunodeficiency (<strong>SCID</strong>).

      "solution": "<p>The given scenario is suggestive of&nbsp;<strong>graft-versus-host disease </strong>(GVHD). The possible mechanism behind the patient's current clinical picture is <strong>transplanted cells attacking host tissues</strong>.</p>\n<p>Transfusion of irradiated RBCs prevents the incidence of <strong>GVHD</strong> associated with the transfusion.</p>\n<p>GVHD occurs when immunologically competent cells or their precursors are transplanted into <strong>immunologically compromised</strong> recipients. The transferred cells recognize the alloantigens in the host and attack host tissues. It is seen <strong>most commonly</strong> during <strong>hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</strong> but may also occur following the transplantation of solid organs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>GVHD may be of two types: acute and chronic.</p>\n<p><strong>Acute GVHD </strong>occurs within days to weeks after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It mainly involves the <strong>immune system </strong>and the <strong>epithelia</strong> of the skin (in the form of generalized rash), <strong>liver&nbsp;</strong>(in the form of jaundice), and <strong>intestines</strong> (in the form of bloody diarrhea). But the affected tissues are not heavily infiltrated by lymphocytes.</p>\n<p><strong>Chronic GVHD</strong> may follow acute GVHD or may occur insidiously. These patients have extensive skin damage, with the destruction of skin appendages and fibrosis of the dermis, resembling <strong>systemic sclerosis</strong>. Cholestatic jaundice and esophageal strictures are also common. There will be involution of the thymus and depletion of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes. There will also be recurrent bouts of <strong>life-threatening infections.</strong> Some may even develop <strong>autoimmunity</strong>, owing to the grafted CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells reacting with host B cells and stimulating them, which may result in autoantibody production.</p>\n<p>Depletion of donor T cells by irradiation before transfusion can eliminate the occurrence of GVHD. But irradiation also has its adverse effects such as tumor recurrence in leukemic patients, increased incidence of graft failures, and EBV-related B-cell lymphoma.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Transplant Rejection and Hypersensitivity</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type of Rejection&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Type of Hypersensitivity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><strong>Host vs Graft</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hyperacute</td>\n<td>Type 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Acute</td>\n<td>Type 2 and 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chronic</td>\n<td>Type 2 and 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Graft vs Host</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Graft vs host reaction</td>\n<td>Type 4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The image given below explains the pathophysiology of hyperacute graft rejection (<strong>type II</strong> hypersensitivity).&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/988706e6c52640cabe45b6c598d1b709x1280x2089.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>The image below shows the mechanism of<strong> type IV</strong> hypersensitivity in graft rejection.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/740d6c7dadda46d38620f36124adea54x1280x4218.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Blood Transfusion Reactions</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\"><span><strong>Immunological Transfusion Reactions</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Reaction<br /></strong></span><span><strong>(Onset)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span><strong>Mechanism</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Presentation</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Management</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Anaphylactic transfusion reaction</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>(Seconds-minutes)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Common in<strong> IgA</strong> deficient recipients&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Shock, respiratory distress, angioedema</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Stop transfusion immediately, give epinephrine</p>\n<p><span>Prevention &ndash;

To help these individuals in social and work settings, <strong>self-sufficiency</strong> and <strong>problem-solving techniques</strong> can be utilised.</p>\n<p>As per the current updates (DSM-5), <strong>autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</strong> includes several conditions that are characterized by early onset of severe delay in the development of social and communicative skills and also unusual responses to the environment.</p>\n<p>The <strong>diagnostic criteria</strong> for autism spectrum disorder are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Persistent deficits</strong> in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts</li>\n<li><strong>Restricted, repetitive patterns</strong> of behaviour, interests, or activities</li>\n<li>Symptoms must be present in the <strong>early developmental period</strong></li>\n<li>Symptoms cause clinically <strong>significant impairment</strong> in social, occupational, or other important areas of social functioning</li>\n<li>These disturbances are <strong>not</strong> better explained by <strong>intellectual disability</strong> or <strong>global developmental delay.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Rett’s syndrome</strong> is seen <strong>exclusively</strong> in <strong>girls</strong>, where <strong>deterioration</strong> of developmental <strong>milestones</strong>, <strong>head circumference</strong>, and overall growth occurs after <strong>5 months</strong> of age. The absence of such a history of deterioration from previous normal development, along with the absence of other characteristic features of Rett's syndrome like- <strong>stereotypic motions</strong> (eg-hand wringing), poor coordination, <strong>ataxia</strong>, <strong>complete loss</strong> of <strong>verbal</strong> abilities, <strong>respiratory difficulties</strong>, and <strong>seizures </strong>makes a diagnosis of Rett syndrome unlikely.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Options C &amp; D:<strong> Heller syndrome/Childhood disintegrative disorder,</strong> occurring between the ages of <strong>3–5 years, </strong>is characterized by a significant developmental regression after a period of <strong>normal development </strong>for<strong> at least two years</strong>. This results in a <strong>deterioration</strong> of<strong> behavioural</strong> and<strong> adaptive functioning,</strong> including self-help skills, with <strong>loss of language </strong>and<strong> social skills, </strong>along with <strong>stereotyped movements</strong> and <strong>compulsive</strong> behaviour. The absence of these features makes a diagnosis of Childhood disintegrative syndrome unlikely.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Autism Spectrum Disorder</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Autism</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Rett syndrome</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Asperger syndrome</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Heller syndrome</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Onset</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Before 3 years</span></td>\n<td><span>After 5 months</span></td>\n<td><span>After 3 years</span></td>\n<td><span>After 2 years</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Gender predilection</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Boys</span></td>\n<td><span>Girls</span></td>\n<td><span>Boys</span></td>\n<td><span>Boys</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Intellectual disability</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Present in 30% of the cases</span></td>\n<td><span>Present</span></td>\n<td><span>Absent</span></td>\n<td><span>Present</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Language</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Mostly poor</span></td>\n<td><span>Mostly poor</span></td>\n<td><span>Normal</span></td>\n<td><span>Mostly poor</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Remarks</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>---</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Normal head circumference at birth.</span></p>\n<p><span>Regression of milestones</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>---</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Normal head circumference at birth.</span></p>\n<p><span>Regression of milestones</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0fd179d1aaa7421ab241484cc63a4038x1279x1336.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Rett's syndrome has been removed from DSM-5 because it was found to have a clear genetic basis.</p><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span>&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>DSM - 4</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>DSM - 5</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Change in Classification&nbsp;</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Pervasive Developmental disorders</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Autistic Spectrum Disorder</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Number of Domains</strong>&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td>\n<div><span>3 domains</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>2 domains</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Impairment in social interaction and communication</strong>&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Delay or total lack of development of spoken language</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Stereotyped and repetitive use of language</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Failure to develop peer relationships</span></p>\n</li>\n<li><span>Lack of social or emotional reciprocity</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships</span></p>\n</li>\n<li><span>Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Repetitive and restricted</strong><br /><strong>interests/behaviors</strong>&nbsp;</span></td>\n<td>\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms</span></li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Persistent preoccupation with parts of an object</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Highly restricted, fixated interests.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<span>&nbsp;</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Examples include cases of rape, murder, dowry death, and death due to rash or negligent acts.

Criminal negligence is a <strong>cognizable offense</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Ragging</strong> in any form is a <strong>cognizable offense</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Contributory negligence</h3><p><strong>Contributory negligence</strong> occurs when a <strong>patient</strong> or his <strong>personal attendant</strong> shows unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care, which when combined with the negligence of the doctor, has contributed to the injury. In this case, the patient&rsquo;s or attendant&rsquo;s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.</p>\n<p>So, contributory negligence occurs when <strong>both the doctor and patient are negligent</strong>. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient&rsquo;s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the<strong> patient:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.</li>\n<li>Fails to follow the doctor&rsquo;s instructions</li>\n<li>Refuses to take the treatment</li>\n<li>Leaves the hospital against doctor&rsquo;s advice</li>\n<li>Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contributory negligence is a defence </strong>for doctor&rsquo;s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the <strong>doctrine of comparative negligence</strong>, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>no</strong> <strong>proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is negligent</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<strong>Last clear chance doctrine: </strong>It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>gave proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (<strong>There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

The radiograph shows <strong>enlarged diaphyses</strong> of the metacarpals and phalanges. These features along with severe <strong>developmental delay</strong>, <strong>cloudy cornea</strong>, hepatomegaly, and<strong> intellectual disability</strong> suggest that the child has Hurler syndrome.</p>\n<p>It is a <strong>severe</strong> type of mucopolysaccharidoses <strong>(MPS) I</strong>. It is caused due to deficiency of <strong>α-L-iduronidase. </strong>This enzyme is required for the breakdown of dermatan and heparan sulfate.

The symptoms appear <strong>after 5 years</strong> of age and the diagnosis is made between 10-20 years. It is characterized by <strong>normal intelligence</strong> and stature, joint stiffness, aortic valve disease, corneal clouding, and mild dysostosis multiplex. Ophthalmic and cardiac involvement might be present.</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Hurler-Scheie syndrome</strong> is an intermediate between Hurler syndrome and Scheie syndrome. The onset of symptoms is between <strong>3-8 years of</strong> age. They have <strong>mild</strong> or <strong>no intellectual dysfunction</strong>. Ophthalmic and cardiac involvement might be present.</p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Hunter syndrome</strong> is a <strong>type II MPS. </strong>It occurs due to the deficiency of <strong>iduronate 2-sulfatase. </strong>It shares the same features as type I MPS like coarse facial features, short stature, and dysostosis multiplex. However, there is <strong>no corneal clouding. </strong>It is the only MPS with <strong>X-linked recessive</strong> inheritance. So if a baby girl is affected in the family, it is less likely to be Hunter syndrome.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Chitin</strong> among the mentioned polysaccharides has an <strong>animal</strong> origin. It is present in mushrooms, exoskeletons of crustaceans, and insects. It is made of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units joined by β1 → 4 glycosidic bonds.</p>\n<p>Polysaccharides are <strong>polymers</strong> <strong>of monosaccharides</strong>. It is of two main types: </p>\n<p>1) <strong>Homopolysaccharide</strong> is made of 1 type of monomer. e.g. starch, insulin, glycogen, and cellulose<br />2) <strong>Heteropolysaccharide </strong>is made of &gt;1 type of monomer. e.g. hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Starch </strong>is the reservoir carbohydrate of the <strong>plant</strong> kingdom. It is the most important dietary carbohydrate. It is present mainly in cereals, potatoes, legumes, and other vegetables. The <strong>glycemic index</strong> of a starch-rich food is a measure of its digestibility. Starch hydrolyzes 100% in the small intestine. <br />The two main constituents are as follows: <br /><strong>- Amylose</strong> has a <strong>non-branching, helical structure<br />-</strong> <strong>Amylopectin</strong> (major) consists of <strong>branched chains. </strong>It is made of 24 to 30 glucose residues with α1 → 4 linkages in the chains and α1 → 6 linkages at the branch points.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Cellulose</strong> is the chief constituent of <strong>plant cell walls</strong>. It is insoluble and consists of β-D-glucopyranose units linked by β1 → 4 bonds to form <strong>long, straight chains</strong> strengthened by <strong>cross-linking hydrogen bonds. </strong>Mammals lack the enzyme that can hydrolyze β1 → 4 bonds, so they <strong>cannot digest</strong> cellulose. It is a major constituent of dietary fiber. Microorganisms in the gut of ruminants and other herbivores can hydrolyze the linkage and ferment the products to short-chain fatty acids as a major energy source. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Inulin </strong>is composed of D-fructose units with repeating beta-1,2 linkages. It is<strong> </strong>of <strong>plant origin </strong>and is found in tubers and roots of dahlias, artichokes, and dandelions. It is <strong>readily soluble</strong> in water and is used to determine the <strong>glomerular filtration rate. </strong></p>\n<p>Other polysaccharides of importance: </p>\n<p><strong>Dextrans </strong>are highly branched homopolymers of glucose units with 1-6, 1-4, and 1-3 linkages. Since they will not easily go out of the vascular compartment, they are used for intravenous infusion as plasma volume expanders for the treatment of hypovolemic shock.</p>\n<p><strong>Glycogen </strong>is also known as <strong>animal starch</strong> because it is the reservoir carbohydrate in animals. It is stored in the liver and muscles. Excess carbohydrate is stored in this form. It is a <strong>more branched </strong>and <strong>more compact</strong> structure than amylopectin: it has chains of 12 to 15 α-D-glucopyranose residues (in α1 → 4 glucosidic linkage), which show branching through α1 → 6 glucosidic bonds.</p>\n<p><strong>Dietary fibers: </strong>It<strong> </strong>is the edible part of plants which is <strong>non-digestible</strong>, <strong>non-starch carbohydrates</strong> and <strong>lignin</strong>. The AI for dietary fiber is 25 g/day for women and 38 g/day for men. It is completely or partially fermented by the gut bacteria to short-chain fatty acids (<strong>SCFA</strong>) in the large intestine. SCFAs play an essential role in regulating host metabolism, the immune system, and cell proliferation. Dietary fiber provides little energy but has several beneficial effects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It adds <strong>bulk</strong> to the diet.</li>\n<li>It draws fluid into the lumen of the intestine and increases bowel motility (<strong>laxation</strong>).</li>\n<li>It delays gastric emptying and can result in a sensation of fullness (<strong>satiety</strong>).</li>\n<li>This delayed emptying also results in <strong>reduced spikes</strong> in <strong>blood glucose</strong> following a meal.</li>\n<li>It <strong>lowers LDL cholesterol</strong> levels by increasing fecal bile acid excretion and interfering with bile acid reabsorption.</li>\n<li>It decreases the risk for constipation, hemorrhoids, and diverticulosis. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Functional fiber is the term used for isolated fiber that has proven health benefits such as commercially available fiber supplements. The introduction of fiber into the diet should be gradual as it can lead to abdominal discomfort, gas, diarrhea, and even constipation.</p>",

This young woman with <strong>palpitations,</strong> a <strong>mid-systolic click</strong> heard at the <strong>apex</strong> which <strong>exacerbates</strong> when <strong>standing up</strong> and <strong>improves</strong> on <strong>lying down,</strong> most probably has a diagnosis of <strong>mitral valve prolapse.</strong></p>\n<p>Mitral valve prolapse is a valvular heart defect in which the <strong>mitral valve leaflets</strong> are <strong>floppy</strong> and <strong>prolapse</strong> into the <strong>left atrium during ventricular contraction, </strong>making it the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>most common cause of primary mitral valve regurgitation.&nbsp;It is seen most commonly in young women and can be inherited in an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> fashion with incomplete penetrance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This produces the classic mid-systolic click which is heard at the apex of the heart. The <strong>intensity</strong> of this click sound changes <strong>depending </strong>on the<strong> left ventricular (LV) volume</strong>. When LV <strong>volume increases</strong>, the floppy valve is able to maintain tension, and the degree of prolapse is reduced. Thus the <strong>intensity</strong> of the murmur <strong>reduces.</strong> On the other hand, when the LV <strong>volume is low</strong>, the mitral valve leaflets remain floppy and produce a <strong>louder click</strong> sound.</p>\n<p>By this logic, when the patient <strong>stands up</strong>, the venous return reduces and so the<strong>&nbsp;LV volume decrease. </strong>This causes the<strong> murmur</strong> to become <strong>louder.</strong> On<strong> lying down</strong>, venous return increases, leading to <strong>increased LV volume</strong> and a <strong>softer murmur</strong>. On performing the <strong>Valsalva</strong> maneuver, intrathoracic pressure increases. This reduces venous return, and hence the <strong>murmur</strong> becomes <strong>louder</strong> because of <strong>reduced LV volume</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A - Mitral valve prolapse is also called <strong>Barlow's syndrome&nbsp;</strong>or <strong>floppy valve disease</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B -&nbsp; It is associated with connective tissue disorders like <strong>Marfan's syndrome</strong><strong>,</strong> Ehler's Danlos syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta.</p>\n<p>Option C - The valve becomes floppy due to <strong>myxomatous degeneration</strong> of the valve.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis can be made with a combination of clinical examination and <strong>transthoracic</strong> or <strong>transesophageal echocardiography.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> of these patients involves the usage of <strong>beta-blockers for palpitations</strong>.
