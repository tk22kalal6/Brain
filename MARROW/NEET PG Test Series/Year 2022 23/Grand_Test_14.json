Therefore, they only <strong>inhibit </strong>the<strong> conversion of levodopa</strong> into dopamine in the<strong> periphery</strong> and <strong>not in the brain</strong>. This leads to the increased plasma half-life of levodopa, and therefore, lower doses of levodopa can be prescribed.</p>\n<p>Benefits of combination therapy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This therapy inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in the periphery, leading to <strong>increased plasma half-life</strong> of levodopa.</li>\n<li>Combination therapy reduces adverse effects like gastrointestinal side effects, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.</li>\n<li>This therapy allows for increased availability of levodopa in the brain.</li>\n<li>Fluctuation in motor control, where the patient is alternately well and disabled, occurs on prolonged therapy with levodopa.

It may be caused by the <strong>calcification</strong> of the normal aortic valve, calcification of the congenital bicuspid valve, and rheumatic heart disease. Narrowing of the aortic valve causes a <strong>decreased stroke volume</strong>. This results in a <strong>weak</strong>&nbsp;<strong>pulse</strong> (parvus), which <strong>rises slowly</strong> to a <strong>delayed peak</strong> (tardus), best appreciated in the carotid arteries.</p>\n<p>Three cardinal clinical features of aortic stenosis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exertional dyspnea:</strong>&nbsp;This occurs due to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Raised end-diastolic LV volume and reduced LV compliance lead to increased LV pressure, leading to elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. This causes exertional dyspnea.</li>\n<li><strong>Angina pectoris</strong>:&nbsp;It occurs due to the&nbsp;combination of the increased O<sub><span class=\"s1\">2 </span></sub>needs of hypertrophied myocardium and reduction of O<sub><span class=\"s1\">2 </span></sub>delivery&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Syncope</strong>:&nbsp;It occurs due to the combination of decreased cardiac output and systemic arterial dilation which lead to a reduction of cerebral perfusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As LV systole gets prolonged, the aortic component of S<sub>2</sub> may become synchronous with the pulmonary component, or there may be a <strong>paradoxical splitting of&nbsp;S<sub>2,</sub></strong> where the aortic component follows the pulmonary component.&nbsp;The murmur in aortic stenosis is typically an <strong>ejection systolic murmur</strong> best heard at the right second intercostal space and transmitted to the carotids.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Severe AS</strong> is defined as the aortic valve area <strong>&lt;1 cm<sup>2</sup></strong>. Patients even with severe AS may be asymptomatic as the left ventricle undergoes hypertrophy to increase the intraventricular pressure and maintain the stroke volume. Symptomatic AS is an indication for valve replacement.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Pulsus alternans</strong> is defined as <strong>beat-to-beat variability</strong> in the amplitude of the pulse. It is seen in patients with <strong>severe LV dysfunction</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Pulsus bisferiens</strong>&nbsp;also known as bifid pulse has <strong>two systolic peaks.</strong> It is seen in patients with <strong>hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy</strong>. There is a rapid upstroke to the first peak (percussion wave) and a slower rise to the second peak (tidal wave). It is also rarely appreciated in patients with severe aortic regurgitation.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Pulsus paradoxus</strong> is defined as a <strong>fall in systolic pressure &gt;10 mmHg</strong> with <strong>inspiration.</strong> It is seen in patients with pericardial tamponade, severe asthma, massive pulmonary embolism, and tension pneumothorax.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Grading of Aortic Stenosis</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Grading of stenosis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Area of aortic valve</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Mild</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1.5 &ndash; 2 sq cm</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Moderate</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1 &ndash; 1.5 sq cm</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Severe</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&lt; 1 sq cm</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Among the given options, pericardial knock is not a clinical feature of cardiac tamponade. It<strong> </strong>is a sign of constrictive pericarditis. </p>\n<p>Cardiac tamponade is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, leading to the impairment of diastolic relaxation of the cardiac chambers. This leads to a decline in cardiac output. The characteristic signs of cardiac tamponade include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pulsus paradoxus - </strong>This is a paradoxical reduction in the systemic blood pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) on inspiration. In tamponade, the increase in venous return to the right side (during inspiration) of the heart causes the interventricular septum to bow towards the left ventricle (fixed total heart volume), thereby reducing the left heart volume. This leads to a reduction in stroke volume and systemic blood pressure. </li>\n<li><strong>Beck's triad - </strong>This is a triad of findings in tamponade that consists of <strong>hypotension </strong>(90/56 mmHg), <strong>muffled heart sounds, </strong>and <strong>elevated jugular venous pressure. </strong>Features of JVP in tamponade include prominent x descent and absent y descent.<strong> </strong></li>\n<li><strong>ECG - </strong>ECG shows<strong> </strong>reduced voltage and electrical alternans. Electrical alternans is a specific finding caused by the anteroposterior swinging of the heart with each contraction.

In cases of recurrent tamponade, a small catheter may be left in place to drain subsequent collections of fluid. </p>\n<p>Note - <strong>Constrictive pericarditis </strong>is characterized by a progressive fibrotic change in the pericardium that causes it to thicken and calcify.

It focuses on grief over loss, interpersonal disputes, interpersonal skill deficits, and role transitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Exposure and response prevention</strong> is used in the treatment of <strong>OCD</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Personality Disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Key features of Personality disorders</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Cluster A (Odd, Weird, Eccentric)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Paranoid</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Suspicious, distrustful, hypervigilant</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Schizoid</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Prefers to be loner, detached, unemotional</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Schizotypal</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Eccentric &amp; odd thoughts, perceptions &amp; behavior, magical thinking and beliefs</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Cluster B (Dramatic, Emotional and Erratic)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Antisocial</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Disregard for and violation of rights of others, illegal activities</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Borderline</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Chaotic relationships, sensitivity to abandonment, labile mood, impulsivity, inner emptiness, self-harm</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Histrionic</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Dramatic, superficial, attention-seeking</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Narcissistic</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Grandiosity, lack of empathy</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Cluster C (Anxious, Fearful, Introvert)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Avoidant</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Avoidance due to fears of criticism and rejection</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Dependent</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Submissive, clingy, needs to be taken care of</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Obsessive-compulsive/</span></div>\n<div><span>Anankastic</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Rigid, controlling, perfectionist</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It can be <strong>inherited</strong> (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive) or <strong>acquired</strong> due to sporadic mutation in the rhodopsin gene.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Patients present with <strong>worsening night blindness</strong>. However, patients do not often notice night blindness and may present after much disease progression. They also develop <strong>tunnel vision,&nbsp;</strong>which manifests as difficulty performing activities of daily living such as reading, walking, and driving.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ocular examination reveals&nbsp;<strong>normal visual activity</strong> and <strong>central vision</strong> (though central vision will be involved later in disease progression). Fundoscopy shows bilateral, mid-peripheral intraretinal perivascular '<strong>bone-spicule</strong>' changes and <strong>atrophy</strong> of the retinal pigment epithelium.

Protection from cold can help.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Diabetic foot </strong>also occurs as a result of <strong>peripheral neuropathy </strong>and <strong>atherosclerosis</strong> of<strong> small arteries</strong> in the <strong>legs </strong>and <strong>feet. </strong>Hence, improving venous circulation with compression stockings will have no benefit in this condition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Buerger's disease </strong>or <strong>thromboangiitis obliterans</strong> involves occlusive disease of <strong>small- </strong>and <strong>medium-sized arteries</strong>, thrombophlebitis of the superficial or deep veins, and Raynaud&rsquo;s syndrome<strong>. </strong>It occurs in<strong> male smokers,</strong> usually under the age of 30 years.

      "solution": "<p>The image shows a&nbsp;<strong>coin in the abdomen</strong>&nbsp;that was absent before the surgery. As the patient was nil per os after the surgery, this implies that the coin from the bracelet had fallen inside the abdomen during the surgery and the surgeon completed the surgery without removing it. The surgeon will be held responsible under <strong>res ipsa loquitur.</strong></p>\n<p>Res ipsa loquitur means \"<strong>the thing or fact speaks for itself</strong>.\" It implies that the negligent act is so obvious that the patient need not prove the negligence. The patient has to only state the negligent act. This doctrine applies to both civil and criminal negligence. All of the following conditions should be fulfilled for this doctrine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the absence of negligence, there would not have been any injury usually.</li>\n<li>The doctor had complete control over the injury-producing instrument or treatment.</li>\n<li>The patient was not a part of contributory negligence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Res&nbsp;indicata</strong>&nbsp;is a defense for the doctor against negligence. This specifies that a&nbsp;suit for damages for negligence should be filed against the doctor <strong>within two years</strong> from the date of alleged negligence. A suit&nbsp;filed beyond two years would be dismissed as it would be&nbsp;beyond the<strong> period of limitation.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Contributory negligence</strong> is the absence of ordinary care on the part of the patient or his personal attendant along with the doctor's negligence contributing to the injury without which the injury would not have occurred. It acts as a <strong>partial defense</strong> against negligence for the doctor. In the given scenario, the patient was nil per os, indicating that there was no provision for foreign body consumption and suggesting there is no contributory negligence by the patient.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Medical maloccurrence</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the patient does not respond properly or faces adverse effects in spite of good attention and care by the doctor.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Contributory negligence</h3><p><strong>Contributory negligence</strong> occurs when a <strong>patient</strong> or his <strong>personal attendant</strong> shows unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care, which when combined with the negligence of the doctor, has contributed to the injury. In this case, the patient&rsquo;s or attendant&rsquo;s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.</p>\n<p>So, contributory negligence occurs when <strong>both the doctor and patient are negligent</strong>. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient&rsquo;s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the<strong> patient:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.</li>\n<li>Fails to follow the doctor&rsquo;s instructions</li>\n<li>Refuses to take the treatment</li>\n<li>Leaves the hospital against doctor&rsquo;s advice</li>\n<li>Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contributory negligence is a defence </strong>for doctor&rsquo;s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the <strong>doctrine of comparative negligence</strong>, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>no</strong> <strong>proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is negligent</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<strong>Last clear chance doctrine: </strong>It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>gave proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (<strong>There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

Among the given options, a&nbsp;<strong>reduction in stroke volume</strong> is the feature most likely to be seen in hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism leads to a <strong>decrease in</strong> <strong>myocardial contractility</strong> and <strong>pulse rate,</strong>&nbsp;resulting in reduced stroke volume and bradycardia.</p>\n<p><strong>Enzymes</strong> involved in regulating <strong>calcium fluxes</strong> in the <strong>heart</strong> are controlled by <strong>thyroid hormones</strong>, including the calcium-dependent adenosine triphosphate and phospholamban.</p>\n<p>In hypothyroidism, the expression and activity of these enzymes decrease so that it could potentially impair systolic performance and diastolic relaxation.</p>\n<p>Expression of the beta-adrenergic receptor is also decreased in hypothyroidism, resulting in a reduced response to a catecholamines-mediated increase in inotropy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The<strong> thyroid hormone relaxes</strong> the <strong>vascular smooth muscle</strong> and reduces peripheral vascular resistance. Conversely in hypothyroidism, the release of endothelial-derived relaxing factors is decreased causing a contraction of smooth muscle and, thereby, an <strong>increase in peripheral vascular resistance&nbsp;</strong>(option A)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>leading to hypertension.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This change causes a reduction in stroke volume and tissue perfusion.

Re-evaluation should be done after birth and in cases presenting with <strong>symptoms of recurrent UTI, palpable flank mass or pain, urinary obstruction, and in cases of failure to thrive</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the hydronephrosis is persistent, its <strong>severity</strong> is <strong>graded</strong> by the extent of the dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system and parenchymal thickness. It needs to be ascertained whether the other kidney is involved, the lower ureter is dilated, the bladder wall is thickened, and whether emptying of the bladder is incomplete. Based on these findings, a diagnosis can be made.</p>\n<p>In cases of hydronephrosis, <strong>long-standing urine stasis</strong> and pressure may <strong>damage the kidney</strong>s.</p>\n<p>The causes of UPJ obstruction are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intrinsic (due to an adynamic or stenotic segment of the proximal ureter) or&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Extrinsic (e.g. compression by accessory renal arteries). This needs to be corrected primarily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The renal anatomy and function can be assessed using <strong>radioscintigraphy</strong> studies. The&nbsp;<strong>investigation of choice</strong>&nbsp;for UPJ obstruction is<strong>&nbsp;</strong><sup>99m</sup>Tc-MercaptoAcetyl-triGlycine<strong>&nbsp;(MAG3) scan.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Micturating cystourethrogram</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;investigation of choice in&nbsp;<strong>vesicoureteric reflux.</strong> <sup>99m</sup>Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid&nbsp;<strong>(DMSA) scan</strong>&nbsp;is used for assessing&nbsp;<strong>renal scarring</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> of intrinsic UPJ obstruction is done <strong>surgically if renal function is compromised</strong> or if there is bilateral involvement of the kidneys. In other cases, <strong>serial follow-up with ultrasonography</strong> is done to assess the spontaneous resolution of hydronephrosis.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Vesicoureteral reflux</strong> is the <strong>second most common</strong> cause of hydronephrosis after UPJ obstruction.&nbsp;In vesicoureteric reflux, the&nbsp;valve that prevents the backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter is defective;&nbsp;hence, abnormal <strong>backflow of urine</strong> occurs <strong>from</strong> the&nbsp;<strong>bladder</strong> into the <strong>ureter</strong>. It may also present with hydronephrosis; however, the distal ureter is also involved, unlike in this case.</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Ureterocele</strong> is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, thought to result from the persistence of the membrane between the ureteral bud and urogenital sinus. Since the distal urinary tract is normal-looking in this case, this diagnosis is unlikely.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Posterior urethral valve</strong> is an <strong>obstructing membrane</strong> in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in-utero&nbsp;development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. As a result, bilateral hydronephrosis and bladder dilatation is seen, unlike the unilateral involvement in this case.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of Hydronephrosis</h3><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1306\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1306\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Unilateral hydronephrosis</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Extramural obstruction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tumor from adjacent structures, e.g., cervix, prostate, rectum, colon, or cecum</li>\n<li>Retrocaval ureter</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Aberrant renal vessels</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond&rsquo;s disease)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Intramural obstruction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Congenital PUJ obstruction</strong> - most common congenital cause</li>\n<li>Congenital stenosis</li>\n<li>Ureterocele</li>\n<li>Ureteric stricture - iatrogenic/ inflammatory</li>\n<li>Neoplasm of the ureter or bladder involving the ureteric orifice</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Intraluminal obstruction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Renal stones</strong> - most common acquired unilateral cause</li>\n<li>Sloughed papilla in papillary necrosis (especially, in patients with diabetes, analgesic abuse, or sickle cell disease)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p><strong><span><span>Bilateral hydronephrosis</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span><span>Congenital</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span>Posterior urethral valves (associated with pulmonary hypoplasia)</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Urethral atresia</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>PUJ obstruction</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Acquired &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Benign prostatic hypertrophy or carcinoma of the prostate</li>\n<li>Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis <span><span>(Ormond's disease)</span></span></li>\n<li>Postoperative bladder neck scarring</li>\n<li>Urethral stricture</li>\n<li>Phimosis</li>\n</ul>",
