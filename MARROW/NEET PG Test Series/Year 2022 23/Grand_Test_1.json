It acts by preventing the implantation of the blastocyst in the endometrium. It is the only contraceptive that neither suppresses ovulation nor interferes with the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.</p>\n<p><strong>Mifepristone</strong> (option C) is administered as a <strong>single 10 mg</strong> tablet <strong>within 72 hours</strong>. It is a steroid with an affinity for progesterone receptors. It prevents fertilization by blocking the action of progesterone on the endometrium. This leads to sloughing and shedding of decidua, thus preventing implantation.</p>\n<p><strong>Levonorgestrel </strong>(option D) is administered as <strong>two tablets</strong> of <strong>0.75 mg</strong> strength taken 12 hours apart, <strong>within 72 hours</strong> of intercourse. It prevents ovulation and causes desynchronization of the endometrium through its receptors (luteal phase deficiency).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification Of Contraceptives Based On Effectiveness</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Category</td>\n<td>Failure rate in first year</td>\n<td>Contraceptive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>First tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&lt; 2 %</td>\n<td>IUCD, Implants, Sterilization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Second tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;3-9 %</td>\n<td>Hormonal - oral, injected, transdermal patches, transvaginal rings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Third tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;10-20 %</td>\n<td>Barrier, Fertility awareness method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fourth tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;21-30 %</td>\n<td>Spermicidal preparations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Methods of contraceptions</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methods</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Advantages</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Disadvantages</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Barrier</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents STD, HIV</li>\n<li>The incidence of Ca cervix reduced</li>\n<li>Effective if used properly</li>\n<li>No contraindication use</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Cumbersome</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Coital dependent</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Short term</li>\n<li>&nbsp;High failure rate</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Lactation</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Beneficial to the newborn</li>\n<li>Contraceptive action (non-ovulatlon) 6 months</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>Short-term benefit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>IUCD</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Long-term use</li>\n<li>Effective</li>\n<li>Coital Independent</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>Side effects<br />&bull; Failure rate 1-3%<br />&bull; Contraindicated In few</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hormones</strong></td>\n<td>Effective 99-100% long-term use of beneficial effects<br />of OC coital independent</td>\n<td>Side effects<br />&bull; Not used during lactation<br />&bull; Contraindicated In few<br />&bull; Requires Surgery for implantation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Surgery</strong></td>\n<td>Permanent and effective</td>\n<td>Surgical complications surgery required.<br />&bull; Not suited in low parity women</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Postcoital</strong></td>\n<td>Effective 95-98% short-term use</td>\n<td>Failure in 1-5%<br />Not used as contraceptives</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

The lesion behind the given pathology is the <strong>facial nerve located&nbsp;proximal to the geniculate ganglion.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Crocodile tears syndrome</strong> or <strong>Bogorad syndrome,&nbsp;</strong>also known as <strong>gustatory lacrimation</strong> is caused due to anomalous regeneration of the facial nerve fibres.&nbsp;When the facial nerve is damaged <strong>proximal to </strong>the<strong> geniculate ganglia</strong>, the regenerative fibers&nbsp;supplying the salivary gland aberrantly supply the lacrimal gland. These fibres connect the submandibular salivary gland with preganglionic secretomotor fibres of the lacrimal gland. Hence, the&nbsp;patient presents with&nbsp;<strong>spontaneous lacrimation</strong> in response to the stimuli such as the taste of food or during eating. It can be treated by sectioning the greater petrosal nerve or tympanic neurectomy.</p>\n<p>The anatomy of the geniculate ganglia is best understood with the course of the facial nerve.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The course of the facial nerve is divided into&nbsp;<strong>intracranial (cisternal), intratemporal,&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> extratemporal portions.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Intracranial portion</strong>-&nbsp;The facial nerve nucleus lies in the caudal pontine reticular formation near the trapezoid nucleus and nucleus of the trigeminal nerve.

This is further divided into&nbsp;meatal, labyrinthine, tympanic (horizontal), and mastoid (vertical) segments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meatal</strong>- The facial nerve passes through the internal acoustic meatus along with the nervus intermedius, cochlear nerve, superior and inferior vestibular nerves. It passes <strong>above</strong> the <strong>transverse crest.</strong> It is separated from the superior vestibular nerve by <strong>Bill's bar.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Labyrinthine segment</strong> is from the internal acoustic meatus to the first genu near the geniculate ganglion. It is the shortest and narrowest part of the facial nerve and is susceptible to vascular compression.</li>\n<li><strong>Tympanic part</strong>- is the horizontal part of the facial nerve. It curves around the oval window niche then lies just anterior and inferior to the lateral semicircular canal.

Initially, in response to SIADH, there is a decrease in thirst which prevents further progression of the hyponatremia. However, later with increased ectopic vasopressin secretion the osmostat controlling thirst and hypothalamic secretion of vasopressin gets altered causing more thirst in the patient. This mechanism worsens hyponatremia.</p>\n<p><strong>SIADH</strong> is a syndrome characterized by <strong>euvolemic hyponatremia</strong> due to a primary defect in osmoregulation. The causes of SIADH include <strong>neoplasms</strong>&nbsp;of the lung, duodenum, pancreas, ovary, <strong>head trauma, infections</strong> (tuberculosis, meningitis, pneumonia), and <strong>drug overdose</strong>&nbsp;(vasopressin, desmopressin).</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> involves administration of <strong>conivaptan</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>tolvaptan (</strong>vasopressin receptor V2 antagonist), <strong>demeclocycline,</strong> and <strong>fluid restriction</strong> to less than 500 ml (although this can be difficult). In <strong>severe cases</strong>, correction of hyponatremia is done by administering IV fluids with <strong>hypertonic normal saline</strong> along with diuretics such as furosemide (to increase free water clearance).</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of SIADH</h3><p><strong>Neoplasms</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Carcinomas</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lung</li>\n<li>Duodenum</li>\n<li>Pancreas</li>\n<li>Ovary</li>\n<li>Bladder, ureter</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other neoplasms</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thymoma</li>\n<li>Mesothelioma</li>\n<li>Bronchial adenoma</li>\n<li>Carcinoid</li>\n<li>Gangliocytoma</li>\n<li>Ewing&rsquo;s sarcoma</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Head trauma</strong> (closed and penetrating)</p>\n<p><strong>Infections</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pneumonia</li>\n<li>Abscess</li>\n<li>Cavitation (aspergillosis)</li>\n<li>Tuberculosis</li>\n<li>Meningitis, Encephalitis</li>\n<li>AIDS</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vascular</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cerebrovascular occlusions, haemorrhage</li>\n<li>Cavernous sinus thrombosis</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Neurologic</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guillain-Barre syndrome</li>\n<li>Multiple sclerosis</li>\n<li>Delirium tremens</li>\n<li>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</li>\n<li>Hydrocephalus</li>\n<li>Psychosis</li>\n<li>Peripheral neuropathy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Congenital malformations</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Metabolic</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acute intermittent porphyria</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Respiratory</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asthma</li>\n<li>Pneumothorax</li>\n<li>Positive-pressure respiration</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Drugs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vasopressin or desmopressin</li>\n<li>Serotonin reuptake inhibitors</li>\n<li>Oxytocin (high dose)</li>\n<li>Vincristine</li>\n<li>Carbamazepine</li>\n<li>Nicotine</li>\n<li>Phenothiazines</li>\n<li>Cyclophosphamide</li>\n<li>Tricyclic antidepressants</li>\n<li>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Paraneoplastic Syndromes and Underlying Cancers</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Clinical Syndromes/&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Endocrinopathies</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Major Forms of Underlying Cancer</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Causal Mechanism</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Cushing Syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Small-cell carcinoma of lung</p>\n<p>Pancreatic carcinoma</p>\n<p>Neural tumours</p>\n<p>Renal carcinoma</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>ACTH or ACTH- like substance</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Small-cell carcinoma of lung</p>\n<p>Intracranial neoplasms</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Antidiuretic hormone or atrial natriuretic hormones</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hypercalcemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Squamous cell carcinoma of lung</p>\n<p>Breast carcinoma</p>\n<p>Renal carcinoma</p>\n<p>Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Parathyroid hormone-related protein(PTHRP), TGF-a, TNF, IL-1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hypoglycaemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ovarian carcinoma</p>\n<p>Fibrosarcoma</p>\n<p>Other mesenchymal sarcomas</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Insulin or insulin-like substance</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Polycythemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Renal carcinoma</p>\n<p>Cerebellar haemangioma</p>\n<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Erythropoietin</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Osteomalacia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>FGF-23</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Disseminated intrvascular coagulation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Acute promyelocytic leukemia</p>\n<p>Prostatic carcinoma</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tumor products activate clotting</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>ACTH:&nbsp;Adrenocorticotropic hormone&nbsp;</p>",

It will result in the obstruction of the blood flow into the ventricles. Patients present with a triad of hypotension, soft or absent heart sounds and raised JVP (Beck's triad). In JVP, there is a <strong>prominent x descent but an absent y descent. </strong></p>\n<p>Another feature found in this is a <strong>paradoxical pulse.</strong> Normally the blood pressure falls during inspiration. But this fall is not more than 10mm of Hg. However, in the pulses paradoxus, the fall in blood pressure during inspiration is more than 10 mm Hg. This is called a paradoxical pulse. The mechanism for this is as follows: due to cardiac tamponade, the ventricles are now covered in a tight incompressible covering. During inspiration, there is an increase in the volume of the right ventricle. Since this ventricle cannot expand, it <strong>pushes</strong> the <strong>interventricular septum</strong> to the left causing decreased volume in the left ventricle.
