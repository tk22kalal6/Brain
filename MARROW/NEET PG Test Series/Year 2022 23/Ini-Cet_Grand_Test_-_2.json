These precipitates are&nbsp;<strong>pathognomonic</strong>&nbsp;for anterior uveitis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anterior uveitis is the<strong> inflammation</strong> of the uvea extending from the <strong>iris to </strong>the <strong>pars plicata</strong>. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Inflammation leads to&nbsp;<strong>pseudo-rubeosis iridis&nbsp;</strong>(dilatation&nbsp;of the&nbsp;blood vessels) and exudation. A large amount of exudation causes the iris to become waterlogged with the sticky fluid and causes <strong>movement restriction</strong>. This is why there are <strong>sluggish pupillary reactions</strong>. The extravasated fluid is also an&nbsp;irritant&nbsp;that causes the ciliary muscle fibers to contract, leading to <strong>pupillary constriction</strong>.</p>\n<p>The iris loses its clear and defined pattern and becomes \"<strong>muddy.\"</strong>&nbsp;The exudate also spills into the anterior chamber. This causes the aqueous to become turbid and is seen as a hazy, milky \"flare\" on slit-lamp examination.

Thus, it is suggestive of <strong>recovery</strong>, <strong>non-infectivity</strong> and <strong>immunity.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anti-HBc </strong>(antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen) has IgM and IgG. <strong>IgM anti-HBc</strong> is diagnostic of <strong>acute hepatitis</strong> and it appears soon after HBs Ag. It persists for 3-6 months and can re-appear in flare-ups. <strong>IgG anti-HBc</strong> appears during acute infection and persists indefinitely irrespective of the recovery or progression to <strong>chronic disease</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>HBV DNA</strong> is a sensitive indicator for <strong>viral replication</strong> and <strong>infectivity</strong>. <strong>HBeAg </strong>also indicates viral replication and infectivity. It appears shortly after HBs Ag and if it is persisting beyond 3 months, it is suggestive of <strong>chronic hepatitis</strong>. </p>\n<p>Hepatitis B virus is mainly transmitted by percutaneous route followed by perinatal and sexual transmission. Chronic hepatitis B is a progression of acute hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis B infection has five phases - immune tolerant phase, immune active phase, inactive HBsAg carrier state, reactivated chronic hepatitis B phase, and HBsAg negative phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> options include interferon, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir.</p>\n<p><strong>Prophylaxis</strong> is by hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and recombinant vaccine. </p>\n<p><strong>HDV superinfection</strong> occurs when a person who is already chronically infected with HBV acquires HDV. The infection of HDV on <strong>chronic hepatitis B</strong> can <strong>accelerate</strong> the progression to severe disease in all ages. HDV superinfection accelerates progression to cirrhosis almost a decade earlier than HBV mono-infected persons. </p>\n<p><strong>HBV/HDV coinfection</strong> occurs when a person <strong>simultaneously</strong> becomes infected with both HBV and HDV. In <strong>acute hepatitis</strong>, simultaneous infection with HBV and HDV can lead to mild-to-severe hepatitis. The signs and symptoms typically appear 3–7 weeks after the initial infection and include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, jaundice (yellow eyes), and even fulminant hepatitis. However, recovery is usually complete.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4e68d774d3e44cdbabccd8bee64eaab4x1279x1466.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Interpretation of common serologic patterns in hepatitis B infection</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5552cae694994040b6b13be6442fc5adx1280x1466.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> <strong>Clinical Phases</strong></td>\n<td><span><strong>HBsAg</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Anti-HBs</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>HBeAg</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Anti-HBe</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Anti-HBc</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>HBV DNA</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Acute HBV - Early-phase, high infectivity</span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>+</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>+</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>IgM</span></td>\n<td><span>+++</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Acute HBV -</span><span>Window phase</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>+/-</span></td>\n<td><span>+/-</span></td>\n<td><span>IgM</span></td>\n<td><span>+</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Acute HBV - recovery phase</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>+</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>+/-</span></td>\n<td><span>IgG</span></td>\n<td><span>+/-</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Chronic HBV, high infectivity</span></td>\n<td><span>+</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>+</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>IgG</span></td>\n<td><span>+++</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Chronic HBV, low infectivity</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>+</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>+</span></td>\n<td><span>IgG</span></td>\n<td><span>+</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>HBV infection in the recent past</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>+</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>IgG</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>HBV infection in the remote past</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>+/-</span></td>\n<td><span>IgG</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Post-vaccination</span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>+</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n<td><span>-</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Hypoventilation results in the accumulation of carbon dioxide, thereby increasing PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels (hypercapnia).

In acute respiratory acidosis, the body&rsquo;s compensation occurs in 2 steps. The initial response is cellular buffering that takes place over minutes to hours. Cellular buffering causes a slight elevation in plasma bicarbonate values. The second step is renal compensation that occurs over 3-5 days. With renal compensation, renal excretion of carbonic acid is increased, and bicarbonate reabsorption is increased.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Respiratory changes (changes in PCO<sub>2</sub>) promote a corresponding change in metabolic response (changes in HCO<sup>3-</sup>) and vice versa as a&nbsp;<strong>compensatory mechanism</strong>.

Point A is at the end of systole when the ventricular volume is about <strong>50 mL</strong>. This volume is called <strong>end-systolic volume.</strong> The pressure at this point is about 2 to 3 mmHg. The volume and pressure go on increasing as the blood from the atrium flows to the ventricle during diastole. At the <strong>end </strong>of<strong> diastole</strong>, marked by point <strong>B</strong>, the ventricle will have a volume of <strong>around 120 mL</strong>. This volume is called <strong>end-diastolic volume.</strong> The pressure is slightly raised to 5-7 mmHg.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase II</strong>- It is the phase of <strong>isovolumetric contraction</strong>, and extends between <strong>points B</strong> and<strong>&nbsp;C</strong>. At the end of diastole (point B), a slight increase in the ventricular pressure <strong>closes</strong> the <strong>mitral valve</strong>, and contraction starts. The ventricle contracts while both mitral and aortic valves are closed. Therefore, the pressure within the ventricle slowly rises without any changes in the volume.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase III</strong>- It is the phase of <strong>ejection</strong> and extends between <strong>point C</strong> and <strong>point D</strong>. Point <strong>C</strong> is the place where the <strong>aortic </strong>valve <strong>opens</strong>. The pressure within the left ventricle rises slowly during isovolumetric contraction until it is sufficient to open the aortic valve. Once the aortic valve opens, blood within the left ventricle is ejected into the aorta. This decreases the volume of the left ventricle, while increasing the pressure within the ventricle.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase IV</strong>- It is the period of <strong>isovolumetric relaxation</strong>. It extends between <strong>points D</strong> and <strong>A</strong>. At the end of the ejection (Point D), the aortic valve closes. However, the ventricular relaxation continues despite closed aortic and mitral valves. Therefore, the ventricular pressure continues to fall while the volume remains the same. The ventricle returns to its starting point, with about 50 mL of blood left in the ventricle and pressure of about 2 to 3 mmHg.</p>\n<p><strong>End-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ESPVR</strong> is the <strong>maximum pressure</strong> that can be developed by the ventricle at the <strong>end-systolic volume</strong>. It is determined by the line intersecting the upper left corners of the loops. This line can be extended down to the x-axis. The slope of this line is called as ESPVR slope.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/76202439afbd4b4f88576c49193b05c2x1280x1316.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "<p>The above ECG shows <strong>atrial fibrillation. </strong>On physical examination of his jugular venous pressure, <strong>absent 'a' waves </strong>will be noted. </p>\n<p>The following features in the ECG strip suggest the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presence of fibrillatory <strong>'f'</strong> <strong>waves </strong>is indicative of uncoordinated atrial activation. Normal morphology <strong>P waves</strong> (indicative of normal atrial contraction)<strong> </strong>are <strong>absent</strong></li>\n<li>The <strong>QRS complex</strong> duration is<strong> &lt;120 ms</strong>, which is normal. A narrow QRS complex indicates that the impulses are originating from the atria</li>\n<li>R waves (QRS complex) occur irregularly, indicative of a <strong>variable</strong> <strong>RR interval. </strong>The rhythm is <strong>irregular </strong>(the pace is set by the refractory period of the AV node)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>'a' wave</strong> is the first peak on a JVP tracing. It represents the <strong>atrial contraction</strong> (atrial systole). The rapid impulses of atrial fibrillation do not allow enough time for atrial filling and atrial contraction, leading to absent 'a' waves on JVP. </p>\n<p>In acute atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability, electrical or chemical <strong>cardioversion</strong> is the first step. The latter is done by intravenous administration of class III antiarrhythmic - ibutilide. In a stable patient, <strong>ventricular rate control</strong> is the primary aim. This is done by intravenous or oral administration of <strong>beta-blockers</strong>. <strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong> such as verapamil and diltiazem can also be used. </p>\n<p>If the current episode duration is <strong>&gt;48 hours</strong>, cardioversion can precipitate thromboembolic complications. In such cases, cardioversion should be carried out only after <strong>3 weeks</strong> of anticoagulation. It has to be continued for 4 weeks after cardioversion. Another option is to evaluate the presence of a thrombus in the left atrial appendage. This can be done either by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or high-resolution CT.</p>\n<p>If the duration is &lt;48 hours and there are no high-risk factors, cardioversion can be done. <strong>CHA2DS2-VASc</strong> scoring system is used to assess stroke risk. </p>\n<p><strong>Warfarin</strong> is recommended in patients with rheumatic<strong> mitral stenosis</strong> or mechanical heart valves who present with atrial fibrillation. In mitral stenosis, thrombi arise frequently from the <strong>dilated left atrium</strong>. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of mitral stenosis is known as nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. <strong>Oral factor Xa inhibitors</strong> such as apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban can be used in such cases. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: JVP waveform and the abnormalities</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/18bbe4a977c84587903e8637a0d9303cx1280x1005.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>1) The <strong>a-wave</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial contraction</strong>.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prominent a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Pulmonary hypertension, right atrial thrombus/ mass, and tricuspid stenosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cannon a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Complete AV block, ventricular tachycardia, and premature atrial/ junctional/ ventricular beats</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent a-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Atrial fibrillation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) The <strong>c-wave</strong> corresponds to the <strong>bulging of tricuspid valve</strong> into right atrium during ventricular contraction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) The <strong>x-descent</strong> corresponds to <strong>atrial relaxation</strong> during atrial diastole.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent x-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Severe tricuspid regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rapid x-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Cardiac tamponade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) The <strong>v-wave</strong> corresponds to the <strong>venous filling</strong> of right atrium.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dominant v-waves</strong></td>\n<td>Tricuspid regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5) The <strong>y-descent</strong> corresponds to the&nbsp;<strong>passive emptying of the right atrium</strong> into right ventricle.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Abnormality</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conditions</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prolonged y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Tricuspid stenosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rapid y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Constrictive pericarditis and isolated severe tricuspid regurgitation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Absent y-descent</strong></td>\n<td>Cardiac tamponade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Supraventricular tachycardias</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Supraventricular tachycardias with narrow QRS complex:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Narrow QRS with regular RR interval</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ECG features</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sinus tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td>Normal P wave, normal ECG features except for the rate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Focal atrial tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td>A single type of abnormal p wave morphology is seen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Junctional tachycardia</strong></td>\n<td>No p waves.

REM sleep is characterized by a high level of brain activity.&nbsp;REM sleep refers to rapid, roving eye movements that occur during this stage of sleep and are recorded as an electrooculogram (EOG). During<strong> REM sleep</strong>, except for eye movement, there is almost a <strong>complete loss of skeletal muscle tone.</strong> The threshold for arousal from sleep by sensory stimuli is increased during this time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NREM sleep is composed of stages 1 through 4. About 90 minutes after sleep onset, NREM yields to the first REM episode of the night. Non-REM sleep is divided into four stages:</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong>: The transition from wakefulness to sleep. EEG shows a low-voltage, <strong>mixed-frequency</strong> pattern. A <strong>theta rhythm</strong> (4&ndash;7 Hz) is seen during this stage with <strong>vertex sharp waves</strong>. There are slow eye movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong>: Presence of sinusoidal waves called <strong>sleep spindles</strong> (7&ndash;15 Hz) and <strong>K complexes</strong> which are negative sharp waves followed by a positive slow wave. There are no eye movements, muscle tone is reduced. (image 2)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong>: Presence of a <strong>high-amplitude delta rhythm</strong> (0.5&ndash;4 Hz). There is a further reduction in muscle tone and arousal, no eye movements. (image 3)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong>: A characteristic pattern of <strong>rhythmic slow waves</strong>, sometimes referred to as slow-wave sleep. Occurrence of <strong>theta and delta</strong> <strong>rhythms</strong> is normal during sleep. No eye movements, low muscle tone.</p>\n<p><strong>Wakefulness</strong>:&nbsp;Low-voltage, mixed frequency activity. When eyes are closed, alpha activity is noted.

The transportation of the molecules mainly depends on the carrier proteins.</p>\n<p>Important examples of primary active transport: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sodium-potassium ATPase</li>\n<li>Proton pump</li>\n<li>Calcium ATPase</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Proton pumps: These are essential for the primary active transport of <strong>hydrogen ions</strong>. These pumps are mainly present in <strong>gastric glands</strong> of the <strong>stomach</strong> and <strong>late distal tubules</strong> and <strong>cortical collecting ducts</strong> of the<strong> kidney</strong>. </p>\n<p>The main function of proton pumps in the parietal cells of the stomach is to <strong>secrete gastric acid</strong>. The gastric mucosa has abundant mitochondria and this provides the ATPase that is required for the primary active transport of hydrogen ions. </p>\n<p>At rest, the proton pumps lie within the cells in stacks of membrane compartments called <strong>tubulovesicles</strong>. During the active phase secretion, these tubulovesicles fuse to form canaliculi. This fusion increases the apical membrane of the cells and positions the proton pumps to begin the acid secretion. </p>\n<p>Proton-pump inhibitors like omeprazole form <strong>thiophilic sulfenamide cation </strong>that irreversibly binds and inactivates the enzyme H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. </p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: In <strong>simple diffusion</strong>, the molecules pass directly through the cell membrane along the concentration gradient. It does not require energy and is <strong>not carrier-mediated</strong>. Examples include the movement of <strong>water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, </strong>and<strong> nitrogen </strong>across the cell membrane. </p>\n<p>Option B: In <strong>secondary active transport</strong>, the transport of sodium is coupled to the transport of other substances against the concentration gradient. Examples include sodium co-transport of glucose and amino acids with sodium and sodium counter-transport of calcium and hydrogen ions. </p>\n<p>Option C: In <strong>facilitated diffusion</strong>, the molecules are transported via <strong>carrier-mediated</strong> proteins along the concentration gradient. This transport does not require energy. Examples include the transport of glucose through GLUT (insulin-mediated transport of glucose via GLUT 4). </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Characteristics of different types of transport</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Simple diffusion</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Facilitated diffusion</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Primary active transport</strong></td>\n<td>Secondary active transport <strong>Cotransport</strong></td>\n<td>Secondary active transport <strong>Countertransport</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Electrochemical gradient</td>\n<td>Downhill</td>\n<td>Downhill</td>\n<td>Uphill</td>\n<td>Uphill</td>\n<td>Uphill</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carrier mediated</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metabolic energy</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Indirect</td>\n<td>Indirect</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Na<sup>+</sup> gradient</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>--</td>\n<td>Yes (same direction)</td>\n<td>Yes (opposite direction)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump</p>\n&nbsp;</td>\n<td>--</td>\n<td>--</td>\n<td>Inhibits</td>\n<td>Inhibits</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Inhibits</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
