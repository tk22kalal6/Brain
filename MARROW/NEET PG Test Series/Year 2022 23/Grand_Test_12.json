      "solution": "<p><strong>Benzhexol</strong> should be used in the management of this patient. The development of abnormal movements following an anti-emetic injection suggests that the antiemetic used in this case is probably <strong>metoclopramide</strong>.</p>\n<p>Metoclopramide is a <strong>dopamine receptor antagonist</strong> used as a prokinetic and anti-emetic agent. It can produce <strong>extrapyramidal side effects</strong> and <strong>dystonia</strong> is seen acutely following intravenous injections. <strong>Anticholinergics </strong>like<strong> benzhexol (trihexyphenidyl)</strong> are used in the management of these side effects. Benzhexol is a&nbsp;<strong>centrally-acting</strong> anticholinergic&nbsp;agent. It acts by restoring the cholinergic balance in the striatal interneurons.</p>\n<p>Extrapyramidal side effects of metoclopramide are&nbsp;commonly seen in children and young adults with higher doses. Acute dystonia occurs after intravenous administration, while parkinsonian-like symptoms develop weeks after therapy. It is managed with the discontinuation of metoclopramide and with anticholinergics or antihistaminics. Irreversible tardive dyskinesia can occur with chronic treatment.</p>\n<p>Other adverse effects:</p>\n<p>It can cause <strong>galactorrhea</strong> by its dopamine antagonism. Methemoglobinemia can occur if used in infants.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Hyoscine</strong> (scopolamine): It is a muscarinic receptor antagonist used in the management of <strong>motion sickness</strong> and vomiting.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Cyproheptadine</strong> is an H1 receptor antagonist used in the management of various allergy-related conditions like allergic rhinitis, anaphylaxis, urticaria, etc.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Levodopa</strong> is the precursor of dopamine and it is given in combination with carbidopa for the management of <strong>parkinsonism.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotic drugs</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Adverse reactions</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Time of onset</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Features</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Treatment</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Acute dystonia</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>1 to 5 days</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Spasm of muscles of tongue, face, neck, back</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Diphenhydramine or benztropine</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Akathisia</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>5 to 60 days</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Restlessness</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Propranolol</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>lorazepam, diphenhydramine, benztropine</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Parkinsonism</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>5 to 30 days</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Bradykinesia, rigidity, tremors</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Dose reduction, change medication, antiparkinsonian agents</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Tardive dyskinesia</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Months to years</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\">\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Orofacial dyskinesia (may be reversible with early recognition and drug discontinuation)</span></div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>VMAT-2 inhibitors <strong>valbenazine</strong> and <strong>deutetrabenazine</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Weeks to months</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span>Extreme rigidity, fever, unstable blood pressure</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"p1\"><span><strong>Dantrolene</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

When patients' chances of PE are high, the patient should be assessed for D-dimer levels. Normal levels of D-dimer rule out the possibility of PE. <strong>If </strong>the <strong>D-dimer</strong> levels are <strong>elevated,</strong> then the <strong>chances of pulmonary embolism </strong>are very <strong>high </strong>and the <strong>patient should undergo imaging</strong> to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>CT of the chest</strong> with <strong>intravenous contrast</strong> is the <strong>principal imaging test</strong> for the diagnosis of PE. It can provide exquisite detail, with &le;1 mm of resolution during a short breath-hold. It also helps to visualize the chambers of the heart. In patients who do not have a pulmonary embolism, it can also help in identifying alternative diagnoses like emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary mass, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Because of the invasive nature of pulmonary angiography (option B) and availability of chest CT scans, it is not commonly used in the diagnosis of PE. It is reserved for patients with technically unsatisfactory chest CTs and for those for whom an interventional procedure such as catheter-directed thrombolysis is planned.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lung scanning</strong> has become a <strong>second-line</strong> diagnostic test for PE, in patients who cannot tolerate intravenous contrast. Small particulate aggregates of albumin labeled with a gamma-emitting radionuclide are injected intravenously and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed. The perfusion scan defect indicates absent or decreased blood flow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>MR pulmonary angiography</strong> is a reliable test to identify deep vein thrombosis. It may detect large proximal PE, but is not reliable for smaller segmental and subsegmental PE.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most patients with PE have a normal echocardiogram (option D). Therefore, it is not a reliable test to detect PE. However, it can be used to detect other conditions that commonly mimic PE like acute myocardial infarction, pericardial tamponade, and aortic dissection.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ba2dd6cc045540539ac5fd04c28403e1x1280x2263.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Clinical prediction for pulmonary embolism: Well’s, Modified Well’s and Pulmonary Embolism Rule out Criteria (PERC)</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Signs/symptoms</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Score</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clinical signs of DVT</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Diagnosis other than pulmonary embolism is less likely</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heart rate &gt;100 bpm</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Immobilization for &gt;3 days or surgery in the last 4 weeks</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Past history of DVT/pulmonary embolism</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hemoptysis</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Malignancy</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><strong>Three-level score probability:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Well's criteria</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Score</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>&lt;2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>2-6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>&gt;6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><strong>Two-level score probability:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Modified Well's criteria</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Score</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pulmonary embolism unlikely</td>\n<td>&le;4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pulmonary embolism likely</td>\n<td>&gt;4&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC):</strong></p>\n<p>This is a quick OPD/casualty tool to rule out pulmonary embolism in patients with low clinical probability.

In this case, the patient&rsquo;s or attendant&rsquo;s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.</p>\n<p>So, contributory negligence occurs when <strong>both the doctor and patient are negligent</strong>. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient&rsquo;s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the<strong> patient:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.</li>\n<li>Fails to follow the doctor&rsquo;s instructions</li>\n<li>Refuses to take the treatment</li>\n<li>Leaves the hospital against doctor&rsquo;s advice</li>\n<li>Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contributory negligence is a defence </strong>for doctor&rsquo;s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the <strong>doctrine of comparative negligence</strong>, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>no</strong> <strong>proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is negligent</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<strong>Last clear chance doctrine: </strong>It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>gave proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (<strong>There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

Example- the transmission of infection by a contaminated multidose vial (Option C)</p>\n<p>4.<strong> Immunization anxiety&ndash;related reaction&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;An AEFI arising from <strong>anxiety</strong> about the immunization. Example - vasovagal syncope in an adolescent during/following vaccination (Option D)</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Coincidental event&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;AEFI is caused by something other than the vaccine product, immunization error, or immunization anxiety.

As the body is still at a lower temperature, various<strong> heat generating mechanisms are activated </strong>to match the hypothalamic temperature setpoint:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shivering</strong>- the shivering center is located in the <strong>posterior hypothalamus</strong>. It is <strong>normally inhibited</strong> by signals from the<strong> heat center</strong> in the <strong>anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area</strong> but is <strong>excited</strong> by <strong>cold signals </strong>from the <strong>skin</strong> and <strong>spinal cord</strong>. A sudden increase in heat setpoint results in the activation of this center. It then transmits non-rhythmic signals through bilateral tracts through the lateral columns of the spinal cord, and finally to the anterior motor neurons. They increase the tone of the skeletal muscles throughout the body. As the tone rises above a certain critical level, shivering begins. During <strong>maximum shivering</strong>, body<strong> heat production</strong> can <strong>rise</strong> to <strong>four to five times</strong> normal.</li>\n<li><strong>Vasoconstriction </strong>(decreased blood flow to skin) is mediated by increased sympathetic drive by the activation of the posterior hypothalamic sympathetic center.</li>\n<li>An <strong>increase</strong> in<strong> chemical thermogenesis</strong> in which heat production takes place in the<strong> brown fat</strong> by the mechanism of<strong> uncoupling</strong> of oxidative phosphorylation.

The BER is seen in all sites of gastrointestinal smooth muscle&nbsp;<strong>except&nbsp;</strong>in the<strong>&nbsp;esophagus and proximal stomach.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Spike potentials on BER:</strong></p>\n<p>The<strong>&nbsp;BER&nbsp;</strong>does<strong>&nbsp;not cause contraction</strong>&nbsp;of the smooth muscle. However, when the BER is superimposed by the spike potentials, it increases muscle tension. The&nbsp;<strong>depolarizing</strong>&nbsp;portion of each spike is due to&nbsp;<strong>Ca<sup><span class=\"s1\">2+&nbsp;</span></sup>influx</strong>, and the&nbsp;<strong>repolarizing</strong>&nbsp;portion is due to&nbsp;<strong>K<span class=\"s1\"><sup>+</sup>&nbsp;</span>efflux.</strong>&nbsp;Important neurotransmitters that affect BER are</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acetylcholine</strong>&nbsp;causes an&nbsp;<strong>increase</strong>&nbsp;in the number of spike potentials and muscle tension.</li>\n<li><strong>Epinephrine</strong>&nbsp;causes a&nbsp;<strong>decrease</strong>&nbsp;in the number of spike potentials and muscle tension.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">The function of the BER is to coordinate peristaltic and other motor activity, such as setting the rhythm of segmentation, contractions can occur only during the depolarizing part of the waves. After&nbsp;<strong>vagotomy</strong>&nbsp;or transection of the stomach wall, for example, peristalsis in the&nbsp;<strong>stomach becomes irregular and chaotic.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2db297276db6424dbf13937533a5a0d1x1279x858.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "<p>The clinical scenario of an obese patient with&nbsp;hypertension, moon facies, and easy bruisability with multiple purple striae over the abdomen is suggestive of&nbsp;<strong>Cushing's syndrome</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>24-h urine-free cortisol</strong> level is <strong>raised</strong> and is a cost-effective screening test.</p>\n<p>Cushing syndrome is characterized by&nbsp;<strong>prolonged exposure to high circulating levels of cortisol</strong>, i.e., hypercortisolism, which can be&nbsp;due to endogenous or exogenous causes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Endogenous hypercortisolism can be ACTH dependent or ACTH independent. ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism caused&nbsp;by an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma is termed&nbsp;<strong>Cushing's disease.</strong>&nbsp;ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism can also be caused by ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors. ACTH-independent hypercortisolism is mainly caused by adrenal hyperplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma.</p>\n<p>Exogenous hypercortisolism due to the prolonged use of glucocorticoids is the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome.</p>\n<p>Excess cortisol increases the rate of gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and insulin resistance.&nbsp;Cortisol directly affects the transcription and translation of enzyme proteins involved in the metabolism of fats, glycogen, protein synthesis, and Krebs' cycle. The excess catabolism of proteins causes <strong>purplish striae</strong> of the torso, osteoporosis, and poor wound healing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>24-h urine-free cortisol</strong> (UFC) can detect endogenous overproduction of cortisol and is used as a <strong>screening test</strong>. An overnight&nbsp;<strong>1-mg</strong> dexamethasone suppression test (Option C) can be used to identify patients with hypercortisolism.</p>\n<p>Elevated midnight serum or salivary samples of cortisol are suggestive of Cushing&rsquo;s disease. <strong>But, in smokers, late-night salivary cortisol</strong> can be falsely high (Option B) due to the inhibition of 11-beta-hydroxy dehydrogenase on the salivary gland, and hence it is not confirmatory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Basal plasma ACTH levels distinguish patients</strong> with ACTH-independent (adrenal glucocorticoid) from those with ACTH-dependent (pituitary ACTH) Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome.
