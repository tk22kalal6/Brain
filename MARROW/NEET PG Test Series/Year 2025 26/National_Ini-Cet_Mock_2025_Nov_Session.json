This most likely demonstrates a larger study with more participants compared to study A, where the result favours the intervention used.

This can be caused by cord contusion due to vertebral fracture, dislocation, or by a herniated intervertebral disc. The clinical features seen after the period of spinal shock are:<br><br>1. Bilateral lower motor neuron paralysis in the segment of the lesion and muscular atrophy. This is caused by damage to neurons in the anterior grey columns and the anterior nerve roots of the same segment.<br><br>2. Bilateral spastic paralysis below the level of the lesion due to the involvement of anterior corticospinal tracts on both sides. The spasticity is produced by the interruption of tracts other than the corticospinal tracts.<br><br>3. Bilateral loss of pain, temperature, and light touch sensations below the level of the lesion due to anterior and lateral spinothalamic tract involvement on both sides.<br><br>4. Tactile discrimination, vibratory and proprioceptive sensations are preserved as the posterior white columns on both sides are intact.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Complete cord transection results in complete loss of all sensation and voluntary movements below the level of the lesion.<br><br>* The loss of tactile discrimination,  vibratory and proprioceptive sensations is due to bilateral destruction of the ascending tracts in the posterior white columns.<br><br>* The loss of pain, temperature and light touch sensations is due to destruction of the lateral and anterior spinothalamic tracts.<br><br>Option B: Central cord syndrome occurs due to damage to the central region of the spinal cord.

The lump is papular with a raised pigmented area. The ulcers have often everted margins with fissured, cracked, and indurated surrounding skin. They usually bleed and cause offensive vulval discharge. The lesions are most commonly seen over the labia major.  HPV or HIV infection, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are associated with vulval cancers. <br><br>The order of lymph node involvement in vulval cancer includes mainly the superficial inguinal lymph node, deep inguinal lymph node, and femoral group of lymph nodes. The external iliac, obturator, and common iliac nodes are also involved in the advanced stages.<br><br>Surgical morbidity in early vulval cancer can be reduced by restricting unnecessary lymph node dissection but it is necessary for the determination of the extent of primary lymph node (sentinel) involvement.

This stimulates the peripheral chemoreceptors in carotid bodies, resulting in hyperventilation. It causes excessive loss of carbon dioxide, leading to a fall in arterial pCO2 and development of respiratory alkalosis, which is reflected in the ABG findings in the patient. This alkalosis will cause a leftward shift of the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve.<br><br>The oxygen dissociation curve is a plot of the partial pressure of O2 and the percentage saturation of Hb with O2. It is normally sigmoid in shape. If the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the right, it means that the affinity of Hb for O2 has decreased, which favours O2 delivery. This means a higher P50, which implies that a higher PO2 is required to maintain 50% saturation (R - Right shift Releases oxygen). If the curve is shifted to the left, it means that affinity for O2 has increased (which favours O2 binding), i.e., a lower P50 value (Left shift), which allows oxygen to bind more readily.<br><br>The different causes for the shift to the right and shift to the left are shown in the image below:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d9c190ca1fd741b99597459794e1e54ax600x647.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

When the enzyme has a high affinity for the substrate, ½ Vmax is achieved at a lower substrate concentration/ lower Km.<br><br>In non-competitive inhibition, an inhibitor binds to the allosteric site of the enzyme. This leads to a conformational change in the substrate-binding site which prevents the binding of the substrate to the enzyme.

      "solution": "Insulin secretion is dependent on intracellular ATP concentrations.<br><br>On food intake, there is subsequent uptake of glucose by the pancreatic beta islet cells. The glucose molecules undergo cytoplasmic glycolysis (glucokinase-mediated) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. This ATP reenters the cytoplasm where it inhibits the ATP-sensitive K+ channels.<br><br>Reduction of K+ efflux leads to retention of intracellular positive charge and consequent beta-cell membrane depolarization. This results in Ca2+ entry (via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels) that promotes exocytosis of secretory granules containing the insulin hormone.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4ff45490c8564deb950e57398f2aba7cx1280x1153.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Insulin promotes intracellular movement of potassium. This is believed to be due to a mechanism that involves insulin-mediated activation of Na+/K+ ATPase pump that promotes K+ influx into the cell, resulting in hypokalemia. Potassium plays an important role in insulin secretion from beta cells in the pancreatic islets as well. <br><br>Option B: Insulin binds to transmembrane receptors that have tyrosine kinase activity in their intracellular subunits. There is subsequent autophosphorylation of these subunits that mediate the biological effects of insulin. One of the consequences is the growth-promoting protein anabolic effects carried out by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).<br><br>Option C: C peptide is the peptide segment that connects the A and B chains of the insulin (proinsulin). Once hormone granules are exocytosed from the beta islet cells, proinsulin is cleaved so as to be released in equimolar concentrations of insulin and C peptide.<br><br>Pearl PM1498: Factors affecting insulin secretion<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Stimulators</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Inhibitors</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Glucose</p>\n<p>Mannose</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2-Deoxyglucose</p>\n<p>Mannoheptulose</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Glucagon</p>\n</td>\n<td>Somatostatin </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Amino acids - leucine arginine</p>\n<p>Intestinal hormones - GIP, GLP-1, gastrin, secretin, CCK</p>\n</td>\n<td>K<sup>+</sup> depletion </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Leptin</p>\n<p> </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Acetylcholine (Parasympathetic stimulation )</p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>β-adrenergic stimulators</p>\n<p>Theophylline</p>\n<p>Sulfonylureas</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>α-adrenergic stimulators (norepinephrine, epinephrine)β-Adrenergic blockers  (propranolol)</p>\n<p>Diazoxide</p>\n<p>Thiazide diuretics</p>\n<p>Phenytoin </p>\n<p>Alloxan</p>\n<p>Microtubule inhibitors ( Taxanes, Vinca alkaloids)</p>\n<p>Insulin</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Pearl PM1497: Glucose Transporters<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Function</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Major sites of expression</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Secondary active transport</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(Na </strong><strong><sup>+</sup></strong> <strong>-glucose cotransport)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>SGLT 1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absorption of glucose</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Small intestine, renal tubules</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>SGLT 2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absorption of glucose</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Renal tubules</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Facilitated diffusion</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Basal glucose uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Placenta, blood-brain barrier, brain, red cells, kidneys, colon, many other organs</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>β-cell glucose sensor; transport out of intestinal and renal epithelial cells</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>β cells of islets, liver, epithelial cells of small intestine, kidneys</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 3</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Basal glucose uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Brain, placenta, kidneys, many other organs</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 4</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Skeletal and cardiac muscle, adipose tissue, other tissues</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 5</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fructose transport</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Jejunum, sperm</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GLUT 6</p>\n</td>\n<td>Function not known</td>\n<td>Brain, spleen, leucocytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GLUT 7</td>\n<td>Glucose-6-phosphate transporter in the endoplasmic reticulum</td>\n<td>Liver</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "The clinical scenario of a frontal lobe tumour, presenting with seizures and the histopathology image showing the ‘fried egg appearance’ of tumour cells, points to the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma.<br><br>Oligodendroglioma is a subtype of infiltrating glioma. It is comprised of cells that resemble oligodendrocytes. The tumours are composed of sheets of regular cells with spherical nuclei surrounded by a clear halo of vacuolated cytoplasm. This gives it the ‘fried egg appearance.’ The tumour cells that infiltrate the cortex usually collect around the neuron, and this is known as perineural satellitosis. There is a delicate network of anastomosing thin-walled capillaries between the tumour cells, resembling 'chicken wire.'<br><br>Oligodendrogliomas are most commonly detected in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Patients may have had several years of antecedent neurologic complaints, often including seizures. The lesions are found mostly in the cerebral hemispheres, mainly in the frontal or temporal lobes. It is treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Glioblastoma is a synonym for grade IV astrocytoma. Infiltrating astrocytomas and glioblastomas are usually seen in the cerebellum, brainstem, or spinal cord. Histologically, glioblastoma appears like an anaplastic astrocytoma with serpiginous foci of palisading necrosis and microvascular proliferation. <br><br>Option C: Ependymomas in adults occur in the spinal cord and near the ventricles, particularly the fourth ventricle. The microscopic appearance shows both true rosettes and perivascular pseudorosettes.<br><br>Option D: Schwannomas are benign tumours often arising directly from peripheral nerves.

Therefore, autoantibodies are useful in the investigation of patient A.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency presents with skin paleness due to the relatively lower stimulation of the melanocytes due to the deficiency of ACTH.

If a child's stature is less than -3 SD below the average for their age and gender, it is more likely to indicate pathological short stature. A child's height between -2 and -3 SD is more likely due to physiological, i.e. familial or constitutional short stature.<br><br>To assess children under 2 years old, supine length should be measured using an infantometer. For older children, height should be measured using a stadiometer.<br><br>Curve 1 shows that the growth curve initially follows the average pattern but then deviates below the mean curve and gradually tapers off. This represents postnatal onset pathologic short stature. The onset of this condition can be due to factors like undernutrition, systemic illness, or endocrine issues such as growth hormone deficiency or hypothyroidism.<br><br>Curve 2 shows that the growth decreases near the end of infancy, runs parallel through middle childhood, and accelerates toward the end of adulthood with the achievement of normal adult height. This represents the constitutional growth delay where the onset of puberty and adolescent growth spurt is also delayed. Bone age is lower than chronological age and corresponds to the height age.<br><br>Curve 3 shows that the growth runs parallel to and just below the mean curve from early childhood till adulthood. The child has a family history of short stature. Familial short stature is characterized by both the infant and the parents being small in stature. In this case, the bone age aligns with the chronological age, and the projected adult height is below average. The height of the parents has a significant impact on the child's height. Mid-parental height (MPH) provides a rough estimation of the child's genetically determined potential height.<br><br>Curve 4 shows that the growth is decreased since birth and remains below the mean curve. The growth is less than -2 SD while reaching adulthood. This represents the prenatal onset of pathological short stature. In congenital pathologic short stature, an infant may or may not be born small, but growth gradually tapers throughout infancy. Causes include chromosome or genetic abnormalities like Turner syndrome, skeletal dysplasia, trisomy 21, perinatal infection, extreme prematurity, and teratogens.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/177720e156d848159fbab7f01c0cff09x1280x1969.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM2090: Short stature: Familial vs Constitutional<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Feature</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Constitutional Delay</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Familial Short Stature</strong>  </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Height</td>\n<td>Short</td>\n<td>Short</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Final Height</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Normal</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Short  </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Family history</td>\n<td>Delayed puberty</td>\n<td>Short stature  </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bone age</td>\n<td>Less than chronological age</td>\n<td>Normal  </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Puberty</td>\n<td>Delayed</td>\n<td>Normal  </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Height velocity</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "The correct statements are 1, 3.<br><br>The maximum recommended daily dose of paracetamol in adults is 4g/day (Statement 2), while ingestion of more than 10-15 g is considered toxic. In therapeutic doses, paracetamol is mainly metabolised by glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small fraction converted to CYP2E1 to a highly toxic metabolite, NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine). Paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose is a leading cause of acute liver failure.<br><br>Symptoms of paracetamol toxicity appear immediately after ingestion (Statement 4) is a false statement. Instead, toxicity progresses in stages: in the first 48 hours, patients may be asymptomatic or have nonspecific nausea, vomiting, and malaise; during 48-72 hours, hepatic injury manifests with right upper quadrant pain and elevated liver enzymes. The 72-96 hour stage is the peak of hepatotoxicity with jaundice, coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and risk of multi-organ failure; and beyond 4 days, patients either recover or progress to death.<br><br>N-acetyl cysteine acts by replenishing glutathione stores (Statement 1). It is the specific antidote. It enhances non-toxic metabolism of NAPQI, and is most effective when given within 8-16 hours. Supportive measures include activated charcoal if the patient presents within 4 hours of ingestion, and close monitoring of liver function, coagulation profile, renal function, and blood glucose. Severe cases with fulminant hepatic failure may require liver transplantation. <br><br>Chronic alcohol consumption increases the risk of hepatotoxicity (Statement 3) because alcohol induces CYP2E1 and increases the formation of NAPQI. Normally, NAPQI is rapidly detoxified by conjugation with glutathione, but in overdose situations, glutathione stores are depleted, leading to hepatocellular necrosis and fulminant hepatic failure. However, when there is a paracetamol overdose along with acute alcohol consumption, a protective effect against paracetamol-induced liver injury is seen. This can be explained as acute alcohol use inhibits the hepatic microsomal enzymes (mainly CYP2E1) that convert paracetamol to its toxic metabolite, NAPQI. This protection disappears once ethanol is eliminated from the body, so the relative timing of alcohol and paracetamol ingestion is critical.<br><br>Pearl PM0648: Specific antidotes for poisoning<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ANTIDOTE</strong></td>\n<td><strong>POISONING</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4-methyl pyrazole</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>100% oxygen </strong></td>\n<td>Carbon monoxide, cyanide, methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ammonium chloride </strong></td>\n<td>Phencyclidine, amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Amyl nitrite </strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide, hydrogen sulphide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Atropine</strong></td>\n<td>Carbamate and organophosphorus poisoning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bupropion</strong></td>\n<td>Nicotine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium disodium edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, magnesium, nickel, uranium, zinc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium gluconate </strong></td>\n<td>Precipitates fluorides, magnesium and oxalates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Chlorpromazine</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Deferoxamine</strong></td>\n<td>Iron, aluminium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diazepam</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine, chloroquine, alcohol withdrawal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dicobalt edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dimercaprol (BAL)</strong></td>\n<td>Antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and gold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diphenhydramine</strong></td>\n<td>Phenothiazines and related drugs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disodium calcium edetate</strong></td>\n<td><strong> </strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMPS *, (Unithiol)</strong></td>\n<td><strong> </strong>Mercury</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMSA ** </strong></td>\n<td><strong> </strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>D-Penicillamine (Cuprimine) </strong></td>\n<td>Copper, lead, mercury, chromate, nickel, zinc, arsenic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ethanol</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fab fragment</strong></td>\n<td>Digoxin, digitoxin, oleander tea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Flumazenil</strong></td>\n<td>Benzodiazepine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Glucagon</strong></td>\n<td>Propranolol and other beta-blockers toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hydroxocobalamin</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Labetalol hydrochloride</strong></td>\n<td>Hypertensive crisis due to cocaine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methionine</strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methylene blue</strong></td>\n<td>Methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>N-acetylcysteine </strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol, acetaminophen toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nalorphine</strong></td>\n<td>Morphine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Naloxone (Naltrexone)</strong></td>\n<td>Narcotic, opiates, CNS depressants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nicotinamide</strong></td>\n<td>Vacor poisoning, phenylurea pesticide toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Neostigmine</strong></td>\n<td>Neuromuscular blocking agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Penicillamine</strong></td>\n<td>Copper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Physostigmine salicylate </strong></td>\n<td>Coma, convulsions from anticholinergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pralidoxime (2-PAM) </strong></td>\n<td>Organophosphorus insecticides, nerve agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Protamine sulphate </strong></td>\n<td>Heparin overdose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prussian blue</strong></td>\n<td>Thallium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pyridoxine (Vit.

CT is useful to distinguish an empyema from a lung abscess. Radiologically, a thicker and more irregular wall, and destruction rather than compression of the underlying lung suggest abscess rather than empyema. Unlike empyema, lung abscess is caused by trans diaphragmatic extension of a liver abscess or by bronchopleural fistula.  Contrast-enhanced CT should be adopted to visualize the margins and any associated vascular or airway complications. CT findings of lung abscess are similar to radiographs, with thick-walled, discrete cavitating lesions containing fluid, with or without gas.<br><br>The below image shows a lung abscess as the thick-walled cavitary lesion in the right lung, The diffuse ground glass infiltrates present in both lungs represent pneumonia.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6da9945df7014d098afdece62771765fx512x447.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option C: Pleural effusion on CT scan appears as free fluid in the dependent parts of the pleural cavity. It does not show any enhancement.<br><br>Option D: Hemothorax on CT scan may show areas of hyperdensity, which have a varying appearance dependent on age. A hematocrit effect with layering of blood may be seen in a subacute stage.",

      "solution": "If thromboelastography is done, the tracing would correspond to image marked 1.<br><br>The patient is on warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation. Warfarin acts by reducing the activity of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors(Ⅱ, Ⅶ, Ⅸ, Ⅹ). This delays the initiation of clot formation.<br><br>On thromboelastography, the parameter that reflects the clotting factor is the R-time(Reaction time). Hence, warfarin leads to prolonged R-time, represented by image 1. Since the platelet counts and fibrinogen levels are normal, the subsequent clot kinetics - K time, ⍺ angle, and maximum amplitude remain within normal limits.<br><br>Thromboelastography (TEG) is a non-invasive test that quantifies the ability of whole blood to form a clot. It tests the entire coagulation pathway. The thromboelastography curve has the following parts:<br><br>* Reaction time/ R-time signifies the time from start to the initial fibrin formation. It represents the clotting factor activity. Prolonged R-time is seen in deficiency of clotting factors, anticoagulant therapy(heparin, warfarin). Short R-time is seen in a hypercoagulable state.<br><br>* Kinetics/K is the time from initial clot formation until it reaches a defined strength. It depends upon fibrinogen levels.<br><br>* α-angle is the angle formed by the slope of the TEG curve during the K-time phase. It represents the rate at which the fibrin cross-linking occurs. This depends mainly on the concentration of fibrin.<br><br>* Maximum amplitude (MA) represents the maximum strength of a clot. This depends on platelet number and function. <br><br>* LY-30 signifies the extent of clot lysis, and A-30 signifies the amplitude of the clot left behind. Both these values are measured 30 minutes after MA. They depend on the presence of plasmin and its activators.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/25eab3220fd64a278dacb08c399364f8x1280x1131.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>The following image shows different tracings of thromboelastography:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/708e8f49b7254989b420ef6e9370ca89x1280x1071.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
