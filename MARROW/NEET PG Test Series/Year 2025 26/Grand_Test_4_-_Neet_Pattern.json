It is also known as Braxton Hicks contractions.<br><br>It is more common in primigravidae than in parous women and usually appears 1 or 2 weeks prior to the onset of true labor pain in primigravidae and a few days prior in multiparae. <br><br>True labor pain is characterised by pain in the lower abdomen and back, radiating to the thighs. It occurs due to painful uterine contractions at regular intervals with increasing frequency, intensity and duration. It is associated with the show (cervical mucus plug with blood), progressive effacement and dilatation of the cervix and descent of the presenting part. It is not relieved by enema or sedatives.<br><br>A bag of waters refers to the lower pole of the fetal membranes containing liquor amnii, which bulges into the cervical canal below the presenting part. During uterine contraction, the bag becomes tense and convex due to the rise in intra-amniotic pressure and disappears completely after the contractions. This is almost a certain sign of the onset of true labor.",

It results from pulmonary congestion due to the left ventricle’s inability to handle the increased venous return in the supine position, leading to fluid accumulation in the lungs and reduced lung compliance. In addition, recumbency pushes the diaphragm upward, decreasing vital capacity, and redistributes fluid from the lower extremities and splanchnic circulation into the central circulation, raising pulmonary capillary pressure. Symptoms are typically relieved by sitting upright or using extra pillows while sleeping.<br><br>Orthopnea can be seen in conditions such as:<br><br>* Congestive heart failure (Option A)<br><br>* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)<br><br>* Asthma (Option B)<br><br>* Constrictive pericarditis (Option C)<br><br>* Bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis<br><br>* Significant ascites.<br><br>Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare complication of liver cirrhosis characterized by hypoxia without significant lung disease. The development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, and consequently numerous shunts within the pulmonary circulation, is a characteristic of hepatopulmonary syndrome. Since they typically arise in the lung bases, an upright posture causes the patient's shunt fraction to rise. This leads to orthodeoxia (hypoxia in the upright position) and platypnea (the sensation of shortness of breath when upright) rather than orthopnea.",

These episodes usually last for a few days to a few weeks. It is also associated with excessive food intake, irritability, and an abnormally uninhibited sex drive. Affected individuals are symptom-free between episodes.<br><br>The syndrome primarily affects adolescent males but also females and individuals of other ages. The underlying cause of this condition is unknown. Possible etiologies are a psychological disturbance, trauma, toxins, infection, serotonergic or dopaminergic neurotransmitter abnormalities, and underlying hypothalamic pathology. Viral infections due to Epstein-Barr virus, Asian influenza virus, and enterovirus; typhoid vaccine; and Streptococcus have been implicated, on the basis of the frequent flu-like symptoms at onset. Episodes tend to decrease with advancing age.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A:  Hypersomnia due to drug or substance use is characterised by sleepiness that occurs due to abuse of drugs like sedative-hypnotics, opioid analgesics, and sedating antihistamines. This cannot be the answer, as the features mentioned are specific and suggestive of Kleine-Levin syndrome.<br><br>Option B: Idiopathic hypersomnia manifests as nocturnal sleep that is prolonged, undisturbed, and unrefreshing. There is difficulty waking up, amnesia, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. It is characterised by migraine-like headaches, syncope, and orthostatic hypotension. The age of onset is 15-30 years.<br><br>Option D: Narcolepsy is characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone to sudden strong emotions), hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis (Brief episodes of total paralysis at the beginning or end of sleep). The hallmark of narcolepsy is decreased REM latency. Modafinil (wakefulness-promoting drug) is the drug of choice.",

It can result from mitral regurgitation (MR), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). A pansystolic murmur is shown in the image below:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/518cca6592ef4a2fae440946e0e54f83x720x459.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital heart defect. It is an acyanotic heart defect characterized by the shunting of oxygenated blood from the left to the right ventricle. On examination, a loud, harsh, or blowing holosystolic murmur can be auscultated most clearly at the lower-left sternal border and is often associated with a palpable thrill.<br><br>Mitral regurgitation (MR) is mostly caused by infective endocarditis, myocardial infarction, rheumatic fever, and cardiomyopathies. Soft S1 with a widely split S2 and a low-pitched S3 (third heart sound) may be heard on auscultation. Additionally, a holosystolic murmur is prominent at the apex and radiates to the axilla.<br><br>Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is most commonly secondary (functional), caused by annular dilation and leaflet tethering from RV remodeling. Primary TR is less common and results from rheumatic heart disease, infective endocarditis, or trauma. The jugular vein is distended. Prominent c-v waves and rapid y descents are seen in severe TR.

Otherwise, it is switched off.

When glucose is present and lactose is absent- The bacteria utilize glucose. The lac I gene produces repressor protein, which binds to the operator site. Repressor-operator binding prevents the binding of RNA polymerase and, consequently, prevents transcription of the lacZ, lacY, and lacA structural genes into a polycistronic mRNA. <br><br>In addition to this, excess glucose inhibits adenylyl cyclase. Therefore, the production of cAMP is reduced. Less cAMP means less cyclic AMP activator protein (CAP) binding to CRE. CRE is not activated, and lac operon is switched off.<br><br>2. When glucose is absent and lactose is present- Bacteria utilize lactose. The lactose inactivates the repressor protein. This prevents the binding of repressor protein to the operator site. The operator site is now free and RNA polymerase can start with the transcription. The low glucose level causes an increase in the adenylyl cyclase activity, and increases the cAMP levels. This increases the binding of CAP to CRE, which in turn activates the transcription of the lacZ, lacY, and lacA structural genes into polycistronic mRNA. <br><br>3. When both glucose and lactose are present- The bacteria utilize glucose. The unused lactose binds to the repressor protein and renders it inactive. The operator site is free. However, the increased glucose level inhibits adenylyl cyclase and decreases the cAMP levels. Therefore, even though the operator site is free, CRE is not activated, which leads to the switching off of the lac operon.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5fd6e348858c4028a52c16ec95ec7736x637x326.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM1108: Difference between Lac & tryptophan operon<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Lac Operon</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Tryptophan Operon</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Inducible gene complex</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Repressible gene complex</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Catabolic system</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Anabolic system</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Contain 3 structural genes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Contains 5 structural gene</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Produce 3 inducible enzymes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Produce 5 Repressible enzymes</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Repressor protein is active</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Repressor protein is inactive</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>High lactose turn transcription on , in low glucose level</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>High tryptophan transcription off</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Lactose act as inducer</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tryptophan act as co-repressor</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Has only 1 type of gene regulation-Negative  control</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Has only 1 type of gene regulation-Negative control</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Usually OFF, Get activated under certain conditions</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Usually ON, inactive at high level of tryptophan.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>cAMP is necessary for CAP to switch transcription on</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>cAMP is not  necessary</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Body temperature may rise but does not exceed 40.5°C (105°F). Heat exhaustion is distinct from heat stroke as the body maintains thermoregulation and no CNS dysfunction occurs. Prompt treatment is essential to prevent progression to life-threatening heat stroke. Diagnosis involves ruling out heat stroke.<br><br>Heat stroke (Option A) is characterized by a raised core temperature of  > 40.5°C [105°F] due to loss of thermoregulatory function and failure of sweating. Predisposing factors include high temperature, increased humidity, infections, old age, lack of acclimatization, and alcoholism. Heat stroke can be of two types:<br><br>* Classic heat stroke (CHS) seen in those with chronic diseases who are predisposed to heat-related illnesses. <br><br>* Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is seen in young, previously healthy people with prolonged exposure to or physical exertion in high temperatures. <br><br>Heat stroke usually presents as a sudden collapse. The skin is dry, flushed, and hot. Sweating is absent in CHS but present in about 50% of cases of EHS. Tachypnea (rapid Kussmaul breathing), tachycardia, hypotension, and widened pulse pressure are other findings.<br><br>CNS dysfunction includes delirium, coma, and convulsions. Thermal cardiomyopathy and heat-related reversible increase in cardiac biomarker levels are also seen. ECG findings include tachyarrhythmias, nonspecific ST-T wave changes, and heat-related ischemia or infarction. Other complications include rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multiorgan failure.<br><br>Heat stroke is managed by rapid cooling, continuous monitoring with a rectal thermistor (flexible thermometer), fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities (hyponatremia and hypoglycemia).<br><br>Other options : <br><br>Option C: Heat syncope (exercise associated collapse) is when the patient collapses following endurance exercise or prolonged standing in the heat. Heat stress causes relative volume depletion, decreased vasomotor tone, and peripheral vasodilation. This results in decreased venous return and postural hypotension, especially in nonacclimated elderly individuals. After removal from heat source, most patients recover promptly with cooling and rehydration. <br><br>Option D: Heat cramps are painful muscle spasms caused by the loss of water and salt in high temperatures due to profuse sweating.<br><br>Pearl PM2132: Hyperthermic disorders<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Hyperthermic disorders</td>\n<td>Mechanisms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heat edema</td>\n<td>Cutaneous vasodilation and pooling of interstitial fluid leads to swelling of hands, feet, and ankles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heat syncope</td>\n<td>Vasodilation and volume depletion(from sweating) following exercise or prolonged standing with consequent systemic and cerebral hypotension</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heat cramps</td>\n<td>Deficiency of sodium, potassium, and water at an intracellular level, leading to intermittent, painful, and involuntary spasmodic contractions of skeletal muscles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heat exhaustion</td>\n<td>\n<p>Results from prolonged strenuous activity.

This enhanced sensitivity to steroid hormones could promote the formation of hormone-dependent cancers in the uterus, breast, or prostate, and vitamin B6 levels may play a role in determining the prognosis.<br><br>Other drugs that can lead to a deficiency of vitamin B6 include oral contraceptives, cycloserine, and ethanol.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Vitamin B6 plays an important role in heme biosynthesis, as ALA synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of heme biosynthesis, is PLP-dependent. Thus, B6 deficiency can lead to impaired heme production. This impaired heme production manifests as microcytic hypochromic anemia and not macrocytic anemia.<br><br>Option C: PLP plays a crucial role in methionine and cysteine metabolism. Cystathionine synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine and serine into cystathionine, requires PLP as a cofactor. Hence, B6 deficiency leads to elevated (not reduced) homocysteine levels.<br><br>Option D: Dorsal column demyelination is seen in vitamin B12 deficiency, and not B6 deficiency. Vitamin B6 deficiency leads to neurological conditions such as convulsions (due to reduced synthesis of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter) and peripheral neuritis.",

Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 such as alirocumab and evolocumab, counter this and cause persistence of LDL receptors on hepatocytes. This leads to more LDL uptake from the circulation, bringing down the LDL-cholesterol levels in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.<br><br>PCSK9 inhibitors are indicated only as adjunctive therapy in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who have elevated LDL-cholesterol levels despite being on maximum statin therapy.<br><br>Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused due to mutations that reduce the functioning of LDL receptors, the most common being a mutation in the LDLR gene itself. Physical findings present in some of the patients include tendon xanthomas (especially  Achilles tendons) and corneal arcus. These patients may have a myocardial infarction at a young age. Diagnosis is usually established based on biochemical tests.

Prior exposure to the substance (or to cross-reactive compounds) results in immune priming, so that re-exposure triggers a characteristic photoallergic reaction.<br><br>Common sensitizing agents include chemicals found in cosmetics, fragrances, and sunscreens, such as musk ambrette, bergamot oil, and PABA derivatives.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Phototoxic reaction is a non-immunologic direct photochemical injury that resembles an exaggerated sunburn.

      "solution": "The clinical vignette and the ultrasonograph showing hydronephrosis of the affected kidney indicate a likely diagnosis of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJ) associated with UTI.<br><br>Hydronephrosis may be detected on antenatal ultrasound; it can, however, be transient or mild and resolve on its own. Re-evaluation should be done after birth and in cases presenting with symptoms of recurrent UTI, palpable flank mass or pain, urinary obstruction, and in cases of failure to thrive.<br><br>If the hydronephrosis is persistent, its severity is graded by the extent of the dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system and parenchymal thickness. It needs to be ascertained whether the other kidney is involved, the lower ureter is dilated, the bladder wall is thickened, and whether emptying of the bladder is incomplete. Based on these findings, a diagnosis can be made.<br><br>In cases of hydronephrosis, long-standing urine stasis and pressure may damage the kidneys.<br><br>The causes of UPJ obstruction are<br><br>* Intrinsic (due to an adynamic or stenotic segment of the proximal ureter) or <br><br>* Extrinsic (e.g. compression by accessory renal arteries). This needs to be corrected primarily.<br><br>The renal anatomy and function can be assessed using radioscintigraphy studies. The investigation of choice for UPJ obstruction is 99mTc-MercaptoAcetyl-triGlycine (MAG3) scan. Micturating cystourethrogram is the investigation of choice in vesicoureteric reflux. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is used for assessing renal scarring.<br><br>Treatment of intrinsic UPJ obstruction is done surgically if renal function is compromised or if there is bilateral involvement of the kidneys. In other cases, serial follow-up with ultrasonography is done to assess the spontaneous resolution of hydronephrosis.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Vesicoureteral reflux is the second most common cause of hydronephrosis after UPJ obstruction. In vesicoureteric reflux, the valve that prevents the backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter is defective; hence, abnormal backflow of urine occurs from the bladder into the ureter. It may also present with hydronephrosis; however, the distal ureter is also involved, unlike in this case.<br><br>Option C: Ureterocele is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, thought to result from the persistence of the membrane between the ureteral bud and urogenital sinus. Since the distal urinary tract is normal-looking in this case, this diagnosis is unlikely.<br><br>Option D: Posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in-utero development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. As a result, bilateral hydronephrosis and bladder dilatation is seen, unlike the unilateral involvement in this case.<br><br>Pearl PM2252: Causes of Hydronephrosis<br><br>Unilateral hydronephrosis<br><br>Extramural obstruction<br><br>* Tumor from adjacent structures, e.g., cervix, prostate, rectum, colon, or cecum<br><br>* Retrocaval ureter<br><br>* Aberrant renal vessels<br><br>* Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond’s disease)<br><br>Intramural obstruction<br><br>* Congenital PUJ obstruction - most common congenital cause<br><br>* Congenital stenosis<br><br>* Ureterocele<br><br>* Ureteric stricture - iatrogenic/ inflammatory<br><br>* Neoplasm of the ureter or bladder involving the ureteric orifice<br><br>Intraluminal obstruction<br><br>* Renal stones - most common acquired unilateral cause<br><br>* Sloughed papilla in papillary necrosis (especially, in patients with diabetes, analgesic abuse, or sickle cell disease)<br><br>Bilateral hydronephrosis<br><br>Congenital<br><br>* Posterior urethral valves (associated with pulmonary hypoplasia)<br><br>* Urethral atresia<br><br>* PUJ obstruction<br><br>Acquired     <br><br>* Benign prostatic hypertrophy or carcinoma of the prostate<br><br>* Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond's disease)<br><br>* Postoperative bladder neck scarring<br><br>* Urethral stricture<br><br>* Phimosis",

It occurs mostly due to obstetric injuries such as prolonged labor, and instrumental or manipulative deliveries. Patients present with true incontinence characterised by constant dribbling of urine.<br><br>Small fistulas due to difficult childbirth can heal spontaneously. In the case of an established fistula, it is better to wait for about 3 months for all tissue inflammation to subside, before surgery is undertaken. Most vesicovaginal fistulas are repaired per vaginally. The various surgeries done for the repair of VVF are as follows:<br><br>* Latzko procedure: It is done by denudation of vaginal epithelium around fistulous edges and approximation of raw surface with absorbable sutures. This technique is suited for a post-hysterectomy fistula that is caused by cancer cervix (Option A). It can lead to narrowing of the vagina or vaginal atresia. Fistula located at the vaginal vault, post hysterectomy is the most difficult to treat; this technique is suited for such cases.<br><br>* Chassar-Moir technique: Here, the vagina and bladder are separated and sutured into two layers, taking care to avoid tension and overlapping suture lines. <br><br>* Ureteric implantation into the sigmoid colon in case previous surgeries fail.<br><br>Post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days (Option C) along with antibiotics is recommended. Vaginal or speculum examination and intercourse are not advised for 3 months after surgery (Option D). Avoiding pregnancy for a year is also recommended.

In this test, the affected knee is flexed at a 20-degree angle, and the patient places the foot flat on the ground. The examiner provides support, and the patient bears their full weight on that leg. They are then instructed to twist their body to one side and then the other, repeating this movement three times, while maintaining the knee flexed at 20 degrees.

Following paracentesis, the patient should be asked to lie in the supine position for a few hours. <br><br>Paracentesis, which refers to the removal of ascitic fluid, is valuable for evaluating patients with new-onset ascites or ascites of unknown etiology. It is also indicated in patients who have a decompensation in their clinical status. Relative contraindications include bleeding diathesis, prior abdominal surgery, distended bowels, or loculated ascites. Any severe bleeding diathesis should be corrected before the procedure. Bowel distention should be relieved by placement of an NG tube, and the bladder should also be emptied before beginning the procedure.<br><br>During the procedure, the patient should be instructed to lie supine with the head end of the bed elevated. This position should be maintained for around 15 minutes so that the fluid accumulates in the dependent portion of the abdomen. The preferred entry sites for paracentesis include right or left lower quadrants of the abdomen or even a midline puncture halfway between pubic symphysis and umbilicus. To prevent leaking of the ascitic fluid, Z-tracking of the needle is helpful. The needle is advanced slowly while performing continuous aspiration. Fluid should flow freely into the syringe soon after that. For large volume paracentesis, direct drainage into large vacuum containers is commonly utilized. <br><br>Peritoneal fluid is sent for total and differential cell count, Gram stain and bacterial cultures. Patient should be monitored following the procedure and should be asked to lie supine for a few hours. If persistent fluid leakage occurs, continued bedrest and pressure dressings are useful. For patients with decompensated liver disease undergoing large-volume paracentesis, the sudden reduction in intravascular volume can precipitate hepatorenal syndrome.

technique for the detection of specific genetic information on a morphologically intact tissue using fluorescent probes.<br><br>The fluorescent probes are added to cells usually arrested in the metaphase stage of cell division (when every chromosome is separately).<br><br>Types of FISH:<br><br>1) Chromosomal painting: Each chromosome is identified by using a different colour of the fluorescent probe, however, each chromosome does not have a unique colour. Since the fluorescent dyes are limited.<br><br>2) Multicolour FISH: 23 distinct fluorescent colours made by mixing 5 fluorophores. Thus each chromosome is identified by a unique colour. It is also known as spectral karyotyping (SKY). It offers various advantages such as<br><br>* Detects structural and numeric abnormalities in chromosomes.<br><br>* Detects gene amplification and subtle microdeletions<br><br>* Maps a newly isolated gene to its correct chromosomal loci<br><br>However, this process requires prior knowledge of the genes and chromosomes.<br><br>3) Interphase FISH: It is a rapid procedure of FISH, wherein growing cells are not needed. It is used in prenatal diagnosis and in tumour diagnosis. <br><br>The image shown is of a Multicolor FISH also known as Spectral karyotyping with a unique colour to each chromosome pair.",

This fused gene codes for a chimeric protein (PML-Rar-alpha) that blocks promyelocyte differentiation.<br><br>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of APL. Symptoms can range from minimal bleeding to significant hemorrhage (gastrointestinal, intrapulmonary, intracranial). This is thought to be secondary to the Auer rods and primary granules present in promyelocytes. They activate the coagulation cascade and cause consumptive coagulopathy responsible for the bleeding manifestations. <br><br>All-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin, ATRA) increases the concentrations of the Rar-alpha which in turn relieves this block and facilitates further differentiation. <br><br>The mainstay of treatment includes induction (cytarabine + anthracycline) and post-remission chemotherapy.<br><br>Pearl PM1187: FAB classification<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FAB classification</strong></td>\n<td><strong>High-Yield points</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>M0-minimal differentiation</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>M1-without maturation</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>M2 - with maturation</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Most common</li>\n<li>t(8,21)</li>\n<li>Chloromas</li>\n<li>Good prognosis</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>M3 - promyelocytic</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Young-good prognosis</li>\n<li>t(15,17)-intermediate</li>\n<li>Auer rods</li>\n<li>DIC</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>M4 - myelomonocytic</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>inv 16</li>\n<li>t(16,16)</li>\n<li>Eosinophilia</li>\n<li>Gingival hyperplasia</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>M5a - monoblastic</p>\n<p>M5b - monocytic</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Organ infiltration</li>\n<li>Gingival hyperplasia</li>\n<li>Increased WBC count, fever</li>\n<li>Sweet syndrome</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>M6 - erythroid</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Therapy related</li>\n<li>Erythemic myelosis, Di Guglielmo disease</li>\n<li>Poor prognosis</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>M7 - megakaryocytic</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>CD 41/61</li>\n<li>Bad prognosis</li>\n<li>Down syndrome (good prognosis)</li>\n<li>Bone marrow fibrosis (increased PDGF)</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Patients may present with shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (shortness of breath after lying down for 30 minutes or longer), pedal edema, weight gain, early satiety, raised pulsatile jugular venous pressure (JVP), and hepatic congestion with tender hepatomegaly, reflecting systemic effects of impaired cardiac function.<br><br>Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a periodic breathing pattern characterized by alternating phases of hyperventilation with gradually waxing and waning tidal volumes, separated by equal periods of apnea. It occurs during sleep and in patients with severe heart disease or brain injury.<br><br>In Cheyne-Stokes respiration, the depth of breathing varies according to the CO2 level at the respiratory center, with the maximum depth of respiration occurring when CO2 is highest. Cheyne-Stokes respiration occurs due to two main mechanisms:<br><br>* Prolonged lung-to-brain circulation time - This is usually seen in heart failure. Changes in CO2 levels in the blood take longer to reach the brain’s respiratory center. By the time the low CO2 is sensed, the body has already hyperventilated, leading to apnea. This delayed feedback creates the characteristic waxing and waning pattern of Cheyne-Stokes respiration.<br><br>* Increased sensitivity of the brain to CO2 - This is mainly due to disruption of neural pathways. Even small rises in CO2 trigger excessive hyperventilation, which lowers CO2 too much and causes temporary apnea. When CO2 rises again, the cycle repeats, producing a rhythmic pattern of breathing.<br><br>Causes of Cheyne-Stokes respiration: <br><br>* Premature infants <br><br>* Unacclimatized persons at high altitude <br><br>* Deep sleep in certain individuals<br><br>* Congestive cardiac failure <br><br>* Uremia <br><br>* Brain diseases like uncal herniation <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Graph 1 shows a normal breathing pattern.

The causative drug for floppy iris syndrome is tamsulosin.<br><br>Tamsulosin is an α1 receptor antagonist with receptor selectivity at α1A and α1D receptors. This selectivity causes blockade of the α1A receptor in the prostate. It is used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It has very little effect on blood pressure due to its selective effect on α1A and α1D and hence is not used in the treatment of hypertension.<br><br>Some of the adverse effects of tamsulosin include orthostatic hypotension, abnormal ejaculation, and floppy iris syndrome, characterised by the intraoperative finding of floppy iris, the propensity of iris prolapse, and progressive pupillary constriction.<br><br>Examples of other drugs causing floppy iris syndrome include finasteride, benzodiazepines, donepezil, and duloxetine. Some α1 receptor antagonists, like alfuzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin, are associated with floppy iris syndrome but have a very low risk compared to tamsulosin.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Prazosin is an α1 receptor antagonist with equal potency to all the subtypes of α1 receptor. It is used in the treatment of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH). Prazosin causes orthostatic hypotension after its initial dose.<br><br>Option C: Silodosin is an α1 receptor antagonist with more selectivity over the α1 subtype. It is approved in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia with lesser effects on blood pressure. The main adverse effect is retrograde ejaculation. Dizziness and orthostatic hypotension can also be seen.<br><br>Option D: Dutasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. It is approved for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The affected area appears swollen and, if untreated, may develop ulceration or gangrene. Pain is usually localized to the stump rather than the amputated limb.<br><br>Option B: Residual limb pain is pain at the existing amputation stump, often due to nerve entrapment, neuroma formation, ischemia, surgical trauma, infection, or poorly fitting prosthesis. It usually occurs in the early post-amputation period and often improves as the wound heals.<br><br>Option D: Stump neuroma is a nodular mass of regenerating nerve tissue at the site of a transected peripheral nerve that is formed due to the unorganized growth of nerve fibers.

Among the given options, the drug most likely responsible is metronidazole, used for anaerobic bacterial infections, which acts via the formation of free radicals.<br><br>Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole that leads to the formation of reactive compounds that interact with DNA, possibly disrupting its structure and inhibiting replication. Metronidazole enters microbial cells by diffusion, and in anaerobic microbes, its nitro group is reduced to a highly reactive nitro radical. This radical disrupts the organism’s DNA and acts as an electron sink, interfering with the pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme pathway that generates energy in anaerobes lacking mitochondria. <br><br>Metronidazole is highly effective against anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus) and certain parasites. Its clinical uses include:<br><br>* C. difficile colitis<br><br>* Empiric coverage of anaerobes in intra-abdominal and skin/soft-tissue infections<br><br>* H. pylori gastritis (combined with other drugs)<br><br>* Bacterial vaginosis<br><br>A disulfiram like reaction occurs when a drug inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase, similar to disulfiram. When alcohol is combined with these drugs, acetaldehyde accumulates in the body and causes unpleasant symptoms like flushing, sweating, tachycardia, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache.<br><br>Other drugs that can cause disulfiram like reactions:<br><br>* Tinidazole<br><br>* Some Cephalosporins, like Cefoperazone<br><br>* 1st generation Sulfonylureas like Tolbutamide<br><br>* Procarbazine<br><br>* Griseofulvin<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone and acts by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase. DNA gyrase is particularly important in gram-negative bacteria, where it introduces negative supercoils into the DNA to relieve torsional strain. Ciprofloxacin binds to and inhibits this enzyme, preventing the proper replication of bacterial DNA. Additionally, topoisomerase IV is the target of gram-positive bacteria, and its inhibition by ciprofloxacin prevents chromosome segregation during cell division.  However, it is not associated with disulfiram-like reactions. It can cause tendon ruptures, joint pain, gastrointestinal upset, and neurological side effects.<br><br>The following image shows the mechanism of action of various antibiotics:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/df5cfcb258a84ef0bf2a6474cc1edd29x1280x1258.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "The likely cause of amenorrhea in this patient is primary hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. <br><br>Primary amenorrhea refers to the failure of the onset of menstruation, beyond the age of 16 years, regardless of the development of secondary sexual characteristics. This patient's clinical picture of amenorrhea, short stature, webbed neck, low posterior hairline, widely spaced nipples, and lack of secondary sexual characteristics is seen in Turner's syndrome. Turner's syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality with partial or complete monosomy of the X chromosome (45+XO).<br><br>In Turner's syndrome, gonadal dysgenesis causes primary ovarian failure, that is hypogonadism. The levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) are indicative of the cause of hypogonadism. Increased levels of FSH and LH, as seen in this patient, are indicative of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is defined as 1) a decrease or absence in ovarian function and 2) due to absent negative sex-steroid feedback. <br><br>The pathophysiology in Turner's syndrome is primary hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, where there is oocyte atresia and the replacement of ovaries by fibrous streaks. This causes a decrease in serum estrogen levels which, by negative feedback, causes a rise in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), FSH, and LH (gonadotropic hormones) as seen in this patient. Hypogonadism with a rise in gonadotropic hormones is known as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Secondary hypergonadotropic hypogonadism patients also present with primary ovarian failure with increased levels of FSH and LH. Secondary hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is seen in damage to the gonads, as seen post-chemotherapy, radiation, infection, or in autoimmune disorders. This patient has no history suggestive of a secondary cause.<br><br>Option C: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism results when there is a primary abnormality in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Loss of hypothalamic function causes a decrease in the production of GnRH, or pituitary dysfunction causes decreased production of FSH and LH, which results in decreased ovarian function and reduced serum estrogen levels. Inherited hypothalamic abnormality, like Kallmann's syndrome, is an example.<br><br>Option D: Functional(acquired) hypothalamic dysfunction is seen with eating disorders, in patients who exercise excessively, and during periods of stress.",
