The correct answer is 1, 2, 3, 4.<br><br>Rh alloimmunization occurs when an Rh-negative mother produces antibodies to Rh antigens due to an Rh-positive fetus. (statement 1)<br><br>Alloimmunization occurs in two stages. First, sensitisation occurs during the first pregnancy, then the immunisation occurs. Sensitisation occurs during situations of fetomaternal bleeds.<br><br>Examples of these situations include miscarriage, amniocentesis (statement 3), embryoreduction, ectopic pregnancy, hydatidiform mole, cordocentesis, placenta previa with bleeding, abruption of the placenta (statement 4), intrauterine fetal demise, external cephalic version, abdominal trauma (statement 2), and delivery of an Rh-positive infant to an Rh-negative mother. It can also occur during the third stage of labour, manual removal of the placenta, and after a cesarean section. <br><br>Rh immunisation can be prevented if the mother is unimmunized. Here, she is given Rh anti-D immunoglobulin (IgG) intramuscularly after childbirth. This blocks the Rh-antigen of the fetal cells, removing the intact, antibody-coated fetal red cells from circulation by the spleen or lymph nodes, and inhibits the production of IgG from the B cells. <br><br>It should ideally be administered within 72 hours or preferably earlier after delivery or abortion. The dose can be calculated using the Kleihauer-Betke test. <br><br>The antibodies formed as a result of immunisation are IgM and IgG. However, only IgG antibodies are small enough to cross the placenta and cause hemolytic disease in the fetus. The three manifestations of the hemolytic disease include hydrops fetalis, icterus gravis neonatorum, and congenital anaemia of the newborn. <br><br>Hydrops fetalis is the most severe form of Rh hemolytic disease in the fetus. There is widespread erythrocyte destruction leading to anaemia, anoxemia, and metabolic acidosis. This leads to hepatic injury, causing hypoproteinemia and subsequently generalised oedema, ascites, and hydrothorax. <br><br>The following image shows a stillborn baby with hydrops fetalis.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/22e108043f584df3a10baaa9dc713f15x241x415.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

However, the PCO2 here is only 35 mmHg, and hence there is no respiratory compensation.<br><br>Step 3: Since CO2 is 35, which is below the compensatory values, it suggests that there is a simultaneous respiratory alkalosis.<br><br>Thus, the ABG above shows a mixed disorder of metabolic alkalosis with simultaneous respiratory alkalosis.<br><br>Pearl PM1343: Interpretation of Acid-Base Disorders<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>pH&lt;7.35 is acidosis</p>\n<p>pH&gt;7.45 is alkalosis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A primary change in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is termed metabolic</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>If the change in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is in keeping with the pH (i.e. if there are acidosis and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is decreased) the problem is metabolic.</p>\n<p>If the change in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is opposite with the pH (i.e. if there is acidosis and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is increased or normal) the problem is compensatory metabolic.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A primary change in CO<sub>2 </sub>is termed as respiratory</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>If the change in CO<sub>2 </sub>keeping in line with the pH (if in acidosis CO2 is raised) the problem is termed respiratory</p>\n<p>If the change in CO<sub>2</sub> is in the opposite direction of that of the pH (i.e. if there are acidosis and CO<sub>2</sub> is decreased or normal ) the problem is termed compensatory respiratory</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Pearl PM1341: Causes of Acid-Base Disorders<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Metabolic acidosis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Metabolic alkalosis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Respiratory acidosis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Respiratory alkalosis</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ketoacidosis</p>\n<p>Lactic acidosis</p>\n<p>Chronic renal failure</p>\n<p>Salicylate intoxication</p>\n<p>Methanol/formaldehyde intoxication</p>\n<p>Ethylene glycol intoxication</p>\n<p>Diarrhoea</p>\n<p>Renal tubular acidosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vomiting</p>\n<p>Hyperaldosteronism</p>\n<p>Loop or thiazide diuretics</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Opiates, sedatives, anesthesia</p>\n<p>Guillain- Barre syndrome, Polio, ALS, multiple sclerosis</p>\n<p>Airway obstruction</p>\n<p>Adult respiratory distress syndrome, COPD</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Pneumonia, pulmonary embolism</p>\n<p>High altitude</p>\n<p>Psychogenic</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Pearl PM2098: Expected compensation in acid-base disorders<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Primary disorder</td>\n<td>Expected compensation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metabolic acidosis</td>\n<td>\n<p>Expected PaCO<sub>2</sub> = [1 .5 X HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] + 8 ± 2; or</p>\n<p>↓ PaCO2 = 1.25 x ΔHCO3</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metabolic alkalosis</td>\n<td>Increase in PaCO<sub>2 </sub>= 0.75 x ΔHCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p>Respiratory acidosis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Acute</td>\n<td>\n<p>Increase in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>= 0.1 x Δ PaCO<sub>2</sub></p>\n<p>↓ pH = 0.008 x ΔPaCO2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chronic</td>\n<td>\n<p>Increase in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>= 0.4 x Δ PaCO<sub>2</sub></p>\n<p>↓ pH = 0.003 x ΔPaCO2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p>Respiratory alkalosis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Acute</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decrease in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>= 0.2 x Δ PaCO<sub>2</sub></p>\n<p>↑ pH = 0.008 x ΔPaCO2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Chronic</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decrease in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>= 0.4 x Δ PaCO<sub>2</sub></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

The mainstay of surgical management is to bypass the obstructed duodenum.<br><br>It is most commonly seen in young, asthenic individuals (women more than men) and in patients with anorexia nervosa. Predisposing factors include rapid weight loss, prolonged supine immobilization, scoliosis, and application of body casts.<br><br>The clinical features are those of proximal intestinal obstruction, presenting with profuse vomiting, persistent nausea, postprandial epigastric pain, and abdominal distension. The diagnosis is usually made with a barium upper GI study or hypotonic duodenography, which demonstrates abrupt cessation of contrast flow from the duodenum to the jejunum.<br><br>Initial management is conservative with nutritional rehabilitation and postural changes; however, if this fails, surgery is required. <br><br>The definitive operative procedures aim to bypass the obstruction:<br><br>* Duodenojejunostomy (Procedure of choice): Directly bypasses the compressed third part of the duodenum by creating an anastomosis between the duodenum (usually the second part) and the jejunum. It is most physiological as it preserves the gastric emptying pathway. (Option A).<br><br>* Gastrojejunostomy: Creates a bypass from the stomach to the jejunum. It is simpler than duodenojejunostomy. (Option B)<br><br>* Strong’s Procedure (Duodenal derotation): Division of the ligament of Treitz to mobilize and shift the duodenum downward and to the right, relieving vascular compression. It avoids the creation of a bypass anastomosis.

It is typically performed for peptic ulcer disease. Since the obstruction in SMA syndrome lies distal to the anastomosis (in the third part of the duodenum), Billroth I does not relieve the compression and hence has no role in treatment.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d196bee3bf8d4bb0b1755753e5bacc3dx1020x1063.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

The centre for this reflex is the pretectal nucleus.<br><br>The pupillary light reflex pathway involves several components, with the pretectal nucleus in the midbrain serving as the central integrative centre for the reflex. When light is shone into one eye, it causes bilateral constriction of the pupils, a response known as the pupillary light reflex. This reflex has two components:<br><br>1) Direct light reflex: constriction of the pupil in the eye being illuminated.\n2) Consensual light reflex: constriction of the pupil in the opposite eye.<br><br>Light is detected by retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones), and signals travel via the optic nerve (CN II) to the optic chiasma, where nasal fibres cross. These continue in the optic tract to the pretectal nucleus in the midbrain. Temporal fibres remain uncrossed and also reach the pretectal nucleus. The pretectal nucleus, which mediates the pupillary light reflex, sends bilateral signals to the motor nuclei.<br><br>From each pretectal nucleus, fibres are sent to both Edinger-Westphal nuclei (bilaterally). This bilateral connection ensures that shining light in one eye causes both pupils to constrict (direct and consensual response).<br><br>The Edinger-Westphal nucleus (part of the oculomotor nuclear complex) sends preganglionic parasympathetic fibres via the oculomotor nerve (CN III).

The cell of origin of hairy cell leukemia is the memory B cell. <br><br>The markers expressed in hairy cell leukemia include the usual B-cell markers- CD-19 and 20, and specific markers such as CD 11c, CD 25, CD103, and annexin A1.<br><br>Hairy cell leukemia is a distinctive B cell neoplasm, that predominantly affects middle-aged males. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is the cytochemical stain characteristically shown by leukemic hairy cells. These cells are called so because of the fine hair-like projections on their surface as shown below.<br><br>On peripheral blood smear, hairy cells have round or reniform nuclei and moderate amounts of pale blue cytoplasm with thread or bleb-like extension. In the bone marrow, these cells are usually trapped in a mesh of reticulin fibers and so it is difficult to aspirate and hence termed a dry tap. <br><br>The classic hairy cells can be seen in the slide is shown below:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d601122fe2154bdd8983552e9ee4e286x640x479.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Patients commonly present with massive splenomegaly due to infiltration of the leukemic cells. Pancytopenia due to marrow involvement can also be seen. There can be atypical monocytopenia, due to which these patients experience an increased incidence of atypical mycobacterial infections. These tumors respond well to chemotherapy and BRAF (B-type Raf proto-oncogene) inhibitors, and they have an excellent prognosis.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Options A and D: CD3 and CD5 are markers of T cells.<br><br>Option C: CD20 is found on most mature B cells, including naive and memory types. Naive B cells are linked to some lymphomas, like DLBCL and follicular lymphoma.

Laparoscopic surgeries can be done under general anesthesia or local anesthesia; however, general anesthesia is preferred. Carbon dioxide(CO2) gas is usually used, and the maximum pressure is in the range of 14-15 mm Hg. But N2O is used if the procedure is done under local anesthesia. Insufflation with N2O is stopped at a pressure of 10 mmHg or when 2L of gas is insufflated.<br><br>The direct peritoneal access technique (Hasson technique) is done only occasionally. It is preferred for patients who have undergone previous abdominal surgeries as the small bowel may be adherent to the undersurface of the abdominal wound in such cases.",

Similarly, calcium channel blockers like amlodipine and diltiazem are found to lower the risk of gout.<br><br>Gout is a hyperuricemic metabolic condition, typically manifested by episodic inflammatory arthritis due to crystal formation and deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals within the joints and connective tissue.<br><br>Acute recurrent gout flare is characterized by painful, warm, red, tender, and substantially swollen joints. The metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe is involved in 70–90% of cases (podagra), followed by tarsal joints, ankles, and knees. Triggers of gout flares include purine-rich food, alcohol, diuretic use, local trauma, and medical illnesses such as congestive heart failure and respiratory hypoxic conditions.<br><br>Diagnosis is made by synovial fluid examination, which may show needle-shaped monosodium urate crystals. These crystals show bright, negative birefringence under polarized light. WBC count may be increased in synovial fluid. Serum uric acid level is usually elevated in chronic gout patients, but it may remain normal or low during acute attacks, because of the uricosuric property of inflammatory cytokines.<br><br>Management of acute gout includes the application of ice packs, rest, NSAIDS, colchicine, and glucocorticoids. In patients with chronic hyperuricemia urate-lowering agents like xanthine oxidase inhibitors(eg. allopurinol and febuxostat) or uricosuric drugs (e.g. probenecid) can be used.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Options A and D: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors like captopril are associated with an increased risk of incident gout among patients with hypertension. β-blockers such as propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol, timolol, and alprenolol, also have been shown to increase serum uric acid levels. <br><br>Option B: Hydrochlorothiazides inhibit renal Ca2+ excretion, causing hypercalcemia and may precipitate gout.

This can be seen in cases of antrectomy.<br><br>Option B: Destruction of chief cells leads to reduced pepsinogen secretion, impairing protein digestion, but it does not explain the neurological findings.<br><br>Option D: Destruction of parietal cells can lead to absent acid secretion, also known as achlorhydria. Acidic pH is very important for the activation of pepsinogen to pepsin, which is important for protein digestion. So achlorhydria is mainly responsible for protein malabsorption and not vitamin B12 malabsorption.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/655ba7ce1cf54bb080fdb942f3a7b235x1280x1555.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM1277: Cells of the Gastric Glands<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Cell Type</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Part of stomach</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Secretion</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Stimulus for secretion</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Parietal cells</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fundus, Body</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>HCl</p>\n<p>Intrinsic factor</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Gastrin</p>\n<p>Vagal stimulation (Ach)</p>\n<p>Histamine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Chief cells</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fundus, Body</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Pepsinogen</p>\n<p>Gastric lipase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vagal stimulation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Mucous cells</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Antrum, cardia, pylorus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Mucous</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vagal stimulation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>G cells</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Antrum</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Gastrin</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vagal stimulation (via GRP)</p>\n<p>Oligopeptides</p>\n<p>Inhibited by somatostatin</p>\n<p>Inhibited by H<sup>+</sup> in stomach</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Enterochromaffin like cells (ECL)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fundus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Histamine</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Gastrin</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

The staphyloma is lined internally by uveal tissue and externally by weak cornea or sclera.<br><br>Types of Staphyloma:<br><br>* Posterior staphyloma: Ectasia of the posterior pole of the eye and is lined by the choroid. The ectatic portion is detected by fundoscopy and B-scan ultrasonography. Indirect ophthalmoscopy shows a posterior outward curvature of the globe seen as a crescentic shadow in the macular region. The retinal vessels dip down into the region. The staphylomatous area appears pale due to degeneration of the retina, pigment epithelium, and occasionally the choroid. The most common cause is degenerative high axial myopia.<br><br>* Anterior staphyloma: It is characterized by ectasia of the pseudo-cornea, which occurs after the total sloughing of the cornea. It is lined internally by the iris and externally by the newly formed epithelium. The most common cause is a perforated sloughing corneal ulcer.<br><br>* Intercalary staphyloma: This is located at the limbus and is lined by the root of the iris and the anterior-most part of the ciliary body. Common causes include:<br><br>* perforating injuries and ulcers of the peripheral cornea<br><br>* anterior scleritis<br><br>* scleromalacia perforans<br><br>* poor wound apposition after complicated cataract surgery<br><br>* secondary glaucoma<br><br>* Ciliary staphyloma: It is characterized by ectasia of weak sclera lined by the ciliary body. This affects the ciliary zone, which includes the region up to 8 mm behind the limbus. Causes include:<br><br>* Developmental glaucoma, end-stage primary or secondary glaucoma<br><br>* Scleritis<br><br>* Ciliary trauma<br><br>* Equatorial staphyloma: This occurs at the equatorial region up to 14 mm behind the limbus of the eye. Causes include:<br><br>* Scleritis<br><br>* Degenerative myopia<br><br>* Chronic uncontrolled glaucoma<br><br>Treatment involves local excision and repair with a corneal and scleral patch graft.

The use of natalizumab in a patient requires checking for antibodies against the JC virus. The presence of these antibodies indicates a latent infection and is a contraindication to the use of natalizumab. Natalizumab can cause JC-virus antibody-positive patients to develop multifocal leukoencephalopathy. <br><br>Note: Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that prevents only α4β7 interaction and is approved for use in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.",

It is characterized by a germline loss-of-function mutation of the VHL gene on chromosome 3p. The VHL gene encodes a protein that is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which attaches ubiquitin chains to protein substrates, promoting their degradation. <br><br>Under normal oxygen conditions (normoxia), VHL binds to hydroxylated HIF-1α and targets it for proteasomal degradation.<br><br>When the VHL gene is mutated, this degradation pathway is lost, leading to stabilization and accumulation of HIF-1α even in the presence of normal oxygen.

      "solution": "The clinical presentation is consistent with Guyon canal syndrome, and the implicated nerve is the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve divides into its terminal branches at the level of the hook of the hamate, into a deep motor and superficial sensory branch. <br><br>Guyon canal syndrome/handlebar palsy is caused by entrapment of the ulnar nerve as it courses through the Guyon canal in the wrist and is commonly seen in regular cyclists. This occurs due to prolonged pressure on the nerve against the bicycle handlebars. <br><br>Guyon’s canal is located on the anteromedial side of the flexor aspect of the wrist. Guyon's canal is a 4 cm long canal formed by the splitting of the flexor retinaculum along the anteromedial side of the wrist. The Guyon canal is clinically significant because it contains the ulnar nerve and artery & is the site of compression injury.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f6bae705d9374c2ea4a67ccbabab8bf0x1280x2558.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>At the hook of hamate, the ulnar nerve divides into:<br><br>* Superficial branch → sensory (palmaris brevis and skin of medial 1½ fingers).<br><br>* Deep branch → motor (hypothenar muscles, medial 2 lumbricals, interossei, adductor pollicis).<br><br>Depending on the site of compression, Guyon’s canal syndrome produces both sensory and motor symptoms in the hand. Proximal nerve compression affects both sensory and motor modalities. However, if the compression occurs distal to the bifurcation, either the sensory or motor branch will be compromised.<br><br>Clinical features include:<br><br>* Sensory: Tingling, numbness, and burning sensation in the medial 1½ fingers <br><br>* Motor: Weakness of intrinsic hand muscles leads to difficulty with fine motor tasks like holding a pen, buttoning a shirt, and manipulating small objects.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/746c834eeb794bbe91da0da6ae8ef4f6x1280x2371.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: The ulnar nerve passes behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus in the cubital tunnel. At this site, the nerve is superficial and prone to injury, which causes cubital tunnel syndrome.<br><br>Option B: The proximal interosseous membrane is the site where the median nerve gives off the anterior interosseous nerve (supplying flexor pollicis longus, pronator quadratus, and part of flexor digitorum profundus).<br><br>Option C: Styloid process refers to the bony prominence at the distal radius near the wrist joint.

The T-cell zones of lymphoid organs, i.e., paracortical areas of the lymph nodes and the periarteriolar sheaths of the spleen, are depleted. Ig levels may be normal or reduced, depending on the severity of the T-cell deficiency. T cell function is evaluated to guide further management, like vaccination recommendations and the requirement for any antibiotic prophylaxis. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: X Ray of the chest can be used to look for the absence of the thymus, but it is a very nonspecific sign and is present in only 15% of cases.<br><br>Option B: Serum phenylalanine levels can be measured to rule out Phenylketonuria(PKU). Phenylketonuria (PKU) results from a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. It manifests as a progressive intellectual disability. Patients with PKU have a musty or mousy odor due to phenylacetic acid accumulation and a positive dinitrophenylhydrazine test.

      "solution": "In a healthy individual, albumin is usually absent in the urine mainly due to its negative charge. <br><br>The glomerular capillary wall carries a negative charge due to its protein composition, which repels negatively charged molecules such as albumin. As a result of this electrostatic repulsion, albumin, despite having a relatively small effective molecular diameter, is present in the glomerular filtrate in trace amounts. Any trace amount of albumin, if filtered, is reabsorbed completely, leading to its absence in the urine. <br><br>In nephritis, the negative electrical charges in the glomerular wall are lost or reduced, which can cause albumin to leak into the urine without an increase in the size of the pores in the membrane. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Neutral substances smaller than 4 nm are freely filtered through the glomerular filtration barrier, while filtration approaches zero for substances larger than 8 nm. For molecules between 4 and 8 nm in diameter, filtration is inversely proportional to their diameter. Albumin, although a large molecule (~66 kDa), has a relatively smaller effective diameter (~7 nm, i.e., < 8 nm). Therefore, the absence of albumin in urine cannot be explained solely by its effective diameter.<br><br>Option C: Trace amounts of albumin are reabsorbed completely; however, this is not the primary reason for the absence of albumin from urine.<br><br>Option D: The slit pores allow neutral substances of size less than 4 nm to freely pass through the glomerular filtration barrier, and hence, narrow slit pores are not responsible for the absence of albumin from the urine.",

E.g., when a patient presents for a gynaecological complaint, screening for STIs or cervical cancer can be conducted. <br><br>Option D: Multiphase screening is a type of screening that involves multiple tests or stages, typically used to rule out or confirm a diagnosis. It may involve an initial test followed by a more specific or confirmatory test if the first one indicates a potential issue.",

Humans are the definitive host (option B). They get infected by the larvae that come out once the cyclops are killed in the stomach and penetrate the wall of the duodenum. <br><br>They reach the retroperitoneal and subcutaneous connective tissues and develop into adults (option D). The fertilised female worm grows and migrates within the subcutaneous connective tissues. It reaches a site where it is likely to come into contact with water, like the leg (most common). Here, the gravid female worm secretes a toxin that causes blister formation. The blister ruptures, discharging a milky white fluid containing numerous L1-stage larvae.<br><br>The larvae survive for about a week in water. They are swallowed by the intermediate host, freshwater cyclops. The larvae penetrate the gut wall of the cyclops and develop into the infective third-stage larvae. The lifecycle continues when humans drink water containing infective cyclops.<br><br>The following image shows the life cycle of the guinea worm:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8f836e71755b403e99d8d02d16805bb5x593x435.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM1731: Arthropod- borne diseases<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Arthropod</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Disease transmitted</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anopheles mosquito</td>\n<td>Malaria, Filariasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Culex mosquito</td>\n<td>Bancroftian filariasis, Japenese encephalitis, West nile fever, Viral arthritis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aedes mosquito</td>\n<td>Yellow fever, Dengue, Chikungunya, filariasis, zika</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mansoni Mosquito</td>\n<td>Filariasis, Chikungunya</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Housefly</td>\n<td>Typhoid and paratyphoid fever, diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, gastroenteritis, amoebiasis, helminthic infestations, poliomyelitis, conjunctivitis, trachoma, anthrax, yaws, etc.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sandfly (Phlebotomus)</td>\n<td>Kala-azar(Visceral Leishmaniasis), oriental sore, Oroya fever, Sandfly fever</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tsetse fly</td>\n<td>Sleeping sickness(African Trypanosomiasis)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Louse</td>\n<td>Epidemic typhus, relapsing fever, trench fever, pediculosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rat flea</td>\n<td>Bubonic plague, endemic typhus(Murine Typhus), hymenolepis diminuta</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black fly(Simulium)</td>\n<td>Onchocerciasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reduviid bug(Kissing bug/triatominae)</td>\n<td>Chagas disease(American Trypanosomiasis)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hard tick (Ixodes species)</td>\n<td>Tick typhus, viral encephalitis, viral fevers, viral hemorrhagic fever,(e.g. Kyasanur forest disease), tularemia, tick paralysis, human babesiosis, lyme disease</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Soft Tick (Argas species)</td>\n<td>Q fever, relapsing fever, Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) (can be casued by hard tick as well)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trombiculid mite</td>\n<td>Scrub typhus, Rickettsial pox</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Itch mites</td>\n<td>Scabies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cyclops</td>\n<td>Guinea-worm disease, fish tapeworm (D. latum)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cockroaches</td>\n<td>Enteric pathogens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sand flea (Tunga penetrance, Jiggar, Chigoe flea)</td>\n<td> Tungiasis, Ulcer in the feetnails</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Pearl PM0659: Commonly known names of some important parasites<br><br>a.
