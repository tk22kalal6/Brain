      "solution": "The clinical vignette describes a case of acute and fulminant meningitis. The presence of motile trophozoites on saline microscopy with a history of exposure to water from overhead rainwater harvesting tanks suggests an infection by Naegleria fowleri.<br><br>Naegleria fowleri is also known as the brain-eating amoeba. It occurs in 3 forms: cyst, amoeboid trophozoite and flagellate trophozoite forms. The amoeboid form is the feeding, growing, and replicating form of the parasite, and is seen on the surface of vegetation, mud, and water. The flagellate form occurs when trophozoites are transferred to distilled water. Cysts are seen in unfavourable environmental conditions such as nutritional deprivation and desiccation.<br><br>The infection usually follows swimming in warm freshwater rivers or ponds, or poorly maintained swimming pools or nasal irrigation with contaminated tap water. The amoebae invade the nasal mucosa and pass through the olfactory nerve branches in the cribriform plate into the meninges. The incubation period is 2 days-2 weeks.<br><br>It causes an acute suppurative fulminant infection of the CNS known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, ataxia, seizure and coma. The disease is rapidly progressive and has a mortality rate of 98%.<br><br>CSF is the specimen of choice and should be examined immediately and not refrigerated. CSF is thick and purulent, with pus cells >20,000/μL, elevated protein, and reduced sugar levels (mimics bacterial meningitis). CSF microscopy shows motile amoeboid trophozoites on wet mount.  Brain biopsy demonstrates trophozoites having sky blue cytoplasm with a pink nucleus. CSF samples can be cultivated on non-nutrient agar cultured with bacterial supplements like E. coli.<br><br>Naegleria characteristically feeds on bacteria and crawls over the lawn culture to produce the ‘trail sign’.  Although most cases lead to a poor outcome, some sources have reported successful treatment with intravenous amphotericin B. <br><br>The image given below shows various forms of Naegleria fowleri:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c73cd252415545b599c4382682a1548cx710x285.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>The image given below shows the life cycle of Naegleria fowleri:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/88cbd5381d334600b987dbef8955d42dx965x1257.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Toxoplasma gondii is transmitted through contaminated meat, feco-oral transmission through house pets like cats, or the birth canal. Infection leading to encephalitis usually occurs in immunocompromised hosts, where the clinical manifestations in immunocompetent hosts are self-limited.<br><br>Option C: Acanthamoeba causes granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), which is more insidious in onset and has a longer incubation period. Acanthameoba is non-motile. It is also known to cause Acanthamoeba keratitis in users of contact lenses. It exists as an active trophozoite form and a resistant cystic form. The trophozoite is large, 20- 50 µmin size and characterised by spine-like pseudopodia (acanthopodia). It differs from Naegleria in not having a flagellate stage and in forming cysts in tissues that are polygonal and double-walled. <br><br>Option D: Balamuthia is a leptomixid free-living amoeba. It causes GAE in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals. It only has the ameboid trophozoite stage; the flagellate stage is absent. Infection is acquired via the respiratory tract, skin lesions, or eyes. The life cycle resembles that of Acanthamoeba.

It binds irreversibly to the presynaptic membrane of the NMJ and travels to the motor neuron cell body in the spinal cord via retrograde axonal transport (200mm/day). It is then picked up by the terminals of the presynaptic inhibitory interneurons, wherein it attaches to the gangliosides and blocks the release of glycine and GABA. This further enhances the activity of the motor neurons. Symptoms of tetanus include trismus (lock jaw), dysphagia, and excessive drooling of saliva. <br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option A and B & D.

In other words, when an alternative hypothesis is accepted even when it is false and the null hypothesis is true, it is a type I error or false positive error.<br><br>* It is also called an alpha (α) error as it is related to the criterion α.<br><br>* The lower the α level, the lower the rate of a type I error being made.<br><br>* Thus, it can be said that α is the maximum tolerable probability that a type I error is being made and that the p value is the probability that a significant difference is declared when there is none.<br><br>Type II Error<br><br>* The error that is made by rejecting an alternative hypothesis when it is true or failing to reject a null hypothesis when it is false is called a type II error.<br><br>* It is also called a false negative error and more commonly, as a beta (β) error.<br><br>* If the null hypothesis is false, then the probability of a type II error is β.<br><br>* The power of a statistical test is indicated by 1–β.<br><br>Power of a Test<br><br>* The power of a test is the ability of a statistical test to avoid a type II error, which depends on its ability to detect a false null hypothesis.<br><br>* It is equal to 1–β, which is the probability that a false null hypothesis will be rejected.<br><br>* By convention, a test is required to have a power of 0.8 (or a β of 0.2) to be acceptable. This is to say that a study that has less than 80% chance of detecting a false null hypothesis is unacceptable.<br><br>* Type I errors are easily reduced by reducing the criterion α.<br><br>* A test's power will increase in the following conditions:<br><br>* If α increases, but this will increase the chance of a type I error.<br><br>* If the difference between the sample mean and hypothesized mean increases.

Further, gp120 binds to CCR5 chemokine receptors to stabilize the entire complex. Gp41 then mediates the fusion of the viral membrane with the cell membrane of the target cell. Maraviroc is an entry inhibitor that is used for the treatment of HIV. Maraviroc binds to CCR5 receptors and prevents viral entry into the cell. <br><br>Enfuvirtide (option A) is another entry inhibitor that binds to certain domains of gp41 HIV protein and prevents membrane fusion and viral entry into the cell. It is the only antiretroviral drug that is given parenterally (subcutaneous or intravenous). <br><br>Lopinavir (option C) is a protease inhibitor. This class of drugs inhibits the viral protease that is essential for conversion of the inactive protein precursors into functional proteins.<br><br>Raltegravir (option D) is an integrase inhibitor.

In children, ITP often follows an infection and tends to resolve on its own. In adults, it typically presents as a chronic condition, although some may achieve spontaneous remission.<br><br>ITP can be primary or secondary, with common secondary causes including autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, infections such as HIV and hepatitis C, and possibly Helicobacter pylori infection.<br><br>ITP is characterised by low platelet counts and mucocutaneous bleeding, including petechiae, bruising, bleeding from the gums, gastrointestinal tract, or heavy menstrual bleeding. In some cases, serious bleeding such as intracranial haemorrhage may occur. Lab test reveals thrombocytopenia. A peripheral blood smear may show normal-large platelets, but other blood cells are normal. Bone marrow biopsy is reserved for cases with atypical features or a lack of response to initial treatment.<br><br>Evaluation should include testing for underlying causes, including HIV, hepatitis C, SLE, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. In patients with anemia, a direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test should be done to rule out Evans syndrome.<br><br>Patients with platelet counts above 30,000/μL and no significant bleeding generally do not require therapy. When treatment is indicated, such as in cases with platelet counts below 5000/μL or active bleeding, first-line options include corticosteroids like prednisone or dexamethasone and IVIgG. IVIG is especially effective in patients who have had a splenectomy, though it can cause side effects such as aseptic meningitis and kidney injury.<br><br>Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting B-cells, can be used in refractory cases. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists, including romiplostim, eltrombopag, and avatrombopag, stimulate platelet production and are effective in chronic ITP. These are now preferred over broad immunosuppressants or splenectomy due to better safety and quality of life outcomes. If splenectomy is planned, patients should receive vaccines against encapsulated organisms such as pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae. <br><br>Platelet transfusions in treating ITP are not effective, as both autologous and allogeneic platelets have reduced survival in this condition, limiting their clinical benefit.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c976674e31944b4782011e2d7a183d89x1280x2560.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM1313: Idiopathic/Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)<br><br>It is characterized by<br><br>* Isolated thrombocytopenia—the presence of antibody against platelet membrane glycoprotein and subsequent destruction in reticuloendothelial system<br><br>* Normal bone marrow—normal or even increased number of megakaryocytes<br><br>* Absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. <br><br>Types:<br><br>Acute (<6 months) and chronic (>6 months) idiopathic/immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Acute ITP</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Chronic ITP</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Peak incidence</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2<strong>–</strong>6 years</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>20<strong>–</strong>40 years</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Sex predilection</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>None</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>female: male ratio of 3:1 </strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Antecedent infection</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Common 1 to </strong><strong>3 weeks before</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Unusual</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Onset of bleeding</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Abrupt</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Insidious</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Platelet count</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&lt;20000/microlitre</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>30<strong>–</strong>80000/microlitre</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Eosinophilia/lymphocytosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Common</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rare</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Duration</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2<strong>–</strong>6 weeks</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Months or years</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Spontaneous remission</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>80% of cases</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Uncommon</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

It is characterized by-<br><br>* Fever<br><br>* Anterior uveitis- Presents as diffuse congestion of the conjunctival vessels with a prominent circumcorneal injection, pain, and blurred vision<br><br>* Parotid gland enlargement- Due to a granulomatous inflammatory reaction. Cervical lymphadenopathy may also be present. <br><br>* Facial nerve palsy- May show epineural granulomas and perineural inflammation involving the facial nerve. <br><br>The bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement further alludes to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas. Patients with sarcoidosis typically present with cough, dyspnea, chest pain, fever, weight loss, arthralgias, and erythema nodosum. Few patients may have neurological involvement with facial nerve palsy being the most common manifestation. <br><br>Diagnosis may be established based on clinical features and biopsy findings.

      "solution": "The primary goal of behavioural therapy in autism is to teach self-care and communication skills through structured learning and reinforcement.<br><br>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by the two core features: deficits in social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities. Another feature is language impairment, which occurs early in the developmental period but is not a core feature. Autism is more commonly seen in boys, and symptoms usually start before 3 years of age. <br><br>These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder can frequently co-occur, so to make a comorbid diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for the general developmental level. However, some autistic children have unusual abilities in some areas (e.g., exceptional memory or calculation skills). These are referred to as savant skills.<br><br>Management involves behavioural therapy, which focuses on building essential life skills through structured classroom environments, minimal changes in routine, and positive reinforcement. These strategies help children learn basic communication (e.g., through speech or sign language), self-care skills, and interpersonal behaviours like eye contact and imitation. Behavioural techniques are also employed to promote social interaction and reduce problem behaviours like hyperactivity or stereotyped actions.<br><br>In addition, psychotherapy—particularly parental counselling and supportive psychotherapy helps in reducing parental guilt and anxiety.<br><br>Pharmacotherapy can be used as an adjunct, especially to manage co-occurring symptoms like hyperactivity, aggression, or epilepsy. Drugs such as risperidone and haloperidol have been used to reduce behavioural disturbances.

      "solution": "The levels of arterial and alveolar CO2 remain relatively constant during exercise is explained by the isocapnic phenomenon. <br><br>Vigorous exercise leads to increased lactic acid production. The buffering of this acid releases more CO2, which in turn boosts ventilation. Despite the heightened acid production, the rise in ventilation and CO2 production remains proportional. This ensures that alveolar and arterial CO2 levels remain relatively stable; this process is known as isocapnic buffering.<br><br>Pulmonary ventilation rises proportionally with exercise intensity. The initial surge in respiratory rate is due to psychological factors and signals from proprioceptors in muscles, tendons, and joints. During exercise, arterial pH, pCO2, and pO2 generally remain stable. Respiration is further stimulated by elevated potassium (K+) levels activating peripheral chemoreceptors, increased body temperature, and heightened neuron sensitivity to CO2.<br><br>At rest, oxygen uptake is around 250 mL/min, but this can escalate to 4000 mL/min during strenuous exercise. The lungs' oxygen diffusion capacity also improves. Initially, the body prioritizes using stored oxygen rather than immediately increasing oxygen intake to fuel working muscles.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Options B and C. The amount of oxygen required after muscle contraction for its oxygen replenishment is known as oxygen debt. The oxygen required for the restoration of phosphocreatine is known as alactacid oxygen debt, while that required for lactic acid removal is known as lactic acid oxygen debt.<br><br>Option D. Phosphocreatine-creatine system combined amounts of cell ATP and cell phosphocreatine provide energy are used during endurance as sources of energy. These substances together can provide maximal muscle power for 8 to 10 seconds.",

      "solution": "The most appropriate treatment for this patient is emergency decompressive laparotomy as the patient appears to be suffering from abdominal compartment syndrome. <br><br>Despite providing adequate fluid resuscitation and first aid, the patient is still in hypotension, with decreased urine output, indicating that the kidneys are not getting enough blood supply. That could be as a result of the circumferential burns seen in the abdomen and lower back, which have led to a tight abdominal compartment and hence abdominal compartment syndrome. Hence, escharotomy alone will not be enough to relieve the raised intra-abdominal pressure. An emergency laparotomy will have to be performed in this patient.<br><br>Abdominal compartment syndrome is characterised by increased airway pressures with hypoventilation and decreased urine output, and hemodynamic compromise. Decompressive laparotomy is the standard of care for refractory abdominal compartment syndrome but carries an especially poor prognosis in burn patients. Full-thickness burns with a rigid eschar can form a tourniquet effect as the oedema progresses, leading to compromised venous outflow and eventually arterial inflow.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: The most commonly used colloid for fluid resuscitation is human albumin solution. Plasma proteins provide the inward oncotic pressure that counteracts outward capillary hydrostatic pressure. However, in the first 12 hours post-burn, massive fluid shifts drive proteins out of the intravascular space, so colloids are not effective and can worsen edema. <br><br>Option C: Escharotomy alone will not suffice, as the patient has circumferential abdominal burns, which might have led to abdominal compartment syndrome. Hence, releasing the pressure using decompression laparotomy is crucial. <br><br>Option D: Intravenous vasopressors are sometimes used during acute burn resuscitation, but their vasoconstrictive effects can reduce organ perfusion and increase the risk of organ failure and death. Hence, they are not recommended as first-line therapy in burn shock.<br><br>Pearl PM0487: Degrees of Burns<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td><strong>First-degree</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Second-degree (superficial partial thickness)</strong></td>\n<td><strong><strong>Second-degree (deep </strong></strong><strong>partial thickness)</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Third-degree </strong><strong>(full thickness)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong><strong>Fourth-degree </strong></strong><strong>(full thickness)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Depth</td>\n<td>Epidermis</td>\n<td>Epidermis + superficial dermis</td>\n<td>Epidermis + most of the dermis (most skin appendages destroyed)</td>\n<td>Entire dermis + subcutaneous tissue</td>\n<td>Involves connective tissue, muscle, possibly bone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colour/texture</td>\n<td>Red</td>\n<td>Red, edematous, and blistered</td>\n<td>Pale, mottled</td>\n<td>Hard, leathery</td>\n<td>Pale, dry, charred</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blanchable (capillary refill) </td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pain</td>\n<td>Painful</td>\n<td>Painful</td>\n<td>Painful (only on pinprick)</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healing</td>\n<td>5-10 days; no scar</td>\n<td>10-14 days; no or minimal scar</td>\n<td> 4-8 weeks, often with scarring and contractures</td>\n<td>Prolonged, with scarring and contractures, requires skin grafting</td>\n<td>Requires skin grafting or even amputation.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/280163e3ef8a49199158cdd221a8c725x1280x2560.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM1772: Physiological Consequences of Increased Intra-abdominal Pressure<br><br>Decreased :<br><br>* Cardiac output<br><br>* Venous return<br><br>* Visceral blood ﬂow<br><br>* Renal blood ﬂow<br><br>* Glomerular filtration<br><br>Increased :<br><br>* Cardiac rate<br><br>* Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure<br><br>* Peak inspiratory pressure<br><br>* Central venous pressure<br><br>* Intrapleural pressure<br><br>* Systemic vascular resistance",

      "solution": "In this case, the boy’s hypoglycemia is explained by decreased insulin requirement due to residual β-cell activity, also called the honeymoon phase of type 1 diabetes. He has been compliant with both meals and insulin injections, so the hypoglycemia is best explained by transient endogenous insulin secretion on top of a fixed insulin dose.<br><br>After insulin is initiated in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes, the glucotoxic environment improves. This allows the remaining functional β-cells to transiently recover and secrete endogenous insulin. The result is a period of decreased exogenous insulin requirement, often called the honeymoon phase or partial remission. If insulin doses are not adjusted during this time, patients may present with symptomatic hypoglycemia, as in this case.<br><br>The honeymoon phase typically occurs days to weeks after diagnosis and can last several weeks to months. It is characterized by near-normal glycemia with exogenous insulin needs falling below 0.5 U/kg/day. Although glycemic control may appear excellent, insulin should never be completely withdrawn, since autoimmune β-cell destruction will inevitably progress.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2781624fab774c518798d869b8ac7696x1280x1095.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A. There is no phenomenon of autocatalysis causing increased insulin production. Insulin secretion is regulated by blood glucose and other metabolic signals, not by any self-stimulating process. Therefore, this explanation has no physiological or pathological basis in type 1 diabetes.<br><br>Option C. Overactivation of insulin receptors, though rare, can occur in autoimmune conditions involving antibodies against the insulin receptor. These conditions typically manifest as either severe insulin resistance or unexplained hypoglycemia, distinct from the typical progression of new-onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Given the context of newly diagnosed T1DM and the timing (two weeks after insulin initiation), this scenario strongly suggests the honeymoon phase rather than receptor overactivation.<br><br>Option D. Malignant transformation of β-cells refers to insulinoma, a neuroendocrine tumor that secretes insulin. Insulinomas are extremely rare in adolescents, and they do not develop within weeks of a type 1 diabetes diagnosis. Moreover, insulinoma is unrelated to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islets that characterizes T1DM.",

It plays a role in the lateral stabilisation of the hip and the knee joint.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4adfbf20a8624e1cbe9a16d23c0b8eeax600x930.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options : <br><br>Option A: The Thomas test is used to diagnose fixed flexion deformity of the unilateral hip masked by exaggerated lumbar lordosis. During the test, the patient lies supine on a hard surface with legs straight. The patient may compensate for the flexion deformity by arching the lower back, creating excessive lumbar lordosis.<br><br>The easy passage of the examiner's hand between the bed and the back of the patient is considered a positive test, as normally this is not possible. By gradually flexing the unaffected hip, the pelvis tilts and eliminates lumbar lordosis, causing the affected hip to assume the flexed position. The angle between the affected thigh and the bed indicates the degree of flexion deformity.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/98e5d12bd414426ab03cf1a65998bb55x1280x2008.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option C: The Lasegue test or Straight Leg Raising Test (SLRT) is done to assess nerve root irritation in the lumbosacral area.  The patient is made to lie on their back with the head extended, with hips and legs in the neutral position. The affected leg is then passively and slowly raised by the ankle with the knee fully extended. The examiner stops further leg elevation when pain is elicited. Normally, it should be possible to raise the limb to 80–90 degrees.<br><br>The SLRT test is positive if the patient develops pain when the leg is between 30 and 60/70 degrees from horizontal. The pain should be a radicular type and radiating to the back of the thigh or to the calf.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4f5275022724486ba86d6bdf352d0c56x1279x1414.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option D: Bragard test (or Sciatic stretch test or Flip test) is another test for diagnosing nerve root compression. Perform SLRT. At the point where the patient experiences discomfort, the leg is lowered a little. The stretching and pain become less. At this angle, the ankle is passively dorsiflexed. If the pain in the back of the thigh or in the calf is felt again, the test is positive.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/707235f2b3ab4f4ebdcb4c128d54ceabx1280x1375.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM2203: Important tests and signs to assess the function of rotator cuff muscles<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tests</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Muscles tested</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Empty can test</p>\n</td>\n<td> Supraspinatus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resisted external rotation</td>\n<td> Infraspinatus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Lift-off test</p>\n<p>Belly press test</p>\n</td>\n<td> Subscapularis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Abduction paradox</p>\n<p>Drop arm sign</p>\n</td>\n<td> Seen in the complete   rupture of rotator cuff</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Lag sign</td>\n<td> Seen in tear of   supraspinatus or   infraspinatus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Drop sign</td>\n<td> Seen in the tear in the   infraspinatus and the   posterior part of the   rotator cuff</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

These symptoms indicate hyperprolactinemia, making a diagnosis of lactotroph adenoma most likely.<br><br>Lactotroph adenoma is the most prevalent type of hormone-secreting pituitary tumour. It may vary in size from small microadenomas to larger masses that may produce compressive symptoms. The majority are sparsely granulated and composed of chromophobe cells exhibiting juxtanuclear PIT-1 expression.<br><br>Immunohistochemistry typically reveals prolactin within cytoplasmic secretory granules. Co-expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is seen. In some cases, dystrophic calcification, including psammoma bodies or extensive calcified “pituitary stones,” is observed.<br><br>Hyperprolactinemia leads to symptoms such as amenorrhea, galactorrhea, decreased libido, and infertility. Prolactin secretion is generally proportional to tumour size. Diagnosis is easier in women due to menstrual irregularities than in men and postmenopausal women, where subtle hormonal effects may delay detection, allowing the tumour to grow into macroadenomas. Men, if symptomatic, can present with erectile dysfunction and gynaecomastia.<br><br>Management typically involves dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine, which effectively reduce tumour size and prolactin secretion. Surgical intervention may be considered in refractory or non-responsive cases.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Gonadotroph adenoma produces LH and FSH. It typically secretes low hormone levels that do not lead to a distinct clinical syndrome, making it clinically nonfunctioning. It most commonly appears in middle-aged men and women, presenting with neurological symptoms such as visual disturbances, headaches, double vision, or pituitary apoplexy. Impaired LH secretion is seen, which results in symptoms like low energy and decreased libido in men and amenorrhea in premenopausal women. <br><br>Option B: Corticotroph adenoma secretes ACTH, which results in increased cortisol secretion by the adrenal glands, leading to the development of hypercortisolism. It presents with the features of Cushing syndrome.<br><br>Option C: Somatotroph adenoma secretes growth hormone and is responsible for causing gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults.

It has a positive chronotropic as well as a positive inotropic effect on the heart. <br><br>Effect of blood pressure: The increase in cardiac output leads to an increase in systolic blood pressure (upper black line), but due to the action of β2 receptors on blood vessels, peripheral vasodilation causes a fall in diastolic blood pressure (lower black line); hence, the mean blood pressure decreases (orange line). <br><br>Effect on peripheral vascular resistance: due to the action of β2 receptors on blood vessels, peripheral vascular resistance decreases (green line)<br><br>Isoproterenol causes relaxation of smooth muscle, especially when baseline tone is elevated. This effect is most pronounced in bronchial and gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It is effective in relieving bronchoconstriction and may also inhibit antigen-induced release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, similar to β2-selective agonists.<br><br>It is primarily metabolised by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in the liver and other tissues. It is a poor substrate for monoamine oxidase (MAO) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), resulting in limited neuronal uptake compared to epinephrine and norepinephrine.<br><br>It is used in emergency settings to manage bradycardia and heart block, especially before pacemaker implantation. Common adverse effects include palpitations, tachycardia, headache, and facial flushing.

It predominantly stimulates α and β1 receptors. α1-mediated vasoconstriction increases peripheral vascular resistance. β1 stimulation causes an increase in both systolic BP (green line) and diastolic BP (red line). Although β1 action should also cause an increase in heart rate, a compensatory vagal reflex overpowers it, leading to reflex bradycardia.<br><br>Graph B is epinephrine. It stimulates α, β1, β2, and β3 receptors. β1 stimulation causes an increase in heart rate (positive chronotropic) as well as increased force of contraction (positive inotropy). The increase in systolic blood pressure (green line) is greater than the increase in diastolic blood pressure (red line); hence, the mean blood pressure increases (orange line). Peripheral vascular resistance decreases as β2 receptors on blood vessels are more sensitive than α receptors.<br><br>Option C: Dopamine primarily stimulates vascular D1 receptors at low concentrations, particularly in the renal, mesenteric, and coronary circulation. D1 receptor activation increases cyclic AMP levels, leading to vasodilation and an increase in the renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and sodium excretion. At higher concentrations, dopamine stimulates β1-adrenergic receptors, producing a positive inotropic effect on the heart. It also indirectly enhances cardiac function by promoting norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve terminals. Dopamine typically increases systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, while diastolic pressure remains stable or increases slightly.

The drug was administered appropriately, and the patient had no known allergies. Anaphylaxis was sudden and unpredictable, even with proper precautions and standard care. The healthcare team attempted prompt resuscitation, fulfilling their duty of care. Thus, this case is a classic example of therapeutic misadventure. It can be used as a defence against negligence.<br><br>Misadventure is of three types: therapeutic, diagnostic and experimental. Therapeutic misadventure includes medical/surgical errors, complications due to medications, iatrogenic/nosocomial infections and post-operative complications. It is not due to an underlying disease but rather due to the treatment being given. Other examples include- Fatal hemolytic reactions during blood transfusion, Ca breast occurring after prolonged use of di-ethylstilbestrol.<br><br>A diagnostic misadventure occurs during events where diagnosis is the main concern, like a perforation or peritonitis occurring secondarily to a radiological study. An experimental misadventure occurs when a patient is serving as a subject in an experimental study.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Medical negligence: This involves a breach of duty, such as administering the wrong drug or failing to obtain informed consent. It is not applicable in the given scenario. <br><br>Option C: Contributory negligence occurs when a patient or their personal attendant shows unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care, which, when combined with the negligence of the doctor, has contributed to the injury, which is not applicable in this scenario.<br><br>Option D: Product liability: This refers to harm caused by a defective or contaminated drug. In this case, there is no evidence of a defective or contaminated drug. The event was an unpredictable adverse reaction, making it a therapeutic misadventure.<br><br>Pearl PM2391: Contributory negligence<br><br>Contributory negligence occurs when a patient or his personal attendant shows unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care, which when combined with the negligence of the doctor, has contributed to the injury. In this case, the patient’s or attendant’s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.<br><br>So, contributory negligence occurs when both the doctor and patient are negligent. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient’s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.<br><br>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the patient:<br><br>* Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.<br><br>* Fails to follow the doctor’s instructions<br><br>* Refuses to take the treatment<br><br>* Leaves the hospital against doctor’s advice<br><br>* Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.<br><br>Contributory negligence is a defence for doctor’s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the doctrine of comparative negligence, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.<br><br>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:<br><br>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:<br><br>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient<br><br>* Ex: Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (doctor is negligent) to the patient’s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (no proper instruction). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (patient is negligent). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.<br><br> 2. Last clear chance doctrine: It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.<br><br>* Ex: Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (doctor is negligent) to the patient’s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (gave proper instruction). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (patient is negligent). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.<br><br>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:<br><br>1. Avoidable consequences rule: It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor’s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the doctor need not pay anything, and the patient will be held guilty.<br><br>* Ex: A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.<br><br>* Here, despite the doctor being negligent in the first instance, the patient is responsible for his injury as he performed an unnecessary, avoidable act, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.<br><br>2. Good Samaritan doctrine: A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.<br><br>* Ex: A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (serious danger), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car (assisted the victim and was not reckless). However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (victim’s injury was aggravated). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, will not be charged under contributory negligence.<br><br>Pearl PM1025: Doctor and The Court<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>BNS section</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Previous IPC section</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Deals with</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p> 227</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>191</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Giving false evidence (perjury) definition</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>228</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>192</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fabricating false evidence</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>229</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>193</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Punishment for false evidence</p>\n<ul>\n<li>229(1) Judicial proceedings: up to 7 years of imprisonment and fine up to ten thousand rupees</li>\n<li>229(2) Any other case: up to 3 yrs of imprisonment and fine up to five thousand rupees</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>233</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>196</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Using evidence known to be false</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><br/>234<br/><br/></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>197</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Issuing or signing a false certificate</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>238</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>201</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Causing disappearance of evidence of an offence or giving false information to screen offender</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Consequently, the uppermost curve on the graph signifies bicarbonate.<br><br>Pancreatic juice secretion is primarily under hormonal control. Secretin stimulates the pancreatic ducts, leading to a copious secretion of highly alkaline pancreatic juice (rich in bicarbonate) but low in enzymes. This effect on duct cells is mediated by an increase in intracellular cAMP. Secretin also promotes bile secretion.<br><br>Cholecystokinin (CCK) acts on acinar cells, triggering the release of zymogen granules and the production of a low-volume pancreatic juice rich in enzymes. Its effect is mediated by phospholipase.<br><br>In response to intravenous secretin, an increase in pancreatic secretion volume is accompanied by a decrease in chloride content and an increase in bicarbonate content. Although bicarbonate is secreted in small ducts, it is reabsorbed in larger ducts in exchange for chloride ions. The extent of this exchange is inversely proportional to the flow rate. The increase in pancreatic juice volume leads to a decrease in amylase concentration due to dilution.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c3a8bd8a3ce647ef8707b24421b1ebd0x1280x1679.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM1290: Source and actions of gastrointestinal hormones<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Action</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gastrin</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>CCK</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Secretin</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>GIP</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Motilin</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>G cells in the stomach (antrum)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>I cells of duodenum and jejunum (mainly), ileum</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>S cells deep in the mucosa of upper small intestine</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>K cells in mucosa of duodenum and jejunum</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 749\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Mo cells of the duodenum and jejunum</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Acid secretion</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gastric emptying</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Pancreatic HCO<sup>3-</sup></strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Pancreatic enzymes</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Insulin release</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> S</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gall bladder contraction</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Biliary </strong></p>\n<p><strong>HCO<sup>3-</sup></strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> S</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gastric motility</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Intestinal motility</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Mucosal growth</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Exocrine pancreas growth</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>KEY<br><br>S→Stimulates<br><br>I→ Inhibits",

Ibuprofen has a short half-life of around 2 hours, which necessitates three to four doses per day for anti-inflammatory efficacy. <br><br>Option D. Aspirin also has a short half-life (~2–3 hours).

It connects the anterior and posterior ends of the arch and maintains its tension during standing and walking. Along with this, the first layer of muscles in the sole, such as the medial part of flexor digitorum brevis and abductor hallucis, also contribute to the tie beam effect by reinforcing the span of the arch.<br><br>Another critical element in arch maintenance is the sling mechanism, formed by long tendons that descend from the posterior compartment of the leg into the sole. These include the tendons of tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus.

      "solution": "The above clinical scenario with the barium enema image is suggestive of colonic diverticulosis.<br><br>Diverticulosis refers to the condition where multiple outpouchings occur along the gastrointestinal tract, resembling a saw tooth. Colonic diverticulosis is more common among the aged group of more than 50 years. Colonic diverticulosis is primarily false diverticula, as only the mucosa and muscularis mucosa have herniated. Due to the high intraluminal pressure, they are referred to as the pulsion type of diverticula.<br><br>A low fibre diet results in smaller stool volume, which increases intraluminal pressure for propulsion. The higher pressures get directed to the colonic wall, resulting in pulsion diverticula. The sigmoid colon is the most common location.<br><br>The majority of patients with diverticulosis are usually asymptomatic. However, some patients may present with abdominal cramps, altered bowel habits, and painless rectal bleeding. Diverticulosis can present with complications like:<br><br>* Diverticulitis<br><br>* Abscess<br><br>* Peritonitis<br><br>* Intestinal obstruction<br><br>* Hemorrhage <br><br>* Fistula formation<br><br>The diagnosis is confirmed by a colonoscopy or an X-ray barium enema. Barium enema radiograph shows multiple barium-coated outpouchings from the colonic wall and gives the appearance of a saw-tooth. In cases of severe abdominal pain, a CT scan is preferred to avoid the risk of intestinal perforation.<br><br>A high fibre diet reduces the incidence of diverticulosis.

      "solution": "Intelligence Quotient(3) and the temperature in Celsius(4)are measured on the Interval Scale.<br><br>Interval scale data can be placed in a meaningful order. Additionally, they have meaningful intervals between the items, usually measurable quantities. For example, the difference between 100° and 90° is the same as that between 50° and 40° on the Celsius temperature scale. But these scales do not have absolute zeroes, which makes ratios between the items meaningless.<br><br>Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is considered an interval scale because the difference between scores is meaningful and consistent across the scale. For example, the difference between an IQ of 110 and 100 reflects the same magnitude of difference in intelligence as the difference between 120 and 110. However, IQ does not have a true zero point. This absence of a true zero distinguishes it from ratio data. IQ is not ordinal because ordinal data only indicate rank or order, whereas IQ scores have equal, standardised intervals between values, making differences meaningful.<br><br> Data will always fall into one of the four scales- Nominal, Ordinal, Interval and Ratio scales. Nominal scale data can be divided into qualitative categories or groups. No order or ratio from the data is implied. An example includes types of blood groups(5). Other examples are groups like male/female, black/white and urban/suburban/rural.<br><br> Ordinal scale data holds meaning when it is placed in a particular order. But there is no information about the interval size. An example is the Child-Pugh score(1). Other examples are TNM staging of tumours and the Glasgow coma score. IQ is not ordinal because ordinal data only indicate rank or order, whereas IQ scores have equal, standardized intervals between values, making differences meaningful.<br><br>Ratio scale data have similar properties to interval scale data.

Unlike choriocarcinoma (which arises from syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts), PSTT lacks syncytiotrophoblastic elements. This unique origin explains both its clinical presentation and its resistance to chemotherapy.<br><br>It typically presents months to years after a term pregnancy, abortion, or molar pregnancy. Notably, cases presenting many years after the index pregnancy often carry a worse prognosis.<br><br>The hallmark presentation is persistent or irregular vaginal bleeding long after pregnancy. Because PSTT secretes low levels of β-hCG (due to the absence of syncytiotrophoblasts), the elevation is mild but persistent, unlike the very high levels seen in choriocarcinoma. Patients may also have uterine enlargement, amenorrhea, or abdominal pain. Rarely, they present with metastasis (lungs, brain, liver).<br><br>Diagnosis:<br><br>* Ultrasound: Shows a uterine mass infiltrating the myometrium, with minimal vascularity (contrasting with the highly vascular choriocarcinoma).<br><br>* Doppler: Confirms low vascular flow.<br><br>* Serum β-hCG: Persistently low or plateauing.<br><br>* Histopathology: Shows proliferation of intermediate trophoblasts with hyaline-like material, absence of villi, minimal syncytiotrophoblasts, and high mitotic index.<br><br>* Immunohistochemistry: Positive for human placental lactogen (hPL), negative/weak for hCG.<br><br>Chemotherapy (usually multi-agent regimens such as EMA-EP) is reserved for metastatic or recurrent disease, but response rates are lower compared to choriocarcinoma.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A. Multi-agent chemotherapy with EMA-CO (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin-D, cyclophosphamide, vincristine) is the standard regimen for high-risk GTN such as choriocarcinoma or invasive mole. <br><br>Option B. Single-agent chemotherapy with methotrexate is the first-line therapy for low-risk GTN (e.g., non-metastatic choriocarcinoma, molar pregnancy). In PSTT, methotrexate is ineffective due to the tumor’s chemoresistance.<br><br>Option D. Repeat suction and curettage is appropriate in a molar pregnancy or retained products of conception. PSTT is a solid tumor infiltrating the myometrium, not just confined to the endometrial cavity. Curettage would not remove the disease and may even risk bleeding or incomplete clearance.",

Hence, there is pulmonary overcirculation leading to pulmonary edema, respiratory distress. Blood is stolen from the systemic circulation, leading to systemic hypoperfusion. This leads to complications such as necrotising enterocolitis, renal ischemia.<br><br>Ductus arteriosus is a fetal vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta, bypassing the lungs. Its persistence beyond 2-3 weeks is called PDA. It is more common in premature infants and also seen in high-altitude infants.<br><br>Associated syndromes are congenital rubella syndrome and smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome (ACTA2 mutation). Irrespective of age, patients with a PDA require either catheter or surgical closure. In patients with a small PDA, the rationale for closure is prevention of bacterial endarteritis.<br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option A.

Glucagon was most likely administered to this patient, which acts via the activation of adenylyl cyclase.<br><br>Glucagon binds to its receptor, activating adenylyl cyclase and increasing cAMP levels. This triggers protein kinase A, which phosphorylates enzymes like glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase. Phosphorylation activates glycogen phosphorylase and inhibits glycogen synthase, shifting the liver from storing glucose to producing it. As a result, glucagon helps raise blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, counteracting insulin-induced hypoglycemia.<br><br>The action pathway of glucagon is shown in the illustrated image below:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a410309e6ea34babb66ba8a7710d3d21x720x950.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other Options:<br><br>Option A: Glucose-6-phosphatase releases glucose from glucose-6-phosphate. Inhibiting this enzyme reduces the release of glucose from cells, which would lower rather than raise the patient’s blood glucose levels.<br><br>Option B: Glucokinase catalyses the first step of glycolysis, leading to increased glucose utilisation and lowering of blood glucose levels. Activation of this enzyme occurs in glucose excess, when insulin is the predominant hormone.<br><br>Option C: Glucagon stimulates, not inhibits, glycogen phosphorylase, which is responsible for the rate-limiting step in glycogenolysis.

This leads to relaxation of the uterus and effective inhibition of contractions. It is considered a first-line tocolytic, especially before 32–34 weeks of gestation, because of its efficacy and safety profile. The major maternal side effect is hypotension, due to systemic vasodilation. Other adverse effects include flushing, tachycardia, dizziness, and headache, but it is generally well-tolerated with minimal fetal risks.<br><br>Indomethacin works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), leading to reduced prostaglandin synthesis, which is a key mediator of uterine contractions. It is a very effective tocolytic, particularly in pregnancies <32 weeks. However, beyond this gestational age, it carries significant fetal risks, most notably premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and oligohydramnios (due to reduced fetal renal perfusion). Maternal side effects include gastritis and platelet dysfunction. Hence, its use is restricted to early preterm labor. It is contraindicated in cases of hepatic disease, active peptic ulcer, and coagulation disorders.<br><br>Ritodrine is a β2-receptor agonist that stimulates adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cAMP, which in turn relaxes myometrial smooth muscle.  The hallmark side effect is maternal hyperglycemia, as it promotes glycogenolysis and lipolysis. Other complications include tachycardia, hypokalemia, pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, and tremors. Neonates exposed in utero may develop tachycardia or hypoglycemia. <br><br>Atosiban is a selective oxytocin receptor antagonist that prevents oxytocin binding, thereby reducing calcium-mediated uterine contractions. The drug is well-tolerated, with the most common side effects being headache, nausea, and dizziness. Unlike nifedipine or ritodrine, atosiban has minimal cardiovascular effects, making it particularly useful in patients with underlying heart disease.<br><br>Pearl PM2438: Tocolytic agents<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Drugs</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Examples</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Calcium channel blockers</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Nifedipine <br/>Nicardipine<br/> Verapamil</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 606\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Competitive inhibition to calcium ion</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>Magnesium sulfate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Indomethacin<br/>Sulindac</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Beta mimetics</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Terbutaline<br/>Ritodrine<br/>Isoxsuprine</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Oxytocin Antagonists</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Atosiban</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Nitric oxide (NO) Donors</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td> Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
