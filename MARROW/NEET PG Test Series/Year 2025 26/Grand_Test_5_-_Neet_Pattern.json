This occurs due to a combination of altered collagen structure with ageing, disordered motility, and increased intraluminal pressure, especially in the narrow sigmoid colon. <br><br>It commonly occurs in people who consume a low-fibre diet as it increases the transit time, reduces the stool weight, and reduces the bulkiness of stool, which in turn raises the intraluminal pressure and causes muscle hypertrophy. This progresses to colonic narrowing and segmentation, resulting in pulsion diverticula of only mucosa adjacent to the taenia in the antimesenteric region. It's common in the sigmoid colon. However, these are false diverticula as there is no muscularis layer in the diverticulum. <br><br>Other risk factors associated with this disease are a non-vegetarian diet, NSAIDs intake, smoking, alcohol consumption, long-standing constipation, laxative abuse, etc. The majority of diverticulosis remain asymptomatic with no complications. Some develop complications like diverticulitis, abscess, peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, haemorrhage, and fistula formation.<br><br>Hinchey’s system is used to stage complicated diverticulitis as follows: <br><br>* Grade I: Mesenteric/pericolic abscess <br><br>* Grade II: Pelvic abscess<br><br>* Grade III: Purulent peritonitis <br><br>* Grade IV Faecal peritonitis<br><br>Clinical features include abdominal distention, lower abdominal pain, left iliac fossa tenderness with radiation to the back, passage of frank, bright red blood per rectum, and pneumaturia (colovesical fistula). Occasionally, a mass is palpable. Early stages are usually asymptomatic. Symptoms depend on the complication they develop. <br><br>Investigations include a CT scan, which is useful in identifying bowel wall thickening, abscess formation, and extraluminal disease. Colonoscopy demonstrates the neck of diverticula within the lumen of the bowel. Management includes a high fibre diet, antispasmodics to relieve the pain, intravenous antibiotics, bowel rest, operative procedures like drainage of abscess, Hartman’s procedure, and primary anastomosis.<br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option B: Montreal classification for Inflammatory Bowel Disease is used to classify the severity of Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative Colitis. <br><br>Option C: Dukes’ staging system is used for colorectal cancer. <br><br>Option D: The Amsterdam criteria are a set of guidelines used to identify families who may have Lynch syndrome.",

This triggers a host of inflammatory responses in the subarachnoid space, causing damage to the cochlea and neural tissue.<br><br>Administering dexamethasone before or with the first dose of antibiotics blunts this inflammatory reaction by inhibiting cytokine production (especially TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6), thus protecting the auditory pathway and brain tissue.<br><br>For uncomplicated cases of H. influenzae meningitis, intravenous antimicrobial therapy should be administered for 7 to 14 days.

Carnosine acts as an intracellular buffer in anaerobically contracting skeletal muscle.<br><br>During high-intensity exercise, hydrogen ions accumulate as a result of rapid ATP hydrolysis and other metabolic reactions, leading to a decrease in intracellular pH. The imidazole group of the histidine residue in carnosine accepts excess hydrogen ions, thereby stabilizing muscle pH and helping maintain optimal enzymatic activity under acidic conditions.

It is considered so because delaying the reduction of a dislocated hip increases the risk of osteonecrosis of the femoral head due to loss of blood supply.<br><br>Initially, a trauma survey is made, and life-threatening injuries are ruled out. After that, the dislocated hip takes precedence over any other orthopaedic injury.

It can be performed either under light sedation or general anaesthesia.<br><br>The most common method used for the reduction of a posteriorly dislocated hip is the Allis maneuver. It is performed with the patient in the supine position. An assistant stabilises the pelvis by applying pressure on both the ASIS.

It is a reliable method of sterilization, but not a reversible technique and may require a laparotomy incision.<br><br>Other methods of sterilization include:<br><br>1. Laparotomy/Minilaparotomy:<br><br>* Pomeroy's procedure: The fallopian tube is identified on each side, brought out through the incision, and the middle portion is formed into a loop which is tied at the base with catgut and excised. It is surgically reversible.<br><br>* Madlener's procedure: A loop of the fallopian tube is crushed and then ligated with a nonabsorbable suture.<br><br>* Kroener's technique: It refers to fimbriectomy done by ligating the distal ampulla of the tube with two permanent sutures followed by division and removal of the infundibulum. It is irreversible.<br><br>* Uchida's method: The serosa in the midsegment of the tube is stripped off from the mucosa and then excised. The proximal segment is ligated and buried in the broad ligament. The minimum tubal excision preserves the potential for tuboplasty.<br><br>* Cornual resection: The cornual part of the tube is resected between two clamps.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/417ea18431a342268453182c5dd6dcaax1280x2577.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4e77f71975b54f0d9df6c3642834a362x1200x2309.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6c0d4acab35d4d6eab90ca9c98eeb99ax1280x2110.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>2.

Hysteroscopic sterilization with the Essure permanent device: It is made of a flexible stainless steel inner coil and a nickel-titanium outer coil (nitinol). Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in the inner coil causes a benign local fibrous tissue growth that occludes the fallopian tube. It takes 3 months to occlude the tube, confirmed with hysterosalpingography. During this period of 3 months, other methods of contraception should be used.

Ultrasound findings include increased liver echogenicity, reflecting diffuse steatotic changes.\n \nRisk Stratification (Next Step): Before initiating treatment, fibrosis assessment is essential to identify patients at risk for progression to cirrhosis with non-invasive scoring systems like:<br><br>* NAFLD Fibrosis Score includes Age, BMI, Diabetes status, AST/ALT ratio, Platelet count, Albumin<br><br>* FIB-4 (Fibrosis-4) Score <br><br>Calculate the NAFLD Fibrosis score to assess risk of fibrosis.<br><br>* Low risk: Manage in primary care with lifestyle modification.<br><br>* Intermediate/High risk: Refer for FibroScan (transient elastography) to assess hepatic stiffness (Option D)<br><br>* If FibroScan suggests advanced fibrosis → confirm with Liver biopsy (gold standard) (Option B)<br><br>The mainstay of treatment for NAFLD is lifestyle modifications.

These include a red, warm, tender right leg with restriction of movement due to pain. Laboratory findings also show leukocytosis and elevated ESR/CR, further strengthening the diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis. <br><br>If osteomyelitis is suspected on clinical grounds, blood and fluid samples should be taken for laboratory investigation, and then treatment started immediately without awaiting final confirmation of the diagnosis.<br><br>There are four important facets to the management of a suspected case of acute osteomyelitis<br><br>* Appropriate antimicrobial therapy (first empirical, then specific).<br><br>* Surgical drainage of pus if required<br><br>* Splinting and the rest of the affected part<br><br>* Supportive treatment for pain and dehydration.<br><br>Blood and aspiration material are sent immediately for examination and culture, but the prompt intravenous administration of antibiotics is so vital that treatment should not await the result. Once the culture report comes, antibiotics can be changed accordingly. But initially, early empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic administration needs to be started.<br><br>Staphylococcus aureus is the most common at all ages, but treatment should also provide cover for other bacteria that are likely to be encountered in each age group. Factors such as the patient’s age, general state of resistance, renal function, degree of toxaemia, and previous history of allergy must be taken into account.<br><br>For neonates and infants up to 6 months of age, the drugs of choice are flucloxacillin plus a third-generation cephalosporin such as cefotaxime. Alternatively, effective empirical treatment can be provided by a combination of flucloxacillin, benzylpenicillin and gentamicin.<br><br>For children of 6 months to 6 years of age, empirical treatment is best provided by a combination of intravenous flucloxacillin and cefotaxime or cefuroxime. In older children and previously fit adults, the vast majority in this group will have a staphylococcal infection and can be started on intravenous flucloxacillin and fusidic acid.<br><br>Other Options:<br><br>Option A: MRI of the affected limb can be helpful in cases of doubtful diagnosis. It will help in demonstrating bone marrow inflammation. It is extremely sensitive, even in the early phases of bone infection, and it can therefore assist in differentiating between soft-tissue infection and osteomyelitis. However, it need not be taken in a clinically obvious case of Acute osteomyelitis. <br><br>Option B: Immediate surgical debridement, as the x-ray is unremarkable, further radiological scans can be done to look for the presence of an abscess. It can be debrided under empirical antibiotic coverage, and the sample collected can be sent for culture<br><br>Option D: Bone Scan with Technicium 99- Radioscintigraphy with Technicium 99 reveals increased activity in both the perfusion phase and the bone phase. This is a highly sensitive investigation, even in the very early stages, but it has relatively low specificity, and other inflammatory lesions can show similar changes.",

This reduced interaction is due to the replacement of β-chains (in HbA) with γ-chains in HbF, which alters the 2,3-BPG binding site.<br><br>* In adults, 2,3-BPG binds to the central cavity of deoxyhemoglobin, stabilizing the T (tense) state, promoting oxygen unloading, and shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right.<br><br>* In fetal hemoglobin, this interaction is weaker, so HbF remains in the R (relaxed) state longer, holding onto oxygen more tightly, resulting in a left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve.<br><br>This allows for efficient placental oxygen transfer from mother to fetus.<br><br>The different causes for the shift to the right and shift to the left are shown in the image below:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4607b8d6967641ebb448d5a11558d6e6x944x976.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Fetal hemoglobin causes a left shift of the dissociation curve and hence has a reduced Bohr effect compared to HbA, not enhanced.<br><br>Option C: Bisphosphoglycerate mutase makes 2,3-BPG, but it does not explain HbF’s higher O₂ affinity.

OAEs are useful in evaluating cochlear function, particularly in newborn hearing screenings, as they are present when outer hair cells are healthy and absent when there is damage to the cochlea. OAEs are passive, non-invasive, and do not require active cooperation, making them ideal for use even after mild sedation, particularly when testing uncooperative or mentally challenged patients<br><br>OAEs are preserved in VIIIth nerve lesions (Option A), as they reflect the function of outer hair cells in the cochlea, not the auditory nerve. In VIII nerve (retrocochlear) pathologies, such as vestibular schwannoma or auditory neuropathy, the outer hair cells remain structurally and functionally intact, so OAEs are typically preserved.

      "solution": "In the given clinical scenario of a chronic smoker with complaints of intermittent discharge from bilateral nipples for the past few months and mammography showing the characteristic broken needle calcification, is suggestive of duct ectasia which is associated with greenish discharge. <br><br>Duct ectasia is associated with focal dilatation of the lactiferous duct system. It is the most common cause of nipple discharge in non-lactating women. This condition is strongly associated with smoking.<br><br>The initial stage of this disease consists of dilatation of one or more lactiferous ducts due to hormonally induced myoepithelial relaxation of the duct wall. These ducts get filled with stagnant brown or green-coloured secretions. The collection may be discharged as shown below.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/f68749c86c9b4952860239be1a038c42.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>In the later stages, the accumulation of fluid in the lactiferous ducts leads to infection and inflammation, due to irritation, causing periductal mastitis. The infections are most often mixed infections of aerobic and anaerobic flora of the skin. If the condition does not resolve, it can lead to the formation of a subareolar mass or abscess, and even mammary duct fistulas. Persistence of this condition eventually leads to fibrosis, which can cause slit-like retraction of the nipple.<br><br>Mammography reveals coarse rod and branching calcifications, described as broken needle calcification. This occurs due to the calcification of debris within dilated ducts.<br><br>Initial episodes can be managed with antibiotics. Recurrent episodes of the disease are best managed by Hadfield operation. This operation consists of the excision of all the major lactiferous ducts. If a single duct is involved, then a microdochectomy is performed.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Intraductal papilloma is a benign condition wherein a wart-like growth occurs within the mammary ducts. They are made up of glandular and fibrous tissue and vascular vessels. It is associated with blood-stained discharge.<br><br>Option C: Galactorrhea is characterised by the spontaneous release of milky discharge from multiple ducts in both nipples. It may be associated with a prolactin-secreting adenoma of the pituitary gland. Drugs that lead to increased prolactin secretion and galactorrhoea include amitriptyline, metoclopramide and H2 receptor antagonists (cimetidine). <br><br>Option D: Paget’s disease is characterized by nipple erythema and irritation. It is associated with pruritus and may progress to crusting and ulceration. It is associated with discharge from the surface of the nipple and not from within the nipple.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a66f9d76a32a4e8f9e2b4c05573b0ba0x258x187.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM2216: Discharge from the Nipple<br><br>From the surface:<br><br>* Paget’s disease<br><br>* Skin diseases (eczema, psoriasis)<br><br>* Rare causes (e.g., chancre)<br><br>From a single duct:<br><br>* Blood-stained:<br><br>* Intraductal papilloma (M/C cause)<br><br>* Intraductal carcinoma<br><br>* Duct ectasia<br><br>* Serous (any colour):<br><br>* Fibrocystic disease<br><br>* Duct ectasia<br><br>* Carcinoma<br><br>From multiple ducts:<br><br>* Blood-stained:<br><br>* Carcinoma (M/C cause)<br><br>* Ectasia<br><br>* Fibrocystic disease<br><br>* Black or green:<br><br>* Duct ectasia<br><br>* Purulent:<br><br>* Infection<br><br>* Serous:<br><br>* Fibrocystic disease (M/C cause)<br><br>* Duct ectasia<br><br>* Carcinoma<br><br>* Milk:<br><br>* Lactation<br><br>* Rare causes (hypothyroidism, pituitary tumour)",

This condition is defined by secondary amenorrhea for at least 4 months in a woman under 40, along with elevated gonadotropins (FSH >40 IU/L on two occasions at least one month apart) and low estradiol levels, indicating hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. The absence of any other systemic illness and normal TSH and prolactin levels further support this diagnosis.<br><br>In women with POI, the ovarian reserve is severely diminished, and spontaneous ovulation is rare. One of the key tests for assessing ovarian reserve is anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which reflects the quantity of antral follicles. AMH is produced by granulosa cells of ovarian follicles, and levels <1 ng/mL typically suggest poor ovarian reserve. Other markers include a high FSH in the early follicular phase (Day 2 or 3), low estradiol (<75 pg/mL), low antral follicle count (<4–5), and low inhibin B (<40 pg/mL), all indicating reduced follicular activity and diminished reproductive potential.<br><br>Given the lack of functional ovarian follicles, ovulation induction agents like clomiphene citrate or pulsatile GnRH are ineffective. The only viable option for pregnancy in these patients is assisted reproduction with donor oocytes, which has high success rates and is considered standard of care. Using combined oral contraceptives has no role in fertility management, and the priority in a woman strongly desiring pregnancy is to proceed directly to IVF with donor oocytes.",

It is a soft tissue skin fold, not part of the nail plate. Paronychia refers to an infection of the proximal and lateral nail folds. It results from the disruption of the protective barrier between the nail and the nail fold, introducing pathogens and predisposing the area to infection. It is more common in women. It can be acute if it lasts < 6 weeks or chronic if it lasts for >6 weeks.<br><br>Acute paronychia is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It presents clinically as erythematous, swollen, and tender lateral nail folds, and an area of fluctuance is seen if an abscess is present. In addition, papulosquamous disorders like psoriasis and pemphigus can also cause paronychia. Predisposing factors include nail biting, torn hangnails, or local trauma such as a splinter or thorn prick.<br><br>If superficial, the infection may drain spontaneously or be easily incised with a scalpel. Deeper infections may form a collar-stud abscess and require incision and drainage, sometimes involving removal of part of the nail plate. Penicillinase-resistant antibiotics are started initially, and a lack of improvement within 48 hours warrants surgical management. Twice-daily soaking in an antiseptic solution like chlorhexidine promotes healing. Complications include osteitis or, rarely, amputation.

This can be detected using biochemical assays.<br><br>* Ultrastructural changes: Changes visible under electron microscopy, such as mitochondrial swelling and plasma membrane disruption.<br><br>* Light microscopy changes: Cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation, observable under the light microscope.<br><br>* Gross morphological changes: Visible tissue changes, such as coagulative necrosis.",

The junction of all these sinuses is called the confluence of sinuses.<br><br>The superior sagittal sinus runs in the superior margin of the falx cerebri. It begins near crista galli and receives tributaries from the cortical veins draining the superior part of the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. It also receives tributaries from the cortical veins draining the anterior part of the orbital surface of the frontal lobe.<br><br>Acute and complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus is a severe condition that causes acute elevation of intracranial pressure.

Legal action may still be brought up to three years after the alleged negligent act, where a patient and doctor have entered into a specific contract that requires the provision of care.<br><br>Other defences against negligence<br><br>* No duty owed to the plaintiff<br><br>* Duty discharged according to prevailing standards<br><br>* Misadventure may be therapeutic (option D), diagnostic, and experimental. Therapeutic misadventure is a situation in which a patient has suffered harm or has died as a result of an error made by a doctor or agent of the doctor or the hospital.<br><br>* Error of judgment<br><br>* Contributory negligence - the absence of ordinary care on the part of the patient or his personal attendant<br><br>* Res judicata (337 BNSS/300 CrPC, option C) - If a question of negligence against a doctor has already been decided by a court in a dispute between the doctor and his patient, the patient will not be allowed to contest the same in another legal proceeding, based on the same set of facts. Multiple appeals cannot be made. <br><br>* Limitation (Res indicata) - A suit for damages for negligence must be filed within 2 years from the date of alleged negligence against the doctor. A suit filed after two years will be dismissed. But, where a breach of duty to provide care as per a contract between a patient and a doctor is committed, legal action may be undertaken for up to three years from the date of alleged negligence.<br><br>Other option:<br><br>Option A: 'Res ipsa loquitur' means 'the thing or fact speaks for itself'. It is obvious evidence of the negligent act committed, such as swabs left in the abdominal cavity post-laparotomy.<br><br>Pearl PM2391: Contributory negligence<br><br>Contributory negligence occurs when a patient or his personal attendant shows unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care, which when combined with the negligence of the doctor, has contributed to the injury. In this case, the patient’s or attendant’s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.<br><br>So, contributory negligence occurs when both the doctor and patient are negligent. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient’s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.<br><br>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the patient:<br><br>* Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.<br><br>* Fails to follow the doctor’s instructions<br><br>* Refuses to take the treatment<br><br>* Leaves the hospital against doctor’s advice<br><br>* Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.<br><br>Contributory negligence is a defence for doctor’s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the doctrine of comparative negligence, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.<br><br>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:<br><br>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:<br><br>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient<br><br>* Ex: Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (doctor is negligent) to the patient’s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (no proper instruction). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (patient is negligent). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.<br><br> 2. Last clear chance doctrine: It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.<br><br>* Ex: Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (doctor is negligent) to the patient’s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (gave proper instruction). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (patient is negligent). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.<br><br>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:<br><br>1. Avoidable consequences rule: It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor’s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the doctor need not pay anything, and the patient will be held guilty.<br><br>* Ex: A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.<br><br>* Here, despite the doctor being negligent in the first instance, the patient is responsible for his injury as he performed an unnecessary, avoidable act, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.<br><br>2. Good Samaritan doctrine: A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.<br><br>* Ex: A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (serious danger), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car (assisted the victim and was not reckless). However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (victim’s injury was aggravated). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, will not be charged under contributory negligence.",

The presence of two pots removes the risk of over-chlorination.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/148fdbb620634ff3882e65dfce25ace8x1280x1251.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option D: Controlled superchlorination is another name for breakpoint chlorination.<br><br>Pearl PM1598: Chlorination of Water<br><br>* Chlorination is widely used for the large-scale purification of drinking water.<br><br>* It is bactericidal and moderately virucidal but not sporicidal, except in high doses.<br><br>* It oxidizes iron, manganese, and hydrogen sulphide. It also destroys some taste and odour producing components. It controls algae and slime organisms and aids in coagulation.<br><br>* The action of chlorine:<br><br>* Hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid are formed when chlorine is added to water. Hypochlorous acid ionizes to form hydrogen and hypochlorite ions.<br><br>* H2O + Cl2 → HCl + HOCl\n HOCl → H + OCl<br><br>* The disinfecting action of chlorine is predominantly due to hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid is the most effective form of chlorine and it is almost 70 – 80 times more effective than hypochlorite ions.<br><br>* Chlorine acts best in water that has a pH of around 7.<br><br>* Principles of chlorination:<br><br>* The water to be disinfected must be clear of turbidity as turbidity impedes efficient chlorination.<br><br>* The chlorine demand of water is the difference between the amount of chlorine added to the water and the amount of residual chlorine remaining at the end of a specific period of contact (usually 60 minutes) at a given temperature and pH of the water. This has to be estimated before chlorination is done.<br><br>* The point at which the chlorine demand of water is met is called the breakpoint. It is beyond this that residual free chlorine begins to appear.<br><br>* Contact period of free chlorine for at least one hour is required to kill bacteria and viruses.<br><br>*  Minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0.5 mg/litre for one hour. Free residual chlorine provides a margin of safety against microbial contamination that occurs in storage or transport.<br><br>* The sum of the chlorine demand of the specific water plus free residual chlorine of 0.5 mg/litre constitutes the correct dose of chlorine to be applied.<br><br>* Methods of chlorination:<br><br>* Chlorine gas: It is the first choice as it is cheap, quick and efficient in action, and easy to apply. Special chlorinating equipments like Paterson’s chloronome are used for the application of chlorine gas.<br><br>* Chloramines: These loose compounds of chlorine and ammonia give more persistent forms of residual chlorine. They have slow action and thus are not widely used.<br><br>* Perchloron or high test hypochlorite (H.T.H.): It is a calcium compound that has 60 – 70% of available chlorine.<br><br>* Break point chlorination:<br><br>* The point at which the chlorine demand of water is met is called the breakpoint. <br><br>* Free chlorine (HOCl and OCl) appears when chlorine is added beyond the breakpoint.<br><br>* In other words, at the breakpoint, if chlorine is added, then all the combined chlorines would have been completely destroyed and free residual chlorines begin to appear.<br><br>* This corresponding dosage to achieve the appearance of free residual chlorine is called breakpoint dosage and this method is called breakpoint chlorination.<br><br>* It is also called controlled superchlorination<br><br>* Superchlorination followed by dechlorination is used to disinfect highly polluted waters whose quality fluctuates greatly.<br><br>* Orthotolidine (OT) test:<br><br>* It is a test for chlorination and determines free and combined chlorine in water, rapidly and accurately.<br><br>* The reagent used is analytical grade Orthotolidine dissolved in a 10% solution of hydrochloric acid.<br><br>* When added to water that contains chlorine, it turns yellow with varying intensity. This is faster in the presence of free chlorine and slower in the presence of combined chlorine.<br><br>* Orthotolidine - arsenite (OTA) test:<br><br>* This is a modification of the OT test which nullifies the errors due to interfering substances like iron, nitrites, manganese, etc.<br><br>* It determines free and combined chlorine separately.<br><br>Pearl PM1594: Purification of Water<br><br>Purification of water can be done on a large scale or small scale.<br><br>I) Purification of water on a large scale is done by one or more of the following measures:<br><br>* Storage<br><br>* Filtration:<br><br>* Slow sand filters<br><br>* Rapid sand filters<br><br>* Disinfection:<br><br>* Chlorination<br><br>* Ozonation<br><br>* UV radiation<br><br>* Membrane processes like reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration and microfiltration.<br><br>II) Purification of water on a small scale:<br><br>* Household purification of water:<br><br>* Boiling<br><br>* Chemical disinfection using bleaching powder, chlorine solution, high test hypochlorite, chlorine tablets, iodine and potassium permanganate.<br><br>* Filtration using Pasteur Chamberland filter, Berkefeld filters or Katadyn filters.<br><br>* UV radiation<br><br>* Multi-stage reverse osmosis<br><br>* Disinfection of wells with bleaching powder",

Because this reaction withdraws α-ketoglutarate, a central TCA intermediate, it represents a true cataplerotic pathway.<br><br>Examples of such reactions are:<br><br>* Citrate is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase to yield acetyl-CoA, the precursor for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis.<br><br>* Succinyl CoA combines with glycine in the presence of ALA synthase to begin porphyrin synthesis.<br><br>* Transamination of oxaloacetate to aspartate, which is used for the urea cycle, nucleotide synthesis, and other biosynthetic pathways.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes an anaplerotic reaction, replenishing oxaloacetate from pyruvate to maintain TCA cycle flux.<br><br>Option C: Citrate synthase combines oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to form citrate, committing substrates to the cycle but not removing intermediates.<br><br>Option D: α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase continues the oxidative decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate within the cycle, not diverting it.<br><br>Pearl PM0091: Steps involved in TCA cycle<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Step 1</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Acetyl CoA + Oxaloacetate → Citrate</p>\n<p>     (2C  + 4C  =   6C)</p>\n<p>Enzyme: Citrate Synthase</p>\n<p><strong>Irreversible</strong>, Exothermic reaction</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Step 2</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Citrate → Cis –aconitate  → Isocitrate </p>\n<p>( 6C    →          6C →             6C)</p>\n<p>Enzyme:   <strong>Aconitase</strong></p>\n<p>Cofactor:   Fe<sup>2+</sup></p>\n<p>The Reaction occurs in 2 steps:         </p>\n<p>1<sup>st</sup> step:  Dehydration      </p>\n<p>2<sup>nd</sup> step:  Rehydration</p>\n<p>Inhibited by:<strong> Fluoroacetate (Non- Competitive)</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Step 3</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Isocitrate →[Oxalosuccinate]→α- Keto glutarate</p>\n<p>        (6C) →         [6C]         →         (<strong>5C</strong>)</p>\n<p>Enzyme:  Isocitrate Dehydrogenase</p>\n<p>Cofactor:   Mn<sup>2+ </sup>or Mg<sup>2+</sup></p>\n<p>Reaction:  Oxidative  Decarboxylation</p>\n<p><strong>Intermediate:   Oxalosuccinate [ Unstable]</strong></p>\n<p>Release:    1 NADH and CO2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Step 4</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>α- Keto glutarate → Succcinyl Co A </p>\n<p>       (5C             →         4C)</p>\n<p>Enzyme: α- Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase(Multienzyme complex)</p>\n<p>Reaction:  Oxidative Decarboxylation</p>\n<p>Inhibited by: <strong>Arsenite  (Non – Competitive)</strong></p>\n<p>Physiologically <strong>unidirectional</strong> step.</p>\n<p>Release: 1 NADH and CO2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Step 5</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Succinyl- CoA  → Succinate</p>\n<p>      ( 4C          →         4C )</p>\n<p>Enzyme<strong>:  Succinate Thiokinase</strong></p>\n<p>Cofactor: Mg<sup>2+</sup></p>\n<p>Release:  1 ATP / GTP</p>\n<p><strong>Substrate level phosphorylation</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Step 6</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Succinate  →   Fumarate</p>\n<p>( 4C          →         4C )</p>\n<p>Enzyme:  Succinate Dehydrogenase (Part of 2<sup>nd</sup> complex ETC)</p>\n<p>Cofactor:  <strong>FAD and Fe-S protein</strong> </p>\n<p>The only enzyme of TCA cycle attached to the <strong>inner</strong> <strong>mitochondrial membrane.</strong></p>\n<p>Inhibited by: <strong>Malonate</strong> (<strong> competitive)</strong></p>\n<p>Release: FADH<sub>2</sub></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Step 7</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Fumarate  →   Malate</p>\n<p>( 4C         →     4C )</p>\n<p>Enzyme:  Fumarate Hydratase</p>\n<p>Reaction: Hydration</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Step 8</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Malate  →  Oxaloacetate  </p>\n<p>( 4C     →        4C )</p>\n<p>Enzyme:  Malate Dehydrogenase</p>\n<p>Release:  1 NADH</p>\n<p>Oxaloacetate<strong> is</strong> <strong>regenerated.</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/76825a8fa7b34db89430c4b5211dd573x1280x1018.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

It is relieved on sitting or forward flexion at the waist such as in an uphill walk.<br><br>It may be seen in cases of nerve compression from lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse or spinal stenosis. Symptoms become most prominent when there is a reduction of the interlaminar space; this occurs with prolonged standing when the spine is in an erect position.<br><br>Claudication pain may be of different types and can be differentiated as follows:<br><br>* Vascular (intermittent) claudication pain is brought on by walking and is relieved by rest within 5 minutes. <br><br>* Claudication pain present on taking the first step of walking is classical for osteoarthritis. (Option A)<br><br>* Neurogenic claudication occurs with changes in the position of the back such as bending forward and straightening. It takes more time to be relieved by rest (more than 5 minutes).<br><br>The most common symptom of peripheral obstructive vascular disease is intermittent claudication. It is usually felt in the calf when the superficial femoral artery is affected.<br><br>The distance that a patient is able to walk without pain or stopping is called claudication distance which varies only slightly from day to day. Such distance may even decrease further when the oxygen requirement of the muscles is increased as in cases like walking uphill, walking fast or carrying heavy weights.<br><br>Intermittent claudication is a feature of chronic arterial disease or occlusion of the artery. Classically, the muscle group affected by claudication is one anatomical level below the level of arterial disease.<br><br>Rest pain occurs when the occlusive disease progresses in severity and anaerobic respiration occurs even at rest. Though this pain is present during the day, it is exacerbated on lying down at night due to loss of gravity dependent perfusion of the foot. This may be relieved by hanging the foot out of the bed to restore the gravitational effects.<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><span class=\"qPbGnFJx\">In</span><span class=\"JSoxYEJn\">ter</span><span class=\"fSKBSVVz\">mitt</span><span class=\"tcBYKXiR\">ent</span> <span class=\"Qddvpfhg\">cla</span><span class=\"cPpAwJQG\">udic</span><span class=\"GHkDxCuh\">atio</span><span class=\"IdghZnla\">n</span></strong></td>\n<td><strong><span class=\"mbsbRMsd\">Neu</span><span class=\"cstcjGEw\">roge</span><span class=\"nSGOtXME\">nic</span> <span class=\"tcBYKXiR\">cla</span><span class=\"Qddvpfhg\">udic</span><span class=\"akeGgCMz\">atio</span><span class=\"RGDmfbwY\">n</span></strong></td>\n<td><strong><span class=\"LvLvjVJU\">Os</span><span class=\"WzBRXKbn\">teoa</span><span class=\"vqJfWEEh\">rthr</span><span class=\"YKadUvuA\">itis</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"fSKBSVVz\">Pain</span> <span class=\"ESEcOZpe\">afte</span><span class=\"WazAYrpG\">r</span> <span class=\"sDszolqM\">walk</span><span class=\"OSddcNFb\">ing</span> <span class=\"jjFkivhJ\">a</span> <span class=\"BDNpZjNd\">ce</span><span class=\"xmcBDoPX\">rta</span><span class=\"RGDmfbwY\">in</span> <span class=\"LGcQFOkC\">dist</span><span class=\"JSoxYEJn\">ance</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"ROKWwHdf\">Pain</span> <span class=\"OSddcNFb\">afte</span><span class=\"ROKWwHdf\">r</span> <span class=\"NbLHFtBb\">wa</span><span class=\"wZXIJehy\">lkin</span><span class=\"tcBYKXiR\">g</span> <span class=\"oVcsyOZl\">or</span> <span class=\"wIrzHQfT\">stan</span><span class=\"WzBRXKbn\">din</span><span class=\"gKHBDCdN\">g</span> <span class=\"WzBRXKbn\">for</span> <span class=\"OVGpeCub\">so</span><span class=\"NmWKxpvF\">me</span> <span class=\"IdghZnla\">time</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"vktEgemX\">Ma</span><span class=\"dEHJjTmS\">ximu</span><span class=\"ROKWwHdf\">m</span> <span class=\"zVyoRMMS\">pain</span> <span class=\"GHkDxCuh\">on</span> <span class=\"fSKBSVVz\">the</span> <span class=\"aabBGzee\">firs</span><span class=\"XQJEGeSp\">t</span> <span class=\"ZJYuejJl\">step</span><span class=\"ObKrXqPj\">.</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"aCcAcITz\">Pai</span><span class=\"RGaPCQwn\">n</span> <span class=\"VWsUfjfg\">qu</span><span class=\"gKHBDCdN\">ickl</span><span class=\"gKHBDCdN\">y</span> <span class=\"fQHADJeS\">reli</span><span class=\"VNBlNuYV\">ev</span><span class=\"dbaluEOI\">ed</span> <span class=\"VNBlNuYV\">on</span> <span class=\"BDNpZjNd\">res</span><span class=\"ueugCSmP\">ti</span><span class=\"LvLvjVJU\">ng.</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"Qddvpfhg\">Pa</span><span class=\"CflxyBXe\">in</span> <span class=\"ebOPpbto\">reli</span><span class=\"xPYhuscA\">ev</span><span class=\"LdxtCqxJ\">ed</span> <span class=\"OSddcNFb\">on</span> <span class=\"IdghZnla\">flex</span><span class=\"IdghZnla\">ion</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"IdghZnla\">Pa</span><span class=\"hamShWEU\">in</span> <span class=\"RvyvfvIe\">reli</span><span class=\"fSKBSVVz\">ev</span><span class=\"tsoHcNUw\">ed</span> <span class=\"QQPbGFYV\">on</span> <span class=\"pPAuLayy\">res</span><span class=\"pPAuLayy\">ting</span><span class=\"zlEZTbak\">.</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

An antagonist binds to Ri and Ra in relative same amounts as in the absence of any drug (Ri~Ra). Thus, in this situation, no change in activity is observed (Line C).<br><br>The presence of the antagonist at the receptor site will block access of agonists to the receptor and prevent the agonist effect. Such blocking action is termed as neutral antagonism, for example, flumazenil on GABA receptors.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>* Line A (Option A) depicts full agonist, where the drug shifts maximum receptors to Ra pool. (Ra>>Ri)<br><br>* Line B (Option B) depicts partial agonists, which bind to the same receptors and activate them but not as much as full agonists, even at their maximum concentrations.<br><br>* Line D (Option D) depicts inverse agonists, where the majority of the receptors are shifted to inactivated state than activated state (Ri>Ra). Here, the effects are opposite to those produced by conventional agonists at that receptor.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c68e5e10b1254ee9a7ae296ef0fff888x1280x1236.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
