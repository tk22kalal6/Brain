This gene is responsible for encoding <strong>ATP-gated chloride channels</strong> in the apical membranes of epithelial cells, which regulate the flow of ions across various epithelial membranes in the body, including sweat glands, respiratory airways, and pancreatic ducts. The defect in CFTR leads to<strong> elevated salt concentrations in sweat</strong> and the production of <strong>thick, viscous secretions</strong> in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.</p>\n<p>Diagnostic tests for CF include the <strong>sweat chloride test&nbsp;</strong>(option A), where an increased chloride concentration<strong> (&gt;60 mEq/L)</strong> is considered <strong>diagnostic</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels</strong> (option B) are also measured for newborn screening, as they tend to be<strong> elevated</strong>&nbsp;in CF. <strong>Genetic testing</strong> for CFTR gene mutations is considered the <strong>gold standard</strong> and should be performed for all <strong>suspected</strong> cases. In<strong> equivocal </strong>cases, <strong>nasal transepithelial potential difference</strong> can be estimated as an additional diagnostic test.</p>\n<p>The <strong>criteria for diagnosis</strong> is the presence of <strong>c</strong><strong>linical symptoms</strong>&nbsp;affecting at least <strong>one</strong> organ system (respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary)&nbsp;<strong>or </strong>a&nbsp;<strong>positive&nbsp;newborn screening</strong>&nbsp;<strong>or</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>a&nbsp;<strong>sibling</strong>&nbsp;with cystic fibrosis, along with evidence of&nbsp;<strong>dysfunction</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<strong>CFTR gene</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>t</strong><strong>wo positive sweat chloride test</strong> results obtained on separate days&nbsp;<strong>or </strong>identification of&nbsp;<strong>two CFTR mutations</strong>&nbsp;by genetic testing&nbsp;<strong>or </strong>an&nbsp;<strong>abnormal</strong>&nbsp;measurement of&nbsp;<strong>nasal potential</strong> <strong>difference</strong>).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The image below shows the organs involved in cystic fibrosis:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0f05fc955e954de0b5e10544c2b5a402x480x342.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "<p>In the clinal scenario of a <strong>55-year-old</strong> woman with <strong>third-degree uterine prolapse</strong>, the ideal management is <strong>vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic floor repair</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Uterine prolapse is the descent of the uterus from its normal position which usually occurs due to laxity of ligaments that offer support, seen often due to childbirth, aging, or trauma. The uterine descent is clinically categorized into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First</strong> degree:&nbsp; the <strong>external</strong> <strong>os</strong> remains <strong>above</strong> the vaginal <strong>introitus</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Second</strong> degree: The <strong>external</strong> <strong>os</strong> protrudes <strong>below</strong> the vaginal <strong>introitus</strong> but the uterine body remains inside the vagina&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Third degree (Syn: <strong>Complete</strong> <strong>prolapse</strong>): The <strong>uterine,</strong> <strong>cervix,</strong> <strong>body,</strong> and <strong>fundus</strong> descend to lie <strong>outside</strong> the <strong>introitus</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Procidentia</strong> involves prolapse of the uterus with the <strong>entire</strong> <strong>vagina everted</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The patient usually presents with a sense of heaviness in the pelvic region with lower back discomfort. Based on the structures involved the patient can additionally have urinary symptoms (like incontinence and urgency), bowel disturbances (constipation and tenesmus), or sexual discomfort during intercourse.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptomatic</strong> uterine prolapse is managed <strong>surgically</strong> with different procedures based on the profile of the patient. <strong>Conservative</strong> management is done for <strong>old asymptomatic</strong> <strong>women</strong> with <strong>mild</strong> <strong>degree</strong> <strong>prolapse</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A <strong>vaginal</strong> <strong>hysterectomy</strong> is recommended for patients who satisfy the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&gt;40</strong> years of age&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Have <strong>completed</strong> their <strong>families</strong></li>\n<li>Do <strong>not</strong> wish to <strong>preserve</strong> menstrual and <strong>child-bearing</strong> function</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Fothergill</strong> <strong>repair</strong> or <strong>Manchester</strong> <strong>operation</strong> is a procedure done to <strong>preserve</strong> the <strong>reproductive</strong> <strong>function</strong> and vaginal prolapse with supravaginal cervix elongation. It initially involves preliminary curettage with low amputation of the cervix. After Mackenrodt's ligament is plicated,&nbsp; anterior colporrhaphy and colpoperineorrhaphy are performed.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Sling</strong> <strong>operation</strong> (Purandare's operation) is indicated in <strong>congenital</strong> or <strong>nulliparous</strong> <strong>prolapse</strong> without cystocele. The procedure involves the extraperitoneal passage of rectus sheath strips joined to the anterior surface of the cervix by silk sutures.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Shirodkar</strong> <strong>procedure</strong> is a type of <strong>abdominal</strong> <strong>sling</strong> <strong>surgery</strong> done in young women to <strong>retain</strong> <strong>menstrual</strong> and <strong>reproductive</strong> function. It involves using a sling to <strong>fix</strong> the <strong>cervix</strong> to the <strong>lumbosacral</strong> <strong>fascia</strong>.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Management of Uterine prolapse</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Treatment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nulliparous or congenital prolapse&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Abdominal sling operations:</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 374\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>Abdominal wall cervicopexy</li>\n<li>Shirodkar&rsquo;s abdominal sling operation</li>\n<li>Khanna&rsquo;s abdominal sling operation</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pregnancy and postnatal period</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ring pessary (up to 16 weeks period of gestation)</li>\n<li>Pelvic floor exercises</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&lt;40 years&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Fothergill's repair (Manchester operation)</li>\n<li>Shirodkar's procedure</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&gt;40 years - with completed family&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Vaginal hysterectomy and pelvic floor repair&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&gt;60 years - unfit for surgery&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Le Fort's repair</li>\n<li>Colpocleisis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are done if the patient doesn't want to retain sexual function&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
