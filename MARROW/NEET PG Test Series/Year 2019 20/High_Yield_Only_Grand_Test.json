This is now recommended instead of two 0.75-mg doses separated by 12 or 24 hours. Dosing begins ideally within 72 hours of unprotected coitus but may be given up to 120 hours.

In a comparative trial of RU486 with Yuzpe regimen, side-effects were less common with mifepristone but menstrual disturbances occurred more often.</p>\n<p><strong>Intra uterine contraceptive devices:</strong> Insertion of copper-T and copper-7 within 7 days of unprotected intercourse is a highly successful method for post-coital contraception. Copper-T is effective following even multiple coital exposures during a short interval especially when the delay is <strong>beyond 120 hours, but less than 1 week,</strong> making hormonal methods ineffective.

This is because these proteins, which are <strong>anti-thrombotic</strong>, have a <strong>shorter half-life</strong> as compared to the clotting factors inhibited by warfarin. Initiation of warfarin caused a <strong>sudden drop</strong> in the levels of protein C and S before they inhibit the clotting factors, due to which there is <strong>hypercoagulability</strong> and consequent <strong>thrombosis of microvasculature</strong> which leads to necrosis. The toes, thighs, buttocks and breasts are commonly involved.</p>\n<p>This adverse effect can be <strong>prevented by co-administration</strong> of warfarin with a <strong>parenteral anticoagulant</strong> such as heparin in the <strong>initial few days</strong>, until the therapeutic INR range is achieved, before continuing with warfarin alone.</p>\n<p>Treatment of this condition is by immediately discontinuing warfarin. <strong>Vitamin K </strong>can be administered<strong> for reversal </strong>of the drug effect. Patients are started on an<strong> alternative anticoagulant</strong> such as heparin or LMWH.</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Aspirin acts by irreversibly inhibiting the enzymes <strong>cyclo-oxygenase </strong>and <strong>thromboxane</strong>.
