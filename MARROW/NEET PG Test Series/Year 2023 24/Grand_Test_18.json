      "solution": "<p>Flash or spark burns are not seen in a person struck by lightning and are seen in a person affected by <strong>electric shock</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Lightning injuries</strong> over a person can lead to the following findings such as <strong>burnt clothes</strong> or torn at the point of entry and exit, linear burns, <strong>filigree burns</strong>,<strong> </strong>and <strong>surface burns</strong> occur beneath the metallic objects worn or carried by the person (Option B) </p>\n<p><strong>Lichtenberg's flowers</strong> (Option C), also called <strong>arborescent </strong>(Option D) or filigree burns are superficial, thin, irregular, and tortuous markings over the skin that resemble the branches of a tree. They usually appear within minutes to an hour of a lightning injury and are observed as having a <strong>fern-like pattern</strong> of erythema over the skin of the shoulders or the flanks. </p>\n<p>They occur due to the staining of the tissues by hemoglobin released by lysed red blood cells along the path of the lightning strike. They can also appear due to the <strong>rupture</strong> of <strong>smaller blood vessels</strong> in several places giving rise to ecchymoses.</p>\n<p>The image below shows a filigree burn pattern:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/142d43384dd640f2a02d080d37c76c01x720x959.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong><br />Flash </strong>or Spark burn (option A) occurs in <strong>electrical burns</strong> or electrocution when the <strong>contact</strong> is<strong> less firm</strong>, a narrow air gap exists between skin and conductor, and the current jumps the gap as a spark. This causes the outer skin keratin to melt over a small area. On cooling, the keratin fuses into a <strong>hard brownish nodule</strong>, usually raised above the surrounding surface, the so-called <strong>spark lesion</strong>. The heat generated by the current may melt the calcium phosphate, which is radiologically seen as typical round dense foci known as bone pearls or wax drippings.</p>\n<p>Filigree burns are never seen in an electric shock. <strong>High voltage burns</strong> are very severe and lead to charring off the body. This leads to <strong>multiple burnt </strong>or <strong>punched-out lesions</strong> in large body surface areas called \"<strong>crocodile flash burns</strong>\".</p>\n<p>Image showing different patterns of injury due to electrical burns is shown below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/136b7c9090e54bdda96347d96cb91003x1280x1882.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

It is performed as mentioned below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patient wears goggles with\n<ul>\n<li>Red lens: Right eye</li>\n<li>Green lens: Left eye</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A box is viewed having 4 lights: one red, two green, and one white</li>\n<li><strong>Inference:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>A: <strong>Normal</strong>—All 4 lights seen</li>\n<li>B: <strong>Abnormal retinal correspondence</strong>—All 4 lights seen in the presence of manifest squint</li>\n<li>C: <strong>Left</strong><strong> Suppression</strong>—2 red lights seen</li>\n<li>D: <strong>Right suppression</strong>—3 green lights seen</li>\n<li>E: <strong>Diplopia</strong>—5 lights seen (2 red, 3 green)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ARC </strong>occurs as sensory adaptation in case of small angle squint whereas in <strong>diplopia</strong> corresponding points change. Over of the normal eye corresponds with the extra foveal point of a slightly deviated eye to adapt for diplopia. </p>\n<p><strong>Suppression </strong>occurs as sensory adaptation in confusion where 2 images are formed. The brain will suppress the image from the deviated eye. </p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option A: To measure direction and degree of deviation we use <strong>Hirschberg's test</strong>. It gives a rough estimate of the angle of manifest strabismus. A pen torch is used to shine light from an arm's distance and the patient is asked to fixate. The corneal reflection of the light will be decentered in the squinting eye in the direction opposite to the deviation.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/63ba149acd2c4e33902d99f4e3cc7dffx1280x1613.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option B: To measure heterophoria and cyclophoria we use <strong>Maddox rod</strong>. It consists of parallel red or colorless cylinders stacked together. It is a macular function test. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2b49efb09e644acf8fbc80f860d08f16x600x695.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D: To assess ocular motility we use <strong>Hess chart</strong>. It is use to diagnose and monitor patients with incomitant strabismus by assessing a binocular single vision field.

It is also useful in <strong>monitoring</strong> DKA. During the resolution of DKA, the levels of BOHB decrease, and acetoacetate increases, as BOHB is converted to acetoacetate for utilization by peripheral tissues.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Options A and B: <strong>Urine ketone</strong> testing is unreliable in the diagnosis of DKA for many reasons. They are <strong>nonspecific</strong> as they are also <strong>seen in</strong> <strong>normal individuals</strong> in conditions such as <strong>fasting</strong>, <strong>excessive</strong> <strong>ethanol</strong> use, and during <strong>pregnancy</strong>. Furthermore, urine ketone body tests rely on the nitroprusside reaction which does not detect BOHB. Patients can have also false positives due to certain drugs, and false negatives if ketones are below the level of detectability or if samples are exposed to air.</p>\n<p>Option D: In normal conditions, the levels of BOHB and acetoacetate are equal. However, in DKA the levels are vastly shifted in favor of BOHB production compared to acetoacetate. Hence, measuring serum acetoacetate may underestimate the true level of ketonemia.</p>",

The barium enema given shows multiple outpouchings in the ascending, transverse, and descending colon resembling a <strong>saw-tooth. </strong> </p>\n<p>Diverticulosis refers to the condition where multiple outpouchings occur along the gastrointestinal tract without any inflammation. Colonic diverticulosis is more common among the age group of more than 50 years. Colonic diverticulosis is primarily <strong>false diverticula</strong> as only the mucosa and muscularis mucosa have herniated. Due to the high intraluminal pressure, they are referred to as the pulsion type of diverticula. A low fibre diet results in smaller stool volume that increases intraluminal pressure for propulsion. The higher pressures get directed to the colonic wall resulting in<strong> pulsion diverticula.</strong> The <strong>sigmoid colon</strong> is the <strong>most</strong> <strong>common</strong> location.</p>\n<p>The majority of the patients with diverticulosis are usually <strong>asymptomatic.</strong> However, some patients may present with<strong> abdominal cramps,</strong> <strong>altered bowel habits,</strong> and <strong>painless rectal bleeding</strong>. Diverticulosis can present with complications like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diverticulitis</li>\n<li>Abscess</li>\n<li>Peritonitis</li>\n<li>Intestinal obstruction</li>\n<li>Hemorrhage </li>\n<li>Fistula formation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Diagnosis:</p>\n<p>The diagnosis is confirmed by a colonoscopy or an X-ray barium enema. <strong>Barium enema radiograph</strong> shows multiple barium-coated outpouchings from the colonic wall and gives the appearance of a<strong> saw-tooth</strong>. In cases of severe abdominal pain, a CT scan is preferred to avoid the risk of intestinal perforation.</p>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<p>A <strong>high fibre diet</strong> reduces the incidence of diverticulosis. Antispasmodics can be prescribed to reduce intestinal spasms. Most cases of bleeding are self-limiting. If persistent bleeding is present, surgical, endoscopic or radiological interventions can be done to reduce the bleeding.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Carcinoma colon</strong> shows <strong>apple-core sign</strong> on <strong>barium enema</strong> as shown below. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/9eb34c6de65640c59fc78cc87548d5a6x720x576.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>Crohn's disease</strong> is an inflammatory bowel disease that shows the <strong>string sign of Kantor</strong> on<strong> barium enema</strong> as shown below.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/457fa35dc0c24f07b3ac5afc403f9eefx720x844.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Intussusception</strong> shows the <strong>coiled-spring appearance</strong> on <strong>barium enema</strong> as shown below. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f5e06d96bd1545f69d45221f0180eb63x720x339.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Barium Studies</h3><p><strong>Barium swallow:&nbsp;</strong>Used to assess the pharynx, esophagus, and stomach.

Thus leukocytes can't migrate out of the blood vessels to the sites of inflammation.</p>\n<p><strong>Bruton's X-linked agammaglobulinemia</strong> is due to a defect in Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is required for the maturation of pre-B cells. Thus the defect leads to the&nbsp;<strong>arrest of maturation of pre-B cells</strong> and a decrease in the number of mature B cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Hyper IgM syndrome</strong> is due to deficient CD40L on T-cells. B-cells have CD40 on their surface which interacts with CD40L on T-cells to undergo <strong>class switching</strong> from IgM to various other classes (IgG, IgA, IgE) depending on the type of antigen. Thus, failure of this class switching leads to an increase in IgM and a decrease in other classes of antibodies.</p>\n<p><strong>SCID</strong> is due to many defects but the <strong>most common cause</strong> of an autosomal recessive form of SCID is the deficiency of adenosine deaminase enzyme. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to accumulation of adenosine derivatives inside the cell, which is toxic to them.

Large varicoceles may eventually cause testicular failure,ultimately resulting in <strong>low testosterone production</strong>.</p>\n<p>A varicocele is characterized by abnormal dilation and enlargement of the <strong>scrotal venous pampiniform plexus</strong>, which drains blood from each testicle. Majority of them present as left sided <strong>boggy</strong> or ‘<strong>bag of worms</strong>’ like scrotal swelling, since the <strong>left testicular vein </strong>drains into the relatively <strong>high-pressure left renal vein</strong> while the <strong>right testicular vein</strong> drains into the <strong>low-pressure inferior vena cava</strong> below the right renal vein.</p>\n<p>They typically develop during <strong>late childhood</strong> and <strong>adolescence </strong>and presents as <strong>infertility in adulthood</strong>.Other symptoms include <strong>dragging sensation </strong>to the left side that is worse on standing at the end of the day. When examined in the erect position, the scrotum on the affected side often hangs lower than normal and on palpation, with the patient standing, the varicose plexus feels like a ‘<strong>bag of worms</strong>’ and <strong>cough impulse</strong> may be present. <strong>Testicular atrophy</strong> maybe seen in long standing cases.</p>\n<p>While most varicoceles are idiopathic, obstruction of the testicular vein by a <strong>renal tumor</strong> or nephrectomy is a cause of varicocele in later life; characteristically, in such cases, the varicocele <strong>does not decompress in the supine position</strong>. The presence of an isolated <strong>right-sided varicocele</strong> is rare. Hence, imaging should be considered to <strong>exclude a retroperitoneal mass</strong> in such cases.</p>\n<p>Treatment includes <strong>percutaneous embolisation of the gonadal veins</strong> as first line management or <strong>surgical ligation </strong>of the testicular veins. Both procedures are associated with upto <strong>20% recurrence rates</strong>. Newer procedures such as <strong>microsurgical varicocelectomy</strong> have been proved to be more effective than existing treatment modalities.</p>\n<p><strong>Nutcracker syndrome</strong> - It is the <strong>left renal vein entrapment syndrome</strong>, characterized by <strong>extrinsic compression</strong> of the <strong>left renal vein</strong>, most commonly between the <strong>abdominal</strong> <strong>aorta</strong> and <strong>superior mesenteric artery</strong> and is one of the postulated reasons for left sided varicoceles being more common than the right side.</p>",

Hence, when light is transferred to the diseased eye, both the pupils will dilate. And on swinging the light back to the normal eye, both pupils will constrict again.  This 'escape dilatation' is known as a relative afferent pupillary defect/Marcus Gunn pupil. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of loss of vision</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Features </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cause </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sudden painless loss of vision</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Central retinal artery occlusion</li>\n<li>Massive vitreous hemorrhage</li>\n<li>Retinal detachment involving macula</li>\n<li>Ischemic central retinal vein occlusion</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sudden painless onset of diminution of vision</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Central serous retinopathy</li>\n<li>Optic neuritis</li>\n<li>Methyl alcohol amblyopia</li>\n<li>Non-ischemic central retinal vein occlusion</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Sudden painful loss of vision</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Acute congestive glaucoma</li>\n<li>Acute iridocyclitis</li>\n<li>Injury to eyeball</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Gradual painless diminution of vision</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Corneal dystrophy</li>\n<li>Senile cataract</li>\n<li>Primary open angle glaucoma</li>\n<li>Optic atrophy</li>\n<li>ARMD</li>\n<li>Refractive error</li>\n<li>Diabetic retinopathy</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Gradual painful diminution of vision</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronic iridocyclitis</li>\n<li>Corneal ulceration</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

The true statement regarding the technique is that they reduce the need of skin grafting procedures.(Option C)</p>\n<p>Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) is a method of wound management, which uses <strong>negative pressure</strong>(Option A) for spontaneous healing or by lesser reconstructive options. Negative pressure therapy stabilizes the wound environment by <strong>reducing wound edema</strong> and <strong>bacterial</strong> <strong>load,</strong>as well as improves <strong>tissue perfusion </strong>by angiogenesis and thereby stimulating <strong>granulation tissue formation</strong>. All this improves the possibility of primary closure of wounds and reduces the need for plastic procedures.</p>\n<p>Method of VAC application includes <strong>thorough debridement</strong>, <strong>adequate haemostasis</strong> and application of <strong>sterile foams dressing</strong>. A fenestrated tube is embedded in the foam and the <strong>wound is sealed</strong> with adhesive tape to make it airtight.

This eschar seals the wound with <strong>retained exudate</strong> and leads to worsening of the wound.The pressure in VAC dressing gradually reduces over 48 hours therefore, dressings should be changed on the <strong>3rd day</strong>.

It was developed as a modification of bupivacaine to decrease cardiotoxicity. <strong>Ropivacaine</strong> is less cardiotoxic and has a <strong>higher safety profile</strong> than bupivacaine. It has a shorter duration of action and produces <strong>less motor block</strong> (Option D) than bupivacaine (i.e. more motor sparing than bupivacaine). Ropivacaine is <strong>less potent </strong>(Option A) than bupivacaine. </p>\n<p>Both ropivacaine and bupivacaine have <strong>similar</strong> profiles in terms of renal toxicity (Option B). They do not produce adverse renal effects. Dose adjustments in renal failure is also not required. Bupivacaine may even have a renal protective effect.</p>\n<p>Ropivacaine can be used for infiltration anesthesia and central neuraxial blocks (both spinal and epidural).</p>\n<p>Bupivacaine is a long-acting local anesthetic that is the most <strong>cardiotoxic</strong> among the local anesthetics. It blocks the sodium channels of the heart during systole. However, compared to lidocaine, it dissociates very slowly. Therefore, the heart remains blocked for a longer duration in diastole. This makes bupivacaine cardiotoxic.</p>\n<p>Accidental intravascular injection of local anesthetic like bupivacaine results in <strong>bupivacaine-induced</strong> <strong>cardiotoxicity. </strong>If this occurs, basic life support followed by <strong>intralipid therapy</strong> is initiated. A rapid bolus of<strong> intralipid </strong>20% IV (1.5 mL/kg) is administered without delay, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min. Intralipid decreases cardiac bupivacaine concentration, and cerebral bupivacaine concentration</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>Local anesthesia systemic toxicity (LAST) can also affect the central nervous system (CNS), which is more susceptible to local anesthetic action as compared to the cardiovascular system.

UPJO is more common in <strong>males</strong> and occurs more frequently on the <strong>left</strong> side. </p>\n<p>Most cases of PUJO with associated hydronephrosis are now detected before birth with <strong>antenatal ultrasound</strong>. If undetected, it presents in infancy as a palpable renal mass. Associated presentations include abdominal or flank pain, febrile UTI, or hematuria after minimal trauma.</p>\n<p>The causes of UPJ obstruction are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intrinsic</strong> (due to an <strong>adynamic</strong> or stenotic segment of the proximal ureter) or </li>\n<li><strong>Extrinsic</strong> (e.g. compression by accessory renal arteries). This needs to be corrected primarily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>renal anatomy</strong> and <strong>function</strong> can be assessed using <strong>radio scintigraphy</strong> studies. The <strong>investigation</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>choice</strong> for UPJ obstruction is a <strong>99mTc-MercaptoAcetyl-triGlycine </strong>(MAG3) scan. <strong>Micturating cystourethrogram</strong> is the investigation of choice in <strong>vesicoureteric reflux</strong>. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan is used for assessing renal scarring. <strong>Ultrasound</strong> abdomen is useful to grade the <strong>severity</strong> and <strong>persistence</strong> of <strong>hydronephrosis</strong> which in turn guides management. Mild cases with grade 1 or 2 hydronephrosis and normal renal parenchyma are managed with observation and subsequent renal ultrasound studies to monitor the severity.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> of intrinsic UPJ obstruction is done <strong>surgically</strong> if renal function is compromised or if there is bilateral involvement of the kidneys. In other cases, serial follow-up with ultrasonography is done to assess the spontaneous resolution of hydronephrosis.</p>\n<p>Its indications include persistent pain, hypertension, haematuria, secondary renal calculi and recurrent UTIs due to the UPJO. The age group for which it is done depends on the severity of hydronephrosis hence can be from<strong> 1 month</strong> to <strong>18-19 years of age</strong>.</p>\n<p>Surgical options include <strong>Anderson Hynes pyeloplasty</strong> which entails the surgical division of the obstruction and the creation of a funnel-shaped anastomosis. Additionally, a temporary stent and a drain may be inserted. It is necessary to do further serial ultrasounds and MAG-3 imaging in order to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation. This procedure is now commonly being performed via laparoscopy and also with robotic assistance. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Stephan Fowler technique</strong> is used in the management of <strong>cryptorchidism</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Nesbitt’s procedure</strong> is used in the management of <strong>Peyronie's</strong> <strong>disease</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong> Grey hack shunt surgery </strong>is used in the management of <strong>priapism</strong>.</p>",

The genetic defect in the X-linked form is a mutation in the common γ-chain (γc) subunit of cytokine receptors and the most common cause of <strong>autosomal-recessive</strong> SCID is a<strong> </strong>deficiency of<strong> adenosine deaminase (ADA)</strong> enzyme.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Human Diseases of DNA Damage Repair</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>DNA damage repair type</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Diseases</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective Nonhomologous End Joining Repair (NHEJ)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID)</p>\n<p>Radiation sensitive severe combined immunodeficiency disease(RS-SCID)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective Homologous Repair (HR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AT-like disorder (ATLD)</p>\n<p>Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS)</p>\n<p>Bloom syndrome (BS)</p>\n<p>Werner syndrome (WS)</p>\n<p>Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS)</p>\n<p>Breast cancer suspectibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1, BRCA2)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP)</p>\n<p>Cockayne syndrome (CS)</p>\n<p>Trichothiodystrophy (TTD)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Base Excision Repair (BER)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Defective DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: DNA Repair Mechanisms</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Damaging agents</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Damage caused</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Repair mechanisms</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ionizing radiation</p>\n<p>X-rays</p>\n<p>Anti-tumor drugs</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Double-strand breaks</p>\n<p>Single-strand breaks</p>\n<p>Intrastrand crosslinks</p>\n<p>Interstrand crosslinks</p>\n</td>\n<td>Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>UV light</p>\n<p>Chemicals</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Bulky adducts</p>\n<p>Pyrimidine dimers</p>\n</td>\n<td>Nucleotide excision repair (NER)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Oxygen radicals</p>\n<p>Hydrolysis&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alkylating agents</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Abasic sites single-strand breaks</p>\n<p>8-oxoguanine lesions</p>\n</td>\n<td>Base excision repair (BER)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Replication errors</td>\n<td>\n<p>Bases mismatch</p>\n<p>Insertions</p>\n<p>Deletions</p>\n</td>\n<td>Mismatch repair (MMR)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

The <strong>secretion</strong> of<strong> protons</strong> by an activated <strong>H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase</strong> (proton pump) in the <strong>parietal cells</strong> into the gastric lumen is the <strong>final step</strong> involved in the production of<strong> gastric acid</strong> and inhibition of this enzyme prevents acid secretion into the stomach.</p>\n<p>Once PPIs irreversibly inactivate the H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, acid secretion resumes only after new pump molecules are synthesized and inserted into the luminal membrane. This leads to <strong>prolonged suppression of acid secretion</strong> for up to 24-48 hours, despite having a shorter plasma half-life of only 30 minutes to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>In most individuals, once-daily dosing is enough to achieve effective acid inhibition. If necessary, a second dose can be given before an evening meal.</p>\n<p>The number of H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump molecules increases after fasting and food decreases the oral bioavailability of the drug. Hence, PPIs are given around 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.</p>\n<p>PPIs <strong>cannot inhibit</strong> all gastric acid pumps with oral dosing because <strong>not all pumps are active</strong> during the short half-life of the PPI in the blood. </p>\n<p>PPIs cause maximum suppression of gastric acid. They reduce the daily production of <strong>both basal</strong> and <strong>stimulated acid secretion</strong> by 85–90%. <br /><br />There are available in the form of <strong>delayed-release</strong> tablets, capsules, and oral suspension packets and for immediate acid suppression, there are <strong>intravenous formulations</strong> for PPIs like lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole. Therefore, the <strong>release of the drug</strong> depends upon the drug <strong>formulation.</strong></p>",

It is most commonly seen in the age group of <strong>4-8 years</strong>. The incidence is more in <strong>boys</strong> than girls. It is usually a unilateral disease but can occur bilaterally in 10% of the cases.

The lateral epiphyseal artery, a branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery is involved. Over time, healing and fibrosis occur by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and weakening of the femoral head. </p>\n<p>Clinical features include limping and hip pain, which aggravates with activity and is relieved by rest. Examination reveals <strong>pain on passive movement</strong> of the hip and <strong>abduction with internal rotation</strong> movement is limited. Children can also present with referred knee pain.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Sodium-Iodide (Na-I) symporter</strong> in the thyrocytes is an example of <strong>secondary active transport</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Secondary active transport</strong> is a type of active transport where a <strong>primary active transport</strong> mechanism creates a <strong>difference in ionic concentrations</strong> across the cell membrane. This difference in concentration acts as a <strong>driving force</strong> for the movement of <strong>other ions</strong> across the membrane.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">An example of this mechanism is the&nbsp;<strong>Na-I symporter</strong>&nbsp;in the <strong>thyroid gland</strong>&nbsp;which is responsible for <strong>iodine uptake</strong> into the<strong> follicular cells</strong> of the thyroid. It is mainly present in the&nbsp;<strong>basolateral membranes</strong>&nbsp;of the thyrocytes. It transports two Na<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;ions and one I<sup>-</sup>&nbsp;ion into the cell against the concentration gradient. The energy for this transport is derived from the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;ATPase pump.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;ATPase</strong> pumps sodium outside the cell and causes <strong>low intracellular sodium</strong> concentration. This causes <strong>sodium</strong> to enter the cell by <strong>facilitated diffusion</strong>. Along with sodium, <strong>iodide ions</strong> also enter the cell via the&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Na-I symporter</strong>. Since the energy to transport sodium and iodide ions in Na-I symporter is derived from Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;ATPase pump, this is called&nbsp;<strong>secondary active transport.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A. <strong>GLUT transporters in the enterocytes</strong> are examples of <strong>facilitated diffusion</strong>. The molecules are transported via&nbsp;<strong>carrier-mediated</strong>&nbsp;proteins along the concentration gradient. This transport does not require energy.</p>\n<p>Option B. <strong>Movement of oxygen</strong> across cell membranes in our body is an example of <strong>simple diffusion</strong>.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<strong>simple diffusion</strong>,&nbsp;the molecules pass directly through the cell membrane along the concentration gradient. It does not require energy and is&nbsp;<strong>not carrier-mediated</strong>. Examples include the movement of&nbsp;<strong>water, carbon dioxide,&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;nitrogen&nbsp;</strong>across the cell membrane.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D. <strong>Proton pumps in the gastric glands of the stomach</strong> are examples of <strong>primary active transport.</strong> Primary active transport obtains energy from the<strong>&nbsp;hydrolysis&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>ATP</strong>&nbsp;to transport molecules against an electrochemical gradient.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Characteristics of different types of transport</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Simple diffusion</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Facilitated diffusion</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Primary active transport</strong></td>\n<td>Secondary active transport <strong>Cotransport</strong></td>\n<td>Secondary active transport <strong>Countertransport</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Electrochemical gradient</td>\n<td>Downhill</td>\n<td>Downhill</td>\n<td>Uphill</td>\n<td>Uphill</td>\n<td>Uphill</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carrier mediated</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metabolic energy</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Indirect</td>\n<td>Indirect</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Na<sup>+</sup> gradient</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>--</td>\n<td>Yes (same direction)</td>\n<td>Yes (opposite direction)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Inhibits Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> pump</p>\n&nbsp;</td>\n<td>--</td>\n<td>--</td>\n<td>Inhibits</td>\n<td>Inhibits</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Inhibits</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Characteristics of Carrier Mediated Transport</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Properties</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stereospecificity</td>\n<td>For example- D-Glucose is transport by facilitated diffusion but not L-isomer.
