This occurs due to the reduced activity of the ALA synthetase enzyme.</li>\n<li> <strong>Secondary Acquired</strong> - may occur secondary to -\n<ul>\n<li>Drugs, chemicals, and toxins - <strong>isoniazid </strong>(as in this case), alcohol, and lead.</li>\n<li>Hematological disorders - myelofibrosis, acute leukemia, lymphoma, and hemolytic anemia.</li>\n<li>Miscellaneous - inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Peripheral smear in sideroblastic anemia shows hypochromic microcytic (sometimes normocytic) anemia. <strong>MCH </strong>and<strong> MCV</strong> are <strong>reduced</strong> in the hereditary type, and MCV may be raised in the acquired type.

It is calculated by the formula <strong>1-β</strong> where β is called <strong>Type II error</strong>. Type II error refers to <strong>rejecting the alternative (or experimental) hypothesis</strong> when it is true in reality i.e. <strong>false-negative error</strong>. </p>\n<p>Factors that <strong>increase </strong>the power of a study:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing <strong>p</strong> <strong>value or probability value </strong>(from 0.05 to 0.1). This increases the chance obtaining a statistically significant result (rejecting the null hypothesis) when the null hypothesis is actually false. So, it <strong>reduces</strong> the risk of a <strong>type II error</strong> (false negative error). However, this would also result in an increase in the type I error (alpha error or false-positive error).</li>\n<li>A larger <strong>size of the difference</strong> between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean (this is known as the <strong>effect size</strong>). For example, a difference between a hypothesized population mean IQ of 135 and a sample mean IQ of 100 would be detected much more easily (and hence the null hypothesis would be rejected more easily - power of study) than a difference between a hypothesized IQ of 135 and a sample mean IQ of 128. </li>\n<li><strong>Decreasing sampling error. </strong>The <strong>precision</strong> with which the data are measured also influences statistical power. Power can often be improved by reducing the measurement error in the data.</li>\n<li><strong>Increasing sample size.</strong> Increasing sample size is another way of boosting power of a test. This occurs because the effect size is easier to detect as the sample size increases. A large-scale study is more likely to detect a <strong>false null hypothesis</strong> (particularly if the effect size is small) than is a small-scale study. For example, if a coin is tossed 1,000 times, resulting in 600 heads and 400 tails (effect size 200), it is much easier to reject the null hypothesis (that the coin is a fair one) than if the coin is tossed 10 times and 6 heads and 4 tails are obtained (effect size 2).</li>\n</ul>",

It binds with <strong>high affinity</strong> to the serotonin reuptake site <strong>but not</strong> to the norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake site. As a result, vilazodone <strong>potently</strong> and <strong>selectively inhibits</strong> the reuptake of serotonin.</p>\n<p>Vilazodone is also a <strong>partial agonist</strong> at serotonergic <strong>5-HT<sub>1A</sub></strong> receptors. The result of this activity on serotonergic transmission also plays a role in its antidepressant effect.</p>\n<p>Thus it offers a <strong>novel</strong> combination of <strong>selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI)</strong> and serotonergic (<strong>5-HT<sub>1A</sub></strong>) receptor <strong>partial agonist</strong> activity. Because of these characteristics, vilazodone has been termed a serotonin partial agonist–reuptake inhibitor (<strong>SPARI</strong>).</p>\n<p>Vilazodone is never combined with a <strong>monoamine oxidase</strong> (<strong>MAO</strong>) inhibitor or given within <strong>14 days</strong> of discontinuing or initiating MAO inhibitor therapy due to the serious risk of <strong>serotonin toxicity</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Lurasidone </strong>is a second-generation antipsychotic that is a <strong>5-HT<sub>2A </sub></strong>and <strong>D</strong><sub><strong>2</strong> </sub>receptor antagonist. it is used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression (as monotherapy or as an adjunct).</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Asenapine </strong>is a second-generation antipsychotic which is also a <strong>5-HT<sub>2A </sub></strong>and <strong>D</strong><sub><strong>2</strong> </sub>receptor antagonist, used in the management of schizophrenia and acute mania.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Blonanserin</strong> is a second-generation antipsychotic, which acts as an antagonist at <strong>D<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>D<sub>3</sub></strong>, and <strong>5-HT<sub>2A</sub></strong> receptors.

The most probable ligament injured is the <strong>anterior talofibular ligament </strong>(marked as 1).</p>\n<p>Ankle sprains are common in pedestrians and country walkers<strong> </strong>who stumble on stairways, pavements, and potholes. In the majority of the cases, it is the<strong> lateral ligament complex </strong>that is injured, in particular the <strong>anterior talofibular</strong> followed by the <strong>calcaneofibular ligaments</strong>(marked as 2)<strong>.</strong> <strong>Medial ligament injuries</strong> are usually associated with a <strong>fracture or joint injury</strong>.</p>\n<p>The anterior talo-fibular ligament (ATFL) during <strong>plantarflexion</strong>, changes its orientation from horizontal to vertical with respect to the floor. Thus the ligament gets stretched and vulnerable to injury. On slipping off a pavement or into a pothole the foot gets plantar-flexed and inverted predisposing the ATFL to injury.</p>\n<p>The lateral collateral ligaments consist of the <strong>anterior talofibular</strong>, the<strong> posterior talofibular, </strong>and (between them) the <strong>calcaneofibular ligaments</strong>. The <strong>calcaneofibular ligament</strong> runs from the tip of the lateral malleolus to the posterolateral part of the calcaneum and, therefore helps to <strong>stabilize the subtalar joint</strong>. The <strong>posterior talofibular ligament</strong> runs from the posterior border of the lateral malleolus to the posterior part of the talus.</p>\n<p>The medial collateral (<strong>deltoid</strong>) ligament consists of <strong>superficial </strong>and<strong> deep portions.</strong> The superficial fibers spread like a fan from the medial malleolus anteriorly to the navicular and inferiorly to the calcaneum and talus. Its chief function is to <strong>resist </strong>the<strong> eversion of the hindfoot</strong>. </p>\n<p>The deep portion is intra-articular, running directly from the medial malleolus to the medial surface of the talus.

It is also associated with <strong>systemic diseases</strong> like gout, rosacea, psoriasis and connective tissue diseases.</p>\n<p>Episcleritis is characterized by <strong>redness</strong>, and mild ocular discomfort described as a gritty, burning, or foreign body sensation.</p>\n<p>Clinically, two types of presentations may occur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simple episcleritis</strong> is characterized by sectorial or <strong>diffuse</strong> <strong>inflammation</strong> of the episclera. The image given below shows diffuse episcleritis:</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/124223869db14898939ab564a50d98b2x964x738.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Nodular episcleritis</strong> is characterized by a <strong>pink</strong> or<strong> purple flat nodule</strong> surrounded by <strong>erythema</strong>, usually situated 2-3 mm away from the limbus. The nodule is firm, and tender and can be moved separately from the sclera, and the overlying conjunctiva also moves freely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment includes topical NSAIDs, corticosteroid eye drops, cold compress, and artificial tears. In recurrent cases, systemic NSAIDs are used.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Tenon's cyst</strong> or conjunctival inclusion cyst is a benign condition filled with <strong>serous fluid</strong> and slimy mucous secretions of congenital or acquired origin. Acquired cysts can occur following strabismus <strong>surgery,</strong> pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, and Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion. The patient presents with swelling near the <strong>limbus</strong> with <strong>no pain</strong> or redness. The consistency is cystic to firm, non-tender with no mobility suggesting that the cyst is adherent to the underlying scleral tissue. The image of Tenon's cyst is given below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/56a474afb5a744cb9683c02aa2847bc9x960x738.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D: <strong>Scleritis</strong> refers to an <strong>inflammation</strong> of the <strong>sclera proper</strong>. It usually occurs in <strong>elderly</strong> patients (40-70 years) involving <strong>females</strong> more than males. It is frequently associated with an underlying systemic inflammatory condition. The patient presents with moderate to severe pain, redness, lacrimation, photophobia, and diminution of vision.</p>",

The <strong>contrast agents</strong> used for <strong>MRI</strong> are <strong>gadolinium</strong> and <strong>USPIO </strong>(Ultra-Small Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide) which are paramagnetic substances which can change the local magnetic field. </p>\n<p>Gadolinium acts by reducing both <strong>T1 </strong>and <strong>T2 </strong>relaxation time of the tissue. The predominant effect is on T1, so post-contrast is a T1 weighted image. Since free gadolinium ion is <strong>toxic</strong>, Gd-DTPA (Gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) is used. Gadolinium does not cross the <strong>blood-brain barrier</strong> unless the barrier is disrupted. </p>\n<p>Contraindications for Gadolinium:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Renal failure </strong>- Gd-DTPA is predominantly excreted through the kidney. Hence, in renal failure, it gets accumulated in the body and releases gadolinium ions. Since the ion is toxic, the body tries to contain it by fibrosis resulting in multisystem painful fibrosis called <strong>nephrogenic systemic fibrosis</strong>. As a result, gadolinium-containing contrast is contraindicated in patients with an estimated GFR under 60 ml/min and especially under 30 ml/min.</li>\n<li><strong>Pregnancy </strong>- Due to the risk of teratogenicity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gadobutrol </strong>(gadolinium-based contrast agent) is the first and only contrast agent approved by the FDA for the use of cardiac MRI in adult patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.</p>\n<p><strong>USPIO </strong>is a T2 agent and is usually taken by cells of the <strong>reticuloendothelial system</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Gastrografin</strong> and <strong>Iohexol</strong> are <strong>iodinated </strong>contrast agents. They cannot be used for MRI as iodine does not have magnetic or paramagnetic properties. Iohexol is used as an intravascular contrast medium for radiography such as CT scans and in the diagnostic work-up of esophageal perforation. Gastrografin is used for radiographic examination of the gastrointestinal tract. It is taken orally or administered as an enema. </p>\n<p><strong>Levovist</strong> is an <strong>ultrasound contrast</strong> agent.

      "solution": "<p>A bipolar cautery acts by the <strong>spread of current from one blade to the other,</strong> thus completing the circuit. Hence, there will <strong>not be any lateral spread</strong> of the energy or current through the body as with monopolar cautery, making it <strong>preferrable in those patients with cardiac pacemakers.</strong></p>\n<p>In monopolar cautery, there will be lateral spread of current because of a single blade and hence the energy has to travel through the body to complete the circuit. This will <strong>interfere with the conduction </strong>of pacemakers. Also, the heart will be shocked repeatedly by the pacemaker because of the abnormal rhythm caused by the cautery. Hence, monopolar cautery is avoided in such cases.</p><p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option B : Bipolar cautery can <strong>only be used for coagulation</strong> as opposed to monopolar cautery, which can be used for both cutting and coagulation</p>\n<p>Option C : The current in bipolar cautery starts from the machine and travels from one blade to another while coagulating to finally renter the machine, thus closing the circuit. Hence,<strong> a seperate cautery pad is not needed.</strong> But in a monopolar cautery, it is mandatory becuase the current starts from the machine, reaches the tip (pencil/bovie) to cut/coagulate, travels through the body to reach the cautery pad and finally reenters the machine to close the circuit.</p>\n<p>Option D : Monopolar cautery has a narrow pedicle, hence energy given through it will cause channeling of current to the base causing b<strong>urns at the base</strong>. Hence, in surgeries where there are <strong>end arteries (ear lobule) or in circumcision/penile surgeries </strong>monopolar cautery is avoided</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Diathermy/Cautery:</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Features</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Monopolar</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Bipolar</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow of current</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cautery pencil &ndash;&gt; tissue &ndash;&gt; cautery pad &ndash;&gt; machine/ground</p>\n<p>Hence <strong>more</strong> chance of burns</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Only between tips of the instrument</p>\n<p>Hence <strong>less</strong> chance of burns</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modes</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Cutting</strong> &ndash; Low voltage, high amplitude, continuous waveforms</p>\n<p><strong>Coagulation</strong> &ndash; Alternate waveforms (Bursts)</p>\n<p><strong>Dessication</strong> &ndash; Low power</p>\n<p><strong> Fulguration</strong> &ndash; High power</p>\n</td>\n<td>Only coagulation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dissipation</td>\n<td>\n<p>More thermal dissipation of current</p>\n<p>Hence can cause <strong>damage</strong> to nerves and other vital structures</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Less lateral dissipation of current</p>\n<p>Hence<strong> safer</strong> in procedures closer to vital structures</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1a2ad85d0c4b467ba6f98641c22ef684x554x1180.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",
