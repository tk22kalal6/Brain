The glycogen stores are sufficient for around 18 hours after a meal following which they start to deplete. So the source of blood glucose in a person fasting for 11 hours will be liver glycogenolysis.<br /><br />Second stage of fasting:&nbsp;<strong>Gluconeogenesis</strong> begins 4&ndash;6 hours after the last meal but becomes fully active only after stores of liver glycogen are depleted<strong> (after 18 hours)</strong>.

The investigation of choice to evaluate for renal scarring in reflux nephropathy is the <strong>Tc-99m DMSA </strong>(dimercaptosuccinic acid) scan.</p>\n<p>It is used in renal imaging to evaluate renal <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>morphology</strong>, particularly in paediatric imaging for the detection of scarring and pyelonephritis. DMSA is an ideal agent for the assessment of the <strong>renal cortex</strong> as it binds within the <strong>proximal tubules</strong> of the cortex with longer retention than other agents.</p>\n<p>It allows a better assessment of differential renal function.
