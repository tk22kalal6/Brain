These antibodies cause damage to the postsynaptic muscle membrane and increased endocytosis of the AChR. This autoimmune response against the AChR is mediated by the thymus. The myoid (muscle-like) cells present in the thymus express AChRs on their surface and are postulated to provide the autoantigen that triggers this autoimmune reaction. There is some <strong>thymic abnormality in most patients</strong> with MG. <strong>Thymic hyperplasia</strong> is seen in <strong>65%</strong> of the patients, and <strong>thymomas</strong> are seen in<strong> 10%</strong> of the patients. Thymoma is seen as an enlargement of the thymus in the <strong>anterior mediastinum</strong> on CT chest.</p>\n<p>MG usually occurs in females in their 20s and 30s.  Patients usually present with <strong>weakness</strong> and <strong>fatiguability</strong> of the muscles, which <strong>increases on repeated use</strong> or <strong>late in the day</strong> and improves on rest.

Early features of scurvy consist of irritability, loss of appetite, and musculoskeletal pain. There may be associated <strong>developmental delay</strong> with <strong>failure to thrive</strong>.</p>\n<p>The above signs and symptoms are followed by <strong>leg swelling, </strong>most commonly at the <strong>knees</strong> and <strong>ankles</strong>,<strong> </strong>with associated <strong>pseudoparalysis</strong>. A “<strong>scorbutic rosary</strong>” (sharp and tender beads) at the <strong>costochondral junctions</strong> is another typical feature. Features of bleeding include petechiae, purpura, epistaxis, gum bleeding, and the characteristic <strong>perifollicular hemorrhages</strong>. </p>\n<p>The diagnosis is typically based on the <strong>clinical </strong>picture, dietary history, and <strong>typical radiographic changes</strong> at the <strong>distal ends </strong>of the <strong>long bones</strong>, particularly the <strong>knees</strong>. The <strong>white line</strong> of <strong>Fränkel </strong>is an irregular but thickened white line at the metaphysis, representing the zone of <strong>well-calcified cartilage</strong>.</p>\n<p>A more specific but late radiologic feature is a <strong>zone </strong>of <strong>radiolucence </strong>under the white line at the metaphysis, which is described as the <strong>Trümmerfeld </strong><strong>zone</strong>.

Dietary modification is necessary for long-term prevention. </p>\n<p>Other options:<br /><br />Option A: <strong>Vitamin D supplementation </strong>is the first line of treatment in children with <strong>rickets</strong>. Daily treatment with oral Vitamin D preparations is recommended, as daily supplementation is more physiological. The duration of treatment is at least 12 weeks.

Hemophilia A can cause<strong> swelling </strong>of the <strong>knee joints</strong> due to hemarthrosis and hemophilic arthritis.

In <strong>emphysema</strong>, the <strong>destruction</strong> of <strong>alveoli</strong> and airspace enlargement <strong>reduces</strong> the <strong>surface area </strong>available for gas exchange, leading to a <strong>decreased DLCO</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Emphysema</strong> is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease commonly seen in patients who are between 50–75 years of age with <strong>dyspnea</strong> being severe very early in the disease, and late-onset cough with scanty sputum. They are often referred to as <strong>\"pink puffers\"</strong> due to their typical thin non-cyanotic (pink) appearance with severe dyspnea even at rest. </p>\n<p>Emphysema occurs due to <strong>irreversible dilatation</strong> and <strong>destruction</strong> of airspace walls distal to <strong>terminal bronchioles</strong>.

The examiner uses one hand to hold the lower thigh and the other to grasp the upper part of the leg. The joint surfaces are then shifted backward and forwards upon each other. Any abnormal movement observed during this test may indicate a potential anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f5e63b6c70c94bacba32a1f42860ceb4x512x384.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />Meniscal injuries are common injuries seen in <strong>athletes</strong> who play <strong>sports</strong> like football and volleyball. <strong>Medial meniscal</strong> injury is more common(less mobile) than lateral meniscal injury(more mobile). The mechanism of the injury is a <strong>rotational force</strong> on <strong>semi flexed</strong> knee. The patient gives a history of pain and locking of the knee while walking or playing.</p>\n<p>The following tests are done during the diagnosis of a meniscal tear: </p>\n<p><strong>Apley's</strong> test: This test is done with the patient prone, the knee is flexed to 90  degrees and rotated while a compression force is applied, which is called the grinding test. This reproduces symptoms if a meniscus is torn. Rotation is then repeated while the leg is pulled upwards by the doctor, holding the thigh down, which is called the distraction test. This produces increased pain only if there is ligament damage.(Option C)</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b85c2139c3894b4f91bdcec9f13b7143x1279x1060.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong><br />McMurray's test</strong>:<strong> </strong>The patient is positioned in a supine posture with the knee fully flexed. The knee joint is stabilized and palpated using one hand, while the other hand is utilized to internally and externally rotate the leg. Gradual extension of the leg is performed during this examination. If there is any detectable clicking sensation or sound, it may indicate a meniscal injury.

While being supported by the examiner, the patient bears their full weight on that leg. They are then instructed to twist their body to one side and then the other, repeating this movement three times, while maintaining the knee flexed at 20 degrees. Individuals with meniscal tears may feel pain along the medial or lateral joint line and may also sense a locking sensation in the knee.

      "solution": "<p>This patient with episodes of <strong>sudden unprovoked aggression</strong> and <strong>violent behavior</strong> with <strong>subsequent remorse</strong> and <strong>embarrassment</strong> is likely to have <strong>intermittent explosive disorder.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Intermittent explosive disorder </strong>(IED) is characterized by discrete episodes of losing control of aggressive impulses which can result in physical assault or destruction of property. The aggressiveness is <strong>out</strong> of <strong>proportion</strong> to triggers and remits spontaneously. After each episode, patients <strong>express regret,</strong> and aggressiveness is absent between episodes. </p>\n<p>These episodes are <strong>not premeditated</strong> and cause <strong>distress</strong> or <strong>impairment</strong> in <strong>functioning,</strong> features that <strong>align</strong> with the <strong>patient's presentation.</strong> This diagnosis is supported by the <strong>absence</strong> of any <strong>provocation,</strong> the <strong>episodic</strong> nature of the aggression, the <strong>lack</strong> of <strong>substance</strong> abuse, and the remorse expressed by the patient.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Antisocial</strong> Personality Disorder: This condition is characterized by a <strong>long-term</strong> pattern of <strong>manipulation, exploitation,</strong> or <strong>violation</strong> of others' rights. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder tend to show no regard for right or wrong and often disregard the feelings, rights, and safety of others. While <strong>aggression</strong> can be a feature of antisocial personality disorder, the episodic and remorseful nature of the aggression described in the question is more characteristic of intermittent explosive disorder.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Borderline</strong> Personality Disorder: This disorder is marked by a <strong>pervasive</strong> pattern of <strong>instability</strong> in <strong>relationships, self-image,</strong> and emotions. People with borderline personality disorder may experience intense episodes of anger, depression, and anxiety that can last from a few hours to days. Although impulsive aggression can occur, the violence described in the vignette lacks the <strong>relational context</strong> and <strong>emotional swings</strong> typically associated with borderline personality disorder.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder:</strong> This diagnosis is primarily applied to <strong>children</strong> and <strong>adolescents</strong> (up to age 18) who exhibit <strong>persistent irritability</strong> and frequent episodes of extreme, out-of-control behavior. The patient's age and the specific nature of his episodes—sudden, violent outbursts followed by remorse—do not align with the chronic irritability and temper outbursts across contexts typical of DMDD.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Personality Disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Key features of Personality disorders</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Cluster A (Odd, Weird, Eccentric)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Paranoid</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Suspicious, distrustful, hypervigilant</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Schizoid</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Prefers to be loner, detached, unemotional</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Schizotypal</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Eccentric &amp; odd thoughts, perceptions &amp; behavior, magical thinking and beliefs</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Cluster B (Dramatic, Emotional and Erratic)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Antisocial</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Disregard for and violation of rights of others, illegal activities</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Borderline</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Chaotic relationships, sensitivity to abandonment, labile mood, impulsivity, inner emptiness, self-harm</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Histrionic</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Dramatic, superficial, attention-seeking</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Narcissistic</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Grandiosity, lack of empathy</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Cluster C (Anxious, Fearful, Introvert)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Avoidant</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Avoidance due to fears of criticism and rejection</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Dependent</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Submissive, clingy, needs to be taken care of</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Obsessive-compulsive/</span></div>\n<div><span>Anankastic</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Rigid, controlling, perfectionist</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It is life-threatening and requires emergency intervention.</p>\n<p>It is characterized by <strong>chest pain, tachypnoea,</strong> acute <strong>dyspnea,</strong> and sudden onset <strong>hemodynamic compromise</strong> (tachycardia, hypotension, low O2 saturation, loss of consciousness) occasionally. </p>\n<p><strong>Initial management</strong> of open pneumothorax with a sucking wound involves closing the defect with a <strong>sterile occlusive plastic dressing</strong> (e.g., OPSITE), <strong>taped</strong> on <strong>three sides</strong> to function as a <strong>flutter valve,</strong> followed by <strong>chest tube</strong> insertion as soon as possible at a site <strong>remote</strong> from the <strong>injury.</strong> Taping only on three sides creates a dependent opening that lets air and blood out while keeping more air from entering.</p>\n<p>Taping on all <strong>4 sides</strong> would worsen this patient’s condition as it leads to an <strong>accumulation</strong> of air in the thoracic cavity, progressing him to develop tension <strong>pneumothorax</strong> (Option B).</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Needle thoracocentesis</strong> is usually performed emergently in those with tension <strong>pneumothorax</strong> to release the trapped air. A case of <strong>open pneumothorax</strong> can transform into a <strong>tension pneumothorax</strong> in due time, but initially, the air pressure is equal and needs a different treatment plan. The wound must be taped to prevent the progression to a tension pneumothorax.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Surgical exploration</strong> of the wound is done only after initial stabilization and further evaluation to rule out other life-threatening injuries.</p>",

The most common <strong>spontaneous cause</strong> of SAH is the <strong>rupture of</strong> <strong>berry aneurysms</strong>.</p>\n<p>Clinically presents as&nbsp;a <strong>thunderclap headache</strong> (often described by patients as the worst headache of life), neck rigidity, transient loss of consciousness, and no focal neurological deficits. SAH can mostly present with&nbsp;<strong>fever, positive Kernig&rsquo;s sign and Brudzinski&rsquo;s sign,</strong> as well as mimic meningitis or encephalitis.</p>\n<p>Although sudden headache in the absence of focal neurological symptoms is the hallmark of aneurysmal rupture, focal neurological deficits may occur.</p>\n<p>A painful third nerve palsy is typically the result of compression from a posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Intraocular hemorrhages, classically subhyaloid, may be visible on fundoscopy. The combination of SAH and vitreous hemorrhage is known as&nbsp;<strong>Terson&rsquo;s Syndrome.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>&nbsp;- <strong>Non-contrast CT</strong> head shows <strong>hyperdensity</strong> in the subarachnoid space/ basal cistern, and <strong>lumbar puncture</strong> shows <strong>xanthochromia</strong>. Xanthochromia refers to the <strong>yellowish appearance</strong> of CSF. In a lumbar puncture, a traumatic tap can be confused with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as both show blood in the CSF withdrawn. CT angiography has a high sensitivity for aneurysms and AVMs, but&nbsp;<strong>digital subtraction angiography</strong>&nbsp;remains the&nbsp;<strong>gold standard.</strong></p>\n<p>The treatment of choice for&nbsp;<strong>subarachnoid hemorrhage (</strong><strong>SAH)</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>surgical clipping.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Nimodipine</strong>&nbsp;is indicated to<strong>&nbsp;relieve a neurological deficit</strong>&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;<strong>secondary to cerebral vasospasm</strong>&nbsp;following subarachnoid hemorrhage.

It is lipid-soluble and has a high affinity for cerebral blood vessels and appears to reduce morbidity after subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In patients with symptomatic vasospasm, <strong>triple H therapy</strong> is&nbsp;added as part of the therapeutic regimen. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Induced hypertension</strong>- with vasopressors to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).</li>\n<li><strong>Hypervolemia</strong>- to maintain the circulatory blood volume&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Hemodilution</strong>- accompanying change due to fluid therapy.</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types of Intracranial Hemorrhage</h3><p><strong>1.
