In this case, the presence of<strong> asymmetric bilateral loss</strong> of sensation in the <strong>lateral three digits</strong> indicates a compression at the<strong> C5/6 nerve root.</strong> In most cases, it is unilateral but can occur bilaterally.</p>\n<p>The X-ray may show <strong>osteophytes</strong> and <strong>degenerative</strong> changes on Lateral view.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/93e298f3f3a149199d93423aaa83c6cax1280x1354.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conservative treatment with analgesics, physiotherapy, and the cervical collar is the mainstay</li>\n<li>Operative treatments performed include:\n<ul>\n<li>Anterior discectomy and fusion</li>\n<li>Foraminotomy&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Intervertebral disc replacement</li>\n<li>Laminoplasty</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Nerve entrapments</strong> can also present with pain and paresthesias but symptoms are worse at night and follow a particular peripheral nerve rather than a nerve root distribution.

The affected leg is then passively and slowly raised by the ankle with the knee fully extended. The examiner stops further leg elevation when pain is elicited. Normally it should be possible to raise the limb to 80&ndash;90 degrees. The SLRT test is positive if the patient develops pain when the leg is between 30 and 60/70 degrees from horizontal. The pain should be radicular type and radiating to the back of the thigh or to the calf.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/21c521e2b1604f82adf915631ce0d66cx1279x1414.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2. Bragard test&nbsp;(or Sciatic stretch test or Flip test)</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Perform SLRT. At the point where the patient experiences discomfort, the leg is lowered a little. The stretching and pain become less. At this angle, the&nbsp;<strong>ankle is passively dorsiflexed</strong>. If the pain at the back of the thigh or in the calf is felt again, the test is positive. This is also called reinforcement positive or Bragard&rsquo;s sign positive</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2620078ca3e04edc864dd89596ac463dx1280x1375.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>3. Crossed SLRT (</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;well-leg raising test&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;Fajersztajn sign)</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When SLRT is performed on the unaffected side, the patient may feel pain on the affected side. This is termed a contralateral positive SLRT or crossed SLRT positive. It is a very specific sign of root compression. It becomes positive usually when there is severe compression due to a centrally located prolapse.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4. Bowstring sign</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>popliteal compression test</strong>)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The &lsquo;bowstring sign&rsquo; is even more specific for disc prolapse than SLRT. Perform SLRT until the patient experiences sciatic pain. Without reducing the amount of lift, bend the knee so as to relax the sciatic nerve&nbsp;<strong>(Buckling sign)</strong>. Buttock pain is immediately relieved.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>The examiner then presses the popliteal fossa to stretch the lateral popliteal nerve behind the lateral tibial condyle.

All this points toward a diagnosis of <strong>Gilbert syndrome</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Gilbert syndrome</strong> is a <strong>benign</strong>, familial disorder characterized by<strong>&nbsp;mild intermittent jaundice&nbsp;</strong>usually seen <strong>during stress, fatigue, or alcohol use</strong>. The condition is recognized to arise from a mutation in the promoter region of the <em>UGT1A1</em>&nbsp;gene, which results in <strong>mildly decreased UDP-glucuronyltransferase production</strong>. This causes a reduction in the liver's ability to conjugate bilirubin, thus causing <strong>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong>.

It preferentially&nbsp;<strong>affects pigmented hair</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>spares non-pigmented or white hair</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Spontaneous remission</strong>&nbsp;occurs in a majority of patients with hair loss that is patchy and is of shorter duration.&nbsp;<strong>Topical steroids</strong>&nbsp;like<strong>&nbsp;clobetasol</strong> can be useful in patchy alopecia areata. Intralesional steroids are the most effective treatment for patchy alopecia areata. Severe and long-standing alopecia areata require oral <strong>corticosteroids.</strong></p>\n<p>The image below shows a clinical picture of alopecia areata with a patch of alopecia with a smooth surface of the scalp-</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0e228debbfce427888f6ce363b09fc50x1280x1453.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/54b5ece57aeb45df96f5390e8f9a8744x1279x1458.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of scarring and non-scarring alopecia- Mnemonic</h3><p>Alopecia or hair loss can be classified as :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Non-Scarring/Non-Cicatricial alopecia</li>\n<li>Scarring/Cicatricial alopecia&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Mnemonic</strong> for causes of<strong> non-scarring </strong>alopecia<strong>: THATS STD!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>T</strong>inea capitis(Non-Inflammatory Type&nbsp;

After some time, the organisms rapidly become gram-negative and tend to lyse spontaneously. This <strong>autolysis</strong> of pneumococci is greatly enhanced by <strong>surface-active agents</strong>, such as ox bile (10%) or sodium deoxycholate (2%).</p>\n<p>Pneumococci are alpha-hemolytic on blood agar, and this is seen as <strong>greening</strong> of agar around the colonies.

The triad includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Symptoms of<strong>&nbsp;hypoglycemia after fasting or exercise</strong></li>\n<li>Plasma glucose levels<strong>&nbsp;&lt;2.8 mmol/L or 50 mg/dL.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Relief</strong>&nbsp;of symptoms after&nbsp;<strong>intravenous administration of glucose</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This triad can occur in insulinomas and in patients using insulin or insulin secretagogues surreptitiously.</p>\n<p>This patient has had <strong>repeated doctor</strong> visits for <strong>similar</strong> symptoms. This coupled with the history of <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong> in her father allows access to <strong>sulfonylureas</strong>. This patient has likely been taking sulfonylureas to reproduce these symptoms to assume the sick role. Besides this, <strong>insulinomas</strong> are <strong>highly unlikely</strong> in a patient less than <strong>40 years</strong> of age.</p>\n<p>Treatment is with <strong>psychotherapy</strong> and consults with the same physician to prevent unnecessary testing.</p>\n<p>Factitious disorder vs malingering: <strong>Factitious disorder</strong> is an <strong>intentional</strong> production of physical symptoms to obtain <strong>medical attention</strong> whereas <strong>malingering</strong> is an&nbsp;<strong>intentional production of symptoms</strong> and they hold a <strong>motive </strong>behind it.</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Serum <strong>TSH</strong> can be used in cases of suspected abuse of <strong>thyroid hormone </strong>supplements. This patient's symptoms are more likely due to <strong>sulfonylurea</strong> use</p>\n<p>Option B: CT of the abdomen can be used in cases of suspected <strong>insulinomas</strong>. This patient's presentation is more likely due to the abuse of sulfonylureas.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>MRI</strong> of the brain is done in evaluation of <strong>headaches</strong> to look for space-occupying lesions. However this patient's episodic dizziness and weakness make this unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: The reason why C peptide levels are higher than insulin is due to the different mechanism of metabolism. Insulin is metabolised by the liver at a faster pace while C peptide is excreted by the kidneys at a slower pace. Hence in surreptitious use of secretagogues, the ratio is reduced.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, note that the most likely answer considering all the factors of the presentation needs to be chosen. Here, considering the age and other factors, serum sulfonylurea screening is the best suited next step.</p>",
