      "solution": "<p>The patient with a <strong>headache</strong> that occurs at the <strong>same time</strong> everyday with associated <strong>autonomic symptoms</strong> occuring in <strong>clusters</strong> is consistent with <strong>cluster headaches. Verapamil</strong> is the <strong>best prophylactic</strong> treatment for cluster headaches to reduce the frequency and severity of cluster headaches.</p>\n<p>Cluster headache is characterized by severe, <strong>one-sided headaches</strong> that occur in clusters, often associated with <strong>autonomic symptoms,</strong> such as <strong>tearing, redness</strong> <strong>of the eye</strong>, <strong>runny nose</strong> and <strong>unilateral headache</strong> that typically lasts between <strong>15 to 180 minutes. </strong>The important feature of this headache is <strong>periodicity.</strong> At least one of the daily attacks of pain recurs at the same hour each day. It is also associated with autonomic features, such as unilateral lacrimation and rhinorrhea. Occasionally features of Horner's syndrome may be seen. </p>\n<p>The typical cluster headache patient has daily bouts of one to two attacks of relatively short-duration unilateral pain for <strong>8–10 weeks a yea</strong>r; this is usually followed by a <strong>pain-free interval </strong>that averages a little <strong>less than 1 year.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Verapamil,</strong> which is a <strong>calcium channel block </strong>is the drug of choice for the long term prophylaxis of cluster headaches. </p>\n<p>For aborting an acute attack of cluster headache, <strong>subcutaneous sumatriptan</strong> (6 mg), a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist, is most effective. <strong>High-flow oxygen</strong> is also effective in the management of an acute attack. <strong>100% oxygen </strong>at <strong>10–12 L/min</strong> for <strong>15–20 min</strong> is required as treatment. If injectable sumatriptan is unavailable, then high-flow oxygen is the next best treatment option (Option B).</p>\n<p>Other options:<br />Options C and D: <strong>Migraine</strong> presents as an <strong>episodic headache</strong> associated with <strong>nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity,</strong> and sensitivity to sound (phonophobia). Common triggers include bright lights, sounds, and hunger. The release of vasoactive peptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) by the trigeminal nucleus cells is the theory used to explain the pathogenesis of the condition. </p>\n<p>Avoidance of recognized triggers is helpful to avoid symptoms. The various drugs used to treat an acute attack of migraine are <strong>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</strong> (NSAIDs), <strong>triptans,</strong> CGRP Receptor <strong>Antagonists</strong> (rimegepant), 5-HT1/F receptor agonists (lasmiditan), and dopamine receptor antagonists (domperidone). </p>\n<p>The drugs used in the prophylaxis include propranolol, valproate, topiramate and flunarizine.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalalgia</h3><p><strong>Types of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cluster headache</li>\n<li>Paroxysmal hemicranias</li>\n<li>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT)</li>\n<li>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform&nbsp;<em>headache</em>&nbsp;attacks with cranial autonomic features (SUNA)</li>\n<li>Hemicrania continua</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Cluster headache</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Paroxysmal hemicrania&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;SUNCT/SUNA</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gender&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Males&gt;females</td>\n<td>Female=Males</td>\n<td>Female=Males</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Character of pain&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Stabbing /boring</td>\n<td>Throbbing pain&nbsp;/stabbing /boring</td>\n<td>Burning /stabbing/sharp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severity of pain&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Excruciating&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Excruciating</td>\n<td>Severe to excruciating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Site of pain&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Orbit, temple</td>\n<td>Orbit, temple</td>\n<td>Periorbital</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Attack frequency&nbsp;</td>\n<td>1-8 /day</td>\n<td>1-20/day</td>\n<td>3-200/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Duration</td>\n<td>15min-3 hours</td>\n<td>2-30 min</td>\n<td>5-240seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Migraneous feature&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alcohol trigger&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cutaneous trigger</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response to indomethacin</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Abortive treatment</td>\n<td>\n<p>100% oxygen</p>\n<p>Sumatriptan injection</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>No effective treatment</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>IV lidocaine&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prophylaxis</td>\n<td>\n<p>Chronic cluster</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lithium</li>\n<li>Verapamil</li>\n<li>Methysergide</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Episodic cluster&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steroids&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Verapamil</li>\n<li>Methysergide</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Indomethacin</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Lamotrigine</li>\n<li>Topiramate</li>\n<li>Gabapentin</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Indomethacin</strong> is effective in paroxysmal hemicrania,hemicrania continuum, and primary sexual/ exercise headache</li>\n<li>Cutaneous trigger is also seen in trigeminal neuralgia, however, <strong>trigeminal neuralgia</strong> is a <strong>separate entity </strong>and not a part of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>",

This finally helps in the delivery of the fetus by facilitating fetal head descent. It is an example of a positive feedback mechanism.</p>\n<p>Other examples where positive feedback plays an important role are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clotting of blood</li>\n<li>Calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum</li>\n<li>LH Surge</li>\n<li>Action potential</li>\n<li>Shock</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Negative feedback</strong> consists of certain changes that affect a deficient or excessive variable to pull it back to a certain mean value to maintain homeostasis. Most processes in the body are under negative feedback. For example, an increase in gastric acids leading to a decrease in gastric secretion.</p>\n<p>Option B: The <strong>feedforward mechanism</strong> responds to the <strong>anticipation</strong> of a change in a regulated variable. For example, when a meal is in the digestive tract, a feedforward mechanism increases the secretion of insulin that promotes the cellular uptake and storage of ingested nutrients.</p>\n<p>Option C: The <strong>adaptive control mechanism</strong> refers to the <strong>delayed type</strong> of <strong>negative feedback mechanism.</strong> When the feedforward mechanism has an error, the correction is made by a retrospective feedback mechanism called the adaptive control mechanism.</p>",

This results in the production of <strong>sickle-shaped red blood</strong> cells due to the <strong>polymerization</strong> of <strong>deoxygenated</strong> <strong>hemoglobin</strong> <strong>S (HbS</strong>). </p>\n<p>The major pathophysiology involves <strong>chronic hemolysis</strong> and <strong>microvascular occlusion</strong>. <strong>Hypoxia</strong> (option D) increases the concentration of <strong>deoxygenated HbS </strong>promoting RBC sickling. These sickle cells can <strong>disrupt circulation</strong> causing vascular occlusion and <strong>tissue infarction</strong>. <strong>Vaso-occlusive crises</strong>, also known as <strong>pain crises</strong>, are a result of this hypoxic injury and infarction. These crises predominantly affect the bones, lungs, liver, brain, spleen, and penis.</p>\n<p>Several factors can <strong>trigger</strong> the <strong>sickling</strong> of RBCs. <strong>Dehydration</strong> (option A) can <strong>increase</strong> the <strong>mean cell hemoglobin concentration</strong> (MCHC) which results in <strong>polymerization</strong> of <strong>HbS</strong>.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Sevoflurane</strong> is a volatile anaesthetic agent that is preferred for the <strong>induction</strong> of <strong>anaesthesia</strong> in <strong>children</strong> because it is <strong>less likely to cause airway irritation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Children have <strong>smaller</strong> <strong>airways</strong>, making them <strong>more susceptible to occlusion</strong> by secretions and swelling.

However, it is important to note that <strong>sevoflurane</strong> can also cause more <strong>rapid</strong> <strong>cardiovascular</strong> <strong>changes</strong>, such as <strong>tachycardia</strong> and hypotension, during induction. This is because sevoflurane is a more potent vasodilator than other volatile anaesthetic agents.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Sevoflurane</strong> is <strong>not</strong> <strong>less</strong> <strong>likely</strong> to cause seizures than other volatile anaesthetic agents. All volatile anaesthetic agents can cause seizures, especially in high doses. </p>\n<p>Option C: Sevoflurane is <strong>slightly more likely </strong>to cause <strong>respiratory</strong> <strong>depression</strong> than other volatile anaesthetic agents, but this is not a major concern in most cases.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>These clinical features are characteristic of<strong> Ataxia telangiectasia(AT)</strong>; a combined immunodeficiency disorder, inherited in an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> manner. In AT, there is defective<strong> homologous recombination.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Homologous recombination</strong> uses an <strong>undamaged DNA</strong> as a template and repairs the break, leading to the reconstitution of the original sequence . A mutation of the <strong>ATM gene</strong> is responsible for <strong>improper repairing</strong> of the breaks of <strong>double-strand DNA.</strong> Because of this defect, cell response to different pathogenic triggers, such as ionizing radiation and alkylating agents is impaired.</p>\n<p><strong>The ATM gene</strong>, which is found on <strong>chromosome 11,</strong> is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia. Additionally, <strong>poor Ig isotype switching</strong> and <strong>antigen receptor development </strong>are also seen. Thus,<strong> live vaccinations</strong> are avoided because the patient has a partial<strong> T cell deficit</strong> and is <strong>immunodeficient.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cerebral ataxia, telangiectasia, ovarian dysgenesis, </strong>and <strong>chromosomal abnormalities</strong> are the hallmarks of this illness. The face, <strong>conjunctiva,</strong> and other body parts are affected by telangiectasia, which often first manifests at the age of five or six. <strong>Early-life recurring sinopulmonary infections </strong>or cancer in the second or third decade of life are the causes of death. They also have a higher chance of getting lymphomas and leukaemias. Replacement immunoglobulins are part of the treatment. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Nucleotide excision repair (NER):</strong> a DNA repair pathway that repairs damage caused by <strong>ultraviolet radiation.</strong> Defects in NER can cause <strong>xeroderma pigmentosum</strong>, a condition characterized by extreme photosensitivity.</p>\n<p>Option C: A b<strong>ase excision repair</strong> defect is associated with MUTYH-associated polyposis syndrome.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Mismatch repair (MMR):</strong> a DNA repair pathway that repairs errors that occur during DNA replication.

A <strong>DEXA</strong> <strong>scan</strong> is the <strong>investigation of choice</strong> in diagnosing osteoporosis and the results are reported in terms of T-score, and a score of<strong> -2.5 or lower</strong> is defined as osteoporosis.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a7f7bf9d4b19454dba4979b8003931f0x570x630.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
