      "solution": "<p><strong>Low serum PO<sub>4</sub></strong>  is the likely blood parameter seen in this patient.</p>\n<p>The given clinical scenario with the image showing the <strong>wind-swept deformity </strong>(characteristic of rickets in a pediatric patient) and <strong>PHEX gene</strong> mutation is suggestive of a diagnosis of <strong>X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets</strong>. </p>\n<p>X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets is the <strong>most common genetic cause of rickets</strong>. But the <strong>overall most common</strong> cause of rickets remains to be <strong>nutritional vitamin D deficiency</strong>. PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating endopeptidase on <strong>X chromosome</strong>) products are responsible for the <strong>inactivation of phosphatonin</strong>. Mutation of this PHEX leads to <strong>increased phosphatonin (FGF 23) levels</strong>. This leads to <strong>impaired </strong>renal tubular <strong>reabsorption</strong> of <strong>phosphate</strong> and hence the excretion of phosphorous is increased. It also inhibits <strong>renal 1-alpha hydroxylase</strong> leading to<strong> reduced 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D</strong>. </p>\n<p>The patient's laboratory reports will show<strong> low phosphate levels</strong> or <strong>increased urinary phosphate</strong>. All other parameters such as <strong>calcium</strong>, <strong>PTH(parathyroid hormone)</strong> and <strong>pH</strong> are <strong>normal</strong> with <strong>raised alkaline phosphatase(ALP)</strong> levels.</p>\n<p>Clinical features of X-linked dominant hypophosphatemic(XLH) rickets include lower extremity abnormalities, <strong>short stature</strong>, poor growth, <strong>delayed dentition</strong>, and tooth abscesses. The wind-swept deformity is due to <strong>genu</strong> varus(leg going inward compared to the knee joint) on one side and <strong>genu valgus</strong>(leg going outward compared to the knee) on the contralateral side.</p>\n<p>Mainstay treatment of hypophosphatemic rickets includes <strong>oral phosphorus</strong> and<strong> 1,25-D (calcitriol)</strong>. Phosphorus supplementation is usually given in <strong>1-3 g</strong> elemental phosphorus divided into 4–5 doses. Frequent dosing reduces <strong>diarrhoea</strong>, which is a complication of high-dose oral phosphorus. <strong>Calcitriol</strong> is administered <strong>30–70 ng/kg/day</strong> divided into 2 doses. </p>\n<p> </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/da232099312d413db328feba43e9666fx1280x1838.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Biochemical parameters in metabolic bone diseases</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Metabolic bone disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Calcium</strong></td>\n<td><strong>PTH</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Phosphate</strong></td>\n<td><strong>ALP</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Rickets / Osteomalacia</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&darr;/N</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;&uarr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;&uarr;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Primary</p>\n<p>hyperparathyroidism</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&uarr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&uarr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&darr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&uarr;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Secondary</p>\n<p>hyperparathyroidism</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&darr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp; &uarr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&uarr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &uarr;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tertiary hyperparathyroidism</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&uarr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &uarr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&uarr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;&uarr;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Osteoporosis</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;N</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;N</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N</td>\n<td>&nbsp; N</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Paget's&nbsp;disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;N</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;N</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; N</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &uarr;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Osteopetrosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &darr;/N</td>\n<td>&uarr;/N</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &darr;/N</td>\n<td>&nbsp; N</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;&uarr;: Increased,&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;: Decreased, N: Normal</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Radiological Features of Rickets</h3><p>Radiological features of rickets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Loss of provisional zone of calcification: </strong>earliest radiological finding of rickets. </li>\n<li>Delayed appearance of the epiphysis</li>\n<li><strong>Widening of growth plate: </strong>normal width of growth plate is 2-4mm.

After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act.

The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>The pathogenesis of breast milk jaundice is <strong>increased ß-glucuronidase</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Breast milk jaundice</strong> is a type of neonatal jaundice that occurs in neonates due to <strong>breast milk feeding</strong>. It usually happens within the first week of life due to the abnormal accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin, leading to jaundice. The pathology of <strong>breast milk jaundice</strong> is attributed to the <strong>contents of breast milk</strong> whereas in <strong>breastfeeding jaundice</strong> there is <strong>inadequate breastfeeding</strong>.      </p>\n<p>Breast milk contains <strong>inhibitors</strong> of <strong>UDP-glucuronyl transferase</strong> that prevents hepatic conjugation of unconjugated bilirubin. Another constituent of breast milk is <strong>ß-glucuronidase</strong> which is an enzyme that <strong>deconjugates bilirubin</strong> in the intestinal brush border, leading to increased serum reabsorption instead of excretion of bilirubin. Thus<strong> increases enterohepatic recirculation</strong> of unconjugated bilirubin. </p>\n<p>Infant factors contributing to breast milk jaundice include <strong>decreased gut flora</strong> that converts conjugated bilirubin into stercobilinogen and excreted in stools. As well as <strong>increased gut permeability</strong> in infants promotes the enterohepatic recirculation of bilirubin. </p>\n<p>Breast milk jaundice usually is self-limiting in the <strong>2nd to 3rd week of life</strong>. Other causes should be ruled out in infants with severe or persistent jaundice. Rarely due to persistent elevated bilirubin levels, they may require changing from breast milk to infant formula for 24-48 hr and/or treatment with phototherapy without cessation of breastfeeding. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Breastfeeding jaundice</strong> occurs due to<strong> inadequate breastfeeding</strong> which typically reaches its peak between the <strong>third and fifth day</strong> <strong>after birth </strong>and is often accompanied by <strong>excessive weight loss</strong>. They also show increased<strong> unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Dubin Johnson syndrome</strong> shows <strong>multi-drug-resistant protein 2(MRP- 2) mutation</strong>. It is an autosomal recessive hyperbilirubinemia syndrome characterised by <strong>conjugated </strong>hyperbilirubinemia and <strong>black-pigmented</strong> liver on biopsy due to an epinephrine metabolite. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type-I</strong> is due to the<strong> absence of UDP-glucoronyl transferase</strong> enzyme. It is an autosomal recessive hyperbilirubinemia syndrome characterized by severe <strong>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong> and usually presents with <strong>kernicterus</strong>. It is usually fatal in the neonatal period.  </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hyperbilirubinemia- Causes</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<strong>Predominantly Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Excess production of bilirubin</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hemolytic anemias</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Biliary tract obstruction</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Resorption of blood from internal hemorrhage (e.g., alimentary tract bleeding, hematomas)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;Biliary tract diseases like primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ineffective erythropoiesis (e.g., pernicious anemia, thalassemia)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Reduced hepatic uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Drug interference with membrane carrier systems</p>\n</td>\n<td>Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Some cases of Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired bilirubin conjugation</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Physiologic jaundice of the newborn (decreased UGT1A1 activity, decreased excretion)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Breast milk jaundice (&beta;-glucuronidases in milk)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Genetic deficiency of UGT1A1 activity (Crigler-Najjar syndrome types I and II)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Diffuse hepatocellular disease (e.g., viral or drug-induced hepatitis, cirrhosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hereditary Hyperbilirubinemias</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disorder</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Inheritance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Defects in bilirubin metabolism</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Clinical course</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fatal in the neonatal period</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Generally mild,</p>\n<p>occasional kernicterus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR (common)</p>\n<p>AD (occasional)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin-Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired biliary excretion of bilirubin glucuronides due to a mutation in canalicular multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous with black pigmentation of liver</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased hepatic uptake and storage</p>\n<p>Decreased biliary excretion</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

It is mostly consumed by <strong>agricultural labourers</strong> of poor economic status because it is relatively cheap. </p>\n<p>It can present as <strong>skeletal</strong>,<strong> vascular</strong> or <strong>neural</strong> manifestations. <strong>Beta-oxalyl-amino-alanine</strong> (<strong>BOAA</strong>) is the toxic compound causing lathyrism.</p>\n<p>The water-soluble property of the toxin is used in removing it from the pulses by <strong>soaking it in hot water</strong> and rejecting the soaked water. <strong>Vitamin C</strong> in doses of <strong>500-1000 mg</strong> can be used for the prevention and treatment of lathyrism. </p>\n<p> Note - <strong>Cytochrome c oxidase</strong>, <strong>superoxide dismutase</strong> and <strong>tyrosinase </strong>are other examples of <strong>copper</strong>-containing enzymes.      </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Amino acid Enzymatic Disorders and the Associated Enzymes</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Disorder</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Enzyme defect</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Phenylketonuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Phenylalanine hydroxylase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tyrosinosis (Tyrosinemia type I)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Maleyl Acetate isomerase or Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Maple syrup urine disease&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase(BCKAD)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Alkaptonuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Homogentisate oxidase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Albinism</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tyrosinase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Homocystinuria type I</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cystathionine synthase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Homocystinuria type II</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Defect in methylcobalamin formation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Cystathioninuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cystathionase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tyrosinemia type II or Richner-Hanhart syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tyrosine transaminase or Tyrosine aminotransferase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Primary hyperoxaluria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Alanine glyoxalate aminotransferase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hypervalinemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Valine transaminase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Isovaleric acidemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Histidinemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Histidase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hyperprolinemia type I</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Proline oxidase</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Therefore, concurrent statin therapy substantially increases the effectiveness of bile acid sequestrants. </p>\n<p>Another effect of <strong>increased hepatic bile acid synthesis</strong> is that it also causes an <strong>increase in hepatic triglyceride synthesis</strong>, which is of consequence in patients with <strong>significant hypertriglyceridemia</strong>.

Mineralocorticoid deficiency manifests as salt craving, dizziness due to hypotension, and abdominal pain. <strong>Excess ACTH</strong> stimulation results in <strong>hyperpigmentation</strong> of exposed areas of the skin such as palmar creases and dorsal foot. Hyponatremia is a characteristic feature and is often associated with hyperkalemia. </p>\n<p>Diagnosis is established with <strong>decreased morning cortisol</strong> levels and elevated ACTH.

The doses are timed to <strong>mimic</strong> the <strong>physiological cortisol secretion</strong>. Long-acting glucocorticoids like prednisolone are not preferred because of their inability to mimic the physiological cycle.</p>\n<p>Mineralocorticoid replacement is done with <strong>fludrocortisone</strong> at an initial dose of 100–150 μg. The dose is adjusted according to the patient's response and the blood pressure, serum sodium, potassium, and renin levels are monitored. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: As mentioned, <strong>prednisolone</strong> is a long-acting glucocorticoid which is not preferred. <strong>Indomethacin</strong> is used for the management of <strong>nephrogenic diabetes insipidus</strong>. This drug combination is not indicated for this patient. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Demeclocycline + tolvaptan</strong> can be used in the management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (<strong>SIADH</strong>). This condition can present with muscle weakness and lethargy due to hyponatremia. However, it is not associated with hyperpigmentation or hyperkalemia. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride </strong>can be used for the management of <strong>nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI)</strong>. Amiloride is used for the management of lithium-induced nephrogenic DI.

It plays an important role in <strong>mucociliary transport</strong> along the respiratory mucosa. It also helps regulate the amount of exocrine gland secretion.</p>\n<p>The defect in the ion channel results in the production of hyper viscous, <strong>adherent secretions</strong> which can obstruct the airways. Organisms such as <strong><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em></strong> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> can grow in the sputum. The <strong>exocrine</strong> <strong>pancreas</strong> can undergo fibrotic scarring, cyst formation, and acinar tissue loss. The viscid secretions can lead to pancreatic duct obstruction. The flow of <strong>digestive enzymes</strong> to the duodenum is hence impaired.</p>\n<p>Symptoms include sinusitis,<strong> steatorrhea</strong>, and abdominal pain. <strong>Distal intestinal obstruction</strong> is a complication due to difficulty in excreting intestinal contents. In neonates, it can present as <strong>meconium ileus</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Detection of high levels of <strong>trypsinogen</strong> is used in newborn screening. <strong>Chloride levels &gt;60mEq/L</strong> in the <strong>sweat</strong> of affected patients are diagnostic. <strong>Hyponatremic hypochloremic alkalosis</strong> and<strong> hypokalemia</strong> may also be seen.</p>\n<p>Postural drainage, short-term antibiotics, and inhaled bronchodilators can be used for medical management.

Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is 36 mmHg, which belongs to grade IV intra-abdominal hypertension and should be managed by <strong>emergent bedside laparotomy</strong> for decompression.</p>\n<p>Any acute process in the abdomen such as <strong>trauma, intestinal perforation, peritonitis</strong>, or <strong>acute pancreatitis</strong> can increase the intra-abdominal pressure. Increased abdominal pressure can <strong>diminish </strong>the<strong> blood flow</strong> to the <strong>abdominal</strong> <strong>organs</strong> and <strong>decrease the venous return</strong> to the heart. This manifests as <strong>oliguria</strong> and <strong>hypotension.</strong></p>\n<p>Normally, IAP is &lt; 8 mm Hg. <strong>Intra-abdominal hypertension</strong> (<strong>IAH</strong>) is defined as a sustained elevation in <strong>IAP &gt; 12 mmHg</strong>. Whereas, ACS is characterized by a sustained increase in <strong>IAP ≥ 20 mmHg</strong> leading to <strong>end-organ dysfunction</strong>. Measurement of <strong>bladder (intravesical) pressure</strong> is the standard method to screen for IAH and ACS.</p>\n<p>The degree of organ dysfunction increases with the grade of IAH. Most patients with grade III IAH and <strong>all patients with grade IV IAH</strong> require <strong>abdominal</strong> <strong>decompression</strong>. Hence, <strong>emergent bedside laparotomy</strong> is the most appropriate next step in management to relieve the elevated intra-abdominal pressure and prevent further organ damage. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Fluid resuscitation is a standard initial approach in managing hypovolemic shock, especially after trauma. However, in the context of ACS, excessive fluids without adequate decompression can worsen the condition.</p>\n<p>Option B: Obtaining a CECT scanning may not be feasible in an unstable patient as ACS is a clinical diagnosis, and a delay for imaging could be detrimental. Immediate intervention is required in suspected ACS to prevent organ damage and improve outcomes.</p>\n<p>Option D: Antibiotics can be considered based on clinical suspicion or culture results but are not the primary intervention for ACS.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Physiological Consequences of Increased Intra-abdominal Pressure</h3><p><strong>Decreased :</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cardiac output</li>\n<li><strong>Venous return</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Visceral blood ﬂow</strong></li>\n<li>Renal blood ﬂow</li>\n<li>Glomerular filtration</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Increased :</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cardiac rate</strong></li>\n<li>Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure</li>\n<li>Peak inspiratory pressure</li>\n<li><strong>Central venous pressure</strong></li>\n<li>Intrapleural pressure</li>\n<li><strong>Systemic vascular resistance</strong></li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>The reason for the <strong>CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation curve</strong> to shift from point A to point B on <strong>increasing </strong>blood <strong>PO<sub>2</sub></strong> is explained by <strong>Haldane effect</strong>.  </p>\n<p>The binding of O<sub>2</sub> with hemoglobin (Hb) <strong>displaces CO<sub>2</sub></strong> from the blood. This is known as the<strong> </strong>Haldane effect. It helps in the<strong> transport</strong> of <strong>CO<sub>2</sub></strong> from the tissues to the lungs. </p>\n<p>The given graph shows two CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation curves: when the <strong>PO<sub>2</sub> </strong>is <strong>100 mm Hg</strong> (which is the case in the <strong>lung blood capillaries</strong>); and when the <strong>PO<sub>2</sub> </strong>is <strong>40 mm Hg</strong> (which is the case in the <strong>tissue capillaries</strong>). At the normal PCO<sub>2</sub> of 45 mm Hg in the tissues (represented by point A), 52% volume of CO<sub>2</sub> combines with the blood. Upon entering the lungs, the PCO<sub>2</sub> falls to 40 mm Hg and the PO<sub>2</sub> rises to 100 mm Hg. The <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>PO<sub>2</sub> shifts</strong> the CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation curve from the<strong> </strong>top curve to the lower curve, i.e. point B.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Haldane effect</strong> results from the fact that the combination of <strong>O<sub>2</sub></strong> with<strong> Hb</strong> in the lungs causes the Hb to become a <strong>stronger acid</strong>. The more<strong> acidic Hb</strong> has <strong>less</strong> <strong>tendency</strong> to combine with<strong> CO<sub>2</sub></strong>, thus displacing much of the CO2 that is present in the<strong> carbamino form</strong> from the blood. The <strong>increased acidity</strong> of the <strong>Hb</strong> also causes it to <strong>release</strong> an <strong>excess</strong> of<strong> H+</strong>, and these ions bind with<strong> HCO3− </strong>to form <strong>carbonic acid</strong>, which then<strong> dissociates</strong> into <strong>water </strong>and<strong> CO2</strong>, and the<strong> CO2</strong> is<strong> released </strong>from the blood into the <strong>alveoli</strong>.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Haldane effect approximately <strong>doubles</strong> the <strong>amount</strong> of <strong>CO<sub>2</sub> released</strong> from the blood in the lungs and the amount picked up by the tissues.</p>\n<p>The image below demonstrates the Haldane effect at the lungs:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2eb5ae8ccbe74da0bb9f47911c39e67ax1280x758.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: A <strong>right shift </strong>of the <strong>oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve</strong> in response to an <strong>increase</strong> in blood <strong>CO<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>hydrogen ions</strong>, enhances the <strong>release </strong>of<strong> O<sub>2</sub></strong> from the blood in the tissues. This enhances the oxygenation of the blood in the lungs. This is known as the <strong>Bohr effect</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B: The<strong> exchange</strong> <strong>of bicarbonate ions for</strong> <strong>chloride</strong> ions in the <strong>RBCs</strong> to maintain electroneutrality during the transport of CO<sub>2</sub> is known as the <strong>Hamburger effect</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: The <strong>pressure</strong> of a fixed mass of gas is<strong> inversely proportional</strong> to its <strong>volume</strong> if its temperature is kept constant is known as <strong>Boyle’s</strong> law.</p>",

The<strong> diagnosis</strong> is made by testing for autoantibodies (such as <strong>anti-tissue transglutaminase</strong>, anti-endomysial, and anti-gliadin) and by performing a <strong>small intestine biopsy</strong>, which can show flattening of the villi. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Carcinoid syndrome</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/db331361dc434bed8535d417b2cfcb4fx1280x1845.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Conditions Associated with Pellagra-like Symptoms</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Condition/Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Reason for niacin deficiency</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hartnup disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Intestinal &amp; renal malabsorption of tryptophan</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Carcinoid syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Overproduction of serotonin that causes diversion of  tryptophan from NAD+ Pathway</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Vitamin B6 deficiency</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Defective kynureninase pathway</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Maize rich diet</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Niacin is in unavailable niacytin form</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Jowar diet (Sorghum)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Increase leucine content inhibit QPRTase enzyme</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

This phenomenon is alternatively referred to as <strong>instantaneous</strong> <strong>rigor</strong> or <strong>cataleptic</strong> <strong>rigidity.</strong></p>\n<p>Primary relaxation of body muscles is absent whereas it is present before rigor mortis sets in.</p>\n<p>The victims <strong>do not undergo postmortem flaccidity</strong> (unlike rigor mortis), thereby directly entering a state of <strong>instantaneous</strong> <strong>rigor</strong>. This results in <strong>muscle</strong> <strong>stiffening</strong> which indicates the victim's attitude at the time of death. Cadaveric spasm is limited to <strong>select</strong> <strong>muscles </strong>mostly <strong>voluntary</strong>,<strong> smaller groups of muscles</strong> (option A) i.e., the muscles that <strong>were in a state of contraction</strong> at the time of death. The mechanism of cadaveric spasm is thought to be due to <strong>neurogenic</strong> <strong>phenomena</strong>. The cells do not undergo necrosis since <strong>cell death has not occurred</strong> as they may <strong>respond to electrical stimuli </strong>(option C).</p>\n<p><strong>Predisposing factors</strong> for this postmortem change include excitement, fear, fatigue, <strong>electrocution</strong>, nervous system injury, and convulsant poisons such as strychnine. It is a unique phenomenon that <strong>cannot</strong> <strong>be</strong> <strong>replicated</strong> by any other situation, and it is <strong>not</strong> <strong>possible</strong> to <strong>induce</strong> it through any means <strong>following</strong> the <strong>cessation</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>life</strong>. Hence it is useful to get an idea about the <strong>manner of death</strong> (option D).</p>\n<p>A <strong>significant</strong> amount of <strong>force</strong> is necessary to <strong>overcome</strong> <strong>stiffness</strong>. The phenomenon seamlessly transitions into typical rigor mortis and ceases to exist after rigor mortis subsides.

It is caused by the deficiency of <strong>muscle glycogen phosphorylase</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>McArdle disease, also known as <strong>type V</strong> glycogen storage disorder, is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> condition.

This causes <strong>muscle</strong> <strong>glycogen accumulation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Symptoms are <strong>exercise intolerance</strong> associated with <strong>muscle cramps</strong>. Due to high-intensity exercise, sudden persistent muscle contraction occurs. This leads to severe muscle damage resulting in a massive release of muscle proteins and <strong>myoglobin </strong>in the blood. <strong>Myoglobinuria</strong> secondary to<strong> rhabdomyolysis</strong> leads to the passage of <strong>burgundy-colored urine</strong> in some patients. </p>\n<p>A unique feature associated with McArdle is the improvement in symptoms after a rest for a few minutes.
