      "solution": "<p>For the given clinical scenario, among the provided alternatives, the pathogen that is commonly associated is <strong>donor-derived Candida </strong>albicans. The likely cause of <strong>delayed anastomotic bleeding</strong> is the development of a <strong>mycotic aneurysm</strong> associated with <strong>Candida</strong> <strong>infection</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Delayed anastomotic hemorrhage </strong>may also manifest a <strong>few weeks or months later</strong> due to the formation of a mycotic aneurysm. The<strong> most frequently encountered </strong>causal <strong>organism</strong> is <em><strong>Candida albicans</strong></em> which is acquired from the donor. The prompt <strong>surgical intervention</strong> of a ruptured mycotic aneurysm necessitates an <strong>expeditious graft nephrectomy procedure.</strong></p>\n<p>The<strong> post-renal transplant</strong> can be complicated by the formation of a <strong>hematoma</strong> that has the potential to form within the transplant bed during the initial days following the surgical procedure. This phenomenon frequently occurs as a result of haemorrhaging from<strong> minute disconnected blood vessels</strong> in the renal hilum that were<strong> not discernible</strong> during the surgical procedure. In the present scenario, the patient exhibits hemodynamic stability, hence allowing for the utilization of<strong> CT angiography </strong>as a means of investigation. Following this, a<strong> subsequent re-exploration procedure can be conducted to facilitate the removal of the hematoma.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anastomotic haemorrhage</strong>, albeit infrequent, may also manifest as a potential complication. The observed condition manifests as haemorrhagic shock, characterized by a decrease in haemoglobin levels to<strong> less than 50 g/L</strong>. The current scenario poses a significant risk to the patient's life, necessitating an <strong>urgent return to the operating theatre</strong>. Repairing a defect in an arterial or venous anastomosis may be a potential course of action, although it is frequently necessary to resort to transplant nephrectomy.</p>\n<p>Other options </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Cytomegalovirus</strong> is a common cause of<strong> graft dysfunction </strong>and <strong>not anastomotic haemorrhage</strong> in solid organ transplants <strong>between 1-6 months </strong>post-transplant.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Nocardia</strong> is a common cause of <strong>graft dysfunction</strong> and <strong>not anastomotic haemorrhage</strong> in solid organ transplants <strong>more than 6 months post-transplant.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C<strong>:</strong> <strong>BK virus</strong> is emerging as an important cause of <strong>graft dysfunction </strong>after renal transplantation. Infection with the BK virus is almost universal during childhood, with latent infection in the <strong>epithelium of the urinary tract.</strong> Immunosuppression causes lytic BK virus replication with graft involvement in 1–5% of renal transplants. Infection with the polyomavirus BK has been found in association with progressive nephropathy and ureteral obstruction <strong>more commonly 6 months post-transplant</strong>. Detection of BK viral DNA in blood and urine has been useful for diagnosis and monitoring response to therapy. BK virus-associated nephropathy is controlled by cidofovir, IV immunoglobulin. The only effective treatment is to reduce the level of immunosuppression. </p><p><strong><span class=\"TextRun SCXW193804827\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW193804827\">T</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW193804827\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW193804827\">he most common Opportunistic Infections in R</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW193804827\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW193804827\">enal T</span></span>ransplant Recipients:<span class=\"EOP SCXW193804827\"> </span></strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Peritransplant</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(less than 1 month)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Early (1-6 months)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Late (more than 6 months)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wound infection</td>\n<td>Pneumocystis jiroveci</td>\n<td>Aspergillus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Herpes virus</td>\n<td>Cytomegalovirus</td>\n<td>Nocardia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oral candidiasis</td>\n<td>Hepatitis B</td>\n<td>BK Virus (polyoma)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Urinary tract infection</td>\n<td>Listeria</td>\n<td>Herpes Zoster</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Initiation of warfarin caused a <strong>sudden drop</strong> in the levels of protein C and S before they inhibit the clotting factors, due to which there is <strong>hypercoagulability</strong> and consequent <strong>thrombosis of microvasculature</strong> which leads to necrosis.

While <strong>oxycodone</strong> (option C) has good analgesic action when given systemically for visceral pain relief, it has an&nbsp;<strong>increased incidence of adverse effects </strong>when compared to <strong>fentanyl.</strong> Hence, <strong>fentanyl</strong>&nbsp;is preferred over morphine and oxycodone for rescue analgesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other uses are: to manage pain before surgical procedures, supplement in balanced anesthesia, in combination with benzodiazepines in diagnostic, endoscopic, angiographic, and minor procedures, and as an adjuvant in spinal anesthesia.</p>\n<p>Hypertonia can often occur following a rapid infusion of fentanyl and hence a muscle relaxant is often supplemented. <strong>Respiratory depression</strong> is a common side effect.

So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder maximal exercise effort.</li>\n<li>To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, <strong>kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase bicarbonate excretion</strong>.

As the herniation progresses, the contralateral midbrain and thus the <strong>contralateral cerebral peduncle gets compressed</strong> against the tentorial edge on that side. This presents as a <strong>UMN palsy </strong>of the<strong> same side</strong> as the uncal herniation with a positive Babinski's sign. Normally the side opposite the herniation would be expected to show hemiparesis. </p>\n<p><strong>Subfalcine herniation (labeled 1)</strong> refers to the herniation of the<strong> cingulate gyrus</strong> <strong>under </strong>the <strong>falx cerebri.</strong> It presents initially with headache. Once it compresses the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery it can result in contralateral lower limb weakness. This type of herniation does not involve the pupillary functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Central herniation</strong>/central transtentorial herniation<strong>(labeled 4)</strong> would present with the <strong>initial signs</strong> of <strong>mitotic pupils </strong>and <strong>drowsiness</strong> due to the downward displacement of the thalamic structures through the tentorial opening, resulting in compression of the upper midbrain. It can later progress to damage the pons and medulla as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Foraminal herniation (labeled 2)</strong> refers to the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils <strong>through the foramen magnum</strong>. This results in <strong>early compression of the medulla,</strong> leading to respiratory arrest and <strong>death.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/39406accb79d44afa064a7162638e193x1280x1533.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Site of herniation</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Structures involved</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Presenting symptoms</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Subfalcine</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Cingulate gyrus</p>\n<p>Pericallosal arteries</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Leg weakness</p>\n<p>No pupillary involvement</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Uncal (lateral)</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Oculomotor nerve</p>\n<p>Cerebral peduncle</p>\n<p>Posterior cerebral artery</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ptosis</p>\n<p><strong>Ipsilateral mydriasis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Contralateral hemiparesis</strong></p>\n<p>Decreased consciousness</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tectal (posterior)</strong></td>\n<td>Superior colliculi</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Bilateral ptosis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Upward gaze paralysis</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Axial (central transtentorial)</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Perforating branches from basilar artery</p>\n<p>Midbrain, pons, medulla</p>\n<p>Reticular formation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased consciousness</p>\n<p>Impaired eye movement</p>\n<p>Cushing’s triad (hypertension, bradycardia, respiratory irregularity/apnea)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tonsillar</strong></td>\n<td>Medulla</td>\n<td>Cushing’s triad</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Intracranial Hypertension</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p>\n<p>Intracranial hypertension is pressure within the cranium above normal.

The primary function of miRNA is to modulate the translation of target mRNAs into their corresponding proteins. After the target RNA is transcribed from its gene (post-transcriptional), the miRNA may either induce mRNA cleavage or repress its translation. This is referred to as <strong>gene silencing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>RNA interference(RNAi)</strong> is a biological process in which miRNA/siRNA molecules inhibit gene expression by neutralizing targeted mRNAs.The&nbsp;microRNA&nbsp;(miRNA) belongs to a group of&nbsp;non-coding genes.&nbsp;The miRNA genes are transcribed but not translated into proteins. They play a role in the regulation of the expression of the target gene by&nbsp;post-transcriptional&nbsp;silencing.</p>\n<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>&nbsp;<strong>gene</strong>&nbsp;present in the nucleus is transcribed to&nbsp;<strong>primary</strong>&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>, which is further converted to&nbsp;<strong>pre-miRNA</strong>&nbsp;by an enzyme<strong>&nbsp;DROSHA&nbsp;</strong>intranuclearly and exported to the cytoplasm by an export protein.</li>\n<li>The pre-miRNA undergoes trimming, by an enzyme called&nbsp;<strong>DICER</strong>, into&nbsp;<strong>mature</strong>&nbsp;<strong>single-stranded</strong>&nbsp;<strong>miRNA</strong>.</li>\n<li>The mature miRNA is associated with a multiprotein aggregate called&nbsp;<strong>RNA-induced silencing complex</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>RISC</strong>).</li>\n<li>The target mRNAs contain seed sequences in their&nbsp;<strong>3&prime; untranslated region (UTR)&nbsp;</strong>that determines the specificity of miRNA binding and gene silencing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the base pairing between the miRNA strand and its target mRNA, the RISC causes gene silencing either by&nbsp;<strong>mRNA</strong>&nbsp;<strong>cleavage</strong>&nbsp;or by&nbsp;<strong>repressing its translation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>siRNA is similar in function to miRNA and is used in RNA interference.</strong></p>\n<p>miRNA expression has been found to be dysregulated in many cancers. Such misregulation is thought to have a causal role in the pathogenesis of such cancers. Some types of miRNAs are oncogenic (referred to as oncomiRs) and are overexpressed in cancerous tissue. On the other hand, tumor-suppressive miRNAs that counteract oncogenic characteristics are found to be underexpressed in cancers.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 401\">&nbsp;</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/02a7d2ed932640e9982675747ee1b56fx1280x1391.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Recent advancements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Small interfering RNAs</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>siRNAs</strong>) are short RNA sequences that can be introduced experimentally into cells and then serve as substrates for<strong>&nbsp;the Dicer enzyme and interact with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) </strong>in a manner similar to that observed for endogenous miRNAs.</li>\n<li>Synthetic siRNAs targeted against specific mRNA species are useful in the study of gene function (referred to as <strong>knockdown technology</strong>).</li>\n<li>siRNAs also being developed as possible therapeutic agents to <strong>silence pathogenic genes</strong>, such as oncogenes involved in neoplastic transformation.</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Enzyme classification</h3><p>There are seven groups of enzymes according to IUBMB.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>E.C.

Additionally, a temporary stent and a drain may be inserted. It is necessary to do further serial ultrasounds and <strong>MAG-3 imaging </strong>in order to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation.

      "solution": "<p class=\"p1\">The mechanism of inhibition of antagonistic muscle is via reciprocal inhibition.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Afferent fibers</strong> from muscle spindles are related to the <strong>spinal motor neuron</strong> complex that supplies the same muscle. When an impulse is generated, an excitatory potential is generated that leads to the action in the muscle. Meanwhile, an <strong>inhibitory potential</strong> is produced in the motor neurons supplying the <strong>antagonistic</strong> muscle group. By this mechanism, there is both an excitatory and an inhibitory impulse known as <strong>reciprocal inhibition.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option A: <strong>Lateral inhibition</strong>: Stimulation of one motor neuron inhibits adjacent motor neurons. This is known as lateral inhibition. Signals from the spinal motor neurons stimulate Renshaw cells, which are inhibitory interneurons. Renshaw cells transmit inhibitory signals to the adjacent motor neurons, by&nbsp;releasing the neurotransmitter <strong>glycine</strong>. This helps in sharpening signals in order to maintain the desired direction of signal transmission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C: <strong>Feedback inhibition</strong> <strong>(Recurrent inhibition)</strong>: Signals from neurons may inhibit themselves by negative feedback. This is known as feedback inhibition or recurrent inhibition. Signals from a neuron may stimulate the Renshaw cell, which in turn inhibits the same neuron.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D: <strong>Feedforward inhibition</strong>: Signals from neurons stimulate inhibitory cells. These inhibitory cells then <strong>inhibit a different group of neurons</strong>. This is called feedforward inhibition. For example, granule cells stimulate the inhibitory basket cells and stellate cells via parallel fibers. These basket and stellate cells then inhibit the Purkinje cells. This is known as feedforward inhibition.</p>",

This excessive absoprtion of Iron is primarily deposited in parenchymal organs such as the liver, pancreas and also heart, joints and endocrine organs.</p>\n<p>It is associated with increased risk of Hepato cellular carcinoma.</p>\n<p>Hemochromatosis can also be acquired from iron overload due to hemolytic anemia and transfusions.</p>\n<p><strong>Other options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Option A: Hypogonadism in hemochromatosis is&nbsp;not due to deposition of iron in testis;&nbsp;it is due to secondary derrangement in the&nbsp;<strong>hypothalamo-pituitary axis </strong>&nbsp;which results in decreased gonadotrophins and testosterone levels.</li>\n<li>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Vibrio vulnificus</strong>&nbsp;has a&nbsp;propensity to <strong>infect patients with hemochromatosis</strong>.&nbsp;The organism's<strong>&nbsp;virulence</strong>&nbsp;is considerably increased under conditions of<strong>&nbsp;iron overload</strong>. Thus, primary sepsis most often develops in patients with hemochromatosis/cirrhosis.</li>\n<li>Option D: In hemochromatosis,&nbsp;removal of excess iron has little effect on arthropathy and hypogonadism. With <strong>repeated phlebotomy,</strong>&nbsp;following changes occur:\n<ul>\n<li>Liver&nbsp;<strong>decreases in size</strong></li>\n<li>Liver function improves</li>\n<li>Hepatic fibrosis may decrease, but established cirrhosis is irreversible</li>\n<li><strong>Pigmentation</strong>&nbsp;of skin&nbsp;<strong>decreases</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Cardiac failure</strong>&nbsp;may be&nbsp;<strong>reversed</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Diabetes also improves</strong>&nbsp;in about 40% of patients</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
