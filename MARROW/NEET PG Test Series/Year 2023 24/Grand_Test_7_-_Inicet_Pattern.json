The glycogen stores are sufficient for around 18 hours after a meal following which they start to deplete. <strong>Glycogen phosphorylase</strong> (Option B) is the <strong>rate-limiting</strong> enzyme of glycogenolysis.<br /><br />In the <strong>second stage</strong> of fasting <strong>gluconeogenesis</strong> is the source of glucose. It begins 4&ndash;6 hours after the last meal but becomes fully active only after stores of liver glycogen are depleted<strong> (after 18 hours)</strong>. They can serve as a source of glucose for up to <strong>2 days</strong>. Substrates for gluconeogenesis are <strong>glucogenic amino acids</strong> ( mainly alanine) from the muscle and <strong>glycerol</strong> from adipose tissue. These glucogenic amino acids are transported to the liver, transaminated into pyruvate, and converted to glucose.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>third stage</strong> of fasting <strong>(after 2 days)</strong>, <strong>lipolysis</strong>&nbsp;occurs in the adipose tissue due to the activity of <strong>hormone-sensitive lipase </strong>(Option D). It is stimulated by <strong>increased glucagon: insulin ratio.&nbsp;</strong>Triacylglycerols will be hydrolyzed to fatty acids and glycerol. <strong>Beta oxidation</strong> of fatty acids takes place which provides <strong>acetyl CoA.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Free fatty acids</strong> are the source of energy in this stage and not glucose.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>final stage </strong>after&nbsp;<strong>several weeks</strong> of starvation, ketone body synthesis will not take place due to <strong>depleted triacylglycerol </strong>stores. <strong>Proteins</strong> remain the only source of fuel. <strong>Protein degradation</strong> increases, and <strong>death</strong> results from a loss of heart, liver, or kidney function.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Rate determining enzymes and their key regulators</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Pathway</td>\n<td>Enzyme&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Regulating factors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Glycolysis</td>\n<td>Phosphofructokinase (PFK-1)</td>\n<td>\n<p>AMP+, Fructose 2,6 bi-phosphate+</p>\n<p>ATP-, Citrate-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;gluconeogenesis</td>\n<td>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase</td>\n<td>\n<p>ATP+, Acetyl CoA+</p>\n<p>AMP-, Fructose 2,6 bi-phosphate-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Krebs cycle</td>\n<td>Isocitrate dehydrogenase</td>\n<td>\n<p>ADP+,</p>\n<p>ATP-, NADH-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;glycogenesis</td>\n<td>Glycogen synthase</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glucose-6-phosphate+, insulin+, cortisol+,</p>\n<p>Epinephrine-, glucagon-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;glycogenolysis</td>\n<td>Glycogen phosphorylase</td>\n<td>\n<p>Epinephrine+, glucagon+, AMP+</p>\n<p>Glucose-6-phosphate-, insulin-, ATP-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HMP shunt&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)</td>\n<td>\n<p>NADP+</p>\n<p>NADPH-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Denovo pyrimidine synthesis</td>\n<td>Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II</td>\n<td>\n<p>ATP+</p>\n<p>UTP-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Denovo purine synthesis</td>\n<td>Glutamine-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) amidotransferase</td>\n<td>AMP-, IMP-, GMP-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Urea cycle</td>\n<td>Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I</td>\n<td>N-acetyl glutamate (NAG)+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Fatty acid synthesis</td>\n<td>Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)</td>\n<td>\n<p>Insulin+, citrate+</p>\n<p>Glucagon-, palmitoyl-CoA-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Fatty acid oxidation</td>\n<td>Carnitine acyltransferase I</td>\n<td>Malonyl-CoA-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Cholesterol synthesis</td>\n<td>HMG-CoA reductase</td>\n<td>\n<p>Insulin+, thyroxine+</p>\n<p>Glucagon-, cholesterol-</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ketogenesis</td>\n<td>HMG-CoA synthase</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>+ Positive effect on the pathway.</p>\n<p>- Negative effect on the pathway.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Irreversible enzymes in gluconeogenesis pathway</h3><p>The&nbsp;enzymes can be remembered using the mnemonic <strong>P</strong>athway <strong>P</strong>roduces <strong>F</strong>resh <strong>G</strong>lucose.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Enzymes</td>\n<td>Reaction and site</td>\n<td>Cofactors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>P</strong>yruvate carboxylase</td>\n<td>\n<p>Pyruvate &rarr; Oxaloacetate</p>\n<p>mitochondria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Biotin, ATP</p>\n<p>Activated by acetyl-CoA</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>P</strong>hosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase</td>\n<td>Oxaloacetate&nbsp;&rarr; PhosphoenolPyruvate (cytosol)</td>\n<td>GTP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>F</strong>ructose-1,6-bisphosphatase</td>\n<td>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate&nbsp;&rarr; fructose-6-phosphate (cytosol)</td>\n<td>\n<p>Citrate(+ve)</p>\n<p>Fructose 2,6 bisphosphate (-ve)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>G</strong>lucose-6-phosphatase</td>\n<td>Glucose-6-phosphate&nbsp;&rarr; glucose Endoplasmic reticulum</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

It may be monostotic or polyostotic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clinically, it is seen more commonly in people over the age of 50. A majority of the patients are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients present with <strong>bone pain</strong>, which is <strong>constant and dull aching</strong> and mostly involves the long bones of the lower limbs, back, and hips.&nbsp;They may have deformities such as <strong>bowing</strong> of bones, the tibia bending anteriorly and the femur bending anterolaterally. <strong>Skull bones</strong> may be <strong>enlarged</strong> and the base of the skull may be flattened. Disorganized and increased bone deposition may lead to <strong>stenosis of various canals</strong> and foramina resulting in <strong>compression of cranial nerves</strong>,<strong> spinal cord</strong>, and<strong> nerve roots</strong> (due to spinal stenosis). <strong>Hearing loss</strong> is a fairly common feature, due to compression of the cranial nerve and otosclerosis resulting in mixed sensorineural and conductive <strong>hearing loss</strong>. Pathological<strong> fractures</strong> of the long bones may be seen.

The newly absorbed Fe<sup>3+</sup> iron binds rapidly to <strong>transferrin </strong>(Option 4) and is delivered to red cell progenitors in the marrow. <strong>Hepcidin</strong>&nbsp;is a protein secreted from the liver that plays a major role in the regulation of iron absorption. When the body&rsquo;s iron stores are adequate, it downregulates the expression of ferroportin and thereby decreases iron absorption.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Factors affecting iron absorption</h3><p><strong>Enhancers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ascorbic acid</li>\n<li>Citric acid</li>\n<li>Amino acid</li>\n<li>Sugars in the diet</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Inhibitors:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tannins</li>\n<li>Carbonate</li>\n<li>Oxalate</li>\n<li>Phosphate</li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Recrudescence</strong> is the recurrence of malarial fever due to the <strong>survival of parasites</strong> in <strong>red blood cells</strong>.</p>\n<p>After the initial infection of <em>P. falciparum</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and <em><strong>P. malariae</strong></em>, there can be a <strong>period of inactivity</strong> where no clinical symptoms are present. However, certain <strong>parasites</strong> <strong>remain</strong> in some <strong>red blood cells</strong>, although their levels may be below the threshold for causing fever or even below detectable levels under a microscope. When the number of <strong>parasites</strong> reaches a <strong>significant level</strong>, a new <strong>malarial attack</strong> occurs as <strong>erythrocytic schizogony</strong> resumes at a low level within the body. This recurrence of clinical malaria caused by persisting P. falciparum and P. malariae is referred to as recrudescence. Recrudescence can be attributed to a <strong>decline</strong> in the <strong>host's immunity</strong> or possibly due to&nbsp;<strong>antigenic variation. </strong>It occurs <strong>within</strong> a <strong>few weeks or months</strong> of a previous attack</p>\n<p><strong>Incomplete treatment</strong> of <strong><em>P. vivax</em> </strong>and<strong> <em>P. ovale</em></strong> infections can result in relapses. These two species exhibit two types of sporozoites: one group rapidly multiplies within hepatocytes to form schizonts, while the other group remains dormant. The <strong>dormant</strong> forms are known as <strong>hypnozoites</strong> and remain as uninucleated structures, approximately 4-5 &mu;m in size, <strong>within hepatocytes</strong> for extended periods. When hypnozoites are <strong>reactivated,</strong> <strong>new cycles</strong> of <strong>erythrocytic infection</strong> begin, leading to fresh episodes of malarial fever. These renewed malarial attacks, caused by the reactivation of dormant exoerythrocytic forms, typically occur between <strong>24 weeks and 5 years</strong> after the initial infection and are referred to as <strong>relapses</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Difference between plasmodium species</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Feature</strong></td>\n<td><strong>P.vivax</strong></td>\n<td><strong>P.ovale</strong></td>\n<td><strong>P.falciparum</strong></td>\n<td><strong>P.malaria</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Discovered by</td>\n<td>Grassi &amp; Feletti</td>\n<td>Stephens</td>\n<td>Welch</td>\n<td>Laveran</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Erythrocyte preference</td>\n<td>Reticulocytes</td>\n<td>Reticulocytes</td>\n<td>All stages</td>\n<td>Old erythrocytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stages found in peripheral blood</td>\n<td>Trophozoite, schizonts, gametocytes</td>\n<td>As in vivax</td>\n<td>Ring form, accole form, gametocytes</td>\n<td>Band forms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Infected erythrocyte</td>\n<td>Enlarged pale with Schuffner’s dots</td>\n<td>Pear-shaped, fimbriated, Schuffner’s dots (Jame’s dots)</td>\n<td>Normal size, Maurer’s cleft</td>\n<td>Normal size, Ziemann’s stippling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gametocyte</td>\n<td>Spherical, fills the cell</td>\n<td>Similar to but smaller than vivax</td>\n<td>Crescent, Banana shaped</td>\n<td>Similar to but smaller than vivax</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Color of pigment</td>\n<td>Yellowish-brown</td>\n<td>Yellowish-brown</td>\n<td>Black</td>\n<td>Dark brown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hypnozoites</td>\n<td>Present</td>\n<td>Present</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Relapse</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Average IP(days)</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>12 (shortest)</td>\n<td>30 (longest)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Duration of erythrocyte cycle(hours)</td>\n<td>48 (Benign tertian)</td>\n<td>48 (ovale tertian)</td>\n<td>48 (malignant tertian)</td>\n<td>72(Quartan malaria)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Others</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>Nephrotic syndrome</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Bound proteins are then eluted either by competition with a free, soluble ligand or by disrupting protein-ligand interactions.

It may, however, be very <strong>difficult to appreciate</strong> in <strong>fair-skinned people</strong> because the difference in the color of normal and abnormal skin is hardly any. The normal function of <strong>melanin</strong> is to block and absorb light. Since there is less or<strong> no epidermal melanin</strong> in the vitiligo-affected patches, it cannot block the light emitted from deeper layers of the skin. The <strong>vitiligo</strong>-affected skin appears like a window of <strong>blue-white/ivory white</strong> light with sharp margins. Wood's lamp is hence helpful in the diagnosis of vitiligo, especially in fair-skinned people.</p>\n<p>Vitiligo is classified as -</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Segmental vitiligo</strong>- which appears as&nbsp;<strong>unilateral</strong>&nbsp;maculae in a segmented or band-shaped pattern</li>\n<li><strong>Non-segmental vitiligo</strong>- which appears as&nbsp;<strong>bilateral</strong>&nbsp;maculae distributed in an acrofacial pattern or scattered symmetrically over the entire body</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The lesions become apparent between 20-30 years of age.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the theories for the etiology of vitiligo is based on the clinical association of vitiligo with a number of autoimmune disorders like -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thyroid disease (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism) - most common association</li>\n<li>Pernicious anemia</li>\n<li>Addison disease</li>\n<li>Diabetes Mellitus</li>\n<li>Hypoparathyroidism</li>\n<li>Alopecia areata</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hypopigmented macules in vitiligo are commonly found in the&nbsp;<strong>hips, dorsum of the hands/fingers</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>feet, elbows, knees, and ankle areas.</strong>&nbsp;These are the areas of repeated friction. Rarely there may be complete vitiligo (vitiligo universalis), or trichrome vitiligo where there are areas of depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, along with normal skin present. The&nbsp;<strong>k</strong><strong>oebner phenomenon</strong>&nbsp;is the development of&nbsp;<strong>lesions at the site of trauma</strong>&nbsp;on the uninvolved skin.</p>\n<p>Treatment involves <strong>cosmetic camouflage</strong> and the use of <strong>sunscreen.</strong> The topical application of&nbsp;<strong>corticosteroids</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<strong>first line of treatment</strong>. Topical calcineurin inhibitors like&nbsp;pimecrolimus and tacrolimus have also bee successful.&nbsp;<strong>Psoralen photochemotherapy,</strong>&nbsp;khellin and selective&nbsp;<strong>ultraviolet B therapy</strong>&nbsp;are used as&nbsp;<strong>second-line treatment</strong>. In patients who do not respond to this treatment, <strong>surgical grafting techniques</strong> can be used, where the melanocytes from a normal pigmented area are transferred to a non pigmented area.

The amnesia is <strong>predominantly retrograde</strong> with minimal anterograde amnesia. It usually follows severe emotional trauma, interpersonal conflicts, and other <strong>stressful events</strong>, such as sexual abuse, loss of a loved one, loss of livelihood, etcetera. Clinically, the presentation is quite dramatic with significant impairment in social, personal, and occupational functioning. In order for a diagnosis of dissociative amnesia to be made, it is imperative to rule out substance use, and other neurological and psychological conditions that may lead to a presentation similar to dissociative amnesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is further categorized into the following types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selective amnesia:&nbsp;Ability to remember some of the events occurring during a circumscribed period of time.</li>\n<li>Localized amnesia:&nbsp;Inability to recall all events in a circumscribed period of time.</li>\n<li>Generalized amnesia:&nbsp;Failure to recall one&rsquo;s entire life.</li>\n<li>Continuous amnesia:&nbsp;Failure to recall successive events as they occur.</li>\n<li>Systematized amnesia:&nbsp;Amnesia for certain categories of memory, such as all memories relating to one&rsquo;s family or to a particular person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dissociative fugue</strong> is characterized by a sudden, unintended, and <strong>unexpected travel</strong> to a place away from home, or workplace, or another place involved in one's daily repertoire. It is usually brief, lasting few hours to days, and is generally reversible. It is commonly associated with dissociative amnesia. In addition to amnesia, these patients may also experience confusion, trance-like behaviors, depersonalization, derealization, and conversion symptoms. It may recur in some patients.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that dissociative fugue was deleted as a major diagnostic category in DSM-5.

In case of <strong>lymphatic blockage</strong>, these proteins and fluids cannot be cleared and instead accumulate in the interstitium. This fluid accumulation leads to edema. The accumulating proteins <strong>increase</strong> the <strong>interstitial colloidal osmotic pressure</strong> and draw more fluid into the interstitium.</p>\n<p>Options 2 and 5: In <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong>, there is a <strong>loss of proteins</strong> in the urine while in <strong>liver cirrhosis</strong> there is<strong> failure of production</strong> of proteins. Both of these conditions result in <strong>decreased plasma proteins</strong>. Plasma proteins are responsible for the <strong>capillary colloidal osmotic pressure</strong> that causes the osmosis of fluid into the capillary. A decrease in the capillary oncotic pressure causes more fluid to move into the interstitium, causing edema. </p>\n<p>Option 3: In <strong>heart failure</strong>, there is an inability of the heart to pump out the blood. This <strong>pump inefficiency</strong> causes back pressure and an increase in venous and capillary pressure. This <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>capillary hydrostatic pressure</strong> forces the fluid out of the capillary and causes edema.</p>\n<p>Option 4: <strong>Infections</strong> cause inflammation and <strong>membrane damage</strong>.

It is called suicide inhibition because these substances undergo catalysis themselves to form compounds that can inhibit the enzyme. In this process, they are <strong>getting consumed</strong>. This plot does not apply to suicide inhibitors because this plot assumes that the enzyme concentration will not decrease during the course of the analysis.</p>\n<p>Statement 3: <strong>IC</strong><sub><strong>50</strong> </sub>is&nbsp;the less complex alternative to Ki as a measure of inhibitory potency. It is the <strong>concentration of inhibitor</strong> that <strong>produces 50% inhibition</strong>.</p>\n<p>Statement 5: It is true that <strong>noncompetitive inhibitors lower V<sub>max</sub></strong> but <strong>do not affect k<sub>m</sub></strong>.</p>\n<p>V<sub>max-</sub> The maximum rate for a particular reaction with a specific enzyme</p>\n<p>k<sub>m</sub>-&nbsp;The Michaelis constant k<sub>m</sub> is the substrate concentration at which the velocity of the reaction is half the maximal velocity (V<sub>max</sub>/2) attainable at a particular concentration of the enzyme</p>\n<p>Noncompetitive inhibitors <strong>bind to a site </strong>on the enzyme that is <strong>different from the substrate-binding site.</strong> This makes it possible for the substrate to bind to the enzyme even if the inhibitor is also bound to the enzyme.

Competitive inhibitors structurally resemble the substrate and so they tend to <strong>bind to</strong> the <strong>same</strong> binding <strong>site</strong> on the enzyme.
