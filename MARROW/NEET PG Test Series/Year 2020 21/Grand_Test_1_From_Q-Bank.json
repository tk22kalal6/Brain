After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

This is because these proteins, which are <strong>anti-thrombotic</strong>, have a <strong>shorter half-life</strong> as compared to the clotting factors inhibited by warfarin. Initiation of warfarin caused a <strong>sudden drop</strong> in the levels of protein C and S before they inhibit the clotting factors, due to which there is <strong>hypercoagulability</strong> and consequent <strong>thrombosis of microvasculature</strong> which leads to necrosis. The toes, thighs, buttocks and breasts are commonly involved.</p>\n<p>This adverse effect can be <strong>prevented by co-administration</strong> of warfarin with a <strong>parenteral anticoagulant</strong> such as heparin in the <strong>initial few days</strong>, until the therapeutic INR range is achieved, before continuing with warfarin alone.</p>\n<p>Treatment of this condition is by immediately discontinuing warfarin. <strong>Vitamin K </strong>can be administered<strong> for reversal </strong>of the drug effect. Patients are started on an<strong> alternative anticoagulant</strong> such as heparin or LMWH.</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Aspirin acts by irreversibly inhibiting the enzymes <strong>cyclo-oxygenase </strong>and <strong>thromboxane</strong>.

Acute viral myocarditis often presents with symptoms and signs of heart failure, although it can also manifest as chest pain and show electrocardiogram (ECG) changes resembling pericarditis or acute myocardial infarction. In Chagas' disease, specific features include abnormalities in the conduction system, particularly dysfunction of the sinus node and AV node, as well as the right bundle branch block.</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Dilated cardiomyopathy</strong>: It is the most common cardiomyopathy and is predominantly characterised by <strong>systolic dysfunction</strong>. Though it may present acutely, it <strong>progresses chronically</strong>. The familial form is due to mutations in TTN gene which encode the sarcomeric protein titin. Other etiologocal agents include alcohol, infective myocarditis, doxorubicin, hemochromatosis and sarcoidosis. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</strong>: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the <strong>most common genetic</strong> cardiovascular disorder and is a prominent cause of <strong>sudden death</strong> before the age of 35 years. Family history is commonly present, a sarcomere mutation is present in ~50% of patients. Sudden death can be due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Risk factors for sudden death in this disease include young age, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, failure of blood pressure to increase during <strong>exercise</strong>, recent (within 6 months) syncope, ventricular wall thickness &gt;3 cm, and possibly the severity of LV outflow obstruction.</p>",
