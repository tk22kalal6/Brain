Their ability to cause misreading of DNA template and the formation of aberrant proteins that get incorporated into bacterial cell membrane makes them bactericidal agents. Their antimicrobial activity reduces in an anaerobic environment. <strong>Ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, </strong>and <strong>neuromuscular blockade</strong> are the most important adverse effects.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ee45ba38cfce413fbfb460f29cb399ecx1280x1343.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Protein synthesis inhibitors: Primary subunit of ribosome binding</h3><p>Mnemonic: 50 <strong>CELLS</strong> arranged into 30 <strong>TEAM</strong></p>\n<p>50s subunit binding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>C</strong>: Chloramphenicol, Clindamycin</li>\n<li><strong>E</strong>: Erythromycin (macrolides)</li>\n<li><strong>L</strong>: Lincosamides</li>\n<li><strong>L</strong>: Linezolid</li>\n<li><strong>S</strong>: Streptogramins</li>\n</ul>\n<p>30s subunit binding</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Te</strong>: Tetracyclines</li>\n<li><strong>Am</strong>: Aminoglycosides</li>\n</ul>",

Ex:- If an incident causing retrograde amnesia occurs at 30 years of age, the memories acquired at 28 years of age may be more severely affected than those memories acquired at 20 years of age or earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>Dissociative amnesia</strong>&nbsp;is characterized by extensive and severe amnesia with an&nbsp;<strong>inability&nbsp;</strong>to<strong>&nbsp;recall</strong>&nbsp;important<strong>&nbsp;autobiographical information</strong>. The amnesia is&nbsp;<strong>predominantly retrograde</strong>&nbsp;with minimal anterograde amnesia. It usually follows severe emotional trauma, interpersonal conflicts, and other&nbsp;<strong>stressful events</strong>, such as sexual abuse, loss of a loved one, loss of livelihood, etcetera. Clinically, the presentation is quite dramatic with significant impairment in social, personal, and occupational functioning. In order for a diagnosis of dissociative amnesia to be made, it is imperative to rule out substance use, and other neurological and psychological conditions that may lead to a presentation similar to dissociative amnesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is further categorized into the following types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selective amnesia: Ability to remember some, but not all of the events occurring during a circumscribed period of time.</li>\n<li>Localized amnesia:&nbsp;Inability to recall all events in a circumscribed period of time.</li>\n<li>Generalized amnesia:&nbsp;Failure to recall one&rsquo;s entire life.</li>\n<li>Continuous amnesia:&nbsp;Failure to recall successive events as they occur.</li>\n<li>Systematized amnesia:&nbsp;Amnesia for certain categories of memory, such as all memories relating to one&rsquo;s family or to a particular person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dissociative fugue</strong>&nbsp;is characterized by a sudden, unintended, and&nbsp;<strong>unexpected travel</strong>&nbsp;to a place away from home, or workplace, or another place involved in one's daily repertoire. It is usually brief, lasting few hours to days, and is generally reversible. It is commonly associated with dissociative amnesia. In addition to amnesia, these patients may also experience confusion, trance-like behaviors, depersonalization, derealization, and conversion symptoms. It may recur in some patients.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that dissociative fugue was deleted as a major diagnostic category in DSM-5.
