Humans get infected by drinking unfiltered water containing <strong>infective cyclops.</strong> The larvae penetrate the wall of the duodenum and reach the<strong> retroperitoneal and subcutaneous connective tissues.</strong> Here the larvae develop into male and female adults in about 3 to 4 months and mate.<strong>:</strong></p>\n<p>The f<strong>ertilized female worm</strong> grows in size and migrates within the connective tissues and along fascial planes.

The most common site affected is the <strong>leg</strong>, but other sites such as arms, shoulder, breast, buttocks, or genitalia may be affected. When the gravid female worm comes beneath the skin surface, it secretes <strong>a toxin</strong> which causes a <strong>blister formation</strong>.

By ingesting <strong>undercooked pork</strong> containing cysticerci, humans acquire infections that lead to intestinal tapeworms. Infections that cause human cysticercosis follow the ingestion of T. solium eggs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In <strong>cysticercosis</strong>, the clinical manifestations are variable. <strong>Cysticerci</strong> can be found <strong>anywhere</strong> in the body, most commonly detected in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skeletal muscle, subcutaneous tissue, or eye. Neurologic manifestations (<strong>neurocysticercosis)</strong> are the most common.

The cysticercal lesions appear as a <strong>small ring like</strong> <strong>hypodensities</strong> with a <strong>bright central spot</strong>. Clinical criteria includes detection of specific anticysticercal antibodies or cysticercal antigens by well- standardized immunodiagnostic tests. </p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>\n<p>About 70% of <strong>adult-onset epilepsy</strong> is due to neurocysticercosis.</p>\n<p>MRI of the brain in neurocysticercosis.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/eef83360be9448318ec488874710dbf2x468x455.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Commonly known names of some important parasites</h3><p><strong>a.
