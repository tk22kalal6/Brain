Mostly they are asymptomatic and a self-limiting influenza-like fever termed valley fever or desert rheumatism develops in some individuals. The infection leads to lifetime immunity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D- <em><strong>Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis</strong></em> is again a dimorphic fungus causing paracoccidioidomycosis also termed <strong>South American blastomycosis</strong>. Infection is initially acquired by the inhalation of spores causing primary pulmonary infection. It spreads to the mucosa of the nose, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and lymphatics by hematogenous spread resulting in ulcerative granulomas of the buccal and nasal mucosa.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Systemic fungi - Histopathological findings</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0eb743b778a54477a01712589ecfe242x958x666.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Histoplasma</strong>: Tiny oval yeast cells (2- 4 &mu;m size) with narrow-based budding within the macrophages with an underlying granulomatous response.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/540a9635ff20406ca14c9f44eabab597x958x649.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Blastomyces</strong> : Thick-walled round yeast cells of 8- 15 &mu;m size with single broad-based budding (figure of 8 appearance)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b92b3162957241d9aad7ef723c0cd59ex958x656.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Coccidoides</strong> : Mature spherules of coccidioidomycus is seen in the above image.
