The affected leg is then passively and slowly raised by the ankle with the knee fully extended. The examiner stops further leg elevation when pain is elicited. Normally it should be possible to raise the limb to 80&ndash;90 degrees. The SLRT test is positive if the patient develops pain when the leg is between 30 and 60/70 degrees from horizontal. The pain should be radicular type and radiating to the back of the thigh or to the calf.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/67911c92a96c43f7b5a6732e952b715bx1280x1414.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p class=\"p1\"><strong>2.

Buttock pain is immediately relieved.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>The examiner then presses the popliteal fossa to stretch the lateral popliteal nerve behind the lateral tibial condyle.

This results in the formation of<strong> cyst-like cavities around </strong>the<strong> foveola</strong>. It occurs due to a <strong>break</strong> in the <strong>inner and outer blood-retinal barrier</strong>. Common causes of CME include uveitis, previous cataract surgery (<strong>Irvine-Gass syndrome</strong>), retinal vein occlusions, <strong>diabetic retinopathy, </strong>and retinitis pigmentosa.</p>\n<p>Patients may complain of <strong>blurring, distortion</strong>, and <strong>micropsia</strong>.

Fas-FasL interactions are required for thymic medullary negative selection. Defective interactions also cause the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When these T-cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL and bind adaptor proteins via the death domain.</li>\n<li>These,&nbsp;in turn, recruit and activate&nbsp;<strong>caspase-8 and -10</strong>.</li>\n<li>In many cell types, caspase-8 and -10 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called&nbsp;<strong>Bid</strong>, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway.</li>\n<li>The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell.</li>\n<li>Cellular proteins, notably, a caspase antagonist called&nbsp;<strong>FLIP</strong>, block the activation of caspases downstream of the death receptors.
