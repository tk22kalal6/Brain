When both the <strong>liver</strong> and <strong>muscle</strong> are involved, it is termed <strong>type IIIa GSD</strong>, while if only the liver is involved (15% of cases), it is classified as type IIIb.</p>\n<p>The disease presents in infancy and childhood with <strong>hepatomegaly</strong>, <strong>hypoglycemia</strong>, short stature, variable skeletal myopathy, and variable cardiomyopathy. Hepatic symptoms in type III GSD usually improve with age, however, <strong>progressive liver cirrhosis</strong> and failure can occur.

Frequent <strong>high-carbohydrate meals</strong> with cornstarch supplements or nocturnal gastric drip feedings are effective.

It presents with <strong>poor exercise tolerance</strong>,  myoglobinuria on strenuous exercise, and increased levels of creatinine kinase.</p>\n<p>Option D. <strong>Lysosomal acid α-glucosidase</strong> deficiency leads to <strong>Type II GSD</strong> or <strong>Pompe's disease</strong>. In infants, it presents as hypotonia, muscle weakness, <strong>cardiac enlargement</strong>, and failure, fatal early.

      "solution": "<p>In this scenario, the&nbsp;effective renal plasma flow (RPF) is <strong>490mL/min.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Clearance&nbsp;</strong>is defined as the volume of plasma from which a particular substance is completely removed by the kidney in a given amount of time (usually minutes). Para aminohippuric acid (PAH) is filtered by the glomeruli and secreted by the tubular cells. Therefore, the amount of the PAH that enters the kidney is almost completely removed. It means that the entire renal plasma is cleared from PAH in a given time. Because of this reason, PAH clearance measures the renal plasma flow.</p>\n<p>The formula used to calculate PAH clearance (C<span>PAH</span>) is:</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;U<sub>PAH</sub>&nbsp;&times; V &frasl; P<sub>PAH</sub></strong><sub><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</sub>where,</p>\n<p>U<sub>PAH&nbsp;</sub>- Concentration of PAH in urine- 14mg/mL</p>\n<p>P<sub>PAH&nbsp;</sub>- Concentration of PAH in plasma- 0.02mg/mL</p>\n<p>V - Urine flow- 0.7 mL/min</p>\n<p>Substituting the values given in the question, we get:</p>\n<p>PAH clearance =&nbsp;&nbsp;U<sub>PAH</sub>&nbsp;&times; V &frasl; P<sub>PAH ,</sub></p>\n<p>= (14 x 0.7)/0.02</p>\n<p>= 9.8 / 0.02</p>\n<p><strong>= 490 mL/min.</strong></p>\n<p>In an actual scenario, about 90% of the PAH is removed by the kidney. Therefore this is called <strong>effective renal plasma flow. </strong>Actual renal plasma flow is calculated by dividing the PAH clearance with an extraction ratio. The extraction ratio is&nbsp;arterial concentration minus renal venous concentration divided by arterial concentration. Normally the extraction ratio is<strong> 0.9.</strong></p>\n<p>If we consider the extraction ratio to be 0.9 in this scenario, the <strong>actual renal plasma flow</strong> will be</p>\n<p>= 490/0.9</p>\n<p>= <strong>~544 mL/min</strong></p>\n<p>Similarly, inulin and creatine clearance is used in the measurement of the <strong>glomerular filtration rate.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Formulae in renal physiology</h3><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 355\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<table><colgroup><col /><col /><col /> </colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Term</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Equation</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Clearance rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>U<sub>s</sub> &times;V / P<sub>s</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Glomerular filtration rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>U<sub>inulin</sub> &times; V / P<sub>inulin</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Clearance ratio</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>C<sub>s</sub>/C<sub>inulin</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Effective renal plasma flow</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>E<sub>RPF</sub>=C<sub>PAH</sub>=U<sub>PAH</sub> &times;V / P<sub>PAH</sub></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Renal blood flow</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>RPF / (1&minus; Hematocrit)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Excretion rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>U<sub>s</sub> &times;V</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Reabsorption rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>=Filtered load &minus;Excretion rate</p>\n<p>=(GFR&times;P<sub>s</sub>)&minus;(U<sub>s</sub> &times;V)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Secretion rate</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Excretion rate&minus;Filtered load</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Cs - clearance rate of substance &ldquo;s&rdquo;</p>\n<p>EPAH&nbsp; - PAH extraction ratio</p>\n<p>ERPF - effective renal plasma flow</p>\n<p>GFR - glomerular filtration rate</p>\n<p>P - plasma concentration</p>\n<p>PAH - para-aminohippuric acid</p>\n<p>PPAH - renal arterial PAH concentration</p>\n<p>RBF - renal blood flow</p>\n<p>RPF - renal plasma flow</p>\n<p>S - a substance</p>\n<p>U - urine concentration</p>\n<p>V - urine flow rate</p>\n<p>VPAH - renal venous PAH concentration</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

      "solution": "<p>The image shows a <strong>dense unilateral congenital cataract. </strong>Ideally, unilateral dense cataract merits <strong>urgent surgery</strong> and it is at <strong>6 weeks</strong> when elective surgery should be performed.</p>\n<p>Generally, it is not advisable to operate on <strong>lamellar cataracts</strong> until the child is<strong> </strong>1 or preferably 2 years old<strong>. </strong>But when the lens is<strong> completely opaque</strong>, or the pupil will not dilate, and when squint or nystagmus is developing, it is wise to operate at an earlier age. Moreover, the results of surgery in<strong> </strong>unilateral cataracts in children are universally poor, unless the operation is carried out within the first 6 weeks of birth.</p>\n<p>This is because the <strong>critical period</strong> for<strong> </strong>developing the fixation reflex in both unilateral and bilateral visual deprivation disorders is between <strong>2 </strong>and<strong> 4 months </strong>of age. Thus, any cataract dense enough to impair vision must be dealt with before this age and the earliest possible time is preferred. </p>\n<p>Surgery involves anterior capsulorhexis, aspiration of lens matter, capsulorhexis of the posterior capsule, limited anterior vitrectomy, and <strong>IOL implantation</strong>, if appropriate.

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario suggests <strong>acute compartment syndrome</strong>, and it is treated immediately with fasciotomy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the <strong>5 Ps</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pain:</strong>&nbsp;Pain is the <strong>first symptom</strong> of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. On the passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.&nbsp;</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paresthesia:&nbsp;</strong>Paresthesia and hypoesthesia may be noted due to compression of nerves traversing the affected compartment. They are the first signs of nerve ischemia.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pallor: </strong>Pallor of the skin may not always be seen. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paralysis:</strong>&nbsp;Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a <strong>late sign</strong>.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pulselessness:&nbsp;</strong>Usually, the peripheral pulses and&nbsp;capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the <strong>intra-compartmental pressure</strong>&nbsp;using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as the&nbsp;differential pressure (&Delta;P). A&nbsp;<strong>differential pressure (&Delta;P)</strong> of <strong>less than&nbsp;30 mm Hg</strong> (4.00 kilopascals) is an <strong>indication</strong> for <strong>immediate compartment decompression</strong>.</p>\n<p>The threatened compartment must be promptly decompressed, merely splitting the plaster is not helpful and the limb must be <strong>kept flat.</strong>&nbsp;This is because elevating the limb causes a further decrease in end capillary pressure and aggravates muscle ischemia. In the case of compartment syndrome in the leg, <strong>fasciotomy </strong>should be performed. This involves&nbsp;opening all four compartments via medial and lateral incisions. Wounds to be left open and<strong> inspected 2 days</strong> later, if tissues are healthy, the wounds can be sutured. If there is muscle necrosis, debridement to be carried out.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Acute Compartment and Crush Syndromes</h3><p><strong>1. Acute Compartment Syndrome</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Acute compartment syndrome is an elevation of the intracompartmental pressure (ICP) which increases the risk for tissue ischemia and necrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Fractures (70%) and severe soft tissue injuries (30%). Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. </p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. </p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Crush Syndrome </strong></p>\n<p>Crush syndrome is the systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis. It is commonly caused due to prolonged external compression of an extremity. </p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Crush injuries sustained during motor vehicle accidents, earthquakes, mining and other occupational accidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Underperfusion of muscle causes myonecrosis. When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",

This reduction in the heart rate <strong>decreases the myocardial oxygen demand.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The oxygen requirement of the heart mainly depends on the work done by the heart. This work mainly depends on cardiac output and peripheral resistance. An increase in these parameters will increase the oxygen requirement of the heart.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Important determinants of cardiac output are:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Stroke volume</strong>- It is the amount of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat. This stroke volume increases whenever, there is <strong>increased venous</strong> return to the heart, increased end-diastolic volume (<strong>preload</strong>), and increased contractility. Contractility further depends on the <strong>initial length</strong> of the cardiac muscle fiber and the <strong>autonomic innervation.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Heart rate</strong>- Increased heart rate increases the cardiac output which in turn increases the oxygen requirement. Heart rate&nbsp;is controlled primarily by the autonomic nerves, with sympathetic stimulation increasing the rate and parasympathetic stimulation decreasing the rate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Afterload-</strong> The tension at which the load is lifted is called afterload. As the afterload increases, the heart has to work more in order to pump blood to the organs. This in turn results in increased oxygen requirement. It is dependent on the <strong>peripheral resistance.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Drugs used in the management of angina either decrease the work done by the heart or increases the blood flow to the heart.</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Nitrates</strong>- They increase the cGMP and cause venodilation. It mainly results in an increase in venous capacitance and a decrease in the ventricular preload. They might also increase coronary flow in some areas and in variant anginas.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong>- Blocking the calcium channels leads to the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles and decreased impulses in the conduction system. This leads to decreased peripheral resistance,&nbsp;decreased blood pressure, decreased contractility, decreased heart rate, and decreased oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Beta-blockers</strong>- They decrease the oxygen requirement by decreasing the&nbsp;heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility. Some drugs like carvedilol and nebivolol also cause vasodilation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Newer antianginal drugs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Ranolazine-&nbsp;</strong>It inhibits the late sodium current and reduces the intracellular calcium concentration. It reduces diastolic tension, cardiac contractility, and work.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Trimetazidine</strong>- inhibits the fatty acid oxidation in the myocardium. It decreases the oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Ivabradine-&nbsp;</strong>decreases the heart rate and decreases oxygen requirement.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Fasudil-&nbsp;</strong>It is a Rho kinase inhibitor.

The next step in the management of this patient is to <strong>discontinue unfractionated heparin and start lepirudin.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)&nbsp;</strong>results due to the formation of antibodies against <strong>heparin-platelet 4 complexes.&nbsp;</strong>These antibodies also bind to the platelet Fc receptors and promote thrombosis. Features of HIT are usually seen after 5-10 days of starting heparin and are more common in females than in males. The platelet count usually drops to less than&nbsp;&le;100,000/&mu;L or decreases to&nbsp;&ge;50% compared to the levels before the initiation of heparin.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Tolcapone&nbsp;</strong>acts by <strong>inhibiting</strong> the <strong>catechol-O-methyltransferase enzyme.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The addition of carbidopa to levodopa prevents peripheral decarboxylation of&nbsp; levodopa. However, levodopa can now be <strong>methylated</strong> by catechol-O-methyl transferase and get inactivated. This is prevented by catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors&nbsp;<strong>tolcapone </strong>and<strong> entacapone.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Parkinson's disease arises as a result of the <strong>loss of dopaminergic neurons</strong> in the <strong>striatum</strong>. Therefore the mainstay of treatment for this disease is to increase dopamine in this area.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A-&nbsp;<strong>Amantadine</strong> is an antiviral agent. It is used in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A. It has antiparkinsonian activity.&nbsp;It alters dopamine release in the striatum, has anticholinergic properties, and <strong>blocks methyl-D-aspartate</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>NMDA) receptors</strong>. It can be used in <strong>mild disease,&nbsp;dose-related fluctuations,&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>dyskinesia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B-&nbsp;<strong>Rotigotine</strong>&nbsp;is a dopamine receptor agonist. It acts on D1 and D2 receptors, whereas <strong>ropinirole</strong> and <strong>pramipexole</strong>&nbsp;act on the D2 and D3 receptors.&nbsp; The duration of action of the DA agonists (8&ndash;24 h) is often longer than that of levodopa (6&ndash;8 h). They are effective in the treatment of patients who have developed <strong>on/off phenomena</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Selegiline</strong>&nbsp;and rasagiline are&nbsp;<strong>selective</strong> <strong>monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors</strong>.&nbsp;Dopamine in the striatum is predominantly metabolized by the MAO-B enzyme. Inhibiting this enzyme will <strong>increase</strong> <strong>dopamine concentration</strong>&nbsp;in these neurons. They selectively and irreversibly inactivate MAO-B.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>Other drugs used in parkinsonism are:</p>\n<p><strong>Levodopa</strong> is a prodrug. It crosses the blood-brain barrier.&nbsp;<strong>Levodopa</strong> is converted to <strong>dopamine</strong> by decarboxylation in dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. It significantly improves the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</p>\n<p>An adverse effect of levodopa is the <strong>wearing-off phenomenon</strong>. After administrating levodopa, there is improvement in the symptoms for a period of 1&ndash;2 h, but rigidity and akinesia return rapidly after the effect of the drug reduces. Increasing the dose and frequency of administration can improve this phenomenon, but the patients often develop dyskinesia and excessive abnormal involuntary movements.</p>\n<p>In the later stages of the disease, patients may <strong>fluctuate rapidly</strong> between being &ldquo;<strong>off</strong>,&rdquo; having no beneficial effects from their medications, and being &ldquo;on&rdquo; having some beneficial effects but along with side effects.</p>\n<p>Levodopa, if administered alone will undergo decarboxylation by the decarboxylases present in the intestinal mucosa and other peripheral sites. This will lead to decreased concentration of the drug reaching the brain. In order to prevent this levodopa is always given with <strong>carbidopa</strong>.&nbsp;Carbidopa&nbsp;inhibits&nbsp;<strong>peripheral decarboxylase enzymes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Muscarinic receptor antagonists</strong>&nbsp;are used as adjuncts to dopamine therapy. Eg.&nbsp;<strong>trihexyphenidyl </strong>and<strong> benztropine</strong>. <strong>Diphenhydramine,</strong> an antihistamine is also used.</p>\n<p><strong>Apomorphine</strong> acts on D4 and mildly on D2, D3, and D5 receptors.

Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">C. Marked distress regarding binge eating is present.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">D. The binge-eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">E.

It is secreted by the <strong>type II alveolar epithelial cells</strong>. It contains&nbsp;phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol, and fatty acids. <strong>Phosphatidylcholine</strong> is the major phospholipid. Other phospholipids are&nbsp;phosphatidylglycerol,&nbsp;phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine. <strong>Ceramide</strong> is<strong> not</strong> a major component of surfactants. Important proteins are surfactant protein (SP)- A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The important function is to <strong>reduce the surface tension</strong> of the alveoli. The pressure required for the expansion of alveoli is directly proportional to the surface tension present over the alveolar sacs. Surfactant reduces this surface tension and thereby reduces the pressure required to expand lungs. It also prevents pulmonary oedema.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Surfactant production <span class=\"s1\">starts around&nbsp;</span>20 <span class=\"s1\">weeks </span>of life <span class=\"s1\">and </span>peaks at 35 weeks gestation. Therefore, any neonate less than 35 weeks <span class=\"s1\">is </span>prone to develop RDS<span class=\"s2\">.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS):</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">RDS <span class=\"s1\">is </span>common in preterm babies <strong>less than 34 weeks</strong> of gestation. It occurs due to the deficiency of the surfactant in the alveoli. Decreased surfactant increases the surface tension over the alveoli which makes the alveoli to collapse easily. Therefore, the baby has to put more effort to expand the lungs. This results in respiratory distress and hypoxemia.&nbsp;Ischemic damage to the alveoli causes the transudation of proteins into the alveoli that form the <strong>hyaline membrane<span class=\"s1\">.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It usually occurs in the first few hours of life. The babies will have tachypnea, grunting,&nbsp;</span>retractions, <span class=\"s1\">cyanosis </span>and decreased air <span class=\"s1\">entry.
