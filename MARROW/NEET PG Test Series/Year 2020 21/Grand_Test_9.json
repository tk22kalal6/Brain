The <strong>primary bacterial indicator</strong> used to assess this is the <strong>coliform group</strong> of organisms. This is because they are present abundantly in the human intestine and can be <strong>easily detected</strong> by culture methods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>presumptive coliform test</strong> can be done by the <strong>multiple tube method</strong> or <strong>membrane filtration</strong> <strong>technique</strong>. In the multiple tube method, the water to be tested is&nbsp;<strong>inoculated&nbsp;</strong>into tubes containing a suitable liquid medium. These tubes are then incubated for 48 hours and examined. The test is called <strong>presumptive</strong> because the reaction observed in the tube may occasionally be due to other organisms. The presumption that the reaction is due to coliform organisms has to be confirmed. <strong>McConkey's lactose bile salt broth</strong> with<strong> bromocresol purple 25</strong> as an indicator is used as the media. The number of tubes with production of <strong>acid</strong> and <strong>gas</strong> can be assessed to estimate the <strong>most probable number</strong> of coliform organisms in <strong>100 ml</strong> of water. <em>Escherichia coli</em> or thermotolerant coliform bacteria should not be detected in any 100 ml sample.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In samples of chlorinated water, confirmation of the presumptive test is necessary. This is done by <strong>subculturing</strong> the positive tubes in two tubes of brilliant green bile broth. It is based on the fact that <em>E.Coli</em> is the only coliform that can produce<strong> gas</strong> from lactose at 44&deg;C.</p>\n<p>Supplementary indicator organisms include <strong>fecal streptococci</strong> and sulfite-reducing <strong>clostridia</strong>.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, 2017</h3><p><strong>WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, 2017</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I)&nbsp;Physical parameters:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Guideline values</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Comments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Turbidity</strong></td>\n<td>Ideally, no visible turbidity but permissible standard is <strong>&lt; 1.0 NTU </strong>(nephelometric turbidity units) for household drinking water.&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>It describes the <strong>cloudiness of water</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>&gt;4 NTU </strong>&ndash; cloudiness visible to naked eye.</li>\n<li><strong>&lt;4 NTU</strong> &ndash; measured only by instruments.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Color</strong></td>\n<td>Ideally, no visible color but permissible standard is <strong>&lt;15 TCU </strong>(true color units).</td>\n<td>&nbsp;<strong>&gt;15 TCU </strong>is detectable by the naked eye.&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Taste, odor and t</strong><strong>emperature</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>No health based guideline values</strong></td>\n<td>It may be indicative of contamination and pollution.&nbsp;High water temperature may enhance growth of microorganisms and influence taste, odor and color.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>II)&nbsp;Chemical parameters:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Guideline values</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ammonia</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>No health based guideline value</strong>.</p>\n<p>Natural levels in <strong>surface </strong>and<strong> ground water</strong> is <strong>0.2 mg/l</strong>. <strong>Anaerobic groundwater</strong> may have up to <strong>3 mg/l</strong>.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Aluminium</strong></td>\n<td>up to<strong> 0.9 mg/l</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Arsenic</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>up to<strong> 0.01 mg/l</strong></p>\n<p>Levels in natural water range from 1 to 2 &micro;g/l.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Chloride</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>250 mg/l</strong>, as above this a detectable taste appears.</p>\n<p>Maximum permissible level is <strong>600 mg/l.

The deficits in severe hypernatremic dehydration may need to be corrected over 2-4 days.</p>\n<p>The initial resuscitation requires the restoration of intravascular volume with normal saline (NS). <strong>Ringers lactate should not be used</strong> as it is<strong> more hypotonic than NS</strong> and may result in&nbsp;a very<strong> rapid decrease </strong>in serum concentrations, especially if multiple fluid boluses are necessary.</p>\n<p>(Note: Vice versa for hyponatremic dehydration, if hyponatremic dehydration is treated rapidly with 3% saline, it increases the risk of <strong>central pontine myelinolysis</strong>)</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Symptoms associated with different levels of dehydration</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Symptoms</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>No or minimal dehydration</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Mild to moderate dehydration</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Severe dehydration</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Loss of body weight</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>&lt;3%</span></td>\n<td><span>3&ndash;9%</span></td>\n<td><span>&gt;9%</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Mental status</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Well; <strong>alert</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Fatigued or&nbsp;<strong>irritable</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Lethargic </strong>or unconscious</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Thirst</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Drinks normally</span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Thirsty</strong>; eager to drink</span></td>\n<td><span>Drinks poorly</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Heart rate</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Normal</span></td>\n<td><span>Normal to increased</span></td>\n<td><span>Tachycardia</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Quality of pulse</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Normal</span></td>\n<td><span>Normal to decreased</span></td>\n<td><span>Weak, thready or impalpable</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Skin turgor test</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Instant recoil</span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Recoil in &lt;2</strong> <strong>sec</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Recoil in &gt;2 sec</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Capillary refill</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Normal</span></td>\n<td><span>Prolonged</span></td>\n<td><span>Prolonged</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Treatment of dehydration based on severity</h3><p><strong>Plan A</strong>: For no dehydration or minimal dehydration.&nbsp;ORS is administered after each loose stool.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Amount&nbsp;</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&lt;2 years</td>\n<td>50&ndash;100 mL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-10 years</td>\n<td>100&ndash;200 mL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&gt;10 years</td>\n<td>As much fluid as they want</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><strong>Plan B</strong>: For moderate dehydration.</p>\n<p>The amount of oral rehydration solution (ORS) to be given is <strong>75 mL/kg body weight</strong> (wt &times; 75).</p>\n<p><strong>Plan C</strong>: Severe dehydration</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n<td>First, give<strong> 30 mL/kg in</strong></td>\n<td>Followed by <strong>70 mL/kg in</strong></td>\n<td>Total<strong> 100 mL/kg in</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Infants (under 12 months)</td>\n<td>1 hr</td>\n<td>5 hrs</td>\n<td>&nbsp;6 hrs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Older</td>\n<td>30 min</td>\n<td>2&frac12; hrs</td>\n<td>&nbsp;3 hrs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Ringer lactate</strong> (ideal) or normal saline is used as intravenous fluids.</p>",

This method of contraception has a high rate of failure (upto 25%) where the major drawbacks are that precoital secretions may contain sperm and that even a drop of semen might be adequate to cause conception. Poorly timed withdrawal might also lead to pregnancy.</p>\n<p>Option D - Also known as the \"calendar method\", the <strong>rhythm method</strong> is based on calculating the fertile period of the female.

They include AV node reentry, AV reentry via an accessory pathway, and atrial tachycardia. AVNRT is the most commonly seen pattern of PSVT in healthy adults, especially in women.

Cytoplasmic innate immune receptors recognize <strong>microbial products</strong> that entered the infected cells and activate the multiprotein complex called the <strong>inflammasome</strong>. Inflammasome activates <strong>caspase 1</strong> and helps in the release of the biologically activated forms of <strong>IL-1</strong>.&nbsp;Along with caspase 1, caspases 4 and 5 also induce cell death. Unlike classical apoptosis, pyroptosis is characterized by the release of inflammatory mediators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apoptosis- The intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic death receptor-initiated pathways converge to activate a caspase cascade that mediates the final phase of apoptosis. The <strong>intrinsic pathway </strong>activates<strong> caspase 9</strong> whereas the <strong>extrinsic pathway</strong> activates <strong>caspases 8 </strong>and<strong> 10</strong>. These caspases then activate<strong>&nbsp;caspase 3, </strong>and<strong> caspase 6</strong>.&nbsp;Activated caspases cause DNA degradation and nuclei fragmentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Ferroptosis</strong> is an <strong>iron-dependent</strong> distinct pathway of <strong>cell death</strong> induced<strong> by</strong> <strong>lipid peroxidation</strong>. The widespread peroxidation disrupts membrane function which leads to the loss of plasma membrane permeability and results in cell death resembling necrosis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Necroptosis</strong>, as the name suggests has features similar to necrosis and apoptosis. Like necrosis,&nbsp;it is characterized by loss of ATP, cellular and organelle swelling, the release of lysosomal enzymes, and rupture of the plasma membrane. However, like apoptosis, this is programmed cell death. Ligation of <strong>TNFR1</strong> initiates necroptosis. This is a <strong>caspase-independent</strong> programmed cell death.</p>",
