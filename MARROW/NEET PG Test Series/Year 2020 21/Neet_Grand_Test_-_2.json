This may be from lung cancer and other neoplasms, increased release induced by various diseases, drugs, or exogenous administration of AVP. It is characterized by <strong>impaired water excretion</strong> leading to <strong>hyponatremia</strong> with<strong> euvolemia</strong> or<strong> hypervolemia. </strong></p>\n<p>ADH promotes the reabsorption of water and not the solutes resulting in <strong>concentrated urine.</strong> This is depicted as <strong>high urine osmolality</strong>.</p>\n<p>Patients usually present with hyponatremia with a euvolemic status. If hyponatremia develops acutely, signs and symptoms may include mild headache, confusion, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, coma, and convulsions. Chronic hyponatremia allows cerebral adaptation, and the patients are asymptomatic despite the hyponatremia.</p>\n<p>Laboratory findings in SIADH:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hyponatremia: <strong>serum Na<sup>+</sup>&lt;135 mEq/L</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Urinary loss of Na<sup>+ </sup>&gt;25 mEq per day or &gt;40 mEq/L</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>Urinary osmolality is &gt;100 mOsm/kg</strong></li>\n<li>Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are low, usually &lt;10 mg/dL</li>\n<li>Serum K<sup>+</sup> and serum bicarbonate are normal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment: Hyponatremia should be corrected gradually.

This results in<strong> </strong>jerky, hyperkinetic movements called <strong>chorea </strong>and<strong> dementia. </strong>It is commonly seen in the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> decades of life. Motor problems (the characteristic chorea) precede dementia. The HTT gene, on chromosome 4 encodes a protein called huntingtin.

This leads to the phagocytic inability to kill specific microbes.</p>\n<p>Catalase is an enzyme that inactivates hydrogen peroxide. When these patients are infected with catalase-negative organisms, the patient's immune system can use hydrogen peroxide produced by the organism to create reactive oxygen species. However, in catalase-positive organisms, the hydrogen peroxide produced is rapidly destroyed by catalase, and therefore, the patient's immune response cannot use it to produce reactive oxygen species. Thus, most&nbsp;patients present with pneumonia due to catalase-positive organisms lik<em>e Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Serratia marcescens,</em> Nocardia, and Aspergillus species.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Patients have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. The symptoms begin within the first two years of life, affecting the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, and lymphatic drainage of these organs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nitroblue tetrazolium is used&nbsp;as a diagnostic test.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A - X-linked (Bruton)&nbsp;<strong>agammaglobulinemia</strong>&nbsp;is characterized by the failure of B-cell maturation.

These suggest that the region marked corresponds to the surface marking for the&nbsp;<strong>right atrium.</strong></p>\n<p>The projection of the cardiac borders, of an average adult, on to the anterior thoracic wall forms a trapezoid.&nbsp; This can be mapped out using the percussion method by looking for cardiac dullness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The varying heart borders and the corresponding surface markings are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>upper border</strong>&nbsp;slopes gently from the second left costal cartilage to the third right costal cartilage. It corresponds to the&nbsp;<strong>left atrium</strong>.</li>\n<li>The<strong> right border</strong> is convex to the right and runs from the third to the sixth right costal cartilages, 1&ndash;2 cm lateral to the sternal edge. It corresponds to the <strong>right atrium</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>inferior border</strong>, also known as the <strong>acute</strong> border runs leftwards from the 6th right costal cartilage to the cardiac apex which is located approximately 9 cm lateral to the midline, often in the left 5th intercostal space or level with the 5th or 6th rib. It corresponds to the <strong>right ventricle</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>left border</strong>, also known as the&nbsp;<strong>obtuse</strong> border, is convex laterally on the left. It extends superomedially from the cardiac apex to meet the second left costal cartilage about 1 cm from the left sternal edge.

Repeated stimulation or faster heart rate increases the calcium that enters in cardiac cell with each action potential. It is due to the increased cytoplasmic calcium which accumulates with each contraction and binds to cause more powerful contraction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another effect, with a similar mechanism of action, is post-extrasystolic potentiation. After an extra-systole(sudden extra ventricular beat)the beat that immediately follows extra systole has increased amplitude. This is because the sarcoplasmic reticulum accumulates the extra calcium and hence the immediate next beat has a higher amplitude</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f9b9e857a5514bc890bb118a85303622x468x684.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Cardiac muscle is a functional syncytium and every time it contracts, all the cardiac fibres contract, as they get the depolarization wave. There is no scope of additional cardiac fibres to be recruited, unlike skeletal muscle.</p>\n<p>Every time stroke volume decreases, HR is increased to maintain cardiac output. But if HR increases during exercise, it is over and above the existing stroke volume, to meet the cardiac output demands. It doesn&rsquo;t lead to a decrease in stroke volume. ( But vice versa is not true. Athletes have a higher stroke volume due to years of training and have a lesser resting heart rate). Athletes have a lesser resting heart rate due to prominent vagal tone and remodelling of the sinus node.</p>\n<p>Fall in blood pressure with increasing heart rate is known as <strong>Marey&rsquo;s law.</strong></p>",

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario with repeated <strong>vaso-occlusive crises</strong>, gall stones<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;and salmonella osteomyelitis, and the&nbsp;peripheral smear showing sickle cells, target cells, and polychromasia are suggestive of sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell disease is caused by a <strong>point mutation</strong> in the<strong> sixth codon </strong>of <strong>&beta;-globin </strong>that leads to the replacement of a glutamate residue with a<strong> valine </strong>residue.</p>\n<p>HbS molecules stack into polymers when deoxygenated. With continued deoxygenation HbS molecules assemble into long <strong>needle-like fibers </strong>within red cells, producing a <strong>distorted sickle</strong> <strong>or holly-leaf shape.&nbsp;</strong>Polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin, leading to red cell distortion<strong>, hemolytic anemia, microvascular obstruction, </strong>and ischemic tissue damage.</p>\n<p>Peripheral blood smear demonstrates -&nbsp; Irreversibly<strong> sickled cells</strong>, reticulocytosis, and target cells, which result from red cell dehydration with <strong>Howell-Jolly bodies.</strong></p>\n<p>The major pathologic manifestation is chronic hemolysis, microvascular occlusions, and tissue damage. Increased breakdown of hemoglobin is responsible for&nbsp;<strong>pigment gallstones and hyperbilirubinemia.&nbsp;</strong>Splenomegaly can be seen in early childhood, but&nbsp;fibrosis and progressive shrinkage of the spleen may occur in adolescence known as&nbsp;<strong>autosplenectomy.&nbsp;</strong>Priapism affects up to 45% of males. Leg ulcers may also be seen. Stroke and retinopathy leading to loss of visual acuity and even blindness.</p>\n<p><strong>Vaso-occlusive crises, or pain crises</strong>&nbsp;are characterized by episodes of hypoxic injury and infarction that cause severe pain in the affected region, hand-foot syndrome, or dactylitis.&nbsp;<strong>Osteomyelitis</strong>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;<strong>sickle cell anemia patient</strong>&nbsp;is commonly caused by Salmonella and it most likely affects the&nbsp;<strong>diaphysis</strong>&nbsp;of bones.&nbsp;<strong>Acute chest syndrome </strong>is a&nbsp;vaso-occlusive crisis involving the lungs with fever, cough, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates.&nbsp;<strong>Sequestration crises</strong>&nbsp;is seen in children with intact spleens. Massive entrapment of sickle red cells leads to rapid splenic enlargement, hypovolemia, and sometimes shock.&nbsp;<strong>Aplastic crises</strong>&nbsp;occur due to the infection of red cell progenitors by <strong>parvovirus B19, </strong>which causes a transient arrest of erythropoiesis and a sudden worsening of the anemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased </strong>susceptibility to infection with<strong> encapsulated organisms</strong> is another risk due to altered splenic function.&nbsp;<strong>Pneumococcus&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> Haemophilus influenzae </strong>septicemia and meningitis are common, particularly in children, but can be <strong>reduced by vaccination </strong>and prophylactic antibiotics. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is also used to demonstrate the presence of HbS.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disease that results from&nbsp;<strong>acquired mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation group A gene</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(<em>PIGA</em>)</strong>, which is required for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG). These cells lack the ability to synthesize proteins that limit the activity of complement. As a result, they are sensitive to lysis by the complement C5b-C9 membrane attack complex</p>\n<p>Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by mutations that most frequently involve ankyrin, band 3, or spectrin (i.e. inherited defects in the membrane skeleton).</p>\n<p><strong>A nonsense mutation</strong>&nbsp;is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon. For example, a point mutation affecting the codon for glutamine (CAG) creates a&nbsp;<strong>stop codon (UAG)</strong>&nbsp;if U is substituted for C. This change leads to premature termination of &beta;-globin gene translation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded. The resulting deficiency of &beta;-globin chains can give rise to a severe form of anemia called&nbsp;<strong>&beta;<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;t</strong><strong>halassemia.</strong></p>",

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario points to <strong>hemochromatosis</strong>, and the best treatment for this iron-overload state is <strong>phlebotomy</strong>. One 500-mL unit of blood contains 200&ndash;250 mg of iron. Iron removal can be accomplished by weekly or twice-weekly phlebotomy of 500 mL.</p>\n<p>With <strong>repeated phlebotomy,</strong>&nbsp;the following changes occur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Liver&nbsp;<strong>decreases in size</strong></li>\n<li>Liver function improves</li>\n<li>Hepatic fibrosis may decrease, but established cirrhosis is irreversible</li>\n<li><strong>Pigmentation</strong>&nbsp;of skin&nbsp;<strong>decreases</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Cardiac failure</strong>&nbsp;may be&nbsp;<strong>reversed</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Diabetes also improves</strong>&nbsp;in about 40% of patients</li>\n<li>There is little or no effect of arthropathy and hypogonadism. In some cases, arthropathy may even progress, despite therapy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal is to reduce the serum ferritin levels to <strong>50&ndash;100 ng/mL.</strong> Once the goal is reached, the phlebotomies may be done at appropriate intervals (usually, 3-4 times a year), required to maintain the serum ferritin levels at that level.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hemochromatosis</strong>&nbsp;is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disease caused due to mutation in the HFE gene on chromosome 6.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is tightly linked to the HLA-A locus on chromosome 6p.</p>\n<p>Clinical manifestations are initially non-specific like lethargy, arthralgia, skin pigmentation, and features of diabetes mellitus. The liver is the first organ to be affected, resulting in hepatomegaly, ascites, and spider angiomas. Other systems are also affected, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, congestive cardiac failure, and testicular atrophy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pathogenesis:</p>\n<p>The <strong>mutated</strong> <strong><em>HFE</em> gene </strong>on <strong>chromosome 6p&nbsp;</strong>causes abnormally low levels of hepcidin, which is a principal iron regulatory hormone. This, in turn, leads to increased iron absorption from the duodenum. The excessively absorbed iron is primarily deposited in the parenchymal organs such as the liver and pancreas; heart; joints; and endocrine organs.</p>\n<p><strong>Other features</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hemochromatosis can also be acquired from iron overload due to <strong>hemolytic anemia</strong> and <strong>transfusions.</strong></li>\n<li>It is associated with an increased risk of <strong>hepatocellular carcinoma.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)</strong> is the most common manifestation of hemochromatosis.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Hemochromatosis can also produce restrictive cardiomyopathy but it is less common as compared to DCM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Diagnosis: Clinical features, family history, and laboratory investigations directed at diagnosing an increase in total body iron stores using serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin levels. Liver biopsy with measurement of the iron concentration and calculation of the hepatic iron index. MRI of the liver is also indicated.</p>\n<p><strong>Other options:</strong></p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Deferoxamine</strong> is a chelating agent, which&nbsp;removes 10&ndash;20 mg of iron per day&nbsp;when given parenterally. It is used in cases of severe iron load or when phlebotomy is not well-tolerated.</p>\n<p>Options A and D-<strong> Trientine</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>D-penicillamine</strong> are chelating agents that bind to copper and are used in the treatment of&nbsp;<strong>Wilson's disease.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: HLA association with diseases</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Autoimmune Gut and Skin</strong> <strong>Diseases and HLA associations</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease)</td>\n<td>DQ2 , DQ8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chronic active hepatitis</td>\n<td>DR3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dermatitis herpetiformis</td>\n<td>DR3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SLE(white)</td>\n<td>DR3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sjogren&rsquo;s syndrome</td>\n<td>DR3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Psoriasis vulgaris</td>\n<td>Cw6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pemphigus vulgaris</td>\n<td>DR4, DQ1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bullous pemphigoid variant</td>\n<td>DQ7</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Autoimmune Endocrine</strong> <strong>Diseases and HLA associations</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type 1 diabetes mellitus</td>\n<td>DQ8, DR4, DR3, DR2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hyperthyroidism (Graves&rsquo;)</td>\n<td>B8, DR3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hyperthyroidism (Japanese)</td>\n<td>B35</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adrenal insufficiency</td>\n<td>DR3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Autoimmune Neurologic</strong> <strong>Diseases and HLA associations</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Myasthenia gravis</td>\n<td>B8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple sclerosis</td>\n<td>B16, DR2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<strong>Other Important Diseases and their HLA Associations</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ankylosing Spondylitis</p>\n</td>\n<td>B27</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Reactive Arthritis</p>\n</td>\n<td>B27</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Psoriatic Arthritis</p>\n</td>\n<td>B27</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Behcet&rsquo;s disease</td>\n<td>B51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</td>\n<td>B47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Narcolepsy</td>\n<td>DR2 (<strong>DQB1*06:02)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Goodpasture&rsquo;s syndrome (anti-GBM)</td>\n<td>DR2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Abacavir hypersensitivity</td>\n<td>B57 <strong>(</strong><strong>B*57:01)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hemochromatosis</td>\n<td>A3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Narcolepsy</td>\n<td>Q1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rheumatoid arthritis</td>\n<td>DR4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Pernicious anemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>DR5&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Hashimoto thyroiditis</td>\n<td>DR3, DR5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification of Iron Overload</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Primary / Hereditary Hemochromatosis</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>HFE gene-related</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type 1: C282Y mutations of genes encoding HFE&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Non-HFE gene-related</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type 2: Juvenile hemochromatosis\n<ul>\n<li>2a <strong>- </strong>HJV&nbsp;mutation (hemojuvelin)</li>\n<li>2b<strong> -

      "solution": "<p><strong>Routine analysis of complete blood count</strong> for the duration of the <strong>azathioprine</strong> therapy should be advised.</p>\n<p>Azathioprine<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a purine analog commonly used in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is an <strong>immunosuppressant</strong>&nbsp;that can be used alone or in combination with other drugs. It is used <strong>alone</strong> in patients in <strong>remission</strong> to prevent a recurrence. Side effects include <strong>hepatotoxicity</strong>, arthralgia, and pancreatitis.<strong> Bone marrow suppression</strong>&nbsp;is a dose-related adverse effect and warrants regular <strong>monitoring</strong> of complete blood counts. Regular liver function tests are also recommended.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Inflammatory bowel disease includes <strong>ulcerative colitis</strong> and <strong>Crohn's disease</strong>. Ulcerative colitis is a recurrent condition marked by mucosal inflammation restricted to the <strong>colon</strong>. Crohn's disease is characterized by <strong>transmural</strong> inflammation of any section of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>\n<p>Laboratory investigations usually show elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. <strong>Fecal calprotectin</strong> and<strong> lactoferrin</strong> can be used to differentiate it from <strong>irritable bowel syndrome</strong>.&nbsp;In ulcerative colitis, a sigmoidoscopy is usually done before treatment to assess disease activity while a colonoscopy is done when the disease is not active. A colonoscopy also allows visualization and biopsy of mass lesions and strictures in Crohn's disease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IBD can be medically managed by 5-aminosalicylic acid agents such as sulfasalazine and mesalamine. Other drugs used are azathioprine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, glucocorticoids, and anti-tumor necrosis factors.&nbsp;Indications for surgery are extensive bleeding, <strong>intestinal obstruction</strong>, symptomatic <strong>perianal fistulas</strong>, and unresponsiveness to medical therapy.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;<strong>Annual screening for skin cancer</strong> is recommended in patients who are prescribed anti-tumor necrosis factor anti-TNF agents such as <strong>infliximab</strong> or <strong>adalimumab</strong>. These drugs increase the risk of developing <strong>melanoma</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Folate supplementation</strong> is recommended in patients on <strong>methotrexate</strong> in addition to liver function tests and CBC monitoring.</p>\n<p>Option D: The patient should <strong>avoid pregnancy while </strong>on<strong> treatment</strong> with<strong> methotrexate</strong>.

It has no association with ANCA, but about 30% of patients have<strong> </strong>chronic<strong> hepatitis B</strong>.

There can also be gastrointestinal and pulmonary manifestations, with disease mortality related to severe neurologic involvement or rupture of vascular aneurysms.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Giant cell arteritis</strong> is an inflammatory vasculitis of large vessels.
