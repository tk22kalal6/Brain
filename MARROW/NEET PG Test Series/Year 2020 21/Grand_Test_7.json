The lumbricals have a combined action on metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion and interphalangeal (IP) joint extension (glass holding posture). In ulnar nerve injury, since the medial lumbricals are not functional, the forearm muscles are unopposed.

Relative afferent pupillary defect is either absent or if present, mild.

Cotton wool spots and retinal edema may also be present.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Central retinal artery occlusion</strong> is characterised by sudden profound loss of vision, that is painless and visual acuity is severely reduced. Relative afferent pupillary defect is profound, giving rise to an amaurotic pupil and fundoscopy shows the presence of a cherry red spot at the region of the foveola.
