Myositis ossificans</strong> is a type of heterotopic ossification which occurs as a result of <strong>pathological connective tissue metaplasia.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Metaplasia</strong>&nbsp;is a reversible change in which <strong>one differentiated cell type</strong> (epithelial or mesenchymal) is <strong>replaced by another</strong> cell type.

Common examples- female breast during puberty and pregnancy, benign prostatic hyperplasia, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option (C):<strong> Hypertrophy</strong> is an increase in cell size and organ size which occurs in response to increased workload in tissues incapable of cell division.

The image shows the <strong>train-of-four stimulation (TOF). </strong>The image shows that following the administration of a muscle relaxant, the amplitude of all four twitches has declined to a similar extent. This is the pattern of <strong>depolarizing</strong> <strong>muscular block</strong>, which is seen characteristically in <strong>succinylcholine</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>TOF </strong>is a pattern of nerve stimulation used to monitor neuromuscular blockade. It consists of four supramaximal stimuli delivered no more than 10 seconds apart. It is calculated by dividing the amplitude of the fourth response by the amplitude of the first response and requires an objective measure of the response to stimulation. The TOF count denotes the number of detectable evoked responses, and it correlates to the degree of neuromuscular block</p>\n<p>With <strong>depolarizing block</strong>, as in SCh, <strong>phase 1</strong> will show a <strong>decrease in amplitude in all four twitches</strong> <strong>simultaneously</strong>, but no progressive decline in amplitude. If repeated doses or a prolonged infusion is given, <strong>phase 2 blockade</strong> with <strong>progressive decline</strong> in amplitude will be seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Succinylcholine</strong> is a <strong>depolarizing</strong> muscle relaxant. It acts by depolarizing the muscle similar to the action of acetylcholine. However, compared to acetylcholine, it acts for a longer duration and causes <strong>flaccid paralysis</strong>. It has a faster onset and shortest duration. It is administered <strong>intravenously</strong>. If there is no access to veins, it can also be administered <strong>intramuscularly</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is metabolized by <strong>butyrylcholinesterase</strong> (also known as pseudocholinesterase or plasma cholinesterase). In patients with deficiency of this enzyme, the recovery from this agent may be delayed.</p>\n<p>It is extensively used in the clinical setting for <strong>rapid sequence intubation</strong> due to its short onset of action</p>\n<p>Important side effects of these drugs are <strong>malignant hyperthermia</strong>, rhabdomyolysis, fasciculations, <strong>bradycardia</strong>, and hyperkalemia.

This method is applicable mainly to estimate the age of dead infants.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option B- <strong>Stack&rsquo;s method</strong>:&nbsp;Determination of age is done from the weight of the erupting teeth of the fetus/ infant. It can be used on both deciduous and permanent teeth in their erupting phase.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option C-<strong> Miles' method:</strong>&nbsp;Age estimation is made on the basis of a comparison of the amount of wear on all three permanent molars with the baseline. It is used to determine the age beyond 25 years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D- <strong>Gustafson&rsquo;s Method:&nbsp;</strong>It&nbsp;is based on&nbsp;physiological changes in teeth. It is used to determine the age between 25-60 years. Gustafson&rsquo;s criteria include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attrition:</strong>&nbsp;Wear and tear changes of the occlusal surface.</li>\n<li><strong>Periodontosis:</strong>&nbsp;Regression of gums surrounding the tooth resulting in loosening of the tooth and falling.</li>\n<li><strong>Secondary dentin:</strong>&nbsp;Deposition of dentin in the pulp cavity.</li>\n<li><strong>Cementum apposition:</strong>&nbsp;Deposition of cementum in the root forming incremental lines.</li>\n<li><strong>Root resorption:</strong>&nbsp;Involves both cementum and dentin.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency of the root</strong>: This is<strong>&nbsp;the most reliable&nbsp;</strong>criterion.
