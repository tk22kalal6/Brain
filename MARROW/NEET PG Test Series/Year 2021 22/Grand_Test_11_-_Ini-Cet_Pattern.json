It is used in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A. It has antiparkinsonian activity.&nbsp;It alters dopamine release in the striatum, has anticholinergic properties, and <strong>blocks methyl-D-aspartate</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>NMDA) receptors</strong>.

After administrating levodopa, there is improvement in the symptoms for a period of 1&ndash;2 h, but rigidity and akinesia return rapidly after the effect of the drug reduces. Increasing the dose and frequency of administration can improve this phenomenon, but the patients often develop dyskinesia and excessive abnormal involuntary movements.</p>\n<p>In the later stages of the disease, patients may <strong>fluctuate rapidly</strong> between being &ldquo;<strong>off</strong>,&rdquo; having no beneficial effects from their medications, and being &ldquo;on&rdquo; having some beneficial effects but along with side effects.</p>\n<p>Levodopa, if administered alone will undergo decarboxylation by the decarboxylases present in the intestinal mucosa and other peripheral sites.

      "solution": "<p>The correct sequence of cellular events that occurs during inflammation is as follows: <strong>Rolling, Cytokine-mediated integrin activation, Adhesion, Migration</strong>.</p>\n<p>The recruitment of leucocytes to the site of inflammation is a multi-step process that is mediated by adhesion molecules and cytokines called chemokines. This process can be divided into sequential phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the lumen: margination, <strong>rolling</strong> and <strong>adhesion</strong> to the endothelium occurs.</li>\n<li><strong>Migration</strong> of the leucocytes across the endothelium and vessel wall</li>\n<li><strong>Migration</strong> in the tissues towards a chemotactic stimulus.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The process of leucocyte recruitment is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Margination: Because of the dilation of the inflamed postcapillary venues, there is stasis of blood flow, and hence, more leucocytes assume a peripheral position along the endothelial surface; this process of leucocyte redistribution is called margination.</li>\n<li><strong>Rolling</strong>: The slowed down leucocytes then sense the signals from the endothelium and start rolling on the vessel wall.</li>\n<li><strong>Cytokine-mediated integrin activation</strong>: The attachment of leucocytes to the endothelial cells requires adhesion molecules that are activated by cytokines. The major families of proteins involved in adhesion and migration are <strong>selectins</strong> and <strong>integrins</strong> and their ligands.</li>\n<li><strong>Adhesions</strong>: The weak rolling interactions slow down the leucocytes and allow them to bind more firmly to the endothelium. <strong>Chemokines</strong> that were produced at the site of injury bind to the endothelial cell proteoglycans. These chemokines then bind to the rolling leucocytes and activate them. This, in turn, converts the ligands for β1 and β2 integrins, <strong>VLA-4,</strong> and <strong>LFA-1 </strong>present on the leucocytes to a <strong>high-affinity state</strong>.</li>\n<li>This combination of cytokine-induced expression of integrin ligands on the endothelium and increased integrin affinity on the leucocytes leads to firm <strong>adhesion</strong> of leucocytes to the endothelium at the site of inflammation.</li>\n<li>Leucocyte<strong> migration</strong>: This is the movement of leucocytes through the intact endothelium, called transmigration or diapedesis. This occurs in postcapillary venules. This migration occurs through the inter-endothelial gap towards the chemical concentration gradient created by the chemokines at the site of injury. This occurs with the help of adhesion molecules present in the intercellular junctions such as <strong>platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule</strong> (<strong>PECAM-1</strong>) or <strong>CD31</strong>. </li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/13f6cf1070f84ca2831df8bddc1eb8ecx1280x1743.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Principal Mediators of Inflammation and Their Source</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mediator</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Source</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Histamine</td>\n<td>Mast&ensp;cells,&ensp;basophils,&ensp;platelets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prostaglandins</td>\n<td>Mast&ensp;cells,&ensp;leukocytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leukotrienes</td>\n<td>Mast&ensp;cells,&ensp;leukocytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cytokines&ensp;(TNF,&ensp;IL-1,&ensp;IL-6)</td>\n<td>Macrophages,&ensp;endothelial&ensp;cells, mast&ensp;cells</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chemokines</td>\n<td>Leukocytes,&ensp;activated&ensp;macrophages</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platelet-activating&ensp;factor</td>\n<td>Leukocytes,&ensp;mast&ensp;cells</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complement</td>\n<td>Plasma&ensp;(produced&ensp;in&ensp;liver)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kinins</td>\n<td>Plasma&ensp;(produced&ensp;in&ensp;liver)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Various actions of Principal Mediators of Inflammation</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Histamine</td>\n<td>Vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, endothelial activation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prostaglandins</td>\n<td>Vasodilation, pain, fever</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leukotrienes</td>\n<td>Increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis, leukocyte adhesion, and activation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cytokines (TNF, IL-1, IL-6)</td>\n<td>\n<p>Local: endothelial activation (expression of adhesion molecules).</p>\n<p>Systemic: fever, metabolic abnormalities, hypotension (shock)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chemokines</td>\n<td>Chemotaxis, leukocyte activation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platelet-activating factor</td>\n<td>Vasoconstriction, Vasodilation (at low concentration), increased vascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion, chemotaxis, degranulation, oxidative burst</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complement</td>\n<td>Leukocyte chemotaxis and activation, direct target killing (membrane attack complex), vasodilation (mast cell stimulation)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kinins</td>\n<td>Increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, vasodilation, pain</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>Note: Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is a prostaglandin, which is a potent <strong>vasoconstrictor</strong></p>",

The drug of choice for long-term management of panic disorder is <strong>paroxetine, </strong>which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).</p>\n<p>A <strong>panic attack</strong> is an abrupt surge of <strong>intense fear</strong> or intense discomfort lasting from minutes to hours. <strong>Recurrent </strong>and<strong> unexpected panic attacks</strong>, at least one of which is associated with 1 month of either persistent concern or worry about additional attacks, or a change in behavior related to the attacks.</p>\n<p>An attack often begins <strong>with 10 minutes of rapid worsening of symptoms.</strong> This includes an extreme <strong>fear</strong> and a sense of <strong>impending doom</strong> and death along with <strong>tachycardia</strong>, <strong>palpitations</strong>, <strong>dyspnea</strong>, and <strong>sweating</strong>. The attack generally lasts for up to half an hour but in some cases may last for more than an hour. Between attacks, the patient may suffer from anticipatory anxiety about the next attack. </p>\n<p>DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder:</p>\n<p>A. <strong>Recurrent unexpected panic attacks</strong> which include <strong>≥4</strong> of the following </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Palpitations</li>\n<li>Trembling</li>\n<li>Sweating</li>\n<li>Dyspnea</li>\n<li>Choking</li>\n<li>Chest pain</li>\n<li>Nausea, abdominal distress</li>\n<li>Chills, heat sensation</li>\n<li>Dizziness, light-headedness</li>\n<li>Paresthesias</li>\n<li>Derealization or depersonalization</li>\n<li>Fear of losing control</li>\n<li>Fear of death</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2. At least 1 attack followed by one or both of the following for <strong>&gt;1 month</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anticipatory anxiety - Continuous concern about additional panic attacks</li>\n<li>Changes in behavior related to attacks (e.g. avoidance of unfamiliar situations)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3. The attack is not attributable to substance abuse or any other medical condition.</p>\n<p>4. The attack cannot be explained by any other mental disorder. </p>\n<p>Treatment</p>\n<p>Presently, <strong>SSRIs</strong> are considered the first-line drugs for the treatment of panic disorder. <strong>Paroxetine</strong> is preferred due to its <strong>sedative</strong> <strong>effects</strong> which calm down patients immediately leading to better compliance. <strong>Citalopram</strong> or <strong>sertraline</strong> are viable alternatives as well. However, for an acute episode with severe symptoms, benzodiazepines like <strong>alprazolam</strong> should be started <strong>concurrently</strong> <strong>with SSRIs</strong> and slowly tapered off. This is because benzodiazepines have the most rapid onset of action. Pharmacotherapy should generally continue for <strong>8-12 months</strong> when it is found to be effective.</p>\n<p>Other than pharmacotherapy, <strong>cognitive</strong> and <strong>behavior therapies</strong> are also very effective treatments for panic disorder. These work especially well when used in combination with pharmacotherapy. These help in producing <strong>long-lasting remissions</strong> of symptoms.</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Alprazolam</strong> is a benzodiazepine with a <strong>high risk of psychological</strong> and <strong>physical</strong> <strong>dependence</strong> if used in the long term. Therefore it is used as an adjunct to SSRIs or psychotherapy and not used as a primary treatment.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Phenelzine</strong> is a <strong>monoamine oxidase</strong> inhibitor. MAOIs may require certain dietary restrictions and hence are used less often.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Imipramine</strong> is a tricyclic anti-depressant that can be used for panic disorder as a second-line drug. TCAs are used less often than SSRIs because they are associated with <strong>more adverse effects</strong> at the dosages required for the treatment of panic disorder. </p>\n<p> </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Anxiety disorders</h3><div>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Disorder&nbsp;</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Feature</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Panic disorder</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>1.

These children are susceptible to recurrent infections, and without a bone marrow transplant, they usually die within the first year of life. </p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Bruton tyrosine kinase (</strong><strong><em>BTK</em>)</strong> gene is mutated in <strong>X-linked agammaglobulinemia. </strong>It occurs because the B-cells fail to undergo maturation. <strong>All lines</strong> of <strong>immunoglobulins</strong> are found to be <strong>low</strong> in this disease. Since it is an <strong>X-linked</strong> disorder, it is most commonly seen in <strong>young males</strong>. They present <strong>after</strong> the age of <strong>6 months</strong> with recurrent respiratory tract infections.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (</strong><strong><em>WASP</em>) </strong>gene is mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. This is also an <strong>X-linked</strong> disorder that presents with <strong>eczema, thrombocytopenia</strong>, and <strong>recurrent infections. </strong>They usually show <strong>low IgM</strong> levels, normal IgG, and elevated IgE and IgA levels.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Primary immunodeficiency disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Affected component</strong><strong>&nbsp;of the immune system</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Disorder</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Humoral immunity:&nbsp;</strong>Problems with<strong> B cells</strong>&nbsp;and their <strong>antibody&nbsp;</strong><strong>production</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Common variable immunodeficiency</li>\n<li>Selective immunoglobulin deficiency, such as IgA deficiency</li>\n<li>Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy</li>\n<li>X-linked agammaglobulinemia</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Cellular immunity:&nbsp;</strong>Problems with<strong> T cells&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis</li>\n<li>DiGeorge syndrome</li>\n<li>X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Combined </strong>humoral and cellular immunity:&nbsp;Problems with<strong> B and T cells</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Ataxia-telangiectasia</li>\n<li>Hyperimmunoglobulinemia M syndrome</li>\n<li>Severe combined immunodeficiency</li>\n<li>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Phagocytes:&nbsp;</strong>Problems with the<strong> movement or killing&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronic granulomatous disease</li>\n<li>Ch&eacute;diak-Higashi syndrome&nbsp;(rare)</li>\n<li>Tuftsin deficiency</li>\n<li>Cyclic neutropenia</li>\n<li>Leukocyte adhesion defects</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Complement </strong>proteins:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Deficiency of complement </strong>proteins</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Complement component 1 (C1) inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema)</li>\n<li>Terminal complement deficiency (C5-C9): Recurrent Neisseria infections</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Properties of immunoglobulin classes</h3><p><strong>IgG:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half-life- 23 days</li>\n<li>Appears late, indicates <strong>chronic infection</strong></li>\n<li>It is the only maternal Ig to cross the placenta.</li>\n<li>Has 4 subclasses.</li>\n<li>Causes complement fixation, precipitation, and neutralization of toxins and virus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IgM</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half-life- 5 days</li>\n<li>Has the highest molecular weight and is a pentamer.</li>\n<li>Polysaccharides and lipids mainly stimulate IgM secretion.</li>\n<li>Intravascular distribution.</li>\n<li>Appears early, indicates <strong>recent infection.</strong></li>\n<li>Acts<strong>&nbsp;</strong>as surface immunoglobulin on the B cells.</li>\n<li>It causes agglutination, hemolysis, complement fixation and opsonization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IgD:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half-life- 2-8 days.</li>\n<li>Acts as a surface immunoglobulin on the B cells.</li>\n<li>Serves as recognition receptors for antigens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IgE:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half-life- 1-5 days</li>\n<li>Causes type I hypersensitivity.</li>\n<li>It is the only heat labile antibody.</li>\n<li>Levels are raised in helminthic infections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IgA:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Half-life- 6 days</li>\n<li>It is of 2 types- Serum IgA and Secretory IgA&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Secretory IgA (A dimer) results in mucosal immunity.</li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>The given scenario of depression, irritability, sudden mood fluctuations, and alcohol abuse for the past 3 years is suggestive of <strong>cyclothymic disorder.</strong></p>\n<p>Cyclothymia presents as a <strong>mild</strong> form of <strong>bipolar II disorder,</strong> characterized by symptoms of <strong>hypomania</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>mild depression</strong>. Hypomania mainly includes symptoms like <strong>persistently elevated </strong>or<strong> irritable mood</strong> and abnormally <strong>increased energy</strong> lasting for at least&nbsp;<strong>4 consecutive days.</strong> The depression seen in cyclothymia does not qualify the criteria for a major depressive episode.</p>\n<p>Around half of the patients complain of <strong>depression</strong> as their <strong>major symptom</strong> but some may have primarily hypomanic symptoms. Most of these patients have <strong>problems</strong> in their <strong>social</strong> and <strong>professional lives</strong> due to this disorder. The mood changes are abrupt and occur within hours leading to a great amount of stress. This makes patients feel that they are out of control.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Substances like <strong>alcohol, benzodiazepines</strong>, or <strong>marijuana</strong> are often used to self-medicate. In some cases during the hypomanic state patients may take cocaine, amphetamines, or hallucinogens to further stimulate themselves.</p>\n<p>The <strong>DSM-5 criteria</strong> for diagnosis of cyclothymia:</p>\n<p>A. For at least <strong>2 years</strong> (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been many periods with <strong>hypomanic</strong> symptoms <strong>not meeting the criteria</strong> for a <strong>manic</strong> <strong>episode</strong> and many periods with <strong>depressive</strong> symptoms <strong>not meeting the criteria</strong> for a <strong>major depressive episode.</strong></p>\n<p>B. During the above 2-year period (1 year in children and adolescents), the hypomanic and depressive periods have been present for at least half the time and the individual has not had a <strong>symptom-free interval</strong> of more than <strong>2 months.</strong></p>\n<p>C. Criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have never been met.</p>\n<p>D. The symptoms in criterion A are not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.</p>\n<p>E. The symptoms cannot be explained by the physiological effects of a substance or any other medical condition.</p>\n<p>F. The symptoms cause significant difficulties in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.</p>\n<p>Mood stabilizers like<strong> lithium</strong> and antimanic drugs like <strong>sodium valproate</strong>&nbsp;are the first lines of treatment. <strong>Psychotherapy</strong> is a great way for patients to develop coping mechanisms to help with their mood swings. Patients often require <strong>life-long treatment.</strong></p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Major depressive disorder</strong> usually presents with depressed mood, anhedonia, significant change in weight or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness nearly every day. These symptoms are&nbsp;present for a minimum of <strong>2 weeks.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Adjustment disorder </strong>is characterized by emotional or behavioral symptoms that develop&nbsp;<strong>within 3 months of exposure</strong>&nbsp;to an identifiable stressor and usually&nbsp;<strong>do not last more than 6 months</strong>&nbsp;after the stressor ends.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Dysthymic&nbsp;disorder&nbsp;</strong>is the presence of a persistently depressed mood that lasts most of the day and is continuous. There are also feelings of guilt, irritability, and anger associated with it. These symptoms are present for at least 2 years.&nbsp;It is distinguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that patients mention that they have always been depressed. There will never be an episode of mania/hypomania in this condition.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Timeline in psychiatry</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Condition</strong></span></td>\n<td><span><strong>Duration</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Manic episode</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>At least 1 week</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Hypomania</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>At least 4 consecutive days</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Major depressive disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Lasts 6 to12 months with episodes for 2 or more weeks</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Cyclothymia</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>At least 2 years</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Dysthymia</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>At least 2 years</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Maternal blues</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Starts 2&ndash;3 days after delivery and usually resolves within 10 days</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Postpartum mood disturbances</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Onset within 4 weeks of delivery</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Brief psychotic disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &lt; 1 month, usually stress-related</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Schizophreniform disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts 1-6 months</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Schizophrenia</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 6 months</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Schizoaffective disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 2 weeks</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Delusional disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 1 month</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Panic disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>An episode followed by 1 month of concern of additional attacks&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Specific phobia</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 6 months</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 6 months&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Acute stress disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts between 3 days and 1 month&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>PTSD</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 1 month&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Adjustment disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Symptoms occur within 3 months of the stressor and last &lt; 6 months</span></p>\n<p><span>May last &gt; 6 months in presence of chronic stressor</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>At least 3 months</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Somatic symptom disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Lasts &gt; 6 months</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Separation anxiety disorder</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Common onset at 7&ndash;9 years&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>Tourette syndrome</strong></span></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Onset &lt; age 18 years</span></p>\n<p><span>Tics that persist for &gt; 1 year&nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span><strong>ADHD</strong></span></td>\n<td><span>Symptoms for &gt; 6 months&nbsp;</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Myositis ossificans</strong> is a type of heterotopic ossification which occurs as a result of <strong>pathological connective tissue metaplasia.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Metaplasia</strong>&nbsp;is a reversible change in which <strong>one differentiated cell type</strong> (epithelial or mesenchymal) is <strong>replaced by another</strong> cell type. It usually represents an adaptive response in which one cell type is replaced by another more capable of <strong>handling the stressor</strong>. Although, in the case of myositis ossificans, it is not clearly seen as an adaptive response.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Common examples of metaplasia include-<strong> Barrett's esophagus</strong> (squamous epithelium replaced by intestinal-like columnar cells due to chronic gastric reflux), columnar to squamous epithelium in the <strong>respiratory tract of chronic smokers.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Connective tissue metaplasia</strong> is the formation of cartilage, bone, or adipose tissue (mesenchymal tissues) in tissues that normally do not contain these elements.&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">Myositis ossificans is characterized by <strong>heterotopic</strong> bone formation within muscle tissue following traumatic injury to the area with hemorrhage into it. <strong>Heterotopia</strong> refers to the presence of normal cells in abnormal places. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are three types of heterotopic ossification known</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Myositis ossificans progressiva</strong>: A rare genetic condition with the autosomal dominant transmission with variable penetrance. This leads to recurrent painful soft-tissue swellings. Patients usually die from restrictive lung disease</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Traumatic myositis ossificans</strong>: This case develops after&nbsp;a single blow to the area, a muscle tear, or repeated minor&nbsp;trauma.&nbsp;The painful area gradually develops masses with a cartilaginous consistency and within 4-7 weeks, a solid mass of bone can be felt</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Neurogenic</strong>&nbsp;<strong>heterotopic ossification:&nbsp;</strong>Heterotopic bone formation around joints, limiting mobility. Seen in patients with traumatic brain or spinal cord injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options-</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option (B): <strong>Hyperplasia</strong> is increased cell number in response to hormones and growth factors that occur in tissues whose cells are able to divide and have abundant stem cell reserve. Common examples- female breast during puberty and pregnancy, benign prostatic hyperplasia, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option (C):<strong> Hypertrophy</strong> is an increase in cell size and organ size which occurs in response to increased workload in tissues incapable of cell division. Common examples- uterus during pregnancy, cardiac muscle in response to chronic hypertension (due to overload), skeletal muscles in bodybuilders, etc.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Three point bony relationship in elbow:</h3><p>The&nbsp;<strong>three bony points in the elbow</strong> are&nbsp;:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tip of the&nbsp;medial epicondyle</li>\n<li>Tip of the&nbsp;lateral epicondyle</li>\n<li>Olecranon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the <strong>elbow</strong> is in <strong>90 degrees of flexion</strong>, these points form an&nbsp;isosceles <strong>triangle</strong>.

A majority&nbsp;of them have <strong>thymic hyperplasia</strong>, while some&nbsp;have a thymic tumor called a <strong>thymoma</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Thymoma</strong> is the <strong>most common </strong>mass found in the <strong>anterior mediastinum. </strong>It arises from the thymus gland and is usually seen&nbsp;in adults greater than 40 years of age. It can be identified by performing a chest X-ray, but this has now been replaced by <strong>CT</strong> as the <strong>diagnostic procedure of choice</strong>. A chest CT is also able&nbsp;to differentiate between thymoma and lymphoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Anti-AChR antibodies </strong>seen in myasthenia gravis&nbsp;block acetylcholine receptors at the post-synaptic membrane.

      "solution": "<p>The clinical presentation of profuse bleeding from minor wounds, prolonged APTT, with normal PT and platelet count suggests <strong>Von Willebrand disease</strong> as the most probable diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder which occurs due to <strong>deficiency</strong> of or <strong>defect</strong> in <strong>von Willebrand factor</strong> (vWF). vWF is stored in endothelial cells and in platelet Weibel-Palade bodies. It has two important functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adhesion</strong> of the <strong>platelets </strong>to injured subendothelium</li>\n<li><strong>Carrier protein</strong> for <strong>factor VIII </strong>and preventing its degradation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clinical features include spontaneous bleeding from mucous membranes (epistaxis), excessive bleeding from wounds, or menorrhagia, after dental extractions and surgeries including tonsillectomies. Most individuals are asymptomatic otherwise.

Deficiency of vWF results in <strong>Factor VIII deficiency</strong> and prolongation of aPTT in this disease. Prolonged BT is due to abnormal platelet-mediated hemostasis.</p>\n<p><strong>Classification</strong></p>\n<p>Three types are recognized, with phenotypic variations:</p>\n<p><strong>Type 1 and type 3</strong> von Willebrand disease are associated with <strong>quantitative defects</strong> in vWF.</p>\n<p><strong>Type 1</strong> is an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> disorder characterized by a <strong>mild to moderate</strong> vWF deficiency, accounting for about 70% of all cases. </p>\n<p><strong>Type 3</strong> disease is an <strong>autosomal recessive disorder</strong> resulting in little to <strong>no vWF synthesis</strong>. Because vWF stabilizes factor VIII in the circulation, factor VIII levels are also reduced in type 3 disease and the associated bleeding disorder is often <strong>severe</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Type 2</strong> von Willebrand disease is characterized by <strong>qualitative defects in vWF.</strong> Type 2A is the most common. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder.</p>\n<p>Treatment:<strong> Desmopressin</strong> for <strong>type 1 vWD</strong> stimulates the release of vWF and Factor VIII from the endothelial stores. <strong>Von Willebrand factor (VWF) concentrates</strong> in cases of<strong> type 2 and type 3 von Willebrand disease</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Options A and B: <strong>B</strong><strong>ernard–Soulier syndrome</strong> and <strong>Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia </strong>are caused due to <strong>deficiency of Gp Ib-IX receptor and deficiency Gp IIb/IIIa receptor</strong> respectively. In both these conditions, PTT is normal, with only an increase in bleeding time.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura</strong> is characterized by the pentad of fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, abnormal renal function, and central nervous system (CNS).

An upward extension of this incision (shown in the figure above) is known as the <strong>Mercedes-Benz extension</strong>, mimicking the logo of the car manufacturer of the same name. This extension provides even <strong>further access </strong>to the <strong>upper abdomen </strong>and<strong> lower part </strong>of the <strong>mediastinum, </strong>and is used primarily in liver transplant surgery or in case there is an epigastric pathology that has to be accessed.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option (A): The incision <strong>labeled 4</strong> is the <strong>Pfannenstiel incision</strong>. It is a <strong>transverse</strong> incision made above the pubic symphysis and is used for <strong>pelvic procedures</strong> - most commonly during cesarean sections. </p>\n<p>Option (B): The incision <strong>labeled 2</strong> is the <strong>paramedian incision.</strong> This is used for abdominal procedures. However, it is being replaced by transverse incisions, to reduce injury to vessels and nerves that also run transversely. The paramedian incision also restricts access to the opposite side of the abdomen, and so it is used very rarely in modern surgery.</p>\n<p>Option (D): The incision <strong>labeled 3</strong> is the <strong>McBurney incision/Gridiron incision.</strong> It is an oblique incision that is made one-third of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. It is the classical incision used during open appendicectomy.</p>\n<p>The image below shows all the important incisions used in abdominal surgery-</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/886a8380b49c427a83d553c089b089c0x1280x1538.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other incicions:</p>\n<p><strong>Midline incision</strong> is the most common incision used for laparotomy. It is a vertical incision that follows the linea alba which is particularly favored in diagnostic laparotomy. It allows wide access to most of the abdominal cavity.</p>\n<p><strong>Battle incision</strong> is a lower right paramedian incision but placed more laterally than the standard paramedian incision. It is suitable for dealing with acute appendicitis and pathologies in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.</p>\n<p><strong>Lanz incision </strong>is a transverse or skin crease incision for appendicitis, 2 cm below the umbilicus, centered on the midclavicular–mid-inguinal line. </p>\n<p><strong>Transverse incision</strong> is a supraumbilical transverse incision offers excellent exposure of the upper abdomen. A transverse incision may be superior to a midline incision in terms of recovery and complications postoperatively.</p>",

The <strong>length</strong> of the wound is more than the depth and width. The edges are well-defined and usually everted, free from contusions and abrasions. It is usually <strong>spindle-shaped</strong>. The depth is higher at the commencement and progressively becomes shallower, known as tailing. Tailing determines the direction of the force applied when creating the wound.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a23bd457e49047e9b0351a28b0bc2272x512x236.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option B- Chop wounds or slash wounds are the wounds produced by <strong>chopping motion</strong>, made with heavy and sharp weapons like <strong>axe</strong>, cleave, etc. The dimensions of the wound correspond to the crosssection of the penetrating part of the weapon. The margins are sharp and show slight abrasion and bruising with the destruction of underlying organs.

The shape of the surface wound depends on the type of weapon, cutting surface, the direction of thrust, cleavage lines, etc. The shape of the wound is usually triangular or wedge-shaped.

      "solution": "<p>Emptying of the stomach is not inhibited, but rather increased by the secretion of <strong>gastrin</strong>. Gastrin promotes emptying of the stomach by <strong>stimulating</strong> the motor functions of the stomach, especially the <strong>pyloric pump</strong>.</p>\n<p>After food enters the duodenum, the duodenal entero-gastric nerve reflexes ensure the inhibition of emptying of the stomach. This mainly includes 3 pathways. They are, via the <strong>enteric nervous system</strong> directly from the duodenum, via extrinsic nerves that go to the prevertebral <strong>sympathetic ganglia</strong> and then back through the sympathetic fibres to the stomach and finally via the <strong>vagus nerve</strong> that inhibits the excitatory signals to the stomach at the level of the brainstem. These reflexes <strong>inhibit </strong>the<strong> pyloric pump</strong> propulsive contractions and also <strong>increase </strong>the<strong> tone</strong> of the <strong>pyloric sphincter.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gastrin</strong> is a hormone secreted by <strong>G cells</strong> located in the pyloric glands of the stomach. It is released into the blood, following which it is transported to the <strong>enterochromaffin-like cells</strong> of the <strong>stomach</strong>, resulting in the release of <strong>histamine</strong>, which stimulates gastric hydrochloric acid secretion.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Increased acidity</strong> of <strong>chyme</strong> inhibits the emptying of the stomach by irritating the entero-gastric inhibitory reflexes of the duodenum. It prevents the subsequent release of stomach contents into the duodenum until the acidic chyme that is already present is neutralised.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Distension of the duodenum</strong> inhibits the emptying of the stomach via the enteric nervous system.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Cholecystokinin</strong> secretion decreases the motility of the stomach as a result of its inhibitory effect on gastrin. It is a hormone that is released from the mucosa of the jejunum and is sensitive to the presence of fats in the duodenum.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Source and actions of gastrointestinal hormones</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Action</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gastrin</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>CCK</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Secretin</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>GIP</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Motilin</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>G cells in the stomach (antrum)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>I cells of duodenum and jejunum</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>S cells deep in the mucosa of upper small intestine</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>K cells in mucosa of duodenum and jejunum</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 749\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Mo cells of the duodenum and jejunum</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Acid secretion</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gastric emptying</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>I</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Pancreatic HCO<sup>3-</sup></strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Pancreatic enzymes</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Insulin release</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gall bladder contraction</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Biliary&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>HCO<sup>3-</sup></strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Gastric motility</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Intestinal motility</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Mucosal growth</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Exocrine pancreas growth</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>S</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><strong>KEY</strong></p>\n<p>S&rarr;Stimulates</p>\n<p>I&rarr; Inhibits</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Factors regulating gastric emptying</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Factors that Increase gastric emptying</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Factors that Decrease gastric emptying</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Distension of the stomach</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Distension of the duodenum</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Food rich in carbohydrate</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Food rich in fats &gt; proteins</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Stimulation of parasympathetic nervous system</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Stimulation of sympathetic nervous system</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Presence of fat in duodenum</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>High acidity (low pH) of the duodenal chyme</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Isotonic chyme</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypertonic &gt;&gt;hypotonic duodenal content</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Breakdown products of protein digestion in the duodenum</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Presence of any irritation in the duodenal mucosa</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gastrin</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>CCK, Secretin, GIP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

The main function of this protein is to <strong>inhibit G1 </strong>to<strong> S transition</strong> during the cell cycle progression. Hence, it controls proliferation by regulating an important step in cell division. <strong>Both</strong> the <strong>RB genes</strong> must undergo <strong>mutation</strong> in order for a child to develop retinoblastoma (<strong>Knudson's two-hit hypothesis)</strong>. These mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion or may be sporadic. Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor seen in children.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Menin</strong> is a protein that normally functions as a <strong>transcription factor.</strong> It is derived from the <strong>MEN I gene</strong>. Mutations in this gene result in the <strong>MEN I syndrome</strong> (multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome I) which presents with tumors of the pituitary, pancreas, and parathyroid.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>p53</strong> is a protein that is involved in <strong>cell cycle arrest</strong> and <strong>apoptosis</strong> in <strong>response</strong> to <strong>DNA damage</strong>. A mutated p53 results in the proliferation of damaged cells that can ultimately lead to cancerous cell lines. This mutation is seen very commonly in <strong>Li Fraumeni syndrome, </strong>which can present with a broad spectrum of tumors such as breast cancer, adrenocortical tumors, leukemias, etc. </p>\n<p>4. <strong>E-cadherin</strong> is a protein derived from the <strong>gene CDH 1.</strong> This protein is responsible for <strong>cell adhesion</strong> and inhibiting cell motility. Its mutation can result in <strong>familial gastric cancer</strong>. Mutations in E-cadherin are also thought to be responsible for metastasis in breast cancer.</p>\n<p>5.<strong> STK11 </strong>is normally a <strong>cell growth suppressor</strong>.

There are generally <strong>no symptoms</strong> associated with avascular necrosis. However, if the fracture does not unite, then there will be pain. </p>\n<p>An X-ray will reveal <strong>increased density.</strong> This occurs due to disuse osteoporosis in the surrounding areas and the collapse of trabeculae compacts the bone. There may also be deformity due to collapse of necrotic bone and osteoarthritis. </p>\n<p>In <strong>osteonecrosis</strong> of the femur, an X-ray will reveal a <strong>crescent sign</strong> which is pathognomonic. The sign refers to the subchondral fracture that overlies the necrotic segment of the femoral head. </p>\n<p>A bone scan may reveal a '<strong>cold area</strong>' before radiological features are evident. </p>\n<p><strong>MRI</strong> is the <strong>imaging modality of choice</strong> in avascular necrosis as it allows for staging and determination of extent of involvement. </p>\n<p>It is treated depending on the joint involved. <strong>Weight-bearing</strong> should be <strong>delayed</strong> <strong>until</strong> it is <strong>revascularized</strong>, a process that may take <strong>6-8 months</strong>. Revascularization can be done by <strong>using vascularized bone grafts</strong> taken from the greater trochanter in the case of a fracture of the femur neck.

It generally affects the <strong>extensor surfaces</strong>, scalp, and lumbosacral region.</p>\n<p>It is linked to infiltration of the skin by <strong>activated T cells</strong> which cause the&nbsp;<strong>proliferation of keratinocytes</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>This child, with lethargy, seizures and hypoketotic hypoglycemia is <strong>likely</strong> to have <strong>medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency</strong>. Among the given options, hypoketotic hypoglycemia can be caused only by medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency</strong> is the most common <strong>disorder</strong> associated with <strong>mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation</strong>. It is also one of the most common<strong> inborn errors of metabolism</strong>. MCAD is an important enzyme involved in fatty acid <strong>beta-oxidation</strong>. This process is <strong>important in</strong> the production of <strong>ketone bodies</strong> as an energy source when blood glucose levels are low.</p>\n<p>It is usually <strong>diagnosed at birth</strong> during <strong>routine screening</strong> for disorders of the newborn. However, <strong>sometimes</strong>, it can be detected <strong>within</strong> the <strong>first two years of life</strong>. </p>\n<p>These babies present with <strong>vomiting</strong> that progresses to <strong>lethargy</strong> and <strong>seizures,</strong> <strong>triggered by mild illness</strong>. The common laboratory results seen in these patients result from a failure to synthesize ketone bodies during episodes of hypoglycemia. Hence, the child will present with <strong>hypoketotic hypoglycemia</strong>. The <strong>diagnosis</strong> can be confirmed with a combination of <strong>biochemical </strong>and <strong>genetic testing</strong>. This illness, once diagnosed can be easily <strong>managed with small frequent meals</strong>, to avoid a state of hypoglycemia. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option (B)- <strong>Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency</strong> can result in <strong>phenylketonuria</strong>. This is an inborn error of metabolism in which phenylalanine is unable to convert to tyrosine, resulting in the <strong>accumulation of phenylalanine</strong>. This results in the characteristic<strong> 'musty' odor</strong> of the urine and body fluids. These children can also present with <strong>seizures </strong>and hyperactivity. In fact, many of the symptoms result from <strong>increased phenylpyruvate (a ketoacid)</strong> derived from the buildup of phenylalanine in this condition.</p>\n<p>Option (C)-<strong> UMP synthase</strong> is an enzyme <strong>deficiency</strong> that results in <strong>orotic aciduria</strong>. This disorder is an <strong>inborn error of pyrimidine metabolism</strong> that presents with developmental delay, failure to thrive, and possibly epilepsy. Laboratory testing reveals <strong>pancytopenia.</strong>  </p>\n<p>Option (D)- <strong>HMG CoA reductase</strong> is an important enzyme involved in the <strong>synthesis of cholesterol.</strong> This enzyme is<strong> targeted by statins</strong>, which are prescribed in hypercholesterolemia, and in patients at risk for cardiovascular events. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Rothera's Test Procedure</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/73b9ba92c9384966a6760940ce51d4fcx287x140.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>Rothera's test, positive for ketone bodies.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Inborn Errors of Amino Acid Metabolism and Their Associated Urine Odor</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Inborn Error of Metabolism</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Urine Odor</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Maple syrup urine disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Maple syrup</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hawkinsinuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Swimming pool</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cat urine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Isovaleric acidemia</p>\n<p>Glutaric acidemia (type II)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sweaty feet</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hypermethioninemia</p>\n<p>Tyrosinemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Boiled cabbage</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Multiple carboxylase deficiency</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tomcat urine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Phenylketonuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Mousy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Trimethylaminuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rotting fish</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Oasthouse syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dried malt/hops</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types, Location and Properties of Fatty acid oxidation</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Types of Oxidation</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Location</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Properties</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Associated Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Beta oxidation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Mitochondria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>A catabolic process by which two-carbons are cleaved from the fatty acid molecule and released as acetyl CoA starting from the carboxyl end.</p>\n<p>The chain is broken between the &alpha;(2) and&nbsp;&beta;(3) carbon.</p>\n<p>1 round of beta-oxidation yield 1FADH2, 1NADH, and 1 Acetyl CoA.</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Alpha oxidation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Peroxisome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The presence of the 3-methyl group of phytanic acid prevents degradation by beta-oxidation.</p>\n<p>The chain is broken between the terminal carboxyl group and &alpha;(2) carbon removing that carbon as CO2.

The image shows the <strong>train-of-four stimulation (TOF). </strong>The image shows that following the administration of a muscle relaxant, the amplitude of all four twitches has declined to a similar extent. This is the pattern of <strong>depolarizing</strong> <strong>muscular block</strong>, which is seen characteristically in <strong>succinylcholine</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>TOF </strong>is a pattern of nerve stimulation used to monitor neuromuscular blockade. It consists of four supramaximal stimuli delivered no more than 10 seconds apart. It is calculated by dividing the amplitude of the fourth response by the amplitude of the first response and requires an objective measure of the response to stimulation. The TOF count denotes the number of detectable evoked responses, and it correlates to the degree of neuromuscular block</p>\n<p>With <strong>depolarizing block</strong>, as in SCh, <strong>phase 1</strong> will show a <strong>decrease in amplitude in all four twitches</strong> <strong>simultaneously</strong>, but no progressive decline in amplitude.
