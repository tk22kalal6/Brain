The two most important ANCAs are <strong>anti-proteinase 3</strong> and <strong>anti-myeloperoxidase</strong>.</p>\n<p>SLE is an <strong>autoimmune disease</strong> that is seen more commonly in <strong>women</strong>. The abnormal immune response leads to the production of various forms of nucleic acids, proteins, and self-antigens. This, in turn, leads to the production of <strong>autoantibodies</strong>. In most cases, autoantibodies can be detected years before the start of clinical symptoms.

Also, multiple myeloma has a <strong>spike</strong> of <strong>IgG</strong> in the majority of the cases.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Amyloidosis</strong> involves the <strong>extracellular deposition</strong> of <strong>fibrillary proteins</strong>.
