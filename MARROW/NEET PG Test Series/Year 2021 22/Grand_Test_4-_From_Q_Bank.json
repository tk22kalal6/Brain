This facilitates the movement of O<sub>2</sub> from the mother to fetus. The cause of this greater affinity is the <strong>poor binding of 2,3-DPG by ɣ polypeptide chains</strong> that replace &beta; chains in Hb F. The fetal oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is thus<strong> shifted to the left</strong> relative to the adult curve. Typically, fetal arterial Po<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;is low, hence leftward shift enhances placental uptake of O<sub>2</sub>.</p>",
