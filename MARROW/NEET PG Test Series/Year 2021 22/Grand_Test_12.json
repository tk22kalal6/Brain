As the synovial membrane and subchondral bone have a common blood supply, a simultaneous infection may be seen.</p>\n<p>The patient presents with complaints of pain, swelling, fever and night sweats, loss of weight, and restricted joint movement. As articular erosion progresses, <strong>deformity</strong> of the joint becomes apparent. The patient begins <strong>limping</strong> and the knee is kept <strong>flexed</strong>. Discharging <strong>sinuses</strong> may be present.</p>\n<p>During the night, subsequent to local muscle relaxation, there is stretching to compression of the affected tissues at night, leading to periods of intense pain called '<strong>night cries</strong>'.</p>\n<p>An X-ray shows the bone ends having a '<strong>washed out</strong>' appearance with narrowing of joint space. Epiphyseal enlargement, soft-tissue swelling, and peri-articular osteoporosis are observed. In the later stages, there is subarticular bone erosion on both sides of the joint with an absence of periosteal reaction.</p>\n<p>On further investigation, the Mantoux test or Heaf test will be positive and there is an elevated ESR. Synovial fluid appears <strong>cloudy</strong> on aspiration; a culture of this fluid or that of synovial biopsy specimen shows the growth of <em>M.Tuberculosis</em>.</p>\n<p>Management involves both conservative and operative procedures. The affected knee is immobilized by below-knee skin traction and plaster of Paris cast above-knee. Antitubercular chemotherapy is started.</p>\n<p>Operative procedures are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Synovectomy</strong> in cases of synovial tuberculosis</li>\n<li><strong>Joint debridement</strong> when articular cartilage is preserved</li>\n<li><strong>Arthrodesis</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other options:<br /><br />Option A: <strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> is the chronic non-suppurative inflammation of the synovial joints. It occurs between the ages of 20 to 50 years and women are more commonly affected. The presence of four or more of the following is indicative of rheumatoid arthritis: Morning stiffness, swelling of three or more specified joints, swelling of joints in the hands and wrist, symmetrical swellings, rheumatoid nodule, rheumatoid factor positive, X-ray showing erosion or unequivocal peri-articular osteopenia.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Osteoarthritis</strong> is a degenerative disease primarily affecting the articular cartilage, which occurs in elderly people, mostly in weight-bearing joints of the lower limb such as the knee and hip when the disease is primary and is usually bilateral. Secondary osteoarthritis occurs due to an underlying disease of the joint such as avascular necrosis, coxa vara, and malunited fractures of the hip. It occurs at any age after adolescence and commonly affects the hip.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Psoriatic arthropathy</strong> presents as a polyarthritis, with the involvement of distal interphalangeal joints. It is also associated with the presence of psoriatic skin disease, nail disease characterized by onycholysis, pitting, splinter hemorrhages, and ocular disease in the form of uveitis.</p>",

The next step in the management of this patient is to <strong>discontinue unfractionated heparin and start lepirudin.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)&nbsp;</strong>results due to the formation of antibodies against <strong>heparin-platelet 4 complexes.&nbsp;</strong>These antibodies also bind to the platelet Fc receptors and promote thrombosis. Features of HIT are usually seen after 5-10 days of starting heparin and are more common in females than in males. The platelet count usually drops to less than&nbsp;&le;100,000/&mu;L or decreases to&nbsp;&ge;50% compared to the levels before the initiation of heparin.

It belongs to the class called sulfonylureas.</p>\n<p>Sulfonylureas act by&nbsp;<strong>closing the ATP-sensitive K channels</strong>&nbsp;in the <strong>beta-cells</strong> of the pancreas. This closure causes cell membrane depolarization and the release of insulin. They are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and therefore can be given orally. Important sulfonylureas are <strong>glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide</strong>, etc.</p>\n<p>Important adverse effects are <strong>hypoglycemia,&nbsp;</strong>vomiting, cholestatic jaundice, agranulocytosis, and aplastic and hemolytic anemias. They can also cause a disulfiram-like reaction. They should be used with caution in pregnancy, lactation, and&nbsp;significant hepatic or renal insufficiency (for the older forms).</p>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p>Option A- <strong>Pioglitazone</strong> belongs to a class of <strong>thiazolidinediones</strong>. It activates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &gamma;&nbsp;<strong>(PPAR&gamma;)</strong> and increases insulin sensitivity. Apart from weight gain, it also causes edema and fluid retention. It increases the plasma volume and is therefore unsuitable for heart failure patients.</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Exenatide</strong> is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (<strong>GLP-1</strong>) receptor agonist. It stimulates insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon release, delays gastric emptying, reduces food intake, and normalizes fasting and postprandial insulin secretion. It is given <strong>subcutaneously.</strong>&nbsp;It can also cause pancreatitis, and therefore is not used in patients with a history or risk of developing <strong>pancreatitis.</strong></p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Teduglutide</strong> is a glucagon-like peptide-2 (<strong>GLP-2</strong>)&nbsp;analog. It enhances the growth of intestinal mucosa. It is used in the treatment of <strong>short bowel syndrome</strong> and not diabetes mellitus.

Gel filtration chromatography: </strong>Proteins with large and small <strong>stokes radii</strong> are applied to the top of a gel filtration column. On entering the column, the small proteins enter pores in the stationary phase matrix (included proteins). During the mobile phase flowing down the column, they lag behind the large molecules, which get excluded (excluded proteins). Proteins thus emerge from a gel filtration column in descending order of their Stokes radii.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e32581fb2af9442680b6255a0f530b1ax1280x1780.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;<strong>2. Ion exchange chromatography: </strong>Proteins interact with the stationary phase by <strong>charge-charge interactions.</strong> Proteins with a net positive charge at a given pH will tightly adhere to negatively charged beads called cation exchangers. Proteins with a net negative charge will adhere to positively charged beads called anion exchangers. Nonadherent proteins flow through the matrix and are washed away.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bound proteins are then selectively displaced by weakening charge-charge interactions. This is done by&nbsp;gradually raising the ionic strength of the mobile phase. It is shown in the image below.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1cd1b504289c473a88db580afe92049dx315x382.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>3. Affinity chromatography</strong> is based on the&nbsp;<strong>high selectivity</strong> displayed by most proteins for their <strong>ligands. </strong>Enzymes are purified using immobilized substrates, products, coenzymes, or inhibitors. In theory, only proteins that interact with the immobilized ligand adhere. Bound proteins are then eluted either by competition with a free, soluble ligand or by disrupting protein-ligand interactions. It is shown in the image below.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1a0474ac3b3e4c9c92efea8d131d4115x782x489.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>4.

In <strong>females</strong>, it is defined as the <strong>early development </strong>of <strong>breasts</strong>, while in <strong>males</strong> it involves an early <strong>enlargement</strong> of the <strong>testes</strong> with a <strong>volume &gt;4mL</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Central</strong> <strong>precocious puberty </strong>results from the&nbsp;<strong>early activation</strong> of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal <strong>(HPG) axis.</strong> This results in early stimulation of the primary sex organs by higher than normal levels of sex hormones. The result is an early enlargement of breasts in females and an early increase in testicular volume in males.</p>\n<p>The HGP axis stimulation results in rapid increases in height and weight but also causes the <strong>epiphyses</strong> of<strong> long bones</strong> to <strong>close early</strong>, resulting in <strong>stunted growth</strong> overall. The earlier the onset of puberty, the more stunted the growth will be.

The most appropriate treatment for this patient with Paget's disease is <strong>IV Zoledronate</strong>- a <strong>bisphosphonate</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is characterized by an <strong>increased bone turnover</strong> due to a disorganized, alternating, and increased rate of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. It may be monostotic or polyostotic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clinically, it is seen more commonly in people over the age of 50. A majority of the patients are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients present with <strong>bone pain</strong>, which is <strong>constant and dull aching</strong> and mostly involves the long bones of the lower limbs, back, and hips.&nbsp;They may have deformities such as <strong>bowing</strong> of bones, the tibia bending anteriorly and the femur bending anterolaterally. <strong>Skull bones</strong> may be <strong>enlarged</strong> and the base of the skull may be flattened. Disorganized and increased bone deposition may lead to <strong>stenosis of various canals</strong> and foramina resulting in <strong>compression of cranial nerves</strong>,<strong> spinal cord</strong>, and<strong> nerve roots</strong> (due to spinal stenosis). <strong>Hearing loss</strong> is a fairly common feature, due to compression of the cranial nerve and otosclerosis resulting in mixed sensorineural and conductive <strong>hearing loss</strong>. Pathological<strong> fractures</strong> of the long bones may be seen.

Point A is at the end of systole when the ventricular volume is about <strong>50 mL</strong>. This volume is called <strong>end-systolic volume.</strong> The pressure at this point is about 2 to 3 mmHg. The volume and pressure go on increasing as the blood from the atrium flows to the ventricle during diastole. At the <strong>end </strong>of<strong> diastole</strong>, marked by point <strong>B</strong>, the ventricle will have a volume of <strong>around 120 mL</strong>. This volume is called <strong>end-diastolic volume.</strong> The pressure is slightly raised to 5-7 mmHg.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase II</strong>- It is the phase of <strong>isovolumetric contraction</strong>, and extends between <strong>points B</strong> and<strong>&nbsp;C</strong>. At the end of diastole (point B), a slight increase in the ventricular pressure <strong>closes</strong> the <strong>mitral valve</strong>, and contraction starts. The ventricle contracts while both mitral and aortic valves are closed. Therefore, the pressure within the ventricle slowly rises without any changes in the volume.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase III</strong>- It is the phase of <strong>ejection</strong> and extends between <strong>point C</strong> and <strong>point D</strong>. Point <strong>C</strong> is the place where the <strong>aortic </strong>valve <strong>opens</strong>. The pressure within the left ventricle rises slowly during isovolumetric contraction until it is sufficient to open the aortic valve. Once the aortic valve opens, blood within the left ventricle is ejected into the aorta. This decreases the volume of the left ventricle, while increasing the pressure within the ventricle.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase IV</strong>- It is the period of <strong>isovolumetric relaxation</strong>. It extends between <strong>points D</strong> and <strong>A</strong>. At the end of the ejection (Point D), the aortic valve closes. However, the ventricular relaxation continues despite closed aortic and mitral valves. Therefore, the ventricular pressure continues to fall while the volume remains the same. The ventricle returns to its starting point, with about 50 mL of blood left in the ventricle and pressure of about 2 to 3 mmHg.</p>\n<p><strong>End-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ESPVR</strong> is the <strong>maximum pressure</strong> that can be developed by the ventricle at the <strong>end-systolic volume</strong>. It is determined by the line intersecting the upper left corners of the loops. This line can be extended down to the x-axis. The slope of this line is called as ESPVR slope.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/76202439afbd4b4f88576c49193b05c2x1280x1316.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

It helps to push the blood from superficial engorged veins into the deep veins, thus improving the blood-pumping function of the calf muscle. Hence, it <strong>decreases edema</strong> and <strong>improves tissue oxygenation</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Complications of this therapy include skin excoriation, dryness, skin maceration, and infection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Varicose veins</strong> are tortuous dilatation of veins due to venous insufficiency. It commonly presents as <strong>lower limb swelling</strong> with a sensation of <strong>heaviness, burning,</strong> and aching over the affected area or whole limb.&nbsp;<strong>Diagnosis</strong> is majorly done using <strong>duplex ultrasound</strong> and very rarely involves MR venography or intravenous ultrasound (IVUS).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> is achieved using modalities such as <strong>compression</strong>, <strong>laser ablation, endothermal ablation</strong>, radiofrequency ablation, endovenous glue, ultrasound-guided foam <strong>sclerotherapy, and open surgery</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Raynaud's disease </strong>refers to an<strong> abnormal sensitivity </strong>in the <strong>arteriolar response to cold. </strong>These vessels constrict and the digits (usually the fingers) turn white and become incapable of fine movements. The capillaries then dilate and fill with slowly flowing deoxygenated blood. Compression will have no effect on these symptoms. Protection from cold can help.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Diabetic foot </strong>also occurs as a result of <strong>peripheral neuropathy </strong>and <strong>atherosclerosis</strong> of<strong> small arteries</strong> in the <strong>legs </strong>and <strong>feet. </strong>Hence, improving venous circulation with compression stockings will have no benefit in this condition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Buerger's disease </strong>or <strong>thromboangiitis obliterans</strong> involves occlusive disease of <strong>small- </strong>and <strong>medium-sized arteries</strong>, thrombophlebitis of the superficial or deep veins, and Raynaud&rsquo;s syndrome<strong>. </strong>It occurs in<strong> male smokers,</strong> usually under the age of 30 years.

      "solution": "<p>The statement that the murmur reduces&nbsp;during the Valsalva maneuver is not true. This young woman with <strong>palpitations,</strong> a <strong>mid-systolic click</strong> heard at the <strong>apex</strong> which <strong>exacerbates</strong> when <strong>standing up</strong> and <strong>improves</strong> on <strong>lying down,</strong> most probably has a diagnosis of <strong>mitral valve prolapse.</strong></p>\n<p>Mitral valve prolapse is a valvular heart defect in which the <strong>mitral valve leaflets</strong> are <strong>floppy</strong> and <strong>prolapse</strong> into the <strong>left atrium during ventricular contraction, </strong>making it the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>most common cause of primary mitral valve regurgitation.&nbsp;It is seen most commonly in young women and can be inherited in an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> fashion with incomplete penetrance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This produces the classic mid-systolic click which is heard at the apex of the heart. The <strong>intensity</strong> of this click sound changes <strong>depending </strong>on the<strong> left ventricular (LV) volume</strong>. When LV <strong>volume increases</strong>, the floppy valve is able to maintain tension, and the degree of prolapse is reduced. Thus the <strong>intensity</strong> of the murmur <strong>reduces.</strong> On the other hand, when the LV <strong>volume is low</strong>, the mitral valve leaflets remain floppy and produce a <strong>louder click</strong> sound.</p>\n<p>By this logic, when the patient <strong>stands up</strong>, the venous return reduces and so the<strong>&nbsp;LV volume decrease. </strong>This causes the<strong> murmur</strong> to become <strong>louder.</strong> On<strong> lying down</strong>, venous return increases, leading to <strong>increased LV volume</strong> and a <strong>softer murmur</strong>. On performing the <strong>Valsalva</strong> maneuver, intrathoracic pressure increases. This reduces venous return, and hence the <strong>murmur</strong> becomes <strong>louder</strong> because of <strong>reduced LV volume</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A - Mitral valve prolapse is also called <strong>Barlow's syndrome&nbsp;</strong>or <strong>floppy valve disease</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B -&nbsp; It is associated with connective tissue disorders like <strong>Marfan's syndrome</strong><strong>,</strong> Ehler's Danlos syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta.</p>\n<p>Option C - The valve becomes floppy due to <strong>myxomatous degeneration</strong> of the valve.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis can be made with a combination of clinical examination and <strong>transthoracic</strong> or <strong>transesophageal echocardiography.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> of these patients involves the usage of <strong>beta-blockers for palpitations</strong>. If the patient has <strong>severe symptoms</strong> due to <strong>mitral regurgitation,</strong> <strong>surgical repair</strong> is advisable.

The unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia predisposes the patient to develop <strong>gallstones.</strong> Hence, childhood gallstones should raise suspicion for this diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Laboratory findings include normocytic anemia with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The peripheral smear will show large <strong>spherical red blood cells without</strong>&nbsp;<strong>central pallor</strong>. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the <strong>acid glycerol lysis test</strong> and the <strong>eosin-5&prime;-maleimide (EMA)&ndash;binding test.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no specific treatment available besides <strong>splenectomy</strong>. However, due to the possible adverse effects, it is only indicated <strong>in severe cases</strong>&nbsp;and after the child attains puberty in moderate cases. It should be followed up with the appropriate antibiotic and vaccine prophylaxis.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option (A): <strong>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency</strong> is a type of <strong>inherited hemolytic anemia</strong>. It is associated with<strong> exacerbations</strong> after consuming <strong>anti-malarial drugs</strong> and in periods of <strong>oxidative stress</strong>. It is not associated with ankyrin mutations. It is an <strong>X-linked</strong> disorder so it is unlikely to be seen in this patient.</p>\n<p>Option (B):&nbsp;<strong>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</strong> is a <strong>hemolytic</strong> disorder that also presents with pancytopenia and a tendency to form venous thrombi. It occurs due to <strong>defective GPI anchors</strong> on the <strong>red blood cell surface</strong> which are normally used to anchor CD 59 (cell-protective proteins) to the surface. These patients can present with episodes of <strong>dark brown urine</strong> in the <strong>morning</strong>, anemia, pancytopenia, and recurrent abdominal pain due to thrombosis of abdominal veins.</p>\n<p>Option (D): <strong>Hereditary elliptocytosis</strong> is also a type of<strong> inherited hemolytic anemia</strong> that results from <strong>spectrin</strong> and similar <strong>surface protein mutations</strong>. The clinical presentation is very similar to spherocytosis, but the peripheral smear will show <strong>elongated elliptical red blood cells</strong> instead of spherical ones.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hyperbilirubinemia- Causes</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<strong>Predominantly Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Excess production of bilirubin</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hemolytic anemias</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Biliary tract obstruction</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Resorption of blood from internal hemorrhage (e.g., alimentary tract bleeding, hematomas)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;Biliary tract diseases like primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ineffective erythropoiesis (e.g., pernicious anemia, thalassemia)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Reduced hepatic uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Drug interference with membrane carrier systems</p>\n</td>\n<td>Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Some cases of Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired bilirubin conjugation</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Physiologic jaundice of the newborn (decreased UGT1A1 activity, decreased excretion)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Breast milk jaundice (&beta;-glucuronidases in milk)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Genetic deficiency of UGT1A1 activity (Crigler-Najjar syndrome types I and II)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Diffuse hepatocellular disease (e.g., viral or drug-induced hepatitis, cirrhosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification of Hemolytic Anemias</h3><p>Hemolytic anemias can be classified in 2 ways:</p>\n<p>1.

When this occurs the patient develops neurological symptoms and signs in the lower limbs.</p>\n<p>Some of the causes of spinal stenosis are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>congenital vertebral dysplasia</li>\n<li>chronic disc protrusion</li>\n<li>displacement and hypertrophy, or osteoarthritis, of the apophyseal(facet) joints</li>\n<li>hypertrophy, folding or ossification of the ligamentum flavum</li>\n<li>bone thickening due to Paget's disease</li>\n<li>spondylolisthesis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The patient is usually a male aged above 50 years with complaints of aching, heaviness, numbness, and paresthesia in the thighs and legs. </p>\n<p>The patient prefers walking uphill which flexes the spine ( maximizes the spinal canal capacity ) to downhill.</p>\n<p>Investigations include imaging studies like X-ray or CT scans of the spinal canal. An anteroposterior diameter of less than 11mm or a transverse diameter of less than 16mm is considered abnormal.</p>\n<p>Treatment includes conservative management. In severe conditions, operative decompressions are almost always successful.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Option A:<strong> Sciatica</strong> - The patient complains of pain radiating down the back of the thigh and calf. Sciatica can either be because of inflammation of the sciatic nerve or because of compression of one of the roots constituting the sciatic nerve</li>\n<li>Option C: <strong>Vascular Claudication</strong> occurs due to injury to blood vessels and leads to exercise-induced ischemia. The collaterals are good enough to keep the limb viable but any further demand on the blood supply like walking uphill or riding a stationary bicycle causes ischaemic pain. Symptoms of vascular claudication reduce on taking rest or by standing still but spinal stenosis requires flexion for relief.</li>\n<li>Option D: <strong>Pott's Disease</strong>, that is, tuberculosis of the spine begins as a dull ache in the early stages and later becomes localized to the affected diseased segment. Other features like stiffness, cold abscess, constitutional symptoms will be present.</li>\n</ul>",

This results in a massive increase in T-cell production, leading to a <strong>cytokine storm</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Streptococcal</strong> TSS is usually seen in the setting of <strong>soft tissue infections</strong> like necrotising fasciitis, cellulitis, etc., and <strong>staphylococcal</strong> TSS is seen in settings of <strong>retained tampons, nasal packing, wound packing</strong>, etc. Hence, in this case, we are more likely to suspect a staphylococcal aetiology.</p>\n<p>The clinical criteria required to diagnose TSS include <strong>fever &gt;102 °F, erythroderma</strong> with desquamation after 1-2 weeks,<strong> hypotension</strong>, and the <strong>involvement</strong> of <strong>&gt;3 organ systems. </strong>The<strong> laboratory diagnosis</strong> of staphylococcal TSS can be made with a Gram stain of the infected site, which would show <strong>gram-positive cocci</strong> in <strong>clusters.</strong></p>\n<p>These patients should be managed aggressively with <strong>fluids</strong> and <strong>systemic antibiotic</strong> therapy. They can be started on drugs like intravenous vancomycin/ daptomycin initially to allow for MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) coverage.

It presents with multiple <strong>fluid-filled blisters</strong> that <strong>rupture easily</strong> on applying mild pressure.</p>\n<p>Option (D): <strong>Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) </strong>is most commonly a drug-induced condition that has a wide range of skin manifestations like purpuric papules, bullae, erythroderma, as well as desquamation. Nikolsky's sign (skin slippage on applying pressure) is often positive. It is usually seen in immunocompromised individuals. SJS involves &lt;10% of the skin surface.

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario of a primigravida who presents with sudden onset of fever, neurologic abnormalities(altered mental status, confusion), thrombocytopenia (petechiae over lower limbs), hemolytic anaemia, acute kidney injury and antibodies to &nbsp;ADAMTS13 suggests the diagnosis of <strong>t</strong><strong>hrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura</strong> (TTP).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TTP is a <strong>thrombotic microangiopathy</strong> that can be inherited or spontaneously acquired. It results from a <strong>deficiency of, or antibodies to</strong>, the metalloprotease <strong>ADAMTS13,&nbsp;</strong>which&nbsp;normally <strong>cleaves multimers</strong> of<strong>&nbsp;vWF</strong>. <strong>Failure to cleave</strong> these multimers results in abnormally large vWF multimers which activate platelets and lead to <strong>excessive platelet adhesion </strong>and<strong> aggregation</strong>. This causes&nbsp;platelet thrombi to form, and fibrin deposits to take place&nbsp;at various sites. These thrombi result in the <strong>classic pentad</strong> of clinical features:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia</li>\n<li>Thrombocytopenia</li>\n<li>Renal failure</li>\n<li>Neurologic findings</li>\n<li>Fever</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>platelet thrombi narrow</strong> the vessel <strong>lumen,</strong>&nbsp;causing&nbsp;<strong>shearing stress</strong> on the red blood cells that are passing through. This results in microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia. The same <strong>platelet thrombi&nbsp;</strong>cause <strong>microvascular occlusion</strong> and result in features like<strong> renal failure</strong> and <strong>neurological manifestations</strong>.</p>\n<p>On peripheral smear, these fragmented red cells appear as <strong>schistocytes</strong> or <strong>helmet cells,</strong> as shown in the image below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7698db7a0b9c479d9e61b2dc0d1b4fd4x754x594.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Timely diagnosis is important to prevent devastating outcomes like profuse bleeding and renal failure. The <strong>best method to treat</strong> these patients is using <strong>plasma exchange</strong> therapy. It should be continued until the platelet counts are back to normal and there are no signs of hemolysis for at least 2 days. <strong>Glucocorticoids</strong> can also be used along with this therapy. In refractory cases, rituximab, and <strong>caplacizumab</strong> an antiVWF nanobody decreases mortality when used in patients with <strong>ADAMTS13 &lt;10%</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other causes of microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Most common)</li>\n<li>Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)</li>\n<li>Malignant hypertension</li>\n<li>Systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\n<li>Disseminated cancer&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option (A): <strong>Immune thrombocytopenic purpura</strong> occurs as a <strong>chronic</strong> disease in adults with several episodes over time, usually <strong>following infections</strong>.&nbsp;It presents as mucocutaneous bleeding and very low platelet counts. These patients have otherwise <strong>normal peripheral blood pictures.</strong></p>\n<p>Option (B):<strong> Disseminated intravascular coagulation&nbsp;</strong>refers to the<strong> widespread intravascular clot formation</strong>, commonly due to sepsis, trauma, and obstetric complications. These patients present with petechiae, ecchymoses, oozing from venipuncture sites, etc. They do not display the classic pentad seen in TTP. Schistocytes may be present on peripheral smear. Deranged clotting parameters are seen only in DIC and not in TTP.</p>\n<p>Option (C): <strong>Hemolytic uremic syndrome</strong> is a disorder seen predominantly in <strong>children</strong>, following an episode of <strong>bloody diarrhea</strong>. <strong><em>Escherichia coli</em> O157:H7</strong> is most commonly the cause of this diarrhea. It can also present with&nbsp;acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia, but neurological manifestations are less common. ADAMTS13 levels are normal in a majority of patients.
