The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paralysis:</strong>&nbsp;Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a <strong>late sign</strong>.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pulselessness:&nbsp;</strong>Usually, the peripheral pulses and&nbsp;capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury.
