      "solution": "<p>The test shown above is Schirmer's test and the likely diagnosis is&nbsp;<strong>Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome is an <strong>autoimmune disorder</strong> that involves <strong>lymphocytic infiltration</strong> of the <strong>exocrine glands</strong>. This manifests as xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes).&nbsp;It is associated with autoantibodies anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B.</p>\n<p>Keratoconjunctivitis sicca can be diagnosed by <strong>Schirmer's test</strong>. This test measures the quantity of tears produced. Two marked strips of paper are placed between the globe and the lower eyelid and the patient is instructed to close their eyes for 5 minutes. The tears produced spread along the paper by capillary action. The distance is measured. A score of more than 10 mm is considered to be normal while that of less than 5 mm is considered deficient.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A number of other systems can be involved as well. For example, atrophic gastritis, esophageal mucosal atrophy, and vaginal dryness.&nbsp;Extraglandular or systemic manifestations can also be present. These manifest as fatigue, arthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, and myalgia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Diagnosis of primary&nbsp;Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome requires the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eye and/or mouth dryness</li>\n<li>Eye tests disclose keratoconjunctivitis sicca</li>\n<li>Mouth evaluation reveals dry oral mucosa and/or</li>\n<li>Presence of anti-Ro or anti-La autoantibodies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A <strong>labial biopsy</strong> is a must to <strong>confirm</strong> the diagnosis and determine the prognosis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Treatment of&nbsp;<strong>Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&nbsp;</strong>is directed at treating the symptoms and complications. <strong>Artificial tears</strong> can be used for dry eyes and <strong>propionic acid gel</strong> for vaginal dryness. Pilocarpine can help increase oral secretions and hydroxychloroquine can be used to treat arthritis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Scleroderma</strong> is associated with <strong>xerostomia.</strong> However, it is more classically represented by <strong>skin</strong> <strong>thickening</strong>, telangiectasia, and lung and renal involvement. In addition, it has <strong>anti</strong>-<strong>topoisomerase</strong> and <strong>anti-centromere</strong> antibodies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Dehydration</strong> can present with <strong>dry</strong> <strong>mouth</strong>. However, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are not involved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Sarcoidosis</strong> is a multisystemic inflammatory disease characterized by noncaseating granulomas. Ocular manifestations of sarcoidosis include anterior uveitis, retinitis, and pars planitis. Patients would have <strong>increased tearing</strong>.&nbsp;</p>",
