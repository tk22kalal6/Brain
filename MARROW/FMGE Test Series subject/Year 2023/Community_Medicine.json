      "solution": "<p><strong>Recall bias</strong> can be eliminated in a prospective study.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 89\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Memory or recall bias</strong>: When cases and controls are asked questions about their past history, it may be more likely for the cases to recall the existence of certain events or factors, than the controls who are healthy persons. <span>For example, those who have had a myocardial infarction might be more likely to remember and recall certain habits or events than those who have not. Thus cases may have a different recall of past events than controls.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Prospective <span>studies begin in the present and continue into future. Hence there will be minimal change for recall bias.</span></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Bias in Epidemiological Studies</h3><ul>\n<li>Bias due to <strong>confounding: </strong>It can be removed by matching.</li>\n<li><strong>Memory or recall</strong> bias as cases and controls may not be able to recall specifics about their history.</li>\n<li><strong>Selection</strong> bias: Cases and controls may not be representative of the population or there may be systematic differences between both.</li>\n<li><strong>Berkesonian </strong>bias: This type of <strong>selection </strong>bias occurs in hospital cases and controls as the admission rates for people with different diseases may differ.</li>\n<li><strong>Interviewer&rsquo;s </strong>bias: If the interviewer knows the hypothesis and who the cases are, he/she may interview the cases more thoroughly than the controls. It can be eliminated by double blinding.</li>\n<li><strong>Neyman&rsquo;s</strong> bias or prevalence-incidence bias: It is due to the selective survival in prevalent cases usually seen in fatal diseases. For example, a case-control study is carried out to study the relation between tobacco smoking and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), being cases interviewed one week after the coronary attack. If smoker patients with AMI die more frequently, the living cases will show lower frequency of smoking, undervaluing the association between smoking and AMI. It has been shown that the bias occurs only if the risk factor influences mortality from the disease being studied.</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Blinding in Epidemiology</h3><ul>\n<li><strong>Blinding</strong> is done in epidemiology to reduce the possibility of <strong>bias</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Types</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>In <strong>single blind trials</strong>, only the <strong>participants or group members</strong> are not aware of the group allocation.</li>\n<li>In <strong>double blind trials</strong>, both the <strong>group members </strong>and the<strong> observers</strong> are not aware of the group allocation.</li>\n<li>In <strong>triple blind trials</strong>, the <strong>group members, the observers </strong>and the <strong>analyzers</strong> are unaware of the group allocation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The most commonly used type of blinding is <strong>double blinding.</strong></li>\n</ul>",

The <strong>primary bacterial indicator</strong> used to assess this is the <strong>coliform group</strong> of organisms. This is because they are present abundantly in the human intestine and can be <strong>easily detected</strong> by culture methods. </p>\n<p>The <strong>presumptive coliform test</strong> can be done by the <strong>multiple tube method</strong> or <strong>membrane filtration</strong> <strong>techniques</strong>. In the multiple-tube method, the water to be tested is <strong>inoculated </strong>into tubes containing a suitable liquid medium. These tubes are then incubated for 48 hours and examined. The test is called <strong>presumptive</strong> because the reaction observed in the tube may occasionally be due to other organisms. The presumption that the reaction is due to coliform organisms has to be confirmed. <strong>McConkey's lactose bile salt broth</strong> with<strong> bromocresol purple 25</strong> as an indicator is used as the media. <em>Escherichia coli</em> or thermotolerant coliform bacteria should not be detected in any 100 ml sample. </p>\n<p>In samples of chlorinated water, confirmation of the presumptive test is necessary. This is done by <strong>subculturing</strong> the positive tubes in two tubes of brilliant green bile broth. It is based on the fact that <em>E.Coli</em> is the only coliform that can produce<strong> gas</strong> from lactose at 44°C.</p>\n<p>Supplementary indicator organisms include <strong>fecal streptococci</strong> and sulfite-reducing <strong>clostridia</strong>. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, 2017</h3><p><strong>WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, 2017</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I)&nbsp;Physical parameters</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Guideline values</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Comments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Turbidity</strong></td>\n<td>Ideally, there should be no visible turbidity but permissible standard is <strong>&lt; 1.0 NTU</strong> for household drinking water.&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Expressed in <strong>nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)</strong>.

It occurs in <strong>cycles</strong> that are spread over short periods of time. This can be days, weeks, months, or even years. Influenza pandemics are known to occur at intervals of 7- 10 years, due to antigenic variations. Some <strong>non-infectious conditions</strong> can also display cyclical trends. An example of this is road traffic accidents occurring more frequently on the weekends. Knowledge of the cyclical pattern of diseases can be used to protect communities against the same.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Seasonal trend</strong> is a type of period fluctuation which refers to<strong> seasonal variation</strong> of diseases. Examples of diseases that follow this trend include <strong>measles</strong>, <strong>malaria</strong>, and upper respiratory tract infections. It can be related to <strong>environmental conditions</strong> such as temperature and humidity. Some non-infectious conditions which follow this trend are <strong>sunstroke</strong>, hay fever, and snakebite.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Secular</strong> or <strong>long-term trend</strong> signifies the changes seen in the occurrence of a disease over a long period of time. It implies a <strong>consistent change</strong> in a particular direction such as a progressive increase or decrease. Examples of conditions that follow this pattern are <strong>coronary heart disease</strong> and <strong>lung cancer</strong> which have shown a consistent upward trend. A decline in the occurrence of diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria has been noted in developed countries. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Point-source epidemic</strong> is a type of common-source epidemic. In this type of epidemic, there are <strong>no secondary waves</strong> and the epidemic curve rises and falls rapidly.

Thus ILR is an ideal option for safe storage of vaccines.</span></p><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/b788dbcaf6d64847b56a73442f43bbc3x375x375.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Cold Chain Equipment</h3><p><strong>Cold chain equipment :&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Storage :&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Walk in cooler (WIC)</li>\n<li>Walk in freezer (WIF)</li>\n<li>Ice lined refrigerator (ILR)</li>\n<li>Deep freezer&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Domestic refrigerator&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Solar :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solar Refrigerator Battery drive</li>\n<li>Solar Refrigerator Direct drive</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Non electrical :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cold box</li>\n<li>Vaccine carrier</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Transportation :&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refrigerator vaccine van</li>\n<li>Insulated vaccine van</li>\n<li>Cold box&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Vaccine carrier</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c13cea69d4ae4f8993ab5e9c3cc78bb8x505x354.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Electrical Cold Chain Equipment:&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Component</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Temperature (degree Celsius)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Level</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Other Comments</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Walk in Freezers (WIF)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>- 15 to &ndash;25&nbsp; </strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>National, State and Regional vaccine stores</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Used for bulk storage of <strong>OPV </strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Walk in Coolers (WIC)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>+2 to +8</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Government Medical Store Depot (GMSD), State and Regional vaccines stores</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Used for bulk storage of most vaccines in UIP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Deep Freezer (DF)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>- 15 to &ndash;25&nbsp; </strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>District and Sub-district vaccines stores</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Used for bulk storage of <strong>OPV</strong> and ice packs</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ice Line Refrigerator (ILR)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>+2 to +8</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>District and Sub-district vaccines stores, <strong>PHCs</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Has different <strong>temperature zones </strong>for different vaccines</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Front Load Refrigerator (Domestic)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>+2 to +8</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sub-district levels, hospitals. dispensaries and nursing homes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Used for all vaccines</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

For example, screening the other members in families of patients with diabetes or hypertension that tend to aggregate in families. It is an <strong>effective</strong> and <strong>economical</strong> method of screening.  </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A<strong>: Mass screening</strong> is the <strong>screening</strong> of a <strong>population</strong> or a sub-group of the population for a disease <strong>irrespective </strong>of the particular<strong> risk</strong> an individual may run of contracting the disease in question. It is not a useful preventive measure unless there is a  suitable treatment that alters the duration or outcome of a disease.</p>\n<p>Option B<strong>: Multiphasic screening</strong> is the application of<strong> two </strong>or<strong> more screening tests</strong> (instead of carrying out separate screening tests for a single disease) to a large number of people in the form of health questionnaires, clinical examinations, and investigations. It has not shown any benefit to the population in terms of mortality and morbidity reduction and has instead increased the cost of health services.</p>\n<p>Option C<strong>: Prospective screening</strong> is screening people for the<strong> benefit </strong>of<strong> others</strong>. For example, screening immigrants for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis to protect the home population from the disease.</p>\n<p>Note: <strong>Prescriptive screening</strong> is defined as the presumptive screening of patients for unrecognized diseases for their <strong>own benefit</strong>. It usually does not arise from a patient's request.

It must cover at least<strong> 1/2 </strong>of the <strong>total daily protein requirement </strong>and<strong> 1/3rd </strong>of<strong> the total daily energy requirement</strong> for children in schools. The<strong> cost </strong>of meals should be reasonably<strong> low</strong>. The meals should be <strong>easy </strong>to<strong> cook</strong> <strong>in schools</strong>. <strong>Locally available foods</strong> must be used whenever possible.
