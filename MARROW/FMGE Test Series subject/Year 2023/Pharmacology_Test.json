      "solution": "<p>The rationale behind the combination therapy of<strong> levodopa</strong> with a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor like <strong>carbidopa (co-careldopa)</strong> is that inhibition of the metabolism&nbsp;of levodopa (i.e. conversion of levodopa into dopamine) in the peripheral circulation <strong>decreases the systemic side effects</strong> of&nbsp;levodopa, like vomiting.</p>\n<p>Peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitors (carbidopa) do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, they only <strong>inhibit </strong>the<strong> conversion of levodopa</strong> into dopamine in the<strong> periphery</strong> and <strong>not in the brain</strong>. This leads to the increased plasma half-life of levodopa, and therefore, lower doses of levodopa can be prescribed.</p>\n<p>Benefits of combination therapy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This therapy inhibits the metabolism of levodopa in the periphery, leading to <strong>increased plasma half-life</strong> of levodopa.</li>\n<li>Combination therapy reduces adverse effects like gastrointestinal side effects, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.</li>\n<li>This therapy allows for increased availability of levodopa in the brain.</li>\n<li>Fluctuation in motor control, where the patient is alternately well and disabled, occurs on prolonged therapy with levodopa. This type of \"<strong>on-off</strong>\" effect is <strong>reduced</strong> in combination therapy because of sustained dopamine levels in the brain.</li>\n<li><strong>Pyridoxine</strong> enhances the peripheral metabolism of levodopa. Hence, combination therapy with carbidopa nullifies the interaction of pyridoxine with levodopa metabolism.</li>\n<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>A<strong> higher&nbsp;degree of improvement</strong> is seen&nbsp;in combination therapy than in monotherapy with levodopa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Demerits of combination therapy:</p>\n<p>This therapy decreases the concentration of levodopa in the periphery, but increases the concentration of levodopa reaching the brain.<strong> Involuntary movements </strong>and <strong>behavioral adverse effects</strong> like confusion, hallucinations,&nbsp;nightmares, and delusions are <strong>not reduced </strong>after the addition of carbidopa<strong>. </strong>In fact, they are <strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;in patients who are taking levodopa <strong>with peripheral carboxylase</strong> inhibitors.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This is because <strong>higher</strong> levels of <strong>dopamine</strong> are formed in CNS.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Medical treatment of Parkinson's disease</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>To </strong><strong>increase dopamine</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Anti cholinergics</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Dopamine precursor</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Anti muscarinic </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Levodopa</td>\n<td>Benzhexol (trihexyphenidyl)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopa decarboxylase inhibitor </strong></td>\n<td>Benztropine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carbedopa</td>\n<td>Procyclidine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Benserazide</td>\n<td><strong>H1 antagonist </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine agonist-Ergot derivatives</strong></td>\n<td>Promethazine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bromocriptine</td>\n<td>Orphenadrine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cabergoline</td>\n<td>Diphenhydramine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pergolide</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lisuride</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine agonist-Non ergot&nbsp;derivatives</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ropinirole</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pramipexole</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rotigotine</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Apomorphine</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine facilitator </strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amantadine</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>MAO-B inhibitor </strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Selegiline</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rasagiline</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>COMT inhibitor </strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tolcapone</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entacapone</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "<p>The reason for administering <strong>multi-drug therapy</strong> in tuberculosis is to <strong>prevent</strong>&nbsp;the <strong>development</strong> of <strong>resistance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Resistance</strong> to individual drugs in <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> occurs by <strong>spontaneous point mutations</strong>&nbsp;that occur at a low but predictable rate (10<sup>-7 </sup>to 10<sup>-10 </sup>). Development of this drug resistance is almost invariably the<strong> result of monotherapy,&nbsp;</strong>i.e., the failure of the health care provider to prescribe at least 2 drugs to which the tubercle bacilli are susceptible. Hence, multi-drug therapy is recommended for the treatment of tuberculosis.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: ATT Regimen for TB Patients</h3><p>As per the latest recommendations from <strong>National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP)</strong>, treatment of TB is now based primarily on <strong>drug susceptibility testing</strong>.
