      "solution": "<p> The given prenatal ultrasound image showing<strong> irregular loops of bowel outside</strong> the abdominal cavity <strong>without an overlying sac </strong>is suggestive of <strong>Gastroschisis.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gastroschisis</strong> represents a congenital anomaly characterized by a <strong>defect in the anterior abdominal wall</strong>. The abdominal contents protrude through this defect. The abdominal defect is located usually to the <strong>right</strong> of the umbilicus at the junction of the umbilicus and normal skin. It is the most common anomaly seen in babies born to mothers under 20 years of age. It is usually<strong> &lt;4cm </strong>in size without an overlying sac.</p>\n<p>Gastroschisis is commonly associated with intestinal atresia. The intestine is thickened, edematous and foreshortened in gastroschisis as the intestine is directly exposed to the amniotic fluid in utero due to the absence of an overlying sac. </p>\n<p>Gastroschisis can be diagnosed by a <strong>prenatal ultrasound scan</strong>. </p>\n<p>Below is the prenatal ultrasound image showing irregular loops of bowel outside the abdominal cavity <strong>without an overlying sac.</strong> </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/3ef3d1dbaed04c65967bd193c3918e69x487x320.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ba904744bdff446fab039062aca5effdx1279x1242.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Treatment</strong>: All newborns with gastroschisis require <strong>urgent surgical treatment</strong>. IV fluids are administered to counter the significant evaporative fluid losses.

Surgical closure can be done within approximately 1 to 2 weeks. </p><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option a : <strong>Omphalocele</strong> is a congenital abdominal wall defect where the bowel and the solid viscera are<strong> covered by the peritoneum and amniotic membrane</strong>.

In the post-operative period,<strong> inadequate pain control</strong> may lead to <strong>poor inspiratory effort </strong>and and <strong>reduced diaphragm contraction</strong> in the patient's attempt to avoid experiencing pain,  may also contribute to the development of atelectasis. On the other hand, <strong>overuse of opioid analgesics</strong> or sedatives may also favour development of atelectasis due to respiratory depression causing collection of secretions. Other causes include lack of mobilization (bed-bound patients) or positional change.</p>\n<p>Patients present with <strong>tachypnoea</strong> and decreased oxygen saturation and on examination, the breath sounds are <strong>bronchial</strong> in nature and <strong>reduced</strong> in intensity. Chest xray may show <strong>diminished lung volume</strong>, linear opacities, and elevation of the diaphragm on the affected side. </p>\n<p> </p>",
