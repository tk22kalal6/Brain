This stroke volume increases whenever, there is <strong>increased venous</strong> return to the heart, increased end-diastolic volume (<strong>preload</strong>), and increased contractility. Contractility further depends on the <strong>initial length</strong> of the cardiac muscle fiber and the <strong>autonomic innervation.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Heart rate</strong>- Increased heart rate increases the cardiac output which in turn increases the oxygen requirement. Heart rate is controlled primarily by the autonomic nerves, with sympathetic stimulation increasing the rate and parasympathetic stimulation decreasing the rate.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Afterload-</strong> The tension at which the load is lifted is called afterload. As the afterload increases, the heart has to work more in order to pump blood to the organs. This in turn results in increased oxygen requirement.

This leads to decreased peripheral resistance, decreased blood pressure, decreased contractility, decreased heart rate, and decreased oxygen requirement of the heart.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Beta-blockers</strong>- They decrease the oxygen requirement by decreasing the heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility.

      "solution": "<p>The clinical features are suggestive of <strong>Graves disease</strong>. <strong>Thyroid hormone</strong> is elevated in this patient. Statements<strong> 1 and 3</strong> are <strong>true</strong> regarding the thyroid hormone.</p>\n<p>Synthesis- Iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormone. Absorbed iodine is taken by the thyroid follicular cells with the help of a<strong> sodium iodide</strong> transporter (<strong>NIS</strong>). NIS is mainly present in the <strong>thyroid gland</strong>, but it can also be present in <strong>salivary glands, lactating breast, and placenta. </strong>NIS is not present in the pituitary gland.</p>\n<p>The iodine that enters the thyroid gland undergoes organification and is added to tyrosyl residues within thyroglobulin. These iodotyrosines are then coupled to form T4 and T3 hormones. This reaction is catalyzed by <strong>thyroid peroxidase.</strong> After coupling, the thyroglobulin is taken back into the cells to release T4 and T3. Uncoupled mono and diiodotyrosines are deiodinated by the enzyme dehalogenase to recycle iodine.</p>\n<p>T3 and T4 are the two forms of the hormone.<strong> T4</strong> is present in<strong> higher concentrations</strong> and has a <strong>longer half-life</strong> than T3. However,<strong> T3 is more potent</strong> than T4.</p>\n<p>Thyroid hormones enter the cell by passive diffusion or by the transporters. On entering the cell, they bind to the <strong>nuclear</strong> thyroid hormone <strong>receptors</strong>. On binding to the receptors, they either stimulate or inhibit transcription.</p>\n<p>Methimazole, carbimazole and propylthiouracil are the drugs used in the management of hyperthyroidism. They act by inhibiting <strong>thyroid peroxidase. </strong>In addition to this, propylthiouracil also inhibits the deiodination of <strong>T<span class=\"s1\">4 </span><span class=\"s2\">→ </span>T<span class=\"s1\">3</span>. </strong></p>\n<p>Drugs that prevent deiodination of T4 to T3 are propylthiouracil, propranolol, amiodarone, and oral cholecystographic agents.</p>",

The sequence of events is as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Troponin I</strong> is bound to actin and tropomyosin. In a resting muscle, it <strong>covers</strong> the sites where <strong>actin</strong> interacts with myosin heads. The myosin head contains a tightly bound adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and an inorganic phosphate (Pi).</li>\n<li>Following an action potential, Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and <strong>cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup></strong> is <strong>increased.</strong> Simultaneously Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx also happens through the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.</li>\n<li>The <strong>free Ca<sup>2+</sup></strong> binds with <strong>troponin C</strong>.
