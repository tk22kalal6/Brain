The patient then externally rotates both arms while the examiner applies resistance; lack of power on one side signifies weakness of infraspinatus. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Teres minor</strong> cannot be assessed separately. But it can assessed along with infraspinatus as they both perform external rotation of the shoulder joint. ‘<strong>Lag sign</strong>’ and the ‘<strong>Drop sign</strong>’ are used for this purpose.</p>\n<p>The <strong>lag sign</strong> is performed by asking the patient to <strong>lift his arms slightly away</strong> from the body and place them in <strong>maximum external rotation</strong>. A positive test is elicited when the patient <strong>cannot maintain</strong> that position on one side and allows the arm to drift into a more <strong>neutral position</strong>. This suggests a tear of the infraspinatus, teres minor, or supraspinatus. </p>\n<p>The drop sign is similar, here the arm is in <strong>90 degrees of abduction</strong>, the <strong>elbow flexed to 90 degrees</strong> and the arm <strong>maximally externally rotated</strong>. When the examiner lets go, the patient would normally hold that position, but if the arm ‘drops’, it denotes a positive test</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Subscapularis</strong> –<strong>Lift-off test</strong> - The patient places one arm behind his or her back with the dorsum of the hand resting against the mid-lumbar spine. The patient’s hand is lifted off the back and the patient is told to hold it there. The inability to do this signifies subscapularis weakness. </p>",

They are excessively fearful of <strong>perceived threats</strong> and deceit and often read hidden demeaning or <strong>threatening meanings</strong> into benign remarks. They are <strong>reluctant to</strong> <strong>confide</strong> in others due to the fear that the information they provide will be used against them maliciously.</p>\n<p>They tend to be <strong>extremely jealous,</strong> <strong>hostile, argumentative,</strong> and <strong>defensive</strong>. Their paranoia prevents them from establishing any overly-involved relationship. They persistently <strong>bear grudges</strong> and can get irritable and angry easily. They use the defense mechanism of <strong>projection</strong> by displacing their insecurities on others. </p>\n<p>They may not be willing to accept that they need psychiatric help. <strong>Psychotherapy</strong> is the treatment of choice. Care should be taken by the therapist to <strong>not behave defensively</strong> if accused of making a mistake. <strong>Pharmacotherapy</strong> is generally used to deal with anxiety and agitation. <strong>Diazepam</strong> is used as an anxiolytic while antipsychotics like <strong>haloperidol</strong> or <strong>pimozide</strong> may be required to deal with agitation.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Individuals with <strong>schizoid personality disorder</strong> are usually <strong>eccentric and isolated</strong>.

FDG is taken up by <strong>metabolically active cells</strong>, where it undergoes phosphorylation to form <strong>FDG-6-phosphate</strong>. Unlike glucose, FDG-6-phosphate cannot undergo further metabolism and becomes trapped within the cell. (So, the patient must be <strong>fasted for 4-6 hrs</strong> prior to imaging).</li>\n<li>The <strong>trapped FDG-6-phosphate</strong> is detected by the PET scanner. </li>\n<li>Before injecting FDG, the <strong>blood glucose level</strong> should be measured.
