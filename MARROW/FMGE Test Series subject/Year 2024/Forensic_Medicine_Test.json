Other organs like the bladder and rectum are separated from the body by using a scalpel to cut the pelvic ligaments.</li>\n<li><strong>Ghon technique</strong>: Like the Rokitansky method, the Ghon method also employs the bloc method of removing thoracic, cervical, abdominal organs.

The victim is squeezed to death by tying both ends of the stick with rope. Sometimes, two sticks are used across the back and front of the upper part of the chest and squeezed forcibly. This causes laceration of the muscles, and rib fractures and interferes with respiration.</p>\n<p>On examination, a <strong>bruise</strong> can be seen in the <strong>center </strong>of the<strong> neck</strong> across the windpipe, corresponding to the width of the stick or the substance used. A similar mark can be seen on the <strong>back of the neck</strong> if two sticks are used. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Garrotting</strong> involves attacking the victim from<strong> behind </strong>using a <strong>ligature</strong>. The ligature is thrown around the unaware victim’s neck and then tightened by twisting it with a lever such as a rod or stick within the ligature.

In this case, the patient&rsquo;s or attendant&rsquo;s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.</p>\n<p>So, contributory negligence occurs when <strong>both the doctor and patient are negligent</strong>. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient&rsquo;s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the<strong> patient:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.</li>\n<li>Fails to follow the doctor&rsquo;s instructions</li>\n<li>Refuses to take the treatment</li>\n<li>Leaves the hospital against doctor&rsquo;s advice</li>\n<li>Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contributory negligence is a defence </strong>for doctor&rsquo;s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the <strong>doctrine of comparative negligence</strong>, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.

He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>As the decomposition stage suggests the body had been buried for approximately 8 days, the equivalent decomposition in air would have taken place in <strong>1/8th</strong> of that time.</p>\n<p><strong>Casper's rule</strong> or <strong>dictum</strong> states that a <strong>body decomposes in the air twice as fast as submerged in water, and eight times faster as buried in earth.</strong></p>\n<p>Therefore, the <strong>rate of decomposition</strong> is <strong>Air &gt; Water &gt; Soil</strong>. It is helpful in the estimation of time since death.  </p>\n<p>Free access of air hastens putrefaction, partly because the <strong>air</strong> conveys organisms to the body. Putrefaction is rapid in a body buried in a <strong>damp, marshy</strong> or<strong> shallow</strong> grave without clothes or coffin, because the body is exposed to constant changes of temperature. <strong>Putrefaction</strong> is <strong>more rapid</strong> in <strong>warm, fresh water than in cold, salt water</strong>. It is <strong>more rapid</strong> in <strong>stagnant water</strong> than in <strong>running water</strong>.</p>\n<p>Note: Forensic taphonomy is the study and interpretation of postmortem processes of human remains i.e. the history of a body following death.<br />The ratio of the time a body takes to decompose in <strong>air, water, and soil</strong> is <strong>1:2:8</strong>. This means that the time taken by soil is greater than water and air. So, the correct order of time taken for decomposition is Soil &gt; Water &gt; Air. </p>",
