      "solution": "<p>NSAID's like <strong>ibuprofen and indomethacin</strong> are used in the medical management to <strong>induce closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).</strong></p>\n<p>Patent ductus arteriosus is the failure of the closure of ductus arteriosus. It usually connects the pulmonary trunk to the aorta distal to left subclavian artery branching. It gives rise to a continuous murmur, which is heard throughout the cardiac cycle. It results in decreased oxygenated blood supply to the lower half of the body. It closes by itself in 2-4 weeks, unless it is large.</p>\n<p><strong>Medical management</strong> involves ruling out other causes of continuous murmur and any other duct dependent lesion. In the absence of either, prostaglandin inhibitor like <strong>Indomethacin</strong> or <strong>Ibuprofen</strong> may be given. But these are <strong>contraindicated in Necrotising enterocolitis</strong> (NEC). </p>\n<p>A <strong>recent edition</strong> of AIIMS neonatology protocol book says that paracetamol is equally effective as Ibuprofen and can be given in case NSAIDs are contraindicated.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prostaglandin E1</strong> is a ductal smooth muscle relaxant and is used to <strong>maintain an open ductus arteriosus</strong> in the newborn with ductal-dependent congenital heart disease.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a287415cc2c242a3ad7af1e8bca1a9b9x1280x2559.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

This initial decrease is primarily due to the elimination of excess fluid and <strong>limited early nutritional intake</strong>. As feeding progresses, colostrum gives way to higher-fat breast milk, and infants improve their ability to latch and suck effectively. Consequently, mothers become more adept at feeding techniques.</p>\n<p>By the <strong>second week</strong> of life, most infants <strong>regain</strong> their birth weight or surpass it. Throughout the <strong>first month</strong>, infants typically gain about <strong>30 grams</strong> (approximately 1 ounce) <strong>per day</strong>. This period marks the fastest phase of postnatal growth. Approximate daily weight gain is that : 0-3 months: 30 g/day; 3-6 months: 20 g/day; 6-9 months: 15 g/day; 9-12 months: 12 g/day. </p>",
