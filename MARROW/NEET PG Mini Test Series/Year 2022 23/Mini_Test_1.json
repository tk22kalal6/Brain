Later, the entire tympanic membrane becomes red.</p>\n<p>Management:</p>\n<p>Since the most common organism responsible are<em> <strong>Streptococcus pneumonia </strong></em>and <em>Haemophilus influenza</em>, antibiotics should be started.

It is <strong>not associated</strong> with the <strong>hardening</strong> of the uterus or<strong> bag of waters</strong> formation and does not cause <strong>cervical dilation.</strong> Usually, it is <strong>relieved with enema</strong> or sedatives. It is also known as <strong>Braxton Hicks contractions</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is more common in<strong> primigravidae</strong> than in parous women and&nbsp;usually appears 1 or 2 weeks&nbsp;prior to the onset of true labor pain in primigravidae and a few days prior in multiparae.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>True labor pain is characterized by pain in the lower abdomen and back, radiating to the thighs. It occurs due to<strong> painful uterine contractions</strong> at <strong>regular intervals&nbsp;</strong>with <strong>increasing frequency, intensity&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>duration</strong>.&nbsp;It is associated with the&nbsp;<strong>show</strong> (cervical mucus plug with blood),&nbsp;<strong>progressive effacement</strong> and <strong>dilatation</strong> of the cervix and <strong>descent</strong> of the presenting part.&nbsp;It is <strong>not relieved</strong> by <strong>enema</strong> or <strong>sedatives</strong>.</p>\n<p>A <strong>bag of waters </strong>refers to the lower pole of the fetal membranes containing <strong>liquor amnii</strong> which&nbsp;bulges into the cervical canal below the presenting part.&nbsp;During uterine contraction, the bag becomes tense and convex due to the rise in intra-amniotic pressure and disappears completely after the contractions. This is almost a certain sign of the onset of <strong>true labor.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
