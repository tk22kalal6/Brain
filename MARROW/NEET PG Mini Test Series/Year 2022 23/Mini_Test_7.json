It can occur following fractures (commonly) or soft tissue injuries and is a<strong> localized condition involving the affected limb</strong>. The clinical features include <strong>pain, paresthesia, pallor, paralysis, and pulselessness</strong>. The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the intra-compartmental pressures.

This results in hypoperfusion and <strong>myonecrosis</strong> in the crushed limb. When the limb is released from the compression, toxic metabolites get released to cause reperfusion injury.&nbsp;Free myoglobin can lead to <strong>acute tubular necrosis</strong> and <strong>renal failure</strong>. Myonecrosis can lead to <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong> with <strong>hyperkalemia</strong> and <strong>hypocalcemia</strong>.
