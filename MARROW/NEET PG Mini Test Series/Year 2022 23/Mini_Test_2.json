Later, it can form an indurated mass that resembles a carcinoma and should be carefully ruled out. Fibrosis causes a <strong>slit-like retraction</strong> of the nipple.

It is used as an analgesic for chronic pain conditions like cancer pain and also used for the treatment of opioid dependence as an alternative to methadone.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Naltrexone</strong> is an opioid antagonist that blocks opioid effects, particularly euphoria, and discourages per­sons with opioid dependence from substance-seeking behaviour.

It may be caused due to the <strong>calcification</strong> of the <strong>normal aortic valve</strong> or the <strong>congenital bicuspid</strong> <strong>valve</strong>, and <strong>rheumatic heart disease</strong>. Narrowing of the aortic valve causes a <strong>decreased stroke volume</strong>. This results in a <strong>weak</strong> <strong>pulse</strong> (Parvus) which <strong>rises slowly</strong> to a <strong>delayed peak</strong> (tardus), best appreciated in the <strong>carotid arteries</strong>.</p>\n<p>The clinical features of AS are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exertional dyspnea:</strong> This occurs due to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Raised end-diastolic LV volume and reduced LV compliance lead to increased LV pressure, leading to elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. </li>\n<li><strong>Angina pectoris</strong>: This occurs due to the combination of the increased O<sub><span class=\"s1\">2 </span></sub>needs of hypertrophied myocardium and the reduction of O<sub><span class=\"s1\">2 </span></sub>delivery.</li>\n<li><strong>Syncope</strong>: This occurs due to the combination of decreased cardiac output and systemic arterial dilation which lead to a reduction of cerebral perfusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As <strong>LV systole</strong> gets <strong>prolonged</strong>, the <strong>aortic component</strong> of <strong>S<sub>2</sub> </strong>may become <strong>synchronous</strong> with the <strong>pulmonary component</strong>.
