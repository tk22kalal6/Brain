This plot can be used to calculate K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> as well as to determine the mechanism of action of enzyme inhibitors.</p>\n<p>In non-competitive inhibition, <strong>V<sub>max</sub> decreases</strong> (or 1/V<sub>max</sub> increases) but <strong>K<sub>m</sub> </strong>is<strong> unchanged.&nbsp;</strong>Hence&nbsp;the graphs of inhibited and uninhibited reactions have the <strong>same x-intercepts</strong> (converge at -1/K<sub>m</sub>) but <strong>different y-intercepts.</strong></p>\n<p>In contrast to competitive inhibitors, noncompetitive inhibitors <strong>bind </strong>to<strong> enzymes</strong> in locations <strong>away from</strong> the<strong> active site</strong>.&nbsp;For this reason,&nbsp;the <strong>degree</strong> of <strong>inhibition</strong> is based solely upon the<strong> concentration of the inhibitor</strong>, and <strong>increasing </strong>the<strong> substrate concentrations</strong> does<strong> not</strong> compete with or <strong>change </strong>the<strong> inhibition</strong>. Therefore, unlike the increase in Km seen with competitive inhibition, in noncompetitive inhibition, Vmax decreases while Km usually remains the same. While <strong>competitive inhibitors</strong> can be <strong>overcome</strong> at a sufficiently<strong> high substrate concentration</strong>, <strong>non-competitive inhibition</strong> is <strong>irreversible</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>cannot </strong>be<strong> overcome</strong> by increasing the concentration of the substrate.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/68c62c7e31bc4e378bfde9d6effe5ecdx1280x1287.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/77321cdf68934ee38405cd6080bcbdd3x1280x2317.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/61e22ac671cd4d56bc7474bb882799f1x1280x2235.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Difference between Competitive & Non-Competitive inhibitors</h3><p>Reversible inhibitors are of two types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive inhibitors</li>\n<li>Non-Competitive inhibitors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Difference between Competitive &amp; Non-Competitive inhibitors</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Competitive inhibitors</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Non-Competitive inhibitors</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Succinate dehydrogenase is inhibited by Malonate</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Pyruvate kinase is inhibited by alanine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Substrate &amp; inhibitor are chemically similar &amp; have same shape</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Substrate &amp; inhibitor are chemically not similar &amp; have different shape</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Inhibitor binds to active site</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Inhibitor binds away from active site, i.e., at allosteric site</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Inhibitor does not change the shape of the active site</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Inhibitor changes the shape of the active site</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Increase in substrate concentration reduces the inhibition</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Increase in substrate concentration does not affect the inhibition</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Vmax remains constant</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vmax decreases</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Km Increases</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Km remains constant</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

On examination, findings consistent with <strong>anemia</strong> (pallor) and <strong>thrombocytopenia</strong> (easy bruising) are seen. This is due to the accelerated destruction of RBC and platelet precursors in the bone marrow. </p>\n<p>APL is associated with aberrant translocations between chromosomes, one of which is <strong>t(15;17)</strong>. This translocation results in the formation of a fused gene with components of promyelocytic leukemia <strong>(PML)</strong> from chromosome 15 and retinoic acid receptor alpha <strong>(Rar-alpha)</strong> from chromosome 17. This fused gene codes for a chimeric protein <strong>(PML-Rar-alpha) </strong>that blocks promyelocyte differentiation.</p>\n<p><strong>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)</strong> is a complication of APL. Symptoms can range from minimal bleeding to significant hemorrhage (gastrointestinal, intrapulmonary, intracranial).
