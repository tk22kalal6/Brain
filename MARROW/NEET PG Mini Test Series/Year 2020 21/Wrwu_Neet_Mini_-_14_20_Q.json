The ultrasound image shows maintained corticomedullary differentiation (CMD). Preserved CMD appears as a different echogenicity of cortex and medulla. This finding along with enlarged kidneys makes the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis more likely.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>CKD - Duration of 1 week and enlarged kidney size with preserved corticomedullary differentiation (CMD) makes this unlikely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Urethral obstruction - Successful foley catheterization rules out urethral obstruction</p>\n<p>ATN - An absence of casts or crystals which are usually seen in ATN are absent in this case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a patient with renal disease, we first try to ascertain if it is acute or chronic. Then the management is decided based on the nature of the renal disease which could be pre-renal, renal, or post-renal:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Parameter</td>\n<td>AKI</td>\n<td>CKD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Duration</td>\n<td>Around 7 days</td>\n<td>More than 3 months</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>Normal or enlarged</td>\n<td>Shrunken&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td><strong>Corticomedullary </strong><br /><strong>differentiation</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Preserved</strong></td>\n<td>Lost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Complications of CKD</td>\n<td>Absent&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Present</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
