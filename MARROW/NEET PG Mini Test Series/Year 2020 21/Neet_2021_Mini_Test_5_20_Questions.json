Common risk factors for placenta previa include previous cesarian section or myomectomy, advanced maternal age (&gt;35 years), smoking, multiple gestation, multiparity, and prior curettage.</p>\n<p>In this patient, with advanced maternal age, previous two cesarian sections, and smoking history, the coital act could have led to the separation of the placenta leading to painless vaginal bleeding. Other causes of bleeding in placenta previa include physiological spontaneous separation, per vaginal examination, external cephalic version, and high rupture of membranes.</p>\n<p>The next best step in this patient will be to <strong>confirm the diagnosis</strong> of placenta previa and <strong>localization</strong> through sonography. In transvaginal ultrasonography, the probe will be placed in the vagina without touching the endocervix. It is <strong>more accurate</strong> than transabdominal ultrasound (TAS) which also necessitates a full bladder for adequate visualization. Maternal obesity and posterior situation of the placenta also result in poor imaging in transabdominal ultrasonography.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Fetal biophysical profile</strong> is done as a test of uteroplacental insufficiency in fetuses with a&nbsp;<strong>non-reactive non-stress test (NST)</strong>. This fetus has a normal baseline heart rate (110-160 bpm) with accelerations, moderate variability, and no declarations. This is a reactive NST and does not need any further testing. This fetus is not in distress.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Fetal fibronectin</strong> is a glycoprotein that binds the fetal membranes to the decidua. The presence of fetal fibronectin in the cervical or vaginal discharge between 24-34 weeks of pregnancy is an <strong>indicator of preterm labor</strong>. It is normally found before 22 weeks and after 37 weeks of pregnancy and hence has no significance in this patient.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Vaginal delivery</strong> is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in placenta previa especially with a previous history of cesarian section. It may be considered if when the placental edge is clearly 2-3 cm away from the internal os as seen on USG. Further, this patient is hemodynamically stable and there is no evidence of fetal distress to necessitate immediate delivery. Definitive delivery through a Cesarian section after localizing the placenta is advisable.</p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Note: </span></strong>Per-Vaginal Examination should not be done<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;in suspected placenta previa.
