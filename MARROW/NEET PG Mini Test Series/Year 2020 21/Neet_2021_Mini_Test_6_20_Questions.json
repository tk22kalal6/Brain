      "solution": "<p>This patient's clinical scenario is suggestive of&nbsp;<strong>aortic stenosis (AS)</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>which is associated with the characteristic <strong>pulsus parvus et tardus.</strong></p>\n<p>Aortic stenosis is the <strong>narrowing of the aortic valve</strong>. It may be caused by the <strong>calcification</strong> of the normal aortic valve, calcification of the congenital bicuspid valve, and rheumatic heart disease. Narrowing of the aortic valve causes a <strong>decreased stroke volume</strong>. This results in a <strong>weak</strong>&nbsp;<strong>pulse</strong> (parvus), which <strong>rises slowly</strong> to a <strong>delayed peak</strong> (tardus), best appreciated in the carotid arteries.</p>\n<p>Three cardinal clinical features of aortic stenosis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exertional dyspnea:</strong>&nbsp;This occurs due to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Raised end-diastolic LV volume and reduced LV compliance lead to increased LV pressure, leading to elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. This causes exertional dyspnea.</li>\n<li><strong>Angina pectoris</strong>:&nbsp;It occurs due to the&nbsp;combination of the increased O<sub><span class=\"s1\">2 </span></sub>needs of hypertrophied myocardium and reduction of O<sub><span class=\"s1\">2 </span></sub>delivery&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Syncope</strong>:&nbsp;It occurs due to the combination of decreased cardiac output and systemic arterial dilation which lead to a reduction of cerebral perfusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As LV systole gets prolonged, the aortic component of S<sub>2</sub> may become synchronous with the pulmonary component, or there may be a <strong>paradoxical splitting of&nbsp;S<sub>2,</sub></strong> where the aortic component follows the pulmonary component.&nbsp;The murmur in aortic stenosis is typically an <strong>ejection systolic murmur</strong> best heard at the right second intercostal space and transmitted to the carotids.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Severe AS</strong> is defined as the aortic valve area <strong>&lt;1 cm<sup>2</sup></strong>. Patients even with severe AS may be asymptomatic as the left ventricle undergoes hypertrophy to increase the intraventricular pressure and maintain the stroke volume. Symptomatic AS is an indication for valve replacement.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Pulsus alternans</strong> is defined as <strong>beat-to-beat variability</strong> in the amplitude of the pulse. It is seen in patients with <strong>severe LV dysfunction</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Pulsus bisferiens</strong>&nbsp;also known as bifid pulse has <strong>two systolic peaks.</strong> It is seen in patients with <strong>hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy</strong>. There is a rapid upstroke to the first peak (percussion wave) and a slower rise to the second peak (tidal wave). It is also rarely appreciated in patients with severe aortic regurgitation.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Pulsus paradoxus</strong> is defined as a <strong>fall in systolic pressure &gt;10 mmHg</strong> with <strong>inspiration.</strong> It is seen in patients with pericardial tamponade, severe asthma, massive pulmonary embolism, and tension pneumothorax.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Grading of Aortic Stenosis</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Grading of stenosis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Area of aortic valve</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Mild</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1.5 &ndash; 2 sq cm</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Moderate</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1 &ndash; 1.5 sq cm</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Severe</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&lt; 1 sq cm</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "<p>In the given clinical scenario, the patient who is on a <strong>Monoamine Oxidase (MAO)</strong> develops diarrhea, restlessness, fever, extreme agitation with hyperreflexia, and autonomic instability which is suggestive of <strong>serotonin syndrome</strong>. The newly added drug must have been a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor <strong>(SSRI)</strong>. Among the given options, <strong>fluoxetine</strong> is an SSRI.</p>\n<p>When an <strong>SSRI</strong> is administered along <strong>with</strong> an <strong>MAO-I, tramadol,</strong> and <strong>pethidine,</strong> plasma levels of <strong>serotonin</strong> are <strong>raised</strong> resulting in <strong>serotonin syndrome. Clinical features</strong> of serotonin syndrome include diarrhea, <span><strong>agitation, restlessness,</strong> rigidity, <strong>hyperthermia,</strong> hyperreflexia, <strong>autonomic instability,</strong>&nbsp;twitchings followed by convulsions, </span><span>delirium, coma, status epilepticus, cardio&shy; vascular collapse, and death.</span></p>\n<p>Treatment involves <strong>removing the offending agent and supportive care</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Imipramine</strong> is a <strong>tricyclic antidepressant</strong>. Common side effects include anticholinergic symptoms, sedation, weight gain, and cardiac arrhythmias. TCAs given with <strong>MAO inhibitors</strong>&nbsp;can result in <strong>hypertensive crisis</strong> with excitement and hallucinations.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Mirtazapine </strong>acts by enhancing noradrenaline and 5-HT release.&nbsp;It helps patients with insomnia. Common side effects include increased appetite and <strong>weight gain.&nbsp;</strong>It doesn't cause sexual dysfunction.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Trazadone</strong> is also an <strong>atypical antidepressant</strong>.
