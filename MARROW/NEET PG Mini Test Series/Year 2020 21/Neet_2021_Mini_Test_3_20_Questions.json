On examination, pulse rate is 97 beats per minute, BP is 100/70 mm of Hg, and the temperature is 99.8F. The skin eruptions include macules, vesicles, pustules, and crusted lesions. The skin surrounding the lesions is erythematous. There is submandibular and cervical lymphadenopathy. An image of the rash on the face is shown below. On enquiring, the mother says that he has had several episodes of itchy rashes over the last 5 years that are currently seen as dry, scaly, lichenified patches on the flexural surfaces and back. What is the most likely diagnosis of the newly formed rash?",
