The corresponding thyroid function test levels are seen in the following sequence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>↓TSH and ↑T3,T4 (thyrotoxic episode)</li>\n<li>↑TSH and ↓T3,T4  (hypothyroid state)</li>\n<li>Euthyroid state</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thyroid function test consistes of 3 entities - </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>TSH - Thyroid stimulating hormone</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>T4 - Thyroxine</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>T3 - Triiodothyronine</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>TSH is released from the anterior pituitary which acts on thyroid follicles to stimulate the release of T3 and T4. High circulating levels of T4 and T3 decrease the levels of TSH via a negative feedback mechanism. Abnormality in the circulating levels of any of these markers help in identifying the underlying pathology.</p>\n<p>It is called \"silent thyroiditis\", as it is <strong>painless</strong>. When it occurs 3-6 months after pregnancy, it is termed <strong>postpartum thyroiditis</strong>. The condition is observed in up to 5% of women and it is 3 times more common in women with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p>\n<p>Typically, patients experience a <strong>brief phase of thyrotoxicosis</strong> lasting 2-4 weeks, <strong>followed by hypothyroidism</strong> for 4-12 weeks, and then clinical resolution. Often,<strong> only one phase is apparent</strong>.</p>\n<p>In addition to painless goiter, silent thyroiditis can be distinguished from subacute thyroiditis by a <strong>normal ESR value</strong> and the <strong>presence of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies</strong>.</p>\n<p>Severe thyrotoxic symptoms can be managed with a brief course of propranolol, a 20–40 mg dose administered three or four times daily. Thyroxine replacement may be needed for treating the hypothyroid phase but should be withdrawn after 6–9 months, to enable patient recovery.</p>",

It can also be seen in yellow nail syndrome, Crohn's disease, Kawasaki's disease, Behcet's disease, cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, zinc deficiency, citrullinemia, pellagra, HIV infection, and even in healthy persons.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Nail findings and associated systemic conditions</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Nail finding</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Associated systemic condition</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Clubbing</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Inflammatory bowel disease</li>\n<li><span>Lung cancer</span></li>\n<li>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</li>\n<li><span>Complicated tuberculosis</span></li>\n<li><span>Suppurative lung disease (lung abscess, empyema, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis)</span></li>\n<li>Mesothelioma</li>\n<li>Cirrhosis</li>\n<li>Congenital heart disease, Endocarditis</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Koilonychia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Iron-deficiency anemia, hemochromatosis, Raynaud&rsquo;s disease</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Onycholysis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Psoriasis, onychomycosis, hyperthyroidism, sarcoidosis, trauma, amyloidosis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Pitting</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Psoriasis, Reiter&rsquo;s syndrome, Alopecia areata</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Beau&rsquo;s lines</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Any severe systemic illness that disrupts nail growth, Raynaud&rsquo;s disease, pemphigus, trauma</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Yellow nail</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lymphedema, pleural effusion, immunodeficiency, bronchiectasis, sinusitis, rheumatoid arthritis, nephrotic syndrome, thyroiditis, tuberculosis, Raynaud&rsquo;s disease</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Nail Pterygium</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dorsal: Lichen Planus</p>\n<p>Ventral: trauma, systemic sclerosis, Raynaud phenomenon, lupus erythematosus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p class=\"heading\">&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Nail finding</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Associated systemic condition</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Terry&rsquo;s (white) nails</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hepatic failure, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, CHF, hyperthyroidism, malnutrition</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Azure lunula</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson&rsquo;s disease), silver poisoning, quinacrine therapy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Half-and-half nails</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Specific for renal failure</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Muehrcke&rsquo;s lines</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Specific for hypoalbuminemia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Mees&rsquo; lines</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Arsenic poisoning, Hodgkin&rsquo;s disease, CHF, leprosy, malaria, chemotherapy, carbon monoxide poisoning, other systemic insults</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Dark longitudinal streaks</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Melanoma, benign nevus, chemical staining, normal variant in darkly pigmented people</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Splinter hemorrhage</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Subacute bacterial endocarditis, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, peptic ulcer disease, malignancies, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, psoriasis, trauma</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Telangiectasia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, dermatomyositis, scleroderma</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
