The direction of the incident <strong>light falling on the retina</strong> is from <strong>B to A</strong>, that is, from the nerve fiber layer towards the retinal pigment epithelium. The direction of <strong>transmission of the electrical signals</strong> in the retina is from <strong>A to B,&nbsp;</strong>that is, from the retinal pigment epithelium towards the nerve fiber layer.</p>\n<p>The given image shows fovea which indicates the vitreal side of the retina. Hence, B denotes the innermost layer of the retina which is the nerve fiber layer. The pigmented layer on the opposite side denoted by A is the retinal pigment epithelium.</p>\n<p>Although the <strong>pigment epithelium of the retina</strong> is responsible for processing the light signals and converting them to electrical impulses, it is <strong>located posteriormost in the retina</strong>. The incoming light has to travel through the ganglion cell layer and the bipolar layer to reach the pigment epithelium.</p>\n<p>The impulses from the pigment epithelium then travel from the posteriorly placed pigment layer anteriorly towards the bipolar layer and then to the ganglion layer. These impulses are transmitted along the axons of the ganglion cell layer which collectively form the optic nerve.</p>\n<p>The arrangement of cells in the retina is shown in the image below:</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Order of neurons in the visual pathway</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Order of neurons in the visual pathway</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>First-order neurons</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Photoreceptors <br />(<strong>rods and cones</strong>)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Second-order neurons</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Bipolar cells</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Third-order neurons</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ganglion cells <br />(<strong>optic nerve</strong>)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Fourth-order neurons</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Axons from the lateral geniculate body <br />(<strong>optic radiation</strong>)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/cdcd5b915c494c13b1a523d97fa017b0x1280x1418.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Layers of Retina</h3><p><strong>Layers of Retina&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>(inner to outer)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Internal limiting membrane</li>\n<li>Nerve fibre layer</li>\n<li>Ganglion cell layer&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Inner plexiform layer</li>\n<li>Inner nuclear layer</li>\n<li>Outer plexiform layer&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Outer nuclear layer</li>\n<li>External limiting membrane</li>\n<li>Rods and cones</li>\n<li>Retinal pigment epithelium</li>\n</ol><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/441b0c4c46264c2a8e754af2303f2f40x1280x3064.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

This helps in the absorption of nicotine. This has to be repeated until it releases no more nicotine.</p>\n<p>Nicotine withdrawal is characterized by mood changes, insomnia, poor concentration, restlessness, bradycardia, and weight gain. Withdrawal usually peaks at 1-3 days and lasts up to 3-4 weeks. This makes it difficult to maintain abstinence from cigarette smoking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Nicotine replacement therapy</strong>&nbsp;strategies have been developed to reduce nicotine withdrawal. Therapies include giving nicotine in the form of <strong>gums or patches</strong> for a <strong>period of 1 month</strong> to manage the withdrawal symptoms. It can then be <strong>gradually tapered.</strong></p>\n<p>Nicotine gum is useful in several ways. Firstly, it provides nicotine in <strong>low doses</strong> to <strong>avoid precipitation of withdrawal,&nbsp;</strong>which is usually the reason why patients use tobacco again. Secondly, it is <strong>free of smoke</strong> and other harmful additives. Thirdly, it provides an indirect measure of craving and how heavy tobacco usage was, in the first place.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Chewing it like regular gum</strong> releases all of the nicotine at once, causing <strong>nausea.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Nicotine gum</strong> acts as a nicotine supplement and <strong>is better than a placebo</strong>. Any de-addiction requires motivation, and nicotine replacement might serve as a useful adjunct in motivated individuals.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Vaping or e-cigarettes have adverse effects</strong> on the cardiopulmonary system despite no smoke like conventional cigarettes. It consists of a battery-powered device, that converts a nicotine-containing liquid into vapor which the user inhales through the mouth, and exhales, just like a cigarette. It uses vapor instead of smoke, which is why it is referred to as vaping.</p>",
