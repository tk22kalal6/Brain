before.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Reaction formation</strong>:&nbsp;An unacceptable impulse is transformed into its opposite; results in the formation of character traits.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Eg: Listen to him tell his family he was not afraid&nbsp;when I saw him crying.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Repression</strong>:&nbsp;An idea or feeling is withheld from consciousness; unconscious
