The presence of <strong>coliform</strong> <strong>bacteria</strong> in the water may indicate <strong>faecal pollution</strong>, while the detection of <em>E.coli</em> confirms it. The presumptive coliform test is done by the <strong>multiple-tube technique</strong>. Following this, the <strong>Eijkman test</strong> is done to <strong>confirm</strong> the presence of<strong> <em>E. coli</em>.</strong> They can grow at 44°C (faecal thermotolerant bacilli), ferment lactose and cause indole and gas production.</p>\n<p>In this test, the bottles of the presumptive coliform test showing acid and gas are subcultured to tubes of <strong>single-strength MacConkey medium</strong>, which are then incubated at 44°C. After 24 hours, tubes with gas are said to have <em>E. Coli</em>. The number of bacteria present in the water sample is determined using <strong>McCrady's probability tables</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Presumptive coliform count</strong> detects the probable number of coliform bacilli in water. It can be positive due to the presence of organisms other than <em>E.coli.</em></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Colony counts</strong> provide an estimate of the general bacterial purity of water.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Methylene blue reduction test</strong> is used to assess the bacterial contamination of milk.</p>",
