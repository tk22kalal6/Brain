The amnesia is <strong>predominantly retrograde</strong> with minimal anterograde amnesia. It usually follows severe emotional trauma, interpersonal conflicts, and other <strong>stressful events</strong>, such as sexual abuse, loss of a loved one, loss of livelihood, etcetera. Clinically, the presentation is quite dramatic with significant impairment in social, personal, and occupational functioning. In order for a diagnosis of dissociative amnesia to be made, it is imperative to rule out substance use, and other neurological and psychological conditions that may lead to a presentation similar to dissociative amnesia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is further categorized into the following types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selective amnesia:&nbsp;Ability to remember some of the events occurring during a circumscribed period of time.</li>\n<li>Localized amnesia:&nbsp;Inability to recall all events in a circumscribed period of time.</li>\n<li>Generalized amnesia:&nbsp;Failure to recall one&rsquo;s entire life.</li>\n<li>Continuous amnesia:&nbsp;Failure to recall successive events as they occur.</li>\n<li>Systematized amnesia:&nbsp;Amnesia for certain categories of memory, such as all memories relating to one&rsquo;s family or to a particular person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Dissociative fugue</strong> is characterized by a sudden, unintended, and <strong>unexpected travel</strong> to a place away from home, or workplace, or another place involved in one's daily repertoire. It is usually brief, lasting few hours to days, and is generally reversible. It is commonly associated with dissociative amnesia. In addition to amnesia, these patients may also experience confusion, trance-like behaviors, depersonalization, derealization, and conversion symptoms. It may recur in some patients.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that dissociative fugue was deleted as a major diagnostic category in DSM-5. It is instead declared as a subtype or specifier of disso&shy;ciative amnesia.</p>\n<p>Treatment of dissociative amnesia and dissociative fugue is mainly with psychotherapy.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 475\">\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Confabulation</strong>&nbsp;refers to the&nbsp;unconscious <strong>filling</strong> of <strong>gaps</strong> in memory&nbsp;with inaccurate, fabricated, and often implausible information.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Depersonalization</strong>&nbsp;is defined as the&nbsp;persistent or recurrent feeling of&nbsp;<strong>detachment</strong> from one's self.
