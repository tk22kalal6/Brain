This occurs when the head has been exposed to <strong>severe external heat</strong> sufficient to burn the scalp and skull. The <strong>blood</strong> may be <strong>extruded</strong> from the diploë and venous sinuses into the <strong>extradural space</strong> to produce a heat hematoma. This false hematoma is <strong>brown</strong> and <strong>friable,</strong> and the <strong>adjacent</strong> brain tissue shows <strong>hardening</strong> and <strong>discoloration</strong> from the heat.</p>\n<p>There is often a significant level of <strong>carboxyhemoglobin</strong> in the body if the death occurred when the fire was in progress. This should be of the <strong>same concentration</strong> in the heat hematoma as in the peripheral blood. If the victim suffered a head injury <strong>before</strong> the <strong>fire</strong> started (indicating an extradural hemorrhage), then there should be little or <strong>no carboxyhemoglobin</strong> in the <strong>hematoma.</strong></p>",
