      "solution": "<p>The above image shows&nbsp;<strong>mediolateral episiotomy</strong>. The primary advantage of mediolateral episiotomy over midline episiotomy is that there is a <strong>lesser chance of anal sphincter involvement</strong>&nbsp;due to extension.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An <strong>episiotomy</strong> is an <strong>intended incision</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>perineum</strong> with the goal of enlargement of the vaginal opening for birth. Prior to episiotomy, analgesia is provided by existing labor regional analgesia, <strong>bilateral pudendal nerve block</strong>, or local infiltration with 1% lignocaine. Typically, an episiotomy is <strong>completed</strong> <strong>when</strong> the <strong>head is visible</strong> during a contraction to a diameter of 4 to 5 cm.</p>\n<p>Midline episiotomy begins at the fourchette, incises the perineal body in the midline, and ends well before the external anal sphincter. Mediolateral episiotomy begins at the midline of the fourchette and is <strong>directed to the right or left at an angle of 60 degrees</strong> off the midline. This angle accounts for the stretch distortion of the perineal anatomy during crowning. After delivery and resolution of the distortion, it ultimately yields an incision 45 degrees from the midline for suturing.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Midline episiotomy</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Mediolateral episiotomy</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Surgical repair is easy</td>\n<td>Surgical repair is <strong>difficult</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blood loss is less</td>\n<td>Blood loss is<strong> more</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healing is superior</td>\n<td>Healing is not so good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dyspareunia is rare</td>\n<td>Dyspareunia is comparatively <strong>more</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\">Postoperative pain is less</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\">Postoperative pain is <strong>more</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\">Extension, if occurs, may involve the anal sphincter</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\">Extension, even if it occurs, will <strong>not involve the anal sphincter</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Mediolateral Episiotomy</h3><p>It begins within 3 mm of the midline in the posterior fourchette and is directed laterally at an angle of at least <strong>60 degrees</strong> from the midline.

It is done to check the patency of the lacrimal drainage system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lacrimal sac syringing should be performed only after ascertaining <strong>punctal patency</strong>. If there is severe stenosis, surgical enlargement of the punctum may be required before canalicular and naso-lacrimal duct patency can be confirmed. This procedure is <strong>contraindicated</strong> <strong>in the presence of an acute infection</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The procedure begins with the instillation of local anesthetic in the conjunctival sac.&nbsp;A punctum dilator is used to enlarge the punctal orifice. A <strong>lacrimal cannula</strong> on a saline-filled syringe is inserted into the lower punctum and, whilst keeping a gentle stretch laterally on the eyelid, advanced a few millimeters, following the contour of the canaliculus. <strong>A hard stop occurs if the cannula enters the lacrimal sac</strong>, coming to a stop at the medial wall of the sac. The rigid lacrimal bone can be felt through the medial wall. This <strong>excludes</strong> complete <strong>obstruction</strong> <strong>of </strong>the<strong> canalicular system</strong>. Gentle saline irrigation is then tried. If <strong>saline</strong> <strong>passes</strong> <strong>into</strong> the nose and <strong>throat</strong>, it will be <strong>tasted</strong> <strong>by</strong> the <strong>patient</strong>. This indicates the presence of a <strong>patent lacrimal system</strong>. A patient can still have watering of the eye due to subtle lacrimal pump failure or stenosis. Failure of saline to reach the throat is indicative of total obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. In this situation, the lacrimal sac will distend slightly during irrigation and there will be reflux of the saline through the opposite punctum.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/90071ab0dc5f45889679932fa531071cx1280x891.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Findings on syringing</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Diagnosis</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unable to pass cannula</td>\n<td>Punctal occlusion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regurgitation through same punctum but good flow through the other punctum</td>\n<td>Upper/Lower canaliculus block</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regurgitation through opposite punctum</td>\n<td>Common canalicular block</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regurgitation through opposite punctum after a few minutes of flow; pressure syringing leads to flow</td>\n<td>Partial nasolacrimal duct block</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Early regurgitation through opposite punctum</td>\n<td>Complete nasolacrimal duct block</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Relative <strong>contraindications</strong> include <strong>bleeding diathesis</strong>, prior abdominal surgery, distended bowels, or <strong>loculated ascites</strong>.

The <strong>preferred</strong> <strong>entry</strong> <strong>sites</strong> for paracentesis include r<strong>ight or left lower quadrants</strong> of the abdomen or even a <strong>midline puncture</strong> halfway between pubic symphysis and umbilicus. To prevent leaking of the ascitic fluid,<strong> Z-tracking of the needle</strong> is helpful. The needle is advanced slowly while performing continuous aspiration.
