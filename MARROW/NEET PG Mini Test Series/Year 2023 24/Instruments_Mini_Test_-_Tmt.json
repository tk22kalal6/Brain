Some examples of commonly done tuning fork tests are as follows:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Weber’s test </strong>is done by placing a vibrating tuning in the middle of the forehead or the vertex, and the patient is asked in which ear the sound is better heard. The inferences are as follows:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>It is reported as normal when the sound is heard equally in both ears</span></li>\n<li><span>In <strong>conductive</strong> deafness, it is lateralised to the <strong>worst</strong> ear.</span></li>\n<li><span>In <strong>sensorineural</strong> deafness it is lateralized to the <strong>better</strong> ear.</span></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/3fa3f86cc7e74fc3b274886bd12d3332x1279x1605.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><span>In<strong> Schwabach's test,</strong> the bone conduction of the patient is compared with that of the examiner, but unlike the absolute bone conduction test, the EAC is not occluded. Inferences are as follows:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Normal: The test result is the same as that of the examiner</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Conductive</strong> deafness: The test result is <strong>lengthier</strong> than that of the examiner</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Sensorineural</strong> deafness: The Test result is <strong>shorter</strong> than that of the examiner</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>Gelle’s test</strong> is a <strong>test of bone conduction</strong> and examines the effect of increased air pressure in the ear canal on hearing. Normally, when air pressure is increased in the ear canal by Siegel’s speculum, it pushes the tympanic membrane and ossicles inwards. This raises the intralabyrinthine pressure and causes immobility of the basilar membrane and decreased hearing. But, no change in hearing is observed when the ossicular chain is fixed or disconnected. Gelle’s test is <strong>positive</strong> in <strong>normal persons</strong> <strong>and</strong> in those with <strong>sensorineural hearing loss.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>The <strong>threshold tone decay</strong> test is a measure of nerve fatigue. A Tone of 4000Hz is presented at 5dB above the patient’s threshold of hearing for 60 seconds. A normal ear can hear continuously for a minute, but a patient with abnormal hearing stops hearing before 1 minute. Loudness is increased until the patient can hear the sound. A decay of <strong>more than 25 dB</strong> is diagnostic of a <strong>retrocochlear</strong> lesion.</span></p>\n<p><span>The <strong>Short Increment Sensitivity Index (SISI )</strong>test distinguishes between a <strong>cochlear</strong> and a <strong>retrocochlear </strong>lesion. Patients with cochlear lesions distinguish smaller changes in the intensity of pure tone better. In this test, a continuous tone is presented 20 dB above the threshold and sustained for about 2 min. Every 5 seconds, the tone is increased by 1 dB and 20 such blips are presented. The patient indicates the blips heard. In conductive deafness, the SISI score is seldom more than 15%. It is 70%-100% in cochlear deafness and 0%-20% in retrocochlear (nerve) deafness.</span></p>",

      "solution": "<p>The given image shows the&nbsp;<strong>Austin-Moore prosthesis. </strong>The<strong> Austin-Moore prosthesis&nbsp;</strong>is used for hemiarthroplasty in the neck of femur fracture in elderly individuals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Austin-Moore</strong> prosthesis has a head, neck, and stem. The stem has a hole to which the hook of the extractor can be attached. It helps in removing the prosthesis. There are<strong> two fenestrations</strong> in the stem which are for bone growth and fixing the prosthesis. It can be used <strong>without cement</strong> since its usage makes the removal difficult.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The below image shows Austin Moore's prosthesis.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5ef79f057fbe42f08f8d0f88c133c91cx800x600.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;<strong>Thompson prosthesis</strong> is used in<strong> hemiarthroplasty </strong>to replace the head of the femur.
