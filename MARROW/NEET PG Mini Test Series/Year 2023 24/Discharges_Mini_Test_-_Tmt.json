Pus spreads out of the cortex, along Volkmann's canals and settles sub-periosteally, eventually forming a discharging sinus.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8921e24f73664be396e94ba6dd8ddfb4x1280x979.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />Chronic osteomyelitis may occur by direct inoculation of the infective organism during <strong>trauma</strong> (like <strong>road traffic accidents</strong>). The infection continues to thrive within the bone leading to alternating quiescent and flare-up stages of chronic osteomyelitis.</p>\n<p>In response to the bacteria, the host bone starts an inflammatory reaction that results in <strong>bone destruction</strong> and the production of inflammatory cells and exudates<strong> (pus)</strong>. Once sufficient pus is formed, it propagates in the following directions:</p>\n<p><strong>Along the medullary cavity-</strong> Pus causes thrombosis of the venous and arterial medullary vessels as it spreads throughout the medullary cavity. Hence, a portion of the bone loses its blood supply.</p>\n<p>Pus leaves the cortex, travels through <strong>Volkmann's canals,</strong> and settles <strong>sub-periosteally.</strong> As a result, the periosteum is lifted off the underlying bone, damaging the periosteal blood supply to that area of the bone. This leads to the formation of a <strong>sequestrum.</strong> Sequestrum develops when a piece of necrotic bone separates from the surrounding healthy bone, serving as a <strong>nidus</strong> for infection<span>.</span></p>\n<p>The pus beneath the periosteum produces sub-periosteal new bone <strong>(periosteal reaction)</strong>. The periosteum eventually perforates, allowing pus to escape into the <strong>muscle</strong> or <strong>subcutaneous plane,</strong> where it can be felt as an <strong>abscess.</strong> If left untreated, the abscess bursts through the skin, forming a <strong>discharging sinus</strong> which is <strong>fixed</strong> to the underlying bone indicating that infection is coming from the bone. </p>\n<p>The<strong> involucrum</strong> is the dense new sclerotic bone surrounding the sequestrum. It is formed from deep layers of stripped periosteum. <strong>Cloacae </strong>are the perforations in the involucrum. Pus and tiny spicules of bone may be discharged through them.</p>\n<p>The radiograph below shows sequestrum, involucrum and cloacae: </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/234c5969c2c94781b62d355374b5091ax1280x1176.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />The <strong>epiphyseal plate</strong> is <strong>resistant</strong> to the spread of pus. It may be affected by the inflammatory process at times. The <strong>epiphysis-metaphysis</strong> junction's <strong>capsular attachment</strong> keeps pus from entering the nearby joint. In joints with an intra-articular metaphysis, pus can spread to the joint, and cause acute <strong>pyogenic arthritis.</strong></p>",

This condition is strongly associated with <strong>smoking.</strong></p>\n<p>The initial stage of this disease consists of dilatation of one or more lactiferous ducts due to <strong>hormonally induced myoepithelial relaxation</strong> of the duct wall. These ducts get filled with stagnant <strong>brown</strong> or <strong>green-coloured</strong> secretions. The collection may be discharged as shown below.</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/f68749c86c9b4952860239be1a038c42.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />In the later stages, the accumulation of fluid in the lactiferous ducts leads to infection and inflammation, due to irritation, causing <strong>periductal mastitis.</strong> The infections are most often mixed infections of <strong>aerobic</strong> and <strong>anaerobic</strong> flora of the skin. If the condition does not resolve, it can lead to the formation of a subareolar mass or abscess, and even mammary duct fistulas. Persistence of this condition eventually leads to fibrosis, which can cause<strong> slit-like retraction of the nipple.</strong></p>\n<p>Mammography reveals coarse rod and branching calcifications, described as <strong>broken needle </strong>calcification. This occurs due to the calcification of debris within dilated ducts.</p>\n<p>Initial episodes can be managed with <strong>antibiotics.</strong> Recurrent episodes of the disease are best managed by <strong>Hadfield operation.</strong> This operation consists of the excision of<strong> all the major lactiferous ducts. </strong>If a <strong>single duct</strong> is involved, then a <strong>microdochectomy</strong> is performed.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Intraductal papilloma </strong>is a benign condition wherein a wart-like growth occurs within the mammary ducts.

The causative organism is <em><strong>Staphylococcus aureus</strong></em><strong>.</strong> It is commonly associated with <strong>diabetes mellitus. </strong></p>\n<p>It presents as a <strong>painful hard lump</strong> in the initial stage of infection which increases in size to <strong>about 3-10 cm</strong>. This is followed by suppuration and <strong>pus </strong>is <strong>discharged </strong>from<strong> multiple follicular orifices.</strong></p>\n<p>Most lesions are usually solitary and are present on the back of the neck, the shoulders or the hips and thighs.</p>\n<p>Microbiological swabs are taken from the lesion for the culture of the organisms present. Treatment with penicillinase-resistant antibiotics such as <strong>flucloxacillin</strong> is recommended. <strong>Incision and drainage</strong> or saucerisation may be required to aid the removal of pus and necrotic tissue.
