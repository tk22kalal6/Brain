      "solution": "<p><strong>Local administration</strong> of Anti-snake venom (<strong>ASV</strong>) to deal with the local toxic effects of toxin is <strong>not recommended</strong> as it is <strong>ineffective</strong>, may cause pain, and may lead to compartment syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Anti-snake venom</strong> is the <strong>mainstay of treatment</strong> of snake envenomations. It is administered <strong>intravenously</strong> as the unbound toxin can only be neutralized in the bloodstream or tissue fluid. <strong>Intramuscular</strong> injections of ASV are also <strong>not recommended</strong> as its absorption may be retarded by hypovolemia induced by venom. ASV <strong>can cause anaphylactic reactions</strong> and is thus <strong>used only if</strong> there are <strong>signs of envenomation&nbsp;</strong>(Option C). ASV administration should be followed with careful monitoring to detect signs of anaphylaxis.</p>\n<p><strong>Systemic signs</strong> of envenomation are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evidence of <strong>coagulopathy</strong>: detected by clotting tests</li>\n<li>Evidence of <strong>neurotoxicity</strong>: signs like muscle paralysis, ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia.</li>\n<li><strong>Cardiovascular abnormalities</strong>: signs like shock, hypotension, and arrhythmias.</li>\n<li>Persistent and severe <strong>vomiting</strong> or <strong>abdominal pain</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ASV</strong> administration will <strong>also</strong> be <strong>required</strong> in cases of local signs like <strong>rapidly spreading swelling</strong> <strong>or</strong> swelling <strong>involving more than half</strong> of the <strong>affected limb</strong>.</p>\n<p>The first aid following a snake bite consists of the mnemonic: <strong>carry no right</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Carry</strong>: The victim is <strong>not allowed to walk</strong>, even for a short distance. Walking generates muscle-pumping activity which disperses the venom into the systemic circulation.</p>\n<p><strong>No</strong>: <strong>No</strong> <strong>tourniquet</strong>, no electrotherapy, <strong>no</strong> <strong>cutting</strong>, no pressure immobilization, <strong>no suction</strong> to the bite site. (Option A)</p>\n<p><strong>R</strong>: <strong>Reassure</strong> the patient since 70% of the bites are from non-venomous species.</p>\n<p><strong>I</strong>: <strong>Immobilize</strong> in the same way as a fractured limb. A <strong>splint</strong> can be applied to the bitten extremity to limit movement and assist with positioning. The extremity should be maintained in a neutral position at approximately heart level. (Option B)</p>\n<p><strong>GH</strong>: <strong>Get to a hospital</strong> immediately. The <strong>most important</strong> step is to <strong>rapidly transport</strong> the patient <strong>to</strong> a <strong>medical facility</strong> equipped to provide supportive management.</p>\n<p><strong>T</strong>: <strong>Tell</strong> the doctor of any systemic symptoms which may have appeared on the way to the hospital.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The clinical vignette describing a patient of RTA with hypotension and <strong>decreased pulse pressure</strong> is suggestive of <strong>haemorrhagic shock. </strong>The patient is probably seeping into <strong>hypovolemic shock. </strong>The patient who received 5 units of packed red blood cell transfusion(pRBCs) in 1-hour also indicates <strong>massive blood transfusion</strong>. <strong>Hyperthermia </strong>and <strong>Hypercalcemia </strong>are least likely seen after massive blood transfusion. </p>\n<p><strong>Hypocalcemia </strong>is a known complication of massive blood transfusion and not <strong>hypercalcemia. </strong>This is due to the <strong>citrate toxicity </strong>of transfusing stored blood. Hypothermia is due to the opening up of coelomic cavities and infusion of cold blood (refrigerated). </p>\n<p>The classification of haemorrhagic shock, the compensatory mechanisms seen in shock and the expected electrolyte abnormalities in a massive blood transfusion are all enlisted in the pearls attached below. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Complications of a Massive Transfusion</h3><p><strong>Massive transfusion (MT)</strong>&nbsp;is defined as the replacement by transfusion of <strong>10 units of pRBCs</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>24 hours&nbsp;</strong>or more than <strong>4 units of pRBCs</strong> in <strong>one hour</strong>.</p>\n<p>Complications from massive transfusion include:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Complication</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Mechanism</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hypothermia</td>\n<td>As blood products are normally stored between 1&deg;C and 6&deg;C</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Coagulopathy</td>\n<td>\n<p>MT with PRBCs alone causes a <strong>dilutional coagulopathy&nbsp;</strong>(vs&nbsp;consumptive coagulopathy caused by&nbsp;massive hemorrhage)</p>\n<p>Can be prevented by starting early transfusion of FFP, platelets, pRBCs in a <strong>1:1:1 ratio</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Acidosis/ Alkalosis</td>\n<td>\n<p>Mild acidosis - increased CO2 levels in stored blood by 21-35 days</p>\n<p>Metabolic alkalosis -&nbsp;citrate gets metabolized to bicarbonate</p>\n<p>Metabolic acidosis - due to tissue hypoperfusion</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hyperkalemia/ Hypokalemia</td>\n<td>\n<p>Initially - Hyperkalemia, as stored blood has high K+ levels due to inactivated Na/K/ATPase pump</p>\n<p>Later - Hypokalemia, due to intracellular potassium uptake and metabolic alkalosis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hypocalcemia</td>\n<td>Stored blood is anticoagulated with citrate, which binds calcium.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hypomagnesemia</td>\n<td>Infusion of large volumes of magnesium-poor fluids and&nbsp;binding of magnesium to citrate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Impaired O2-carrying capacity of hemoglobin</td>\n<td>Decreased 2, 3 DPG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Volume overload</td>\n<td>Due to massive transfusion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification of hemorrhagic shock</h3><table class=\"scrollable bordered\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"rowsep\">Parameters</th>\n<th class=\"rowsep\">Class I</th>\n<th class=\"rowsep\">Class II</th>\n<th class=\"rowsep\">Class III</th>\n<th class=\"rowsep\">Class IV</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blood loss in %</td>\n<td>&lt;15</td>\n<td>15&ndash;30</td>\n<td>30&ndash;40</td>\n<td>&gt;40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pulse rate</td>\n<td>&lt;100</td>\n<td>100&ndash;120</td>\n<td>120&ndash;140</td>\n<td>&gt;140</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blood pressure</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>Decreased</td>\n<td>Greatly decreased</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pulse pressure</td>\n<td>Normal or increased</td>\n<td>Decreased</td>\n<td>Decreased</td>\n<td>Decreased</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Respiratory rate</td>\n<td>14&ndash;20</td>\n<td>20&ndash;30</td>\n<td>30&ndash;40</td>\n<td>&gt;35</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mental status</td>\n<td>Slightly anxious</td>\n<td>Mildly anxious</td>\n<td>Anxious, confused</td>\n<td>Confused, lethargic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Urine output (mL/hr)</td>\n<td>&gt;30</td>\n<td>20&ndash;30</td>\n<td>5&ndash;15</td>\n<td>Minimal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
