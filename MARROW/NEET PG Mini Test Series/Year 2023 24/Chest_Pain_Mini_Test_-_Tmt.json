      "solution": "<p>This patient appears to be having symptoms and EKG signs of <strong>Prinzmetal/Variant/Vasospastic angina</strong>, likely due to cocaine use.</p>\n<p><strong>Cocaine inhibits monoamine </strong>(dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin) <strong>reuptake</strong> and acts as a<strong> vasoconstrictor - </strong>can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the heart: Chest pain, and shortness of breath. This sympathetic stimulation can occur at all concentrations of cocaine and <strong>causes</strong> hypertension and ventricular ectopics. Cocaine can also increase heart rate and blood pressure, which further worsens these symptoms. The first-line agents that are used are <strong>calcium channel blockers (CCBs)</strong> and <strong>nitrates.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Prinzmetal angina </strong>occurs as a result of vasospasm of the epicardial coronary artery. It may result in transient transmural ischemia. The cause of this spasm is poorly understood and is suspected to be due to <strong>hypercontractility</strong> of cardiac smooth muscles. This type of angina is commonly seen in <strong>women</strong> under 50 years of age and is precipitated by <strong>smoking</strong> and <strong>cocaine</strong> use.</p>\n<p>The vasospasm leads to<strong> transmural ischemia, </strong>which is seen on the ECG as transient <strong>ST-segment elevation although</strong> there is no atherosclerosis present on angiography. </p>\n<p>Depolarization of cardiac myocytes depends primarily on the influx of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ions. Ca <sup>2+ </sup>antagonists relax arterial smooth muscle, thereby <strong>decreasing</strong> arterial <strong>resistance,</strong> <strong>blood pressure</strong>, and <strong>cardiac afterload</strong>. Hence, calcium channel blockers such as long-acting <strong>nifedipine and amlodipine</strong> are employed along with <strong>nitrates</strong> to alleviate vasospasm.</p>\n<p>Cocaine is obtained from the plant <strong><em>Erythroxylum coca</em>.</strong> The symptoms of cocaine poisoning are divided into two stages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Stage of excitement:</strong> This stage is characterized by features like dysphagia, dryness in the mouth, tachycardia, and dilated pupils. The reflexes are exaggerated and are associated with tingling and numbness in the hands and feet. </li>\n<li><strong>Stage of depression</strong>: This stage presents with feeble respiration, profuse sweating, convulsions, and death. In most cases, the cause of death is cardiopulmonary failure or vascular collapse.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b70d2bb24022494a9171d7143c07b1c0x904x632.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Chronic users develop a feeling of insects crawling through the skin or the presence of grains of sand under the skin. This is pathognomic for cocaine poisoning and is known as cocaine bugs or Magnan's symptoms/syndrome. Ulceration and sometimes perforation of the nasal septum are seen in chronic abusers due to the sniffing habit.</p>\n<p> Option A: Aortic dissection clinically presents with tearing chest/back pain associated with diaphoresis, syncope, weakness, and dyspnea or neurological manifestations. Unequal pulses or widely discordant blood pressure in the extremities may be seen due to changes of flow in the true and false lumens. There can be hypertension or hypotension, loss of pulses, findings of aortic regurgitation, and pulmonary edema. It is unlikely in this patient who has equal pulses and pain relief with nitroglycerin,</p>\n<p>Option B: Pulmonary embolism is unlikely in this patient with no risk factors or comorbidities. Most patients present with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and tachypnea. The classical clinical triad of sudden onset of chest pain, dyspnoea, and hemoptysis is present in only a few cases.</p>\n<p>Option D: Myocardial Infarction is more likely to occur in people with underlying heart disease, such as coronary artery disease. Moreover, troponin would be elevated in case of MI.</p>\n<p> </p>",

This pill causes <strong>direct damage</strong> to the mucosa. The risk factors for pill-induced esophagitis include <strong>poor pill-taking habits, consuming inadequate liquids, and lying down immediately after</strong> consuming the pill. The most common site for pill-induced esophagitis is in the<strong> mid-esophagus</strong>, near the crossing of the<strong> aorta or carina</strong>. These structures <strong>externally compress</strong> the esophagus and prevent the movement of the pills.</p>\n<p>Drugs causing esophagitis: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Doxycycline</li>\n<li>Tetracycline</li>\n<li>Quinidine</li>\n<li>Potassium chloride</li>\n<li><strong>Ferrous sulfate</strong></li>\n<li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<strong>NSAIDs</strong>)</li>\n<li>Bisphosphonates</li>\n<li>Phenytoin</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Treatment is <strong>discontinuation of the offending pill.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Patients with<strong> diffuse esophageal spasms</strong> present with <strong>dysphagia for solids and liquids </strong>and a sensation of <strong>food getting stuck in the esophagus</strong>. The pain is usually squeezing or constricting in character. Pill esophagitis is more likely in the setting of a new offending medication intake.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Coronary artery disease</strong> is typically described as a <strong>pressure or squeezing sensation</strong>, and it is often precipitated by exertion or stress.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Hiatal hernia</strong> is a condition in which part of the stomach protrudes through the diaphragm and into the esophagus. The symptoms of hiatal hernia can include <strong>heartburn, regurgitation, and chest pain that usually occurs postprandially. </strong>However, the chest pain is typically not as severe as the pain associated with pill-induced esophagitis, and the new medication usage makes pill esophagitis more likely.</p>",
