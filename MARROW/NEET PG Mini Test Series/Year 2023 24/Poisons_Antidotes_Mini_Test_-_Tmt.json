      "solution": "<p>The suitable antidote to this patient presenting with features of <strong>opiate intoxication </strong>is <strong>naloxone. </strong>The derivative drug, <strong>opium </strong>is derived from the <strong>Papaver somniferum </strong>plant as shown in the clinical vignette.</p>\n<p>Toxic parts of the plant include the unripe fruit capsule and the latex juice. Active principles of opium are grouped under <strong>phenanthrenes (morphine, codeine, heroin) </strong>and <strong>benzyl-isoquinolones</strong> <strong>(papaverine, narcotin)</strong>.</p>\n<p>These drugs act on mu, kappa, delta receptors in the CNS and mediate the effects of euphoria, analgesia, respiratory depression, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and miosis. </p>\n<p>The antidote to opiate intoxication is a <strong>competitive opiate antagonist</strong> named <strong>naloxone </strong>which competes with opioids at their receptor sites. Dose: 0.4-2 mg IV (It may be repeated every 10-15 minutes up to a maximum dose of 10 mg).</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Flumazenil</strong> is the<strong> antidote to treat benzodiazepine (BZD)</strong> intoxication. Benzodiazepines (alprazolam, flunitrazepam) are sedative-hypnotics and symptoms of intoxication include normal vital signs, sedation, diplopia, ataxia, slurred speech, and impaired motor function. Flumazenil acts as a competitive antagonist at the site of BZD action, which is the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor. </p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Physostigmine </strong>is used in the <strong>treatment of anticholinergic toxicity due to atropine</strong>. Atropine is the anticholinergic active principle derived from tropane alkaloids such as Datura stramonium and Atropa belladonna. Toxidrome consists of features such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, agitation, delirium, mydriasis, dry flushed skin, and urinary retention. Physostigmine is a reversible acetylcholine esterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine concentrations in the synaptic cleft to mitigate the effects of atropine toxicity. </p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Atropine</strong> is used in the<strong> treatment of cholinergic toxicity due to organophosphates (DDT, parathion, malathion)</strong>. Symptoms of cholinergic toxicity include bradycardia, respiratory depression, and autonomic symptoms of salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation. Atropine used in association with pralidoxime act as competitive inhibitors at the nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to neutralize the toxicity.</p>",
