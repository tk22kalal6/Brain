It occurs due to a mutation of<strong> Na<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>–</sup> co-transporter </strong>(NCCT)<strong> in the distal tubule</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>NCCT</strong> helps in the <strong>absorption of sodium and chloride</strong> ions from the lumen of the distal tubule. In Gitelman's syndrome, due to the<strong> loss of function</strong> of NCCT, there will be <strong>increased sodium and chloride delivery to collecting duct and volume retraction</strong>. This results in <strong>increased</strong> renin and <strong>aldosterone secretion</strong>. Aldosterone act on epithelial sodium channels in the collecting duct causing increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions leading to <strong>hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Downregulation of magnesium-permeable channels in Gitelman syndrome leads to urinary loss of magnesium resulting in <strong>hypomagnesemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>There is increased passive reabsorption of calcium in the proximal convoluted tubule in Gitelman syndrome resulting in <strong>hypocalciuria</strong>. </p>\n<p>Hypomagnesemia impairs the function of calcitropic hormones and down-regulates the normal inverse association between ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone, and calcitriol. This results in reduced skeletal sensitivity of PTH and impaired intestinal calcium transport and explains the <strong>lack of hypercalcemia</strong> response to hypocalciuria. </p>\n<p>Low magnesium levels result in the reduction of pyrophosphate activity that could promote pyrophosphate crystallization in joints causing joint pains and <strong>chondrocalcinosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Even though patients present above the age of 6 years, the diagnosis in most cases is established during adulthood. Patients often present with signs of tetany, paresthesias, and chondrocalcinosis, as a result of hypomagnesemia and fatiguability. </p>\n<p>Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia prolong the duration of the action potential of cardiomyocytes and consequently increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Bartter's syndrome</strong> affects the <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup>  co-transporter</strong> in the <strong>thick ascending loop of Henle</strong>.

It results in <strong>severe hypertension</strong> with hypokalemia.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Fanconi's syndrome</strong> occurs due to a <strong>defect</strong> in the <strong>proximal tubular</strong> function that prevents the absorption of electrolytes and other substances that are normally absorbed by the proximal tubule.

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario of a primigravida who presents with sudden onset of fever, neurologic abnormalities(altered mental status, confusion), thrombocytopenia (petechiae over lower limbs), hemolytic anaemia, acute kidney injury and antibodies to &nbsp;ADAMTS13 suggests the diagnosis of <strong>t</strong><strong>hrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura</strong> (TTP).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TTP is a <strong>thrombotic microangiopathy</strong> that can be inherited or spontaneously acquired. It results from a <strong>deficiency of, or antibodies to</strong>, the metalloprotease <strong>ADAMTS13,&nbsp;</strong>which&nbsp;normally <strong>cleaves multimers</strong> of<strong>&nbsp;vWF</strong>. <strong>Failure to cleave</strong> these multimers results in abnormally large vWF multimers which activate platelets and lead to <strong>excessive platelet adhesion </strong>and<strong> aggregation</strong>. This causes&nbsp;platelet thrombi to form, and fibrin deposits to take place&nbsp;at various sites. These thrombi result in the <strong>classic pentad</strong> of clinical features:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia</li>\n<li>Thrombocytopenia</li>\n<li>Renal failure</li>\n<li>Neurologic findings</li>\n<li>Fever</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>platelet thrombi narrow</strong> the vessel <strong>lumen,</strong>&nbsp;causing&nbsp;<strong>shearing stress</strong> on the red blood cells that are passing through. This results in microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia. The same <strong>platelet thrombi&nbsp;</strong>cause <strong>microvascular occlusion</strong> and result in features like<strong> renal failure</strong> and <strong>neurological manifestations</strong>.</p>\n<p>On peripheral smear, these fragmented red cells appear as <strong>schistocytes</strong> or <strong>helmet cells,</strong> as shown in the image below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7698db7a0b9c479d9e61b2dc0d1b4fd4x754x594.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Timely diagnosis is important to prevent devastating outcomes like profuse bleeding and renal failure. The <strong>best method to treat</strong> these patients is using <strong>plasma exchange</strong> therapy. It should be continued until the platelet counts are back to normal and there are no signs of hemolysis for at least 2 days. <strong>Glucocorticoids</strong> can also be used along with this therapy. In refractory cases, rituximab, and <strong>caplacizumab</strong> an antiVWF nanobody decreases mortality when used in patients with <strong>ADAMTS13 &lt;10%</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other causes of microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Most common)</li>\n<li>Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)</li>\n<li>Malignant hypertension</li>\n<li>Systemic lupus erythematosus</li>\n<li>Disseminated cancer&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option (A): <strong>Immune thrombocytopenic purpura</strong> occurs as a <strong>chronic</strong> disease in adults with several episodes over time, usually <strong>following infections</strong>.&nbsp;It presents as mucocutaneous bleeding and very low platelet counts. These patients have otherwise <strong>normal peripheral blood pictures.</strong></p>\n<p>Option (B):<strong> Disseminated intravascular coagulation&nbsp;</strong>refers to the<strong> widespread intravascular clot formation</strong>, commonly due to sepsis, trauma, and obstetric complications. These patients present with petechiae, ecchymoses, oozing from venipuncture sites, etc. They do not display the classic pentad seen in TTP. Schistocytes may be present on peripheral smear. Deranged clotting parameters are seen only in DIC and not in TTP.</p>\n<p>Option (C): <strong>Hemolytic uremic syndrome</strong> is a disorder seen predominantly in <strong>children</strong>, following an episode of <strong>bloody diarrhea</strong>. <strong><em>Escherichia coli</em> O157:H7</strong> is most commonly the cause of this diarrhea. It can also present with&nbsp;acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia, but neurological manifestations are less common. ADAMTS13 levels are normal in a majority of patients.

The most common site of blockage is the <strong>terminal ileum</strong> before entering the cecum. It usually presents with symptoms of intestinal obstruction (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, distention, and obstipation) in patients with a history of gallstones.</p>\n<p>Large-sized gallstones will not be able to pass through the normal cystic duct. This causes inflammation of the gallbladder and results in <strong>pressure necrosis</strong>. This in turn leads to <strong>biliary-enteric fistula</strong> formation resulting in a triad of features known as <strong>Rigler’s triad.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1303\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The patient may have <strong>constant pain</strong> or recurrent <strong>episodic discomfort</strong> from the intestinal obstruction which may be incomplete. CT scan is helpful in the diagnosis. This condition is managed by <span><strong>laparotomy and milking the stone</strong> proximally away from the site of impaction</span>. The stone is tried to be crushed within the bowel lumen or the intestine is opened at that point to remove the gallstone.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Quincke's triad</strong> is seen in <strong>h</strong><strong>emobilia</strong>. It comprises upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, abdominal pain, and obstructive jaundice.</p>\n<p><strong>Borchardt triad</strong> is seen in gastric volvulus. It comprises a sudden-onset severe upper abdominal pain, recurrent retching with minimal vomitus and inability to pass a nasogastric (NG) tube.</p>\n<p><strong>Saint's triad</strong> comprises hiatus hernia, gallstones, and colonic diverticulosis.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1544\">Note: Obstipation is the failure to pass both flatus and faeces.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Triads in Surgery</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Triad</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Seen in</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Components</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Borchardt’s Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Gastric Volvulus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Epigastric pain + Inability to vomit + Inability to pass a nasogastric tube</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Cushing’s Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Intracranial hypertension</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypertension + Bradycardia + Irregular respiration</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Dieulafoy’s Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Acute appendicitis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypersensitiveness of skin + Reflex muscular contraction + Tenderness at Mc Burney’s point</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Galezia's Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>\n<p>Dupuytren’s contracture + Retroperitoneal fibrosis + Peyronie’s disease of the penis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hutchinson’s Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Congenital syphilis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hutchison’s teeth (notched upper incisors) + Interstitial keratitis + Nerve deafness</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Mackler’s Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Boerhaave’s syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Thoracic pain + Vomiting + Cervical subcutaneous emphysema</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Quincke's Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hemobilia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Gastrointestinal hemorrhage + Biliary colic + Jaundice</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Rigler’s Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Gallstone ileus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Small bowel obstruction + Pneumobilia + Ectopic gallstone</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Saint's Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td>\n<p>Hiatus hernia + Gallstones+ Colonic diverticulosis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tillaux’s Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Mesenteric cyst</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Soft fluctuant swelling in umbilical region + Freely mobile perpendicular to mesentery + Zone of resonance all around</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Trotter’s Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Conductive hearing loss + Immobility of homolateral soft palate + Trigeminal neuralgia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Virchow’s Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Thrombosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypercoagulability + Stasis + Endothelial injury</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Whipple’s Triad</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Insulinoma</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Symptoms of hypoglycemia + Serum glucose &lt;50 mg/dL + Symptomatic relief on glucose ingestion</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
