It occurs in some tropical regions and is often considered a postinfectious complication. Diagnosis is based on a <strong>small intestinal biopsy</strong> showing villous atrophy and chronic inflammation, similar to celiac disease. However, tropical sprue is <strong>unresponsive</strong> to a <strong>gluten-free diet</strong>.</p>\n<p>Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., <strong>tetracycline</strong> for up to six months) and <strong>folic acid supplementation</strong>, which can lead to improvement within weeks. Patients often recover fully if they leave the endemic area. Folic acid alone can improve symptoms and correct hematologic deficiencies, but antibiotics are typically needed for complete resolution.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Celiac disease</strong> is a gluten-sensitive enteropathy.

It is more commonly seen in males, and the peak age group is between 65-70 years. The <strong>main risk factor</strong> for HCC is <strong>cirrhosis</strong> and associated chronic liver damage due to chronic infection by hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV), <strong>alcohol abuse</strong>, metabolic syndrome, or hemochromatosis. The<strong> incidence </strong>of<strong> HCC</strong> is <strong>increasing</strong> worldwide. This is contributed by the increase in HCV and HBV infections, along with lifestyle disorders like obesity.&nbsp;Obesity is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This progresses on to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) causing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus,&nbsp;NASH and NAFLD are risk factors for HCC.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regular surveillance, including liver imaging and monitoring of alpha-fetoprotein levels, is recommended for high-risk populations, such as those with liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B or C infection, or significant alcohol consumption. Early detection of HCC can improve treatment outcomes and overall prognosis.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Very early HCC is treated by ablation. Early HCC with a single nodule is resected, but when there are multiple nodules over 3 cm, ablation or transplantation are considered.&nbsp;Intermediate-stage HCC is treated by chemoembolization.&nbsp;Transarterial chemoembolization (<strong>TACE</strong>) is used for multinodular lesions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Hepatic adenomas</strong> are <strong>benign liver tumors</strong> that are often <strong>associated with oral contraceptive use</strong> and <strong>anabolic steroid use</strong>.&nbsp;The patient's history of alcohol dependence and high alpha-fetoprotein levels are not consistent with hepatic adenoma. Additionally, hepatic adenomas are usually <strong>asymptomatic</strong> and do not present with sudden unintentional weight loss.</p>\n<p>Option B: Cholangiocarcinoma&nbsp;is a cancer that arises from the bile ducts within the liver. While patients with alcohol dependence may have an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma, the <strong>elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels are not typical</strong> for this type of cancer. Cholangiocarcinomas usually <strong>present with jaundice, pruritus, and abdominal pain</strong>, but sudden weight loss is less characteristic.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Alcoholic hepatitis</strong> is an inflammation of the liver caused by excessive alcohol consumption. It usually presents with jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain. While the patient's history of alcohol dependence might suggest alcoholic hepatitis, elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels and unintentional weight loss are not typical for this condition. Moreover, the AST/ALT ratio is usually greater than 2 in alcoholic hepatitis, but it is 0.5 in this case.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Liver tumors - commons</h3><ul>\n<li>Most common tumor overall: Metastatic&nbsp;tumor</li>\n<li>Most common <strong>primary benign</strong> tumor: Cavernous hemangioma</li>\n<li>Most common <strong>primary malignant</strong> tumor: Hepatocellular carcinoma</li>\n<li>Most common <strong>primary malignant</strong> liver tumor of early <strong>childhood</strong>: Hepatoblastoma</li>\n<li>Most common tumor associated with <strong>arsenic / vinyl chloride</strong>: Angiosarcoma</li>\n<li>Most common tumor associated with <strong>oral contraceptive / anabolic steroid</strong>: Hepatic adenoma</li>\n<li>Most common tumor rupture spontaneously causing <strong>hemoperitoneum</strong>: Hepatic adenoma</li>\n</ul>",
