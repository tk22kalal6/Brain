It is one of the most common<strong> inborn errors of metabolism</strong>. MCAD is an important enzyme involved in <strong>fatty acid beta-oxidation</strong>, which is important in producing <strong>ketone bodies</strong> as an energy source when blood glucose levels are low.</span></p>\n<p class=\"xVISr Y9Dpf bCMSCT OZy-3 lnyWN yMZv8w bCMSCT public-DraftStyleDefault-block-depth0 fixed-tab-size public-DraftStyleDefault-text-ltr\"><span class=\"B2EFF public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr\">It is usually diagnosed at birth during routine screening for disorders of the newborn. However, sometimes, it can be detected <strong>within</strong> the <strong>first two years of life</strong>. </span><span class=\"B2EFF public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr\">These babies present with <strong>vomiting</strong> that progresses to <strong>lethargy</strong> and <strong>seizures triggered by mild illness</strong>. The common laboratory results seen in these patients result from a failure to synthesize ketone bodies during episodes of hypoglycemia. Hence, the child will present with <strong>hypoketotic hypoglycemia</strong>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"xVISr Y9Dpf bCMSCT OZy-3 lnyWN yMZv8w bCMSCT public-DraftStyleDefault-block-depth0 fixed-tab-size public-DraftStyleDefault-text-ltr\"><span class=\"B2EFF public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr\">The diagnosis can be confirmed with a combination of <strong>biochemical </strong>and <strong>genetic testing</strong>. This illness, once diagnosed, can be easily managed with <strong>small, frequent meals</strong> to avoid a state of hypoglycemia. </span></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency</strong> can result in <strong>phenylketonuria</strong>. This is an inborn error of metabolism in which phenylalanine is unable to convert to tyrosine, resulting in the <strong>accumulation of phenylalanine</strong>. This results in the characteristic<strong> 'musty' odor</strong> of the urine and body fluids. These children can also present with <strong>seizures </strong>and hyperactivity. In fact, many of the symptoms result from <strong>increased phenylpyruvate (a ketoacid)</strong> derived from the buildup of phenylalanine in this condition.</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> UMP synthase</strong> is an enzyme <strong>deficiency</strong> that results in <strong>orotic aciduria</strong>. This disorder is an <strong>inborn error of pyrimidine metabolism</strong> that presents with developmental delay, failure to thrive, and possibly epilepsy. Laboratory testing reveals <strong>pancytopenia.</strong>  </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>HMG CoA reductase</strong> is an important enzyme involved in the <strong>synthesis of cholesterol.</strong> This enzyme is<strong> targeted by statins</strong>, which are prescribed in hypercholesterolemia and in patients at risk for cardiovascular events. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Rothera's Test Procedure</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/73b9ba92c9384966a6760940ce51d4fcx287x140.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>Rothera's test, positive for ketone bodies.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Inborn Errors of Amino Acid Metabolism and Their Associated Urine Odor</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Inborn Error of Metabolism</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Urine Odor</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Maple syrup urine disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Maple syrup</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hawkinsinuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Swimming pool</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cat urine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Isovaleric acidemia</p>\n<p>Glutaric acidemia (type II)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sweaty feet</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hypermethioninemia</p>\n<p>Tyrosinemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Boiled cabbage</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Multiple carboxylase deficiency</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tomcat urine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Phenylketonuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Mousy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Trimethylaminuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rotting fish</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Oasthouse syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dried malt/hops</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types, Location and Properties of Fatty acid oxidation</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Types of Oxidation</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Location</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Properties</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Associated Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Beta oxidation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Mitochondria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>A catabolic process by which two-carbons are cleaved from the fatty acid molecule and released as acetyl CoA starting from the carboxyl end.</p>\n<p>The chain is broken between the &alpha;(2) and&nbsp;&beta;(3) carbon.</p>\n<p>1 round of beta-oxidation yield 1FADH2, 1NADH, and 1 Acetyl CoA.</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Alpha oxidation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Peroxisome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The presence of the 3-methyl group of phytanic acid prevents degradation by beta-oxidation.</p>\n<p>The chain is broken between the terminal carboxyl group and &alpha;(2) carbon removing that carbon as CO2.
