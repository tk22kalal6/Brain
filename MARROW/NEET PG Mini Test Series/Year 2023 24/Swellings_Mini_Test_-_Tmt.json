This tropical lymphedema resembles lymphatic filariasis. Podoconiosis, commonly known as <strong>endemic non-filarial elephantiasis </strong>or \"mossy foot,\" is a non-infectious ailment caused by prolonged barefoot contact with volcanic red clay soil, an irritant. The exact cause of this debilitating condition is unknown, however transdermal migration of <strong>silica and aluminium silicate microparticles</strong> may cause an abnormal inflammatory response. The particles are absorbed by lymphatic system macrophages, causing an inflammatory response that leads to fibrosis and channel obstruction.</p>\n<p>The disease progresses through <strong>prodromal</strong>, <strong>early</strong>, and <strong>late</strong> stages. Forefoot pruritus, burning in the foot and lower leg, fluctuating chills, and generalized arthralgia define the prodromal phase. The symptoms above may progress to forefoot swelling, splaying, and clear lymph fluid leakage. The epidermis forms hyperkeratotic papillomata that resemble moss or velvet, hence the name \"<strong>mossy foot</strong>\" in African vernacular. Acute episodes may include fever, rigors, and fast leg discomfort and edema. In the advanced stage, both lower legs may acquire hard, fibrotic edema, with one leg usually worse.
