Clinically, it presents as a malabsorption syndrome with <strong>diarrhea, abdominal</strong> pain, and <strong>marked weight</strong> loss.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Pernicious anemia</strong> is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of <strong>autoantibodies</strong> that <strong>impairs</strong> the production or activity of the <strong>intrinsic factor</strong> (IF) that is released from the parietal cells, which is required for the uptake of vitamin B12. These patients also develop chronic atrophic gastritis, characterized by loss of parietal cells, infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and megaloblastic changes in mucosal cells.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Tropical sprue</strong> is another malabsorption disorder seen as <strong>diarrhea, steatorrhea, nutritional deficiencies,</strong> and <strong>weight loss.</strong> It is prevalent in some tropical areas hence the name. Though the exact etiology is still unaccounted for, it is mostly attributed to infectious agents considering its response to antibiotics. It is diagnosed by a small intestinal biopsy which shows a close resemblance to that seen in celiac disease.

The rapid progression of symptoms makes Prion disease caused by accumulation of misfolded protein the likely cause of this condition. The source of the prion infection could have been the <strong>surgical equipment</strong> that was not <strong>adequately</strong> sterilized. </p>\n<p>The proteins that make up the <strong>prions</strong> (PrP) are present even normally in the cells. This normal form, <strong>PrPc,</strong> is in a predominantly α-helical configuration and is sensitive to proteases. However, the prions (infectious form) are in an abnormal <strong>β-pleated</strong> configuration and are called <strong>PrPSc.</strong> This pathological form is <strong>not degradable</strong> by <strong>proteases</strong> and converts the normal form- PrPc to the abnormal form- PrPSc. This abnormal protein gets deposited as <strong>plaques</strong> and <strong>degeneration</strong> of <strong>surrounding neuronal</strong> and glial tissue occurs characterized by intracellular vacuoles, leading to a characteristic <strong>spongiform encephalopathy.</strong> There is no associated inflammatory response to these agents. </p>\n<p>Four types of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have been described:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sporadic (sCJD): Most common;</li>\n<li>Variant (vCJD): Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), Kuru;</li>\n<li>Familial (fCJD): These individuals carry a PrPc mutation and include Gerstmann-Sträussler- Scheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia;</li>\n<li><strong>Iatrogenic</strong> (iCJD): Maybe seen occurring after corneal transplantation, liver transplantation, use of contaminated <strong>neurosurgical instruments,</strong> use of <strong>cadaver-derived hormones,</strong> or <strong>stereotactic depth electrodes.</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clinically, CJD presents with predominantly CNS manifestations with rapidly progressive <strong>dementia, myoclonus</strong> (startle myoclonus is common), ataxia, <strong>akinetic mutism,</strong> visual disturbances, and pyramidal/extrapyramidal dysfunction. Insomnia, apathy, and other behavioral abnormalities may be seen. </p>\n<p>CSF is predominantly normal but may show a positive assay for <strong>14-3-3</strong> protein. EEG may show periodic <strong>triphasic</strong> or <strong>multiphasic</strong> sharp-wave complexes seen as spikes or <strong>spike-wave patterns.</strong> MRI on FLAIR sequencing and diffusion-weighted imaging will show <strong>increased intensity</strong> in the <strong>basal ganglia</strong> region and a characteristic <strong>'cortical ribboning',</strong> in sporadic CJD. Diagnosis of CJD can be established on brain biopsy either by measuring PrPSc or by demonstrating the characteristic neuropathological features of spongiform encephalopathy.</p>\n<p>Management is mainly supportive as the disease is usually fatal within a year of the onset of symptoms. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Chronic bacterial meningitis</strong> causes features of raised ICP and is associated with a <strong>decreased glucose</strong> count in the CSF. This patient's <strong>startle myoclonus</strong> with a history of a <strong>neurological</strong> procedure makes a diagnosis of Prion disease more likely.</p>\n<p>Option C: Blockage of the shunt system presents with features of <strong>raised ICP</strong> as there is <strong>no outlet</strong> for drainage of <strong>CSF.</strong> This patient's only symptoms are <strong>progressive memory deficits</strong> with a history of VP shunt insertion. This makes a prion disease the likely etiology. </p>\n<p>Option D: Surgical error during the procedure could have presented more acutely and not after 5 years.</p>\n<p> </p>",

It includes any <strong>dementia</strong> which is primarily <strong>caused</strong> <strong>by</strong> a <strong>cerebrovascular disease</strong> or <strong>impaired cerebral blood flow</strong>. Any cause of <strong>ischemic stroke</strong> (like atheroembolism), <strong>intracerebral hemorrhage</strong>, or <strong>subarachnoid hemorrhage</strong> can cause vascular dementia if the underlying injury to the brain is severe enough. Aside from a clinical stroke, cerebral small vessel diseases such as <strong>arteriosclerosis</strong> and <strong>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</strong> can also lead to vascular dementia.</p>\n<p>The patient will likely have a <strong>vascular risk factor</strong> (<strong>hypertension</strong>, <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong>, <strong>dyslipidemia</strong>, tobacco use or <strong>atrial fibrillation</strong>), a history of prior stroke, or transient ischemic attack. There will usually be a <strong>stepwise decline</strong> in the patient's mental state due to a series of unrecognized strokes. <strong>E</strong><strong>xecutive functions</strong> (such as planning and organization) are likely to be <strong>affected</strong> <strong>more</strong> and early in the disease course.

The next step in the management of this patient's altered mental status is with <strong>plasmapheresis.</strong> </p>\n<p>WM is a condition characterized by <strong>monoclonal proliferation</strong> of <strong>Plasma cells</strong> that overproduces <strong>IgM.</strong> These antibodies increase the <strong>viscosity</strong> of the blood.

The <strong>treatment</strong> of <strong>choice</strong> is <strong>plasmapheresis</strong> which helps in removing the excessive <strong>IgM</strong> in the <strong>plasma</strong> thus relieving the <strong>hyperviscosity</strong> symptoms. </p>\n<p>Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia is a plasma cell disorder that results in <strong>increased proliferation</strong> of <strong>memory</strong> <strong>B</strong> cells.

This may be due to extra-renal or renal causes.In the case of extra-renal causes, there is hypovolemia due to fluid loss in conditions such as diarrhoea, vomiting, burns, etc. due to which sodium is lost along with the fluid and hence urine sodium concentration will also be low. However, in case of renal loss, the sodium is lost at the nephron level itself, causing increased urine sodium concentration, as seen in adrenal insufficiency.</li>\n<li><strong>Euvolemic hyponatremia,</strong> there is no volume depletion, but low sodium concentration relative to the total body water, as seen in conditions such as hypothyroidism and SIADH.</li>\n<li><strong>Hypervolemic hyponatremia,</strong> patients are in a condition of fluid overload. In case of fluid overload due to acute or chronic renal failure, urine sodium concentration will be high. <br />In case of fluid overload due to cirrhosis, CCF and nephrotic syndrome, urine sodium concentration will be low.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Management of hyponatremia:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8c82cd1c45114b5dae563bc4637721e1x1280x1248.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
