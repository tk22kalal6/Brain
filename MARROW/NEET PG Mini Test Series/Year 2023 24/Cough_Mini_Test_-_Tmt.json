The major virulence factor is the <strong>Pertussis toxin</strong> which acts by ADP ribosylation of the inhibitory G-protein (Gi) and the <strong>Filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA)</strong> is responsible for facilitating the adhesion of Bordetella pertussis to the respiratory epithelium.  Following an incubation period of about 2 weeks, the disease clinically presents over<strong> 3 phases</strong> :</p>\n<p><strong>Catarrhal</strong> - lasts for 1-2 weeks and consists of cough, coryza, and nasopharyngeal secretions.<br /><strong>Paroxysmal</strong> - lasts for 2-6 weeks and consists of worsening paroxysms of productive whooping cough. It becomes more frequent and is commonly associated with vomiting at the end of the bout. Whooping cough derives its name from the inspiratory whoop at the end of a coughing bout. <br /><strong>Convalescent</strong> - Intensity and frequency of cough decrease over 4 weeks.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds. A specific diagnosis can be made by isolation of the organism from a <strong>nasopharyngeal swab</strong> taken in the first two phases.

      "solution": "<p>Cough impulse is not seen in <strong>primary hydrocele.</strong></p>\n<p>Cough impulse refers to the impulse felt on palpation of a swelling, either as a<strong> thrill</strong>, as seen in (varicocele, lymph varix) or an <strong>expansile impulse</strong> where the swelling increases in size when a patient is asked to cough, which is otherwise not normally felt. Cough impulse is a positive clinical finding in <strong>swellings</strong> that are<strong> in continuity with the abdominal (eg - inguinal hernia), pleural (eg - empyema necessitans), or cranial cavities</strong> and <strong>spinal canal (eg - meningocele)</strong> as coughing increases the pressure in that compartment which is represented by the impulse. </p>\n<p><strong>Hydrocoele</strong> is an <strong>accumulation of fluid</strong> within the<strong> tunica vaginalis</strong>. In the case of a <strong>primary hydrocoele</strong>, as the fluid is collected within a <strong>closed sac</strong>, a <strong>cough impulse is unlikely</strong> to be seen. However, in the case of a <strong>congenital hydrocoele </strong>due to the presence of a <strong>patent processus vaginalis, </strong>a<strong> cough impulse may be positive </strong>as a thrill. Important positive clinical findings in a hydrocoele are that they are<strong> irreducible, </strong> the<strong> testes cannot be palpated separately, </strong>ability to<strong> get above the swelling,</strong> and <strong>transillumination </strong>of the swelling.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Saphena varix </strong>refers to the saccular enlargement of the termination of the long saphenous vein at the <strong>saphenous opening</strong>.
