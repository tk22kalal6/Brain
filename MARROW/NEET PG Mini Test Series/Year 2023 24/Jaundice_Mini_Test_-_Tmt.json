In some patients, this process will lead to the loss of intrahepatic bile ducts, which is called <strong>vanishing bile duct syndrome. </strong></p>\n<p>Vanishing Bile Duct Syndrome (<strong>VBDS</strong>) is used to describe a clinicopathological condition characterized by the presence of <strong>cholestasis</strong>, which is the impairment of bile flow, together with the<strong> disappearance of intrahepatic bile ducts</strong>, also known as <strong>ductopenia</strong>. Various factors, such as immune processes, infections, medications, and ischaemia, have been implicated as potential causes of bile duct degeneration. This degradation might manifest within a relatively short period of a few months or progress gradually over an extended period of several years. In this regard, the medical practitioner has the ability to differentiate between an acute or subacute form that progresses over several months. In this form, the presence of ductular reaction and portal fibrosis is not easily noticeable, and the characteristics of acute cholestasis, rather than chronic cholestasis, are more prominent. This can be observed in cases such as ductopenia occurring in allograft rejection, severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), certain medications, and treated Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Chronic transplant rejection</strong> typically presents itself following a period of several months to years. This process elicits a response from <strong>both </strong>the <strong>cellular</strong> and <strong>humoral</strong> c<strong>omponents of the immune system</strong>(<strong>Type II and type IV </strong>hypersensitivity reactions). The CD4+ T cells exhibit a response to the recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that present peptides derived from the donor, which may include the allogeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The recipient T cells elicit a response and secrete cytokines, resulting in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle, parenchymal atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. It manifests as development of <strong>bronchiolitis obliterans</strong> in the <strong>pulmonary</strong> system, <strong>accelerated atherosclerosis</strong> in the <strong>cardiovascular</strong> system,<strong> graft nephropathy</strong> in the <strong>renal</strong> system, and <strong>vanishing bile duct syndrome</strong> in the <strong>hepatic</strong> system.</p><p>Other options</p>\n<p> Option A: <strong>Primary sclerosing cholangitis</strong> presents with fatigue, pruritus, and steatorrhea similar to PBC.

A diagnosis is usually made once other causes of obstructive jaundice have been ruled out such as common bile duct stones, cystic duct stones, pancreatic strictures, etc. It can be differentiated from <strong>Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis</strong>(Option D) due to the presence of <strong>progressive hyperbilirubinemia</strong> which <strong>begins in infancy</strong> and progresses <strong>gradually to liver failure </strong>and is caused due to<strong> mutations in bile salt excretory protein (BSEP).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis </strong>follows an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> pattern of inheritance. It is distinguished by recurring bouts of cholestatic jaundice that can persist for several weeks or months. It typically manifests<strong> throughout the period of adolescence</strong>. Prodromal symptoms include itching, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Patients have no symptoms during the intervals between bouts. Blood tests commonly indicate the presence of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia accompanied by increased levels of alkaline phosphatase. <strong>Cholangiography</strong> reveals <strong>no evidence of biliary blockage.</strong> The <strong>liver biopsy</strong> reveals the presence of <strong>cholestasis during episodes</strong> while returning to a <strong>normal state between episodes</strong>.<br />The BRIC condition is linked to genetic mutations in two bile acid transporters, namely <strong>ATP8B1</strong> (also known as BRIC1) which encodes <strong>FIC1</strong>, and <strong>ABCB11</strong> (also known as <strong>BRIC2</strong>) which encodes the bile salt export pump (<strong>BSEP</strong>).

On reaching the colon, the unconjugated form is acted upon by <strong>bacterial beta glucuronidases&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;reduced into colorless<strong> urobilinogen</strong>. Almost 90% is excreted through faeces as&nbsp;<strong>stercobilinogen</strong>, and the remaining will undergo <strong>enterohepatic cycling</strong>. A small fraction of this escapes hepatic uptake and will be excreted in the urine as&nbsp;<strong>urobilinogen.</strong></p><p>Normally, urine bilirubin is absent. However, in obstructive jaundice, bilirubin cannot drain to the intestine to be converted into urobilinogen. Thus, fecal urobilinogen becomes absent, which gives the characteristic <strong>steatorrhea</strong>. The presence of urine bilirubin is an indication of post-hepatic obstruction and presents as <strong>cola/dark-colored urine.</strong>&nbsp;Increase bilirubin deposition in the skin, resulting in <strong>yellowish discoloration</strong> and may lead to pruritus.</p>\n<p>Serum bilirubin can be measured using the&nbsp;<strong>van den Bergh reaction</strong>. The bilirubin is exposed to diazotized sulfanilic acid with/without alcohol and total and direct bilirubin levels are measured respectively. Indirect bilirubin levels would be the difference between the two values.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types of Jaundice</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Type of jaundice</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Serum bilirubin</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Urine Urobilinogen</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Urine bilirubin</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pre-hepatic</td>\n<td>&uarr; Indirect</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&uarr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hepatic</td>\n<td>&uarr; Direct and indirect</td>\n<td>&nbsp; Normal/&nbsp;&darr;</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Post-hepatic</td>\n<td>&uarr; Direct</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-</td>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hyperbilirubinemia- Causes</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<strong>Predominantly Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Excess production of bilirubin</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hemolytic anemias</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Biliary tract obstruction</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Resorption of blood from internal hemorrhage (e.g., alimentary tract bleeding, hematomas)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;Biliary tract diseases like primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ineffective erythropoiesis (e.g., pernicious anemia, thalassemia)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Reduced hepatic uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Drug interference with membrane carrier systems</p>\n</td>\n<td>Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Some cases of Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired bilirubin conjugation</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Physiologic jaundice of the newborn (decreased UGT1A1 activity, decreased excretion)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Breast milk jaundice (&beta;-glucuronidases in milk)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Genetic deficiency of UGT1A1 activity (Crigler-Najjar syndrome types I and II)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Diffuse hepatocellular disease (e.g., viral or drug-induced hepatitis, cirrhosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hereditary Hyperbilirubinemias</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disorder</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Inheritance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Defects in bilirubin metabolism</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Clinical course</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fatal in the neonatal period</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Generally mild,</p>\n<p>occasional kernicterus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR (common)</p>\n<p>AD (occasional)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin-Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired biliary excretion of bilirubin glucuronides due to a mutation in canalicular multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous with black pigmentation of liver</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased hepatic uptake and storage</p>\n<p>Decreased biliary excretion</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

The lab reports show <strong>increased unconjugated bilirubin</strong> (normal 0.2-0.8 mg/dL) and normal AST and ALT levels. All this points toward a diagnosis of <strong>Gilbert syndrome</strong>. The dysfunctional enzyme ie <strong>UDP-glucuronyltransferase</strong> is present within the <strong>smooth endoplasmic reticulum</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Gilbert syndrome</strong> is a <strong>benign</strong>, familial disorder characterized by<strong> mild intermittent jaundice </strong>usually seen <strong>during stress, fatigue, or alcohol use</strong>. The condition is recognized to arise from a mutation in the promoter region of the <em>UGT1A1</em> gene, which results in <strong>mildly decreased UDP-glucuronyltransferase production</strong>. This causes a reduction in the liver's ability to conjugate bilirubin, thus causing <strong>unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong>. The <strong>total bilirubin</strong> value is <strong>usually &lt; 3 mg/dL</strong>. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Rough endoplasmic reticulum </strong>helps in <strong>protein synthesis </strong>which encompasses various processes, such as post-translational modifications, folding, and sorting. The process of translation occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), where ribosomes that are connected to the membrane are responsible for synthesizing polypeptides. This synthesis involves the translation of mature mRNA transcripts into amino acids, which are subsequently joined to form polypeptide chains.</p>\n<p>Option B:<strong> Golgi bodies</strong> (or Golgi apparatus) appear as stacks of flattened membranous cisternae surrounded by clusters of vesicles. It is responsible for the additional <strong>processing</strong> and <strong>sorting</strong> of proteins obtained from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in order to facilitate their transportation to their respective destinations, which include lysosomes, the plasma membrane, or secretion. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the synthesis of <strong>glycolipids</strong> and <strong>sphingomyelin</strong> takes place within the Golgi apparatus.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Lysosomes</strong> are organelles contained by a membrane, housing a diverse range of enzymes with the ability to degrade many biological polymers, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Lysosomes serve as the cellular digestive system, responsible for the degradation of extracellular material and the digestion of obsolete intracellular components with the help of <strong>hydrolases. </strong>Mutations in the genes encoding these enzymes lead to<strong> lysosomal storage diseases.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hereditary Hyperbilirubinemias</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disorder</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Inheritance</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Defects in bilirubin metabolism</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Clinical course</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absent UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fatal in the neonatal period</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Generally mild,</p>\n<p>occasional kernicterus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR (common)</p>\n<p>AD (occasional)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased UGT1A1 activity</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin-Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired biliary excretion of bilirubin glucuronides due to a mutation in canalicular multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous with black pigmentation of liver</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>AR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased hepatic uptake and storage</p>\n<p>Decreased biliary excretion</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Innocuous</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hyperbilirubinemia- Causes</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;<strong>Predominantly Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Excess production of bilirubin</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hemolytic anemias</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Biliary tract obstruction</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Resorption of blood from internal hemorrhage (e.g., alimentary tract bleeding, hematomas)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;Biliary tract diseases like primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ineffective erythropoiesis (e.g., pernicious anemia, thalassemia)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dubin Johnson syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Reduced hepatic uptake</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rotor syndrome</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Drug interference with membrane carrier systems</p>\n</td>\n<td>Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Some cases of Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired bilirubin conjugation</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Physiologic jaundice of the newborn (decreased UGT1A1 activity, decreased excretion)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Breast milk jaundice (&beta;-glucuronidases in milk)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Genetic deficiency of UGT1A1 activity (Crigler-Najjar syndrome types I and II)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gilbert syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Diffuse hepatocellular disease (e.g., viral or drug-induced hepatitis, cirrhosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
