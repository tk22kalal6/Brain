Excess protein consumption causes <strong>isovaleryl-CoA</strong> to accumulate, which is then hydrolyzed to <strong>isovalerate</strong> and excreted.</p>\n<p>These intermediates are responsible for clinical symptoms such as <strong>vomiting,</strong> <strong>severe acidosis,</strong> and <strong>sweaty feet </strong>or <strong>rancid cheese</strong> odour. Vomiting that is severe enough may indicate <strong>pyloric stenosis. </strong>Laboratory findings include ketoacidosis, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoglycemia.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis is made by demonstrating significant increases in isovaleric acid metabolites <strong>(isovalerylglycine, 3-hydroxyisovaleric</strong> acid) in body fluids, particularly <strong>urine.

It leads to the accumulation of the metabolite <strong>hawkinsin.</strong> The <strong>swimming pool odour</strong> of the urine is characteristic of this condition.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Type I tyrosinemia</strong> is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme <strong>fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase.</strong> Children present with mild mental retardation, liver failure, and hypoglycemia. <strong>Urine</strong> typically has a <strong>boiled cabbage odour.</strong> Boiled cabbage odour can also be found in cases of <strong>hypermethioninemia.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Inborn Errors of Amino Acid Metabolism and Their Associated Urine Odor</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Inborn Error of Metabolism</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Urine Odor</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Maple syrup urine disease</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Maple syrup</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hawkinsinuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Swimming pool</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cat urine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Isovaleric acidemia</p>\n<p>Glutaric acidemia (type II)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sweaty feet</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hypermethioninemia</p>\n<p>Tyrosinemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Boiled cabbage</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Multiple carboxylase deficiency</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Tomcat urine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Phenylketonuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Mousy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Trimethylaminuria</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Rotting fish</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Oasthouse syndrome</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dried malt/hops</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

An olive-shaped mass is palpable in the right upper quadrant. A test feed shows visible gastric peristalsis.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Hirschsprung's disease</strong> usually presents in the neonatal period with symptoms of delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, and bilious vomiting; later, in adult life, it usually manifests as severe chronic constipation.

Once the vomiting centre has been stimulated, <strong>inspiration</strong> occurs against the <strong>closed glottis.</strong> It prevents<strong> </strong>the flow of vomitus into the <strong>lungs</strong>. The <strong>lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is open</strong> and the <strong>upper esophageal sphincter</strong> (UES) <strong>is closed at this stage.</strong></p>\n<p>The muscles of the abdominal wall contract, building <strong>intra-gastric pressure</strong>. Finally <strong>LES relaxes completely</strong> and <strong>UES also relaxes</strong> allowing the expulsion of the gastric contents.</p>\n<p>Note: The esophageal smooth muscle functions as LES at the gastro-esophageal junction. It normally remains tonically constricted. Receptive relaxation of LES occurs when the peristaltic wave passes down the esophagus.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
