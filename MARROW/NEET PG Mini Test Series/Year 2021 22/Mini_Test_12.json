      "solution": "<p>In the above clinical scenario with a history of myocardial infarction and reduced ejection fraction,&nbsp;<strong>etomidate</strong>&nbsp;is considered the most appropriate induction agent.</p>\n<p><strong>Etomidate</strong> is a rapid onset, intravenous anesthetic agent used for induction in patients with <strong>cardiovascular disease, reactive airway disease</strong>, and <strong>intracranial hypertension</strong>. Etomidate&nbsp;has minimal effect on cardiovascular function due to its lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on the function of the baroreceptors. They act on alpha 2 adrenoreceptors and increase blood pressure which helps to<strong>&nbsp;maintain cardiovascular stability</strong>&nbsp;after the induction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is used as a<strong>&nbsp;short-term sedative</strong>&nbsp;in hemodynamically unstable patients, like those requiring cardioversion or patients with unstable angina, for minor operative procedures.&nbsp;<strong>Long-term use</strong>&nbsp;of etomidate in trauma or terminally ill patients is not advised as there is associated&nbsp;<strong>adrenocortical suppression&nbsp;</strong>leading to reduced blood pressure.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A-&nbsp;<strong>Ketamine</strong>&nbsp;has a&nbsp;stimulatory effect on the sympathetic nervous system&nbsp;and results in increased blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output. This leads to an<strong>&nbsp;increase in myocardial oxygen consumption</strong>&nbsp;and so it is <strong>contraindicated in ischemic heart disease</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C-<strong>&nbsp;Propofol</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>myocardial depressant agent</strong>. It&nbsp;reduces sympathetic activity, leading to vasodilatation that results in a reduction of blood pressure and a decrease in cardiac output.</p>\n<p>Option D-&nbsp;<strong>Thiopentone</strong>&nbsp;is also a&nbsp;<strong>myocardial depressant </strong>agent. It causes peripheral vasodilatation, reduction in ventricular filling, and decreased cardiac contractility.
