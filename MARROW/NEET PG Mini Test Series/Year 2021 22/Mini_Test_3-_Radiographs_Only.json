An equal volume of saline is injected into the other forearm as a control. It is observed for the next 30 minutes and again after 1-2 days. The fluid used for the test is sterilized by <strong>Seitz</strong> <strong>filtration. </strong>A <strong>wheal</strong> response at the injection site occurring within 20 minutes is considered <strong>positive. </strong>It is followed by a secondary reaction 8 hours later.</p>\n<p><strong>Hydatid Cysts</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Dogs</strong> are the <strong>definitive hosts</strong> of Echinococcus granulosus. <strong>Sheep</strong> are the usual <strong>intermediate hosts</strong>, but <strong>humans are accidental intermediate hosts</strong>.
