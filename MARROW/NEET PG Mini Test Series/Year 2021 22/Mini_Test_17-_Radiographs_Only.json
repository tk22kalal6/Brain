      "solution": "<p>The most likely diagnosis in this patient is an <strong>aneurysmal bone cyst.</strong></p>\n<p>The above clinical scenario of an 11-year old boy with pain and swelling and radiograph findings showing lytic lesion of the metaphysis of the upper tibia and biopsy showing blood-filled cystic spaces leads to the diagnosis of an <strong>aneurysmal bone cyst.</strong></p>\n<p>An aneurysmal bone cyst is a benign, expansile lytic lesion of the metaphysis of the long bones that are comprised of blood-filled cystic spaces. It is more common between the age group of <strong>5-20 years</strong> with equal male: female distribution. They occur more commonly in the metaphysis of the long bones like the femur, tibia, and humerus. It may occur on the posterior elements of the spine.</p>\n<p>Patients usually present with pain and swelling. In cases of spinal involvement, neurologic manifestations can be seen due to nerve root impingement and neurological impairment.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis:</p>\n<p>A plain radiograph shows an expansile, lytic lesion in the metaphysis. <strong>MRI</strong> reveals a typical cystic lesion and numerous intralesional septations along with <strong>fluid-fluid levels</strong>. A biopsy would reveal <strong>blood-filled cystic spaces</strong> with fibrous septations which might consist of woven bone.</p>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<p><strong>Curettage</strong> and <strong>bone grafting</strong> are done in most cases. Arterial embolization is preferred in cases where curettage is extremely difficult. Low-dose radiation is also effective but avoided in view of potential malignant transformation.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Osteoclastoma</strong> (giant cell tumor) is a <strong>benign</strong> but <strong>locally aggressive</strong> tumor. It usually affects young adults with a peak incidence in the age group of <strong>20-45 years</strong>.<strong> </strong>A plain radiograph reveals an eccentric, expansile, lobulated lytic lesion in the epiphysis. There is minimal calcification within the tumor. Biopsy reveals <strong>osteoclast-like giant cells</strong> scattered among round or spindle-shaped mononuclear cells. </p>\n<p>Below is the image showing <strong>osteoclastoma:</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4d2d002a6b6e4851ad2e738bc1c59ae5x720x912.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>Osteochondromas</strong> are <strong>benign</strong> bone tumors that present commonly in the <strong>adolescent age</strong> group. Radiograph and MRI would reveal pedunculated <strong>bony protuberance</strong> with a stalk (as shown below) or some lesions with a broad sessile base. Histology shows the cap composed of benign hyaline cartilage covered with a perichondrium, disorganised growth plate and endochondral ossification in the stalk and inner portion of the head. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/946a33a3ec2d4089af2ec6cc367d87cax720x1299.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>Simple bone cyst</strong> is a unilocular cystic bone cavity that is filled with <strong>serous</strong> or <strong>serosanguinous fluid</strong>.

The barium enema given shows multiple outpouchings in the ascending, transverse, and descending colon resembling a <strong>saw-tooth. </strong> </p>\n<p>Diverticulosis refers to the condition where multiple outpouchings occur along the gastrointestinal tract without any inflammation. Colonic diverticulosis is more common among the age group of more than 50 years. Colonic diverticulosis is primarily <strong>false diverticula</strong> as only the mucosa and muscularis mucosa have herniated. Due to the high intraluminal pressure, they are referred to as the pulsion type of diverticula. A low fibre diet results in smaller stool volume that increases intraluminal pressure for propulsion. The higher pressures get directed to the colonic wall resulting in<strong> pulsion diverticula.</strong> The <strong>sigmoid colon</strong> is the <strong>most</strong> <strong>common</strong> location.</p>\n<p>The majority of the patients with diverticulosis are usually <strong>asymptomatic.</strong> However, some patients may present with<strong> abdominal cramps,</strong> <strong>altered bowel habits,</strong> and <strong>painless rectal bleeding</strong>.

Auscultation of the chest may reveal bowel sounds with reduced breath sounds.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis: A chest radiograph and nasogastric tube passage can confirm the diagnosis of CDH. Prenatal diagnosis can be made using ultrasonography between 16 to 24 weeks of gestation.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>\n<p>The immediate step in the management is the naso- or orogastric tube placement for decompression. The airway is to be secured with <strong>endotracheal intubation</strong> (option B) and respiratory distress is stabilised. Bag and mask ventilation may increase the abdominal distension and limit the expansion of the hypoplastic lungs. Hence, <strong>bag and mask ventilation</strong> should be<strong> avoided</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)</strong>&nbsp;(option A) and <strong>high-frequency oscillatory ventilation</strong> (Option D) have been used as a part of the ventilation strategy to support respiratory failure. The main goal is to maintain oxygenation to the lungs and carbon dioxide washout without causing volutrauma.</p>\n<p>Surgical repair of the defect is to be considered at least 48 hours after stabilization and resolution of pulmonary hypertension.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Radiologic features of the major respiratory distress disorders in newborns</h3><p><strong> Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mediastinal shift</li>\n<li>Bowel loops in the left hemithorax</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/26467efcc64f448399d64ee0549179cfx439x599.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Respiratory Distress Syndrome</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low lung volume</li>\n<li>Symmetric ground-glass opacity (reticulogranular pattern)</li>\n<li>Air bronchogram</li>\n<li>White-out lung (severe disease)</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d6a4922ed6bf4e358741affc867a3976x557x235.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>Chest radiograph&nbsp;<strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;on Day 2: shows reticulogranular opacities throughout both lungs with prominent air bronchograms.

      "solution": "<p>The image shows a&nbsp;<strong>coin in the abdomen</strong>&nbsp;that was absent before the surgery. As the patient was nil per os after the surgery, this implies that the coin from the bracelet had fallen inside the abdomen during the surgery and the surgeon completed the surgery without removing it. The surgeon will be held responsible under <strong>res ipsa loquitur.</strong></p>\n<p>Res ipsa loquitur means \"<strong>the thing or fact speaks for itself</strong>.\" It implies that the negligent act is so obvious that the patient need not prove the negligence. The patient has to only state the negligent act. This doctrine applies to both civil and criminal negligence. All of the following conditions should be fulfilled for this doctrine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the absence of negligence, there would not have been any injury usually.</li>\n<li>The doctor had complete control over the injury-producing instrument or treatment.</li>\n<li>The patient was not a part of contributory negligence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Res&nbsp;indicata</strong>&nbsp;is a defense for the doctor against negligence. This specifies that a&nbsp;suit for damages for negligence should be filed against the doctor <strong>within two years</strong> from the date of alleged negligence. A suit&nbsp;filed beyond two years would be dismissed as it would be&nbsp;beyond the<strong> period of limitation.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Contributory negligence</strong> is the absence of ordinary care on the part of the patient or his personal attendant along with the doctor's negligence contributing to the injury without which the injury would not have occurred. It acts as a <strong>partial defense</strong> against negligence for the doctor. In the given scenario, the patient was nil per os, indicating that there was no provision for foreign body consumption and suggesting there is no contributory negligence by the patient.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Medical maloccurrence</strong>&nbsp;occurs when the patient does not respond properly or faces adverse effects in spite of good attention and care by the doctor.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Contributory negligence</h3><p><strong>Contributory negligence</strong> occurs when a <strong>patient</strong> or his <strong>personal attendant</strong> shows unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care, which when combined with the negligence of the doctor, has contributed to the injury. In this case, the patient&rsquo;s or attendant&rsquo;s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.</p>\n<p>So, contributory negligence occurs when <strong>both the doctor and patient are negligent</strong>. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient&rsquo;s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the<strong> patient:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.</li>\n<li>Fails to follow the doctor&rsquo;s instructions</li>\n<li>Refuses to take the treatment</li>\n<li>Leaves the hospital against doctor&rsquo;s advice</li>\n<li>Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contributory negligence is a defence </strong>for doctor&rsquo;s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the <strong>doctrine of comparative negligence</strong>, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>no</strong> <strong>proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is negligent</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<strong>Last clear chance doctrine: </strong>It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>gave proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (<strong>There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

The rectal tube should be left in place for 1-2 days to allow complete decompression and to prevent immediate recurrence of the volvulus. This should be followed by bowel cleansing with cathartics and a <strong>complete colonoscopic examination</strong>. In patients with signs of colonic necrosis or in whom endoscopic detorsion has failed, sigmoid colectomy with the closure of the rectum and end colostomy (<strong>Hartmann procedure</strong>) maybe required. Even if detorsion of the sigmoid is successful,<strong> elective sigmoid resection</strong> is indicated to prevent recurrence.</p>",
