This disease is the result of a <strong>point mutation</strong> in the <strong>beta-globin gene </strong>which results in a<strong> glutamate residue </strong>being <strong>replaced by </strong>a <strong>valine residue. </strong>The patients who are homozygous for this mutation present with the above-mentioned features. Those who are <strong>heterozygous</strong>, are said to have <strong>sickle cell trait.</strong> This trait can provide a degree of <strong>protection against falciparum malaria</strong>. This could be because of increases in oxidant stress which can damage the membranes of cells infected by the organism.</p>\n<p>Sickle cell disease results in hemolytic anemia with <strong>reticulocytosis, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia</strong>, and <strong>irreversible sickled red blood cells.</strong> These sickle cells can <strong>obstruct vessels</strong> and cause classic <strong>pain crises</strong>. These episodes can occur in any part of the body, commonly seen in the abdomen, bones, and chest. Repeated episodes of splenic artery vaso-occlusion can result in a <strong>splenic sequestration crises.</strong> At this stage it becomes necessary to remove the spleen. This leaves the child even more vulnerable to infections. Appropriate post-splenectomy antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccination should be carried out. In patients who have <strong>undergone splenectomy,</strong> the peripheral smear can show <strong>Howell Jolly bodies,</strong> which are <strong>basophilic nuclear remnants</strong> that would <strong>normally</strong> be <strong>removed by</strong> the <strong>spleen</strong>.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis can be <strong>confirmed</strong> by <strong>hemoglobin electrophoresis</strong> and

      "solution": "<p>The <strong>Gp IIb/IIIa receptor</strong> is <strong>absent</strong> in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.</p>\n<p><strong>Glanzmann's thrombasthenia</strong> is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder of platelet aggregation in which the Gp IIb/IIIa receptor is absent.</p>\n<p>During <strong>platelet plug formation</strong>, the initial stimulus is <strong>vessel injury</strong>. The site of injury reveals the <strong>von Willebrand factor,</strong> which then <strong>binds </strong>to the <strong>platelets via </strong>the <strong>Gp Ib receptors.</strong> This step <strong>leads to</strong> the <strong>activation of platelets</strong> with the release of substances that promote further platelet aggregation and inhibit anticoagulation. <strong>Gp IIb/IIIa receptors</strong> are the most abundant receptors on the platelet surface, which also <strong>get activated</strong> and help to bring about <strong>platelet-platelet interaction</strong> by <strong>binding</strong> them <strong>with</strong> a molecule of <strong>fibrinogen</strong> as shown in the diagram below.</p>\n<p>Hence, the absence of Gp IIb/IIIa receptors in <strong>Glanzmann's</strong> thrombasthenia will allow only minimal platelet adhesion to the site of vessel injury but <strong>will not allow the platelet plug to form.</strong> This leads to various bleeding manifestations such as gum bleeding, epistaxis, easy bruisability, etc.</p>\n<p>Laboratory findings include <strong>prolonged bleeding time, normal PT/aPTT, normal platelet count,</strong> and <strong>normal platelet morphology</strong>. Specific <strong>platelet aggregation tests</strong> with collagen, ADP, etc. <strong>will fail</strong> to bring about platelet aggregation, but the <strong>ristocetin cofactor assay will be normal.</strong> This is because the ristocetin cofactor assay tests the integrity of the Gp Ib binding to von Willebrand factor. This will be normal in patients with Glanzmann's. So, this test can be <strong>used to differentiate</strong> it <strong>from Bernaner Soulier syndrome</strong> (absence of Gp Ib).</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> for this disorder depends on the severity of the bleed.<strong> Minor</strong> mucosal bleeds can be managed with <strong>antifibrinolytics</strong> such as ε-aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid. <strong>Desmopressin</strong> is used in <strong>mild bleeds</strong> by releasing von Willebrand factor, factor VIII and by activating platelets further. <strong>Severe bleeds</strong> are usually treated with <strong>platelet transfusions</strong>. Leukodepletion can help to prevent alloimmunization in such patients who may require these transfusions often. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/782ae3af1df243909f30610685a47c0ex1279x1689.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Platelet disorders</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8a852ed6ad094d22b4add695e1529e87x1280x1740.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Finding</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Bernard&ndash;Soulier syndrome</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Glanzmann&rsquo;s thrombasthenia</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>von Willebrand Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Inheritance</td>\n<td>\n<p>Autosomal recessive</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Autosomal recessive</p>\n</td>\n<td>Most common (type 1): Autosomal dominant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Defect</td>\n<td>\n<p>Absence of Gp Ib-IX-V receptor</p>\n</td>\n<td>Absence of&nbsp;Gp IIb/IIIa receptor</td>\n<td>\n<p>Type 1: Partial quantitative deficiency of&nbsp;von Willebrand factor (VWF)</p>\n<p>Type 2: Qualitative defect of VWF</p>\n<p>Type 3: Complete quantitative deficiency of VWF&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Mechanism</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lack of Gp Ib-IX-V prevents platelet <strong>adhesion</strong> to VWF</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Platelets cannot <strong>aggregate</strong> as Gp IIb/IIIa normally binds&nbsp;fibrinogen and forms bridges between platelets&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>There are 2 mechanisms:</p>\n<p>Platelet <strong>adhesion</strong> defect - due to absent vWF that normally binds to GPIB-IX and collagen in the subendothelium</p>\n<p>Factor VIII deficiency as&nbsp;vWF usually prevents its degradation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platelet count&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Normal platelet count/ mild thrombocytopenia&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>Normal (except in type 2B- thrombocytopenia)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platelet morphology</td>\n<td>Large platelets/ megathrombocytes with dense granules</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Normal/ large</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bleeding time</td>\n<td>\n<p>Prolonged</p>\n</td>\n<td>Prolonged</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Prolonged</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platelet aggregation tests (collagen, ADP, thrombin)</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>Abnormal</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Normal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ristocetin aggregation test</td>\n<td>\n<p>Abnormal (platelets does not aggregate)</p>\n<p>Does not normalize&nbsp;after addition of normal serum</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Normal</p>\n<p>(aggregation of platelets)</p>\n</td>\n<td>Abnormal, Normalizes after addition of normal serum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>VWF factor levels</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Decreased</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PT/PTT</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>&nbsp;PT normal, aPTT prolonged</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Summary of Laboratory findings in Hemostatic Disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Platelet count</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Bleeding time</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>PT</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>APTT</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>ITP</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Decreased</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Increased</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Normal</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Nomal</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Auto-Antibodies against IIb-IIIa or Ib-IX</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Glanzmann thrombasthenia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Normal</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Increased</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Normal</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Normal</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Defect in IIb/IIIa</p>\n<p>Autosomal recessive</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Bernard&ndash;

      "solution": "<p>The given X-ray and the history of falls on the outstretched hands suggest the diagnosis of <strong>scaphoid fracture.</strong> <strong>Herbert screw</strong> is commonly used to treat this fracture.</p>\n<p>Herbert screw is a <strong>cannulated variable pitch</strong> screw, which is used to fix <strong>unstable or displaced</strong> fractures of small articular bones such as the scaphoid. This screw helps in quick healing by <strong>providing compression</strong> at the fracture site and early return to normal activities. The advantage of cannulated screws is that we <strong>can use </strong>a<strong> guidewire </strong>under videofluoroscopy to assist in the <strong>accurate placement</strong> of the screw during surgery.</p>\n<p>Scaphoid fractures occur most commonly after a <strong>fall</strong> on an <strong>outstretched hand.</strong> The <strong>waist</strong> of the scaphoid is the <strong>most common site</strong> of fracture. Initial x-rays are done in anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views. Even if the x-rays appear normal, if there is clinical suspicion, a glass holding cast should be applied for 2 weeks followed by repeat imaging.</p>\n<p>Management depends upon the type of fracture. If the scaphoid <strong>tubercle</strong> is fractured, the patient is given a <strong>glass-holding cast</strong> for <strong>4-6 weeks</strong>. In case of <strong>undisplaced waist fractures</strong>, most people will recover with a <strong>cast</strong> in place for <strong>6-8 weeks</strong>. Percutaneous screw fixation with the <strong>Herbert screw</strong> can be offered to those with <strong>displaced or undisplaced</strong> fractures of the waist when the patient does not want to undergo prolonged cast immobilization, or if they wish to return to work/daily activities sooner. Reducing and fixing displaced fractures also <strong>reduces</strong> the <strong>risk </strong>of <strong>non-union</strong>.</p>\n<p>The most common complications include <strong>nonunion,</strong> <strong>avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) </strong>of the <strong>proximal </strong>fracture <strong>segment, </strong>and <strong>osteoarthritis. </strong></p>\n<p>Herbert screw is shown below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f984677a257341a88825c039a7cd068ex1280x1223.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p> </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Cannulated cancellous screws</strong> are commonly used to treat fractures of the <strong>neck of </strong>the <strong>femur.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: The <strong>interference screw </strong>is a biodegradable screw used during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This screw is made of polymers that increase its strength so as to improve cortical bone formation at the site as well as to ensure that the tibial tunnel is not too wide during the insertion of the newly reconstructed ligament.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Pedicle screws</strong> are used in spinal fusion surgery to provide added strength and support. They are placed<strong> </strong>above and below the <strong>vertebrae</strong> that were <strong>fused</strong>. Rods are used to connect the <strong>screws, </strong>which prevent their movement and allow the <strong>bone</strong> to heal.

      "solution": "<p>The seeds of <strong><em>Strychnos nux vomica</em></strong> are shown in the given image. The poison obtained from these seeds is <strong>strychnine.</strong> Strychnine acts at the <strong>ventral horn</strong> by <strong>blocking</strong> the postganglionic <strong>glycine receptor</strong> sites in the <strong>spinal cord </strong>and<strong> brainstem.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Glycine</strong> is an<strong> inhibitory</strong> <strong>neurotransmitter</strong> that acts at the <strong>postsynaptic membranes of ventral horn</strong> motor neurons. Hence, the blockade of these receptors by strychnine results in unopposed muscle contraction, resulting in the classical clinical features. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tonic-clonic seizures</li>\n<li>Opisthotonus (body arched in hyperextension)</li>\n<li>Risus sardonicus</li>\n<li>Other less common postures that can be seen are emprosthotonus (body bent forward as if bowing) and pleurosthotonus (body bent sideward). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Strychnos nux vomica seeds are<strong> toxic</strong> only when <strong>chewed/ crushed</strong> prior to swallowing. Intact seeds, if swallowed, will not result in any further symptoms. Treatment involves an initial <strong>stomach wash </strong>and the <strong>use of activated charcoal</strong> to absorb the ingested poison. The patient should be treated with <strong>benzodiazepines </strong>or <strong>barbiturates to control seizures</strong>, and they should be placed in a <strong>dark room </strong>to avoid <strong>triggering further convulsions.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option (A)- <strong>Blocking peripheral postsynaptic ACh receptors</strong> can be seen in<strong> curare poisoning. </strong>It can cause progressive flaccid paralysis, ultimately leading to respiratory failure. It was used as an arrow poison during wars in the past.</p>\n<p>Option (B)- <strong>Blocking peripheral and central ACh receptors</strong> can be seen in <strong>datura poisoning</strong>. It acts by competitive antagonism. All the parts of the datura plant are poisonous. It shows <strong>predominantly peripheral anticholinergic effects</strong> like flushed face, dry and hot skin, dilated pupils, delirium, urinary retention, etc. with <strong>central</strong> effects like <strong>psychosis</strong> and <strong>delirium</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option (C)- <strong>VAMP</strong> (vesicle-associated membrane protein) <strong>cleavage in GABA</strong> (gamma-aminobutyric acid) <strong>neurons </strong>at the<strong> ventral horn </strong>of the spinal cord<strong>, </strong>is the mechanism of action of toxins in<strong> tetanus infections. </strong>VAMP is normally responsible for the release of GABA, hence VAMP cleavage results in unopposed muscular contractions.

This results in pupillary dilatation of the same side (parasympathetic fibers are present superficially in the nerve). As the herniation progresses, the contralateral midbrain and thus the <strong>contralateral cerebral peduncle gets compressed</strong> against the tentorial edge on that side. This presents as a <strong>UMN palsy </strong>of the<strong> same side</strong> as the uncal herniation with a positive Babinski's sign.

It presents with <strong>painful</strong> genital <strong>ulceration</strong> along with <strong>painful inguinal lymphadenopathy </strong>that may develop into buboes. <strong>Auto-inoculation</strong> by the organism can result in new ulcers merging with the older ones. Hence, they are called \"<strong>kissing ulcers</strong>\".</p>\n<p>The diagnosis is made <strong>clinically</strong> and can be supported by the gram stain findings, \"school of fish\"/\"railroad track\" appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong> is recommended with a <strong>single dose</strong> of <strong>azithromycin</strong> (1g oral) or <strong>ceftriaxone</strong> (250mg intramuscular).</p>\n<p>Chancroid has gained clinical significance because it can <strong>increase </strong>the<strong> risk </strong>of <strong>HIV transmission</strong>.

They are caused by <strong><em>Treponema pallidum</em> </strong>and present with a <strong>single, painless</strong> genital ulcer with<strong> painless</strong> inguinal<strong> lymphadenopathy</strong>. The diagnosis can be confirmed by<strong> specific</strong> <strong>treponemal tests</strong> such as fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (<strong>FTA-ABS</strong>), Treponema pallidum haemagglutination test (<strong>TPHA</strong>), and the enzyme immunoassay (<strong>EIA</strong>). Treatment is with <strong>parental penicillin G</strong>, irrespective of the stage of the disease. Dose and duration depend on the clinical stage and presentation. In the case of penicillin hypersensitivity, regimens based on doxycycline, erythromycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol are used for treatment.</p>\n<p>Darkfield microscopy with spirochetes are shown below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/866c8710896d4b0aaf0b5d4d82b2de97x800x600.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong><br />(C) Donovan bodies</strong> are seen in <strong>granuloma inguinale</strong>, which is caused by <strong><em>Calymmatobacterium granulomatis</em></strong>. It presents with <strong>painless beefy red</strong> ulcers.

The diagnosis is made by Giemsa staining which shows the <strong>Donovan bodies.</strong> They show <strong>bipolar staining (\"safety-pin appearance\"). </strong>Management is with a course of azithromycin.</p>\n<p>The slide below shows Donovan bodies with the safety-pin appearance:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5fe86e3d50984d7fb2bcad097f4ca776x720x473.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong><br />(D) Multinucleated giant cells</strong> are seen on <strong>Tzanck smear</strong> in <strong>herpes genitalis</strong>.

Patients may also develop stridor and croupy cough. It is seen as a <strong>bulge on the posterior pharyngeal wall</strong>, most typically, on one side of the midline, unlike parapharyngeal abscesses. </p>\n<p>Option C: Peritonsillar abscess or quinsy presents with severe pain in the throat, fever (up to 104 °F), chills and rigors, and a <strong>“hot potato voice\"</strong>. On examination, a <strong>bulging of the soft palate</strong> and anterior pillar above the tonsil can be seen. Uvula can be pushed to the opposite side.</p>\n<p>Option D: Lemierre’s syndrome is<strong> thrombophlebitis</strong> of the<strong> internal jugular vein</strong> and devastating anaerobic bacteremia that follows oropharyngeal infection.
