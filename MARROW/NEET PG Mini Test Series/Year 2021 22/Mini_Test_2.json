      "solution": "<p>The graph given above depicts the <strong>Haldane effect.</strong></p>\n<p>The binding of O2 with hemoglobin tends to displace CO2 from the blood. This is known as the Haldane effect. It helps in the transport of CO2 from the tissues to the lungs. The graph shows small portions of two CO2 dissociation curves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the PO2 is 100 mm Hg, which is the case in the <strong>blood capillaries</strong> of the lungs.</li>\n<li>When the PO2 is 40 mm Hg, which is the case in the <strong>tissue capillaries</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the <strong>normal PCO2 </strong>of 45 mm Hg in the tissues represented by <strong>point A, </strong>52 volume percent of CO2 combines with the blood. Upon entering the lungs, the PCO2 falls to 40 mm Hg and the PO2 rises to 100 mm Hg. The<strong> increase in PO2</strong> shifts the CO2 dissociation curve from the top curve to the lower curve, so the <strong>CO2 content falls</strong> to <strong>point B. </strong></p>\n<p>Thus, the Haldane effect approximately doubles the amount of CO2 released from the blood in the lungs and the amount picked up by the tissues.</p>\n<p>(Remember - Ha<strong>L</strong>dane effect occurs in&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>ungs and causes&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>eft shift of O2-Hb dissociation curve)</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;<strong>Bohr effect:</strong> A right shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve in response to an increase in blood CO2 and hydrogen ions, enhances the release of O2 from the blood in the tissues. This enhances the oxygenation of the blood in the lungs.</p>\n<p>Option B:&nbsp;<strong>Henry's Law</strong> in <strong>Respiration: </strong>The amount of oxygen that dissolves into the bloodstream is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen in alveolar air.</p>\n<p>Option D: Boyle's <strong>Law</strong>: The pressure of a fixed mass of <strong>gas</strong> is inversely proportional to its volume if its temperature is kept constant.</p>",
