Benzodiazepines (alprazolam, flunitrazepam) are sedative-hypnotics and symptoms of intoxication include normal vital signs, sedation, diplopia, ataxia, slurred speech, and impaired motor function. Flumazenil acts as a competitive antagonist at the site of BZD action, which is the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor. </p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Physostigmine </strong>is used in the <strong>treatment of anticholinergic toxicity due to atropine</strong>. Atropine is the anticholinergic active principle derived from tropane alkaloids such as Datura stramonium and Atropa belladonna. Toxidrome consists of features such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, agitation, delirium, mydriasis, dry flushed skin, and urinary retention. Physostigmine is a reversible acetylcholine esterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine concentrations in the synaptic cleft to mitigate the effects of atropine toxicity. </p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Atropine</strong> is used in the<strong> treatment of cholinergic toxicity due to organophosphates (DDT, parathion, malathion)</strong>. Symptoms of cholinergic toxicity include bradycardia, respiratory depression, and autonomic symptoms of salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation. Atropine used in association with pralidoxime act as competitive inhibitors at the nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to neutralize the toxicity.</p>",

The RQ becomes<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>0.70</strong>. In severe<strong> untreated diabetes,</strong> carbohydrates are not utilized as they require insulin. Hence, the RQ remains near that of <strong>fat metabolism</strong>, i.e., <strong>0.70</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Proteins-&nbsp;</strong>When <strong>proteins</strong> are oxidized, with every 100 molecules of oxygen utilized, an average of 80 carbon dioxide molecules are released. Therefore, the RQ of proteins is <strong>0.8.</strong>&nbsp;Protein utilization is better estimated by measuring <strong>nitrogen excretion</strong>. The average protein contains about 16% nitrogen. During the metabolism of the protein, most of the nitrogen is excreted as urea, uric acid, creatinine, and other nitrogen products in the urine and around 10% is excreted in the feces. The utilization of proteins mainly occurs during <strong>starvation,</strong> when the carbohydrate and the fat stores have been depleted.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
