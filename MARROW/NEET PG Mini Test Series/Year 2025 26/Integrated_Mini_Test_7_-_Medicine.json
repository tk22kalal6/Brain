Anaesthesia and paresthesia of the extremities, abnormal movements, and gait disturbance are the other features commonly seen. <br><br>Conversion disorder usually resolves spontaneously. Insight-oriented or behavioural therapy is also helpful. Hypnosis and anxiolytics are used in some cases. <br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option B: Catatonia is a condition seen in advanced primary mood or psychotic illnesses. Some conditions that can cause catatonia include head trauma, encephalitis, and hepatic encephalopathy. Some medications such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or antipsychotics can also result in the condition. Some clinical features include grimacing, mutism, echolalia, stupor, and posturing.<br><br>Option C: Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), especially in its ischemic form, usually presents with severe visual loss, marked retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, optic disc oedema, and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), often accompanied by detectable abnormalities on ophthalmic examination. However, this patient has normal visual acuity, normal pupillary reactions, and no detectable abnormalities on ophthalmic or neurological exams, making CRVO an unlikely diagnosis in this case.<br><br>Option D: Eales' disease, common in young Asian males, features recurrent vitreous haemorrhage and retinal neovascularization due to peripheral retinal vein inflammation. It presents with a reddish vitreous mass and can lead to vision loss and complications like retinal detachment.

(Euvolemic hyponatremia). Bartter and Schwartz's criteria can be used to diagnose SIADH.<br><br>Management of SIADH: In an acute symptomatic setting, 3% NaCl infusion is recommended at a rate of 1% per hour to gradually raise serum sodium levels, targeting 130 mEq/L. In addition, aquaretic agents can be used, such as Conivaptan, a combined V1a/V2 antagonist available for IV administration, or Tolvaptan, an oral V2 antagonist suited for short-term use.<br><br>For the management of chronic SIADH, the preferred approach is fluid restriction, limiting total fluid intake to less than the combined urinary and insensible losses. Oral Tolvaptan is an appropriate choice for longer-term management, particularly when fluid restriction alone is insufficient to maintain sodium balance.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Furosemide is a loop diuretic that may exacerbate the hyponatremia of SIADH as it induces solute & water loss.<br><br>Option C. Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic agent that itself causes SIADH and can worsen the seizures<br><br>Option D.

It increases myocardial oxygen demand by increasing contractility, heart rate, and blood pressure in a similar manner as exercise. Dobutamine stress testing is the preferred choice for the assessment of myocardial viability and is generally used as an alternative to vasodilator stress in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, where vasodilators are contraindicated.  <br><br>Cardiac stress testing is performed in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. It is also done for preoperative CVS monitoring in a patient with risk factors for myocardial infarction. Generally, exercise stress testing is preferred because it provides information on functional capacity, exercise tolerance, and symptom provocation. However, some patients undergo pharmacologic stress testing. Indications for pharmacologic stress testing include: <br><br>* Unstable angina<br><br>* Inability to exercise<br><br>* History of uncontrolled heart failure at risk for deterioration<br><br>* Poorly controlled blood pressure<br><br>* History of aortic stenosis<br><br>* Recent myocardial infarction<br><br>* Acute pulmonary embolism<br><br>* Acute pericarditis or myocarditis<br><br>* Severe pulmonary hypertension<br><br>* Chronic pulmonary disease<br><br>Vasodilators are the most commonly used pharmacologic stressors for myocardial perfusion imaging. Vasodilator stress acts by increasing and diverting blood flow to the non-diseased blood vessels so that the diseased vessels can be visualized clearly. It is brought about by drugs such as adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson.<br><br>Adenosine and dipyridamole must be completely avoided in chronic pulmonary disease due to the high risk of inducing bronchospasm in such patients. Regadenson could exacerbate symptoms hence must be used with relative caution. Due to this, dobutamine is the most preferred agent.",

Hypertension in pregnancy is defined as a BP of >140/90 mmHg measured 2 times with at least 6-h interval.<br><br>* Also, diastolic BP is determined by the disappearance of the Korotkoff V sound (normally, in adults, we take the Korotkoff IV for measuring DBP).<br><br>Any chronic hypertensive disorder increases the risk of developing superimposed preeclampsia. This form of preeclampsia often arises sooner, manifests with increased severity, and is more likely to result in restricted fetal growth than uncomplicated preeclampsia. Other complications include abruption, preterm delivery, and increased perinatal mortality, especially in the setting of superimposed preeclampsia.",
