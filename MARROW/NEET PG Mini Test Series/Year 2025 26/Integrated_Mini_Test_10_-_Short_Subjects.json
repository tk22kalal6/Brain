This crucial step addresses the underlying cause of her severe skin reaction, preventing further progression of the condition.<br><br>Stevens-Johnson syndrome(SJS) is a drug-induced condition characterized by widespread epithelial keratinocyte necrosis of both skin and mucous membranes. It is due to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. SJS with extensive involvement of skin (more than 30% of body surface area) is considered TEN.<br><br>The most common drugs involved in SJS/TEN are allopurinol, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, nevirapine, oxicam, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, phenobarbital, phenytoin, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfasalazine. <br><br>Patients usually present 7-10 days after consuming the drug with malaise and fever. It then progresses to a skin rash starting on the face and chest, which then spreads over the rest of the body. There are purpuric macules that can easily be desquamated. Positive Nikolsky's sign may be present (gentle lateral pressure causing sliding of the epidermis).<br><br>SJS/TEN is classified based on the extent of epidermal involvement: <br><br>* SJS: Epidermal detachment of less than 10% BSA with widespread purpuric macules or flat atypical targets<br><br>* SJS/TEN overlap: Epidermal detachment of 10-30% BSA with widespread purpuric macules or flat atypical targets<br><br>* TEN with spots: Epidermal detachment of >30% BSA with widespread purpuric macules or flat atypical targets<br><br>* TEN without spots: Epidermal detachment of >30% BSA with loss of large epidermal sheets without widespread purpuric macules or flat atypical targets<br><br>Septicaemia is a common life-threatening complication. The exposed dermis can act as a substrate for microbial colonization by organisms like S.aureus and P.aeruginosa, which can lead to systemic sepsis and multi-organ failure. Other complications include hypothermia, anaemia, fluid loss, and hypoalbuminemia. <br><br>The first step in management is to identify and stop the offending drug. Those with extensive loss of epidermis should be admitted to the burns unit for skin-directed therapy, fluid replacement, and nutrition. The skin should be carefully handled to avoid further removal of the skin. In addition, local therapy should be provided for the eyes, mouth, and urogenital tract. Patients should be given analgesia and monitored for infection. Immunomodulating drugs like corticosteroids and cyclosporin may be used.<br><br>Pearl PM1948: Erythema multiforme vs. Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis<br><br> <br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> </td>\n<td><strong>Erythema multiforme major</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (Lyell syndrome)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>% Body Surface-area</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>&lt;10%</p>\n</td>\n<td>&lt;10%</td>\n<td><strong>&gt;30%</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Causes</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Herpes simplex</strong>&gt; Mycoplasma infection</td>\n<td>Drug induced e.g. cephalosporins, sulfa drugs, allopurinol</td>\n<td>Drug induced e.g. cephalosporins, sulfa drugs, allopurinol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Associated Symptoms</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Less</strong> fever and other constitutional symptoms</td>\n<td>Fever, malaise and headache</td>\n<td>Fever, malaise and headache</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mucosal Lesions</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Milder</strong> mucosal lesions</td>\n<td>Severe mucosal involvement</td>\n<td>Severe mucosal involvement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Lesions</strong></td>\n<td>Erythematous papules, <strong>Target lesions</strong>, <strong>raised atypical target</strong> lesions, occasional bullous lesions</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vesicles on erythematous base, erosions, <strong>purpuric macules, Flat atypical target lesions</strong></p>\n<p>Nikolsky Sign Positive</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Diffuse, generalized epidermal detachment</p>\n<p><strong>TEN with spots</strong> - with widespread purpuric macules and flat atypical target lesions</p>\n<p><strong>TEN without spots</strong>- loss of large epidermal sheets without purpuric macules or target lesions</p>\n<p> Nikolsky Sign Positive</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Distribution</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Acral</strong> – distal extremities</td>\n<td><strong>Variable</strong> distribution</td>\n<td><strong>Extensive</strong> distribution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Histo-pathology</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Interface dermatitis</strong> – Basal cell vacuolization, apoptotic bodies and inflammatory cells at Dermo-epidermal junction</td>\n<td>Dermo-epidermal separation, Intense inflammatory cell infiltrates in dermis, some areas of epidermal detachment </td>\n<td><strong>Epidermal necrosis</strong>, Dermo-epidermal separation, minimal dermal inflammatory cell infiltrate, large areas of epidermal detachment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Recurrence</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Common</strong>, related to Herpes infections</td>\n<td>Uncommon, drug-related</td>\n<td>Uncommon, drug-related</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mortality</strong></td>\n<td>Rare – recovery in 1 to 4 weeks</td>\n<td>Elevated mortality</td>\n<td><strong>Highest mortality</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br> <br><br>Note: Overlap SJS-TEN: There is detachment of 10–30% body surface area, plus widespread purpuric macules or flat atypical targets.<br><br>Erythema Multiforme is regarded as a self‐limiting cytotoxic dermatitis resulting from cell‐mediated hypersensitivity most commonly to infection or drugs. <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c83d335429494d2eb09a17fd553fe4c2x600x796.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

The pupil is spared because diabetic microangiopathy involves the vasa nervorum. This causes ischemia of the nerve's main trunk ie. the inner fibers, and thus superficial pupillary fibers remain intact. Other microvascular diseases such as hypertension also commonly cause isolated third nerve palsy with reactive pupils. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Neuromyelitis optica is bilateral optic neuritis along with ascending myelitis, resulting in progressive quadriplegia. It is not associated with ocular palsies.<br><br>Option B: When posterior communicating artery aneurysm occurs at its junction with the internal carotid artery, it may lead to isolated third nerve palsy. The pupils are involved to an even greater extent than the extraocular muscles. This aneurysm compresses the blood vessels as well as the superficially located pupillary nerve fibers, thus affecting both functions. Aneurysms of the posterior communicating artery occurring at other locations will usually be assosciated with multiple cranial nerve palsies.<br><br>Option D: Subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur due to the sudden rupture of an aneurysm of the circle of Willis.

Apart from discontinuing the offending drug, current therapy for BVH is vestibular rehabilitation therapy. <br><br>Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is a specialized form of physical therapy designed to alleviate imbalance and dizziness associated with vestibular disorders. It involves a series of exercises that help to retrain the brain and vestibular system to compensate for any damage or dysfunction.<br><br>Other options : <br><br>Option A: Vestibular suppressant medications such as meclizine and promethazine should not be used, as they will increase the imbalance. <br><br>Option C: Vestibular implants hold future potential as a treatment, but are not currently indicated.<br><br>Option D: The patient's condition may gradually improve by observation alone, but vestibular rehabilitation therapy helps improve symptoms.",

It is used in preoperative planning to visualize the relations between intrinsic brain tumours and surrounding neural connections and identify any disease process that affects them.<br><br>White matter fibres include:<br><br>* Association fibres<br><br>* Commissural fibres<br><br>* Projection fibres<br><br>* Subcortical fibres.<br><br>The technique is based on the principle that the diffusion in the brain is directionally dependent (anisotropic), which is more evident in the compacted white matter tracts, and least evident in the grey matter. <br><br>The image below shows diffusion tensor tractography:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0cecf034c2ec46e9a0f54ed17eb76802x671x361.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>AF-Arcuate fasciculus, SLF- Superior longitudinal fasciculus , ILF- Inferior longitudinal fasciculus , UF-Uncinate fasciculus , IFOF-Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus .
