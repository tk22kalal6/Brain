When these deposits affect the glomeruli in the kidneys, it can lead to glomerulonephritis, characterized by proteinuria, hematuria, and decreased renal function.</p>\n<p>The presence of glomerulonephritis typically indicates a more aggressive and systemic form of the disease, requiring more intensive immunosuppressive therapy and closer monitoring. Long-term outcomes are worse in patients with renal involvement compared to those with more limited disease manifestations. Acute mortality directly from cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is uncommon, but the presence of glomerulonephritis is a poor prognostic sign for overall outcome.

High levels of cryoglobulins are associated with more severe disease and systemic involvement. Therefore, low serum cryoglobulin levels are not considered a poor prognostic indicator.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Cutaneous involvement</strong>, such as purpura or skin ulcers, indicates disease activity but is often more limited compared to systemic involvement like glomerulonephritis.

The treatment approach for GPA typically involves two main phases: <strong>induction</strong> of <strong>remission</strong> and <strong>maintenance</strong> therapy.</p>\n<p>During the <strong>induction</strong> phase, the primary goal is to achieve remission and control active disease manifestations. The cornerstone of induction therapy for GPA involves a combination of <strong>glucocorticoids</strong> (steroids) and an <strong>immunosuppressive</strong> agent.

It is given orally or intravenously and helps in controlling the autoimmune response responsible for tissue damage and systemic manifestations.</p>\n<p>Once remission is achieved, the <strong>maintenance</strong> phase aims to prevent disease relapse while minimizing long-term side effects of therapy.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Mepolizumab</strong> is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets <strong>interleukin-5 (IL-5)</strong>, a cytokine involved in the maturation, activation, and survival of eosinophilsm, and can be used in Churg-Strauss syndrome.</p>\n<p>Churg-Strauss syndrome, also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), is characterized by systemic vasculitis and eosinophilia. Mepolizumab has been approved for use in EGPA to reduce the frequency of relapses and control asthma exacerbations in patients with refractory disease. By blocking IL-5, mepolizumab reduces eosinophilic inflammation and helps in managing the disease activity associated with EGPA.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Dupilumab</strong> is a monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit, thereby inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Omalizumab</strong> a monoclonal antibody that binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE) and is used in allergic asthma and chronic urticaria. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Tocilizumab</strong> is an IL-6 receptor antagonist used in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, and cytokine release syndrome.  </p>",
