      "solution": "<p>The given clinical vignette of a 65-year-old man presenting with a 4-cm oval swelling <strong>above the right inguinal ligament</strong> is suggestive of an inguinal hernia. The swelling is <strong>medial</strong> to the <strong>inferior epigastric vessels</strong> which is suggestive of a <strong>direct inguinal hernia</strong>. The most probable underlying cause of a direct inguinal hernia is an <strong>acquired weakness of the abdominal wall</strong>. </p>\n<p>Direct inguinal hernia is common in <strong>elderly</strong> patients through the area of the <strong>Hesselbach’s triangle</strong>. It occurs as a result of acquired weakening and stretching of the abdominal wall. This area of the wall is weak as it consists of only the <strong>transversalis fascia</strong> covered by the <strong>external oblique aponeurosis</strong>. </p>\n<p>The contents of a <strong>direct hernia</strong> protrude <strong>outward, forward</strong>, and <strong>medial</strong> to the <strong>inferior epigastric artery</strong> and the deep inguinal ring (in comparison to the contents of an indirect hernia which protrudes lateral to the inferior epigastric artery). A <strong>Lichtenstein mesh repair</strong> is currently one of the most frequently used methods for <strong>treating an inguinal hernia</strong>. It is an <strong>elective</strong> reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults which consists of an anterior <strong>tension-free mesh repair</strong> that reduces the chances of recurrence of a hernia. A piece of prosthetic nonabsorbable mesh is used to bridge the defect in this repair.</p>\n<p>Other options:<strong><br /></strong>Option A: <strong>Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis</strong> is the underlying cause of an <strong>indirect</strong> inguinal hernia. The sac of an indirect inguinal hernia passes from the internal inguinal ring obliquely towards the external inguinal ring and then reaches the scrotum.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Protrusion of the viscus through the femoral ring</strong> is the underlying cause of a <strong>femoral</strong> hernia that is more commonly seen in elderly females. It presents as a swelling <strong>below the inguinal ligament</strong>, and <strong>lateral to the pubic tubercle</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Protrusion of viscus through the linea alba </strong>is the underlying cause of a <strong>paraumbilical</strong> hernia, located slightly around the umbilicus.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Boundaries of Hesselbach’s triangle</h3><ul>\n<li>Lateral - inferior epigastric artery</li>\n<li>Medial - lateral border of rectus abdominis</li>\n<li>Inferior - inguinal ligament</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/18dc8430e3d0464aa62433640a547105x600x645.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Direct inguinal hernia</strong> emerges through<strong> Hesselbach&rsquo;s triangle</strong> (Hence situated <strong>medial to inferior epigastric artery</strong>)</p>\n<p><strong>Indirect inguinal hernia </strong>enters deep inguinal ring (Hence it is <strong>lateral to inferior epigastric artery)</strong></p>",
