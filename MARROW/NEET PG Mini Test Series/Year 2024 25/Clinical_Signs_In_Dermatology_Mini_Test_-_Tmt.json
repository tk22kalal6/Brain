It presents as <strong>erythematous</strong>, <strong>painful</strong>, indurated, and inflamed skin lesions.</p>\n<p>Facial erythema spreading to the pinna is known as <strong>Milian's</strong> <strong>ear sign</strong>. This sign<strong> </strong>is used to distinguish between erysipelas and cellulitis of the facial region. In erysipelas, this sign is positive since there will be<strong> involvement of the ear</strong> while it is not seen in cellulitis. The pinna region is usually <strong>spared in cellulitis</strong>, as there is <strong>no deeper dermal tissue and subcutaneous fat</strong> in the pinna. Thus the pinna involvement supports the diagnosis of erysipelas rather than cellulitis. It can also be distinguished from cellulitis by its <strong>well-demarcated borders.</strong> (Option A)</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option C: Perichondritis is an infection of the <strong>skin</strong> and <strong>tissues</strong> <strong>around</strong> the <strong>cartilage</strong> of the <strong>pinna</strong>. Common causes include <strong>trauma</strong> due to either iatrogenic (surgical incision) or non-iatrogenic (laceration, hematoma) origin. It can also be due to the extension of infection from diffuse otitis externa or furuncle of the meatus. <strong>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</strong> is an organism commonly implicated. Initially, the pinna is<strong> red, hot, painful, and stiff</strong>. In the later stages, an abscess may form between the cartilage and perichondrium with necrosis of cartilage as the cartilage survives only on the blood supply from its perichondrium. Since there was no history of trauma, perichondritis is not the most probable cause for this given scenario.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/3b90b07449ed4a6c88b092abf4ab4838x720x902.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D: <strong>Parotid abscess</strong> is the suppuration of the parotid space most commonly caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.
