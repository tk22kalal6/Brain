The <strong>target sign</strong> of intestinal intussusception is also known as the <strong>doughnut sign</strong><strong> </strong>or <strong>bull's eye sign</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>The given symptoms of choking and abdominal distention with a failure to pass a nasogastric tube and an X-ray showing NG tube in proximal esophagus and stomach distended with gas suggests the presence of a <strong>tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF).</strong></p>\n<p>A tracheoesophageal fistula is an abnormal fistula communication between the esophagus and trachea. Among the different types, <strong>Type C</strong> is the <strong>most common</strong> type. It consists of <strong>proximal esophageal atresia and distal TEF.</strong> With each breath, the air enters the distal esophagus and the stomach causing gastric distention which presents as abdominal distention. </p>\n<p>Inability to pass a nasogastric (NG) tube is a crucial pointer in the diagnosis of esophageal atresia. </p>\n<p>Tracheoesophageal fistula is associated with <strong>VACTERL</strong> (vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheal, esophageal, renal, and limb) anomalies.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/95bd74f95fb84cd58124c38bb727e041x1280x1964.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Foreign body in the trachea</strong> will present with decreased air entry bilaterally in the lungs and stridor.</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Gastric volvulus</strong> may also be associated with abdominal distension and difficulty in passing the NG tube into the stomach. However, in this case, the tube is seen stuck in the proximal esophagus itself making the diagnosis of TEF more likely.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia</strong> is usually left-sided and presents with respiratory distress.

Dogs are the definitive hosts of E. granulosus. Sheep are the usual intermediate hosts, but humans are accidental intermediate hosts. Humans are end-stage hosts of the parasite since there is <strong>no human-to-human transmission.</strong></p>\n<p>The clinical presentation of a<strong>&nbsp;hydatid cyst</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>largely asymptomatic</strong>&nbsp;until complications occur. The&nbsp;most common presenting symp&shy;toms&nbsp;are&nbsp;<strong>abdominal pain,</strong>&nbsp;dyspepsia, and vomiting. The&nbsp;most frequent sign&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>hepatomegaly.</strong></p>\n<p>Approximately 75% of hydatid cysts are located in the&nbsp;<strong>right lobe of the liver</strong>&nbsp;and are&nbsp;<strong>solitary.</strong></p>\n<p>Computed tomography (<strong>CT</strong>) scan is the<strong>&nbsp;best imaging modality&nbsp;</strong>for hydatid cysts. It shows the presence of a space-occupying lesion with a smooth outline with septa. Diagnosis is suggested by the finding of a multiloculated cyst on ultrasound and is further supported by the finding of a floating membrane within the cysts on a CT scan. Active cysts contain a <strong>large number of smaller daughter cysts</strong> (multi-vesicular rosette-like cystic lesions with daughter cysts) which is characteristic of hydatid cysts of the liver.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0d133913c4884961bd5cb12b64739896x512x382.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>The ultrasound&nbsp;of an <strong>active hydatid cyst</strong>&nbsp;shows multiple septations and a rosette or&nbsp;<strong>honeycomb appearance&nbsp;</strong>(as shown below)</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a71f66d3ecb247ffb66c525f9f4f04ecx720x477.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>The serpent sign</strong> is seen as wavy membranes within the cyst, on&nbsp;<strong>CT imaging.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/59a578902e184691b5cc653d982e9f69x767x600.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>A ball of wool</strong>&nbsp;sign is seen on&nbsp;<strong>ultrasound&nbsp;</strong>when the&nbsp;<strong>contents settle in the dependent portion</strong>&nbsp;of the cyst, as seen below.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/57aca12fd6bb49ee979afe66750bf842x232x282.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>The&nbsp;<strong>water-lily sign</strong>&nbsp;is seen in hydatid infections when there is&nbsp;<strong>detachment of the endocyst membrane</strong>&nbsp;which results in&nbsp;<strong>floating membranes within the pericyst</strong>&nbsp;that mimic the appearance of a water lily, on&nbsp;<strong>USG.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/66b5132aaa314a67b19fb4145f1bb0e0x1280x817.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
