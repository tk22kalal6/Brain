      "solution": "<p>In a patient with <strong>chronic shortness of breath </strong>and<strong> dry cough</strong>,<strong> spirometry</strong> showing a <strong>restrictive defect</strong>&nbsp;points to a diagnosis of<strong> interstitial lung disease</strong>. The given <strong>HRCT</strong> shows prominent <strong>honeycombing</strong> in the <strong>lower</strong> and <strong>posterior</strong> <strong>lung zones</strong>, likely to be <strong>idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)</strong>. The patient will have <strong>bibasilar</strong> <strong>inspiratory</strong> <strong>crackles</strong> on auscultation.</p>\n<p><strong>Interstitial lung diseases</strong> are characterized by <strong>inflammation</strong> and <strong>fibrosis</strong> involving the <strong>lung parenchyma</strong>. Although there are multiple diseases under this subset, the clinical presentation for all of them is the same. The <strong>patients</strong> are usually <strong>over 60 years of age</strong> and present with <strong>progressive exertional dyspnea</strong> and <strong>dry cough</strong>. On examination, <strong>fine</strong> <strong>inspiratory, velcro crackles</strong> may be heard. <strong>Digital</strong> <strong>clubbing</strong> and <strong>cyanosis</strong> are signs of advanced disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Pulmonary function tests (PFT)</strong> will show a <strong>restrictive deficit</strong> and <strong>reduction of TLC, FEV1, </strong>and<strong> FVC</strong>. There is also a <strong>reduction</strong> in <strong>DL<sub>CO</sub></strong> and may be the <strong>first finding</strong> seen<strong> in PFT</strong>. Other laboratory tests should be undertaken if the patient has symptoms involving other systems, to rule out any connective tissue disorder which might have led to ILD.</p>\n<p><strong>IPF </strong>is the <strong>most common interstitial lung disease</strong> occurring due to an <strong>unknown cause</strong>. <strong>HRCT</strong> shows <strong>predominant</strong> <strong>subpleural</strong> and <strong>basal</strong> <strong>involvement</strong>, in the form of <strong>reticulation</strong>, <strong>honeycombing,</strong> and <strong>traction</strong> <strong>bronchiectasis</strong>. This is known as the <strong>usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)</strong> <strong>pattern</strong>. Note that <strong>ground glass opacities</strong> are <strong>absent</strong> in this pattern.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>treatment</strong> of IPF is with <strong>antifibrotic therapy</strong> such as <strong>pirfenidone</strong> and <strong>nintedanib</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Bronchial breath sounds</strong> are heard in patients with consolidation, such as in <strong>pneumonia</strong>. The sound from the airways is conducted to the skin better when the alveoli are consolidated. This leads to bronchial breath sounds.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Barrel-shaped chest</strong> is associated with <strong>emphysema</strong>. This occurs because of the loss of the parenchymal elastic tissue in the lung, leading to hyperinflation.</p>\n<p>Option D: Stony dull note on percussion is seen in <strong>pleural effusion</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: HRCT Findings in Interstitial Lung Diseases</h3><p>Idiopathic interstitial lung diseases</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis / Usual interstitial pneumonia</strong><br />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Honeycombing</strong></li>\n<li>Reticular shadows</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Traction bronchiectasis</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Complete loss of lung architecture</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Absence of other nonspecific findings (ground-glass opacities, nodules, cysts, consolidations)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4689091fe1e944fbb126cdfdbbeab7ddx246x157.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Non-specific interstitial pneumonia</strong>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Extensive <strong>ground-glass opacities</strong></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Sub pleural sparing (specific, but not seen always)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c2cc0129f166436b80cdc78eadefca46x706x644.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)</strong></li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">Patchy consolidation with air bronchogram</li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\"><strong>Reverse halo</strong>/ <strong>Atoll sign</strong>: Ground glass area surrounded by peripheral consolidation (as shown below in red arrows)</li>\n</ul>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/14a2b8cf78af4d09ae90a48b8fcf2a25x598x445.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Thin-walled cysts</strong> (shown below in red arrows)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Centrilobular nodules&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Ground glass opacities</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/df68360574724c508e6cacf09f3feb6ex663x606.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><ul>\n<li>&nbsp;<strong>Respiratory bronchiolitis related interstitial lung disease</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Centrilobular ground-glass nodules</li>\n<li>Bronchial wall thickening</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Acute interstitial pneumonia</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Diffuse patchy ground-glass opacities</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Desquamated interstitial pneumonia</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Patchy ground-glass opacities&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other forms of ILDs</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular thin-walled cysts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/57506149be7c44bfb863865b2ebefaf4x1126x962.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Ground-glass opacification with superimposed septal thickening, known as &ldquo;<strong>crazy paving</strong>&rdquo;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It is characteristic but not diagnostic</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b2c5317c962f4d16b1416ece31e7f352x1279x970.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Bilateral irregular shaped cysts with nodules, predominantly in the upper lobe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/31564146821e4b5faa1b5305d8445724x1280x819.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

Occupational exposures associated with silicosis include <strong>mining</strong>, <strong>stone cutting</strong>, <strong>sandblasting</strong>, <strong>glass</strong> and <strong>cement</strong> <strong>manufacturing</strong>, and quarrying of <strong>granite</strong>. The <strong>pathogenic form</strong> of silica is<strong> crystalline quartz</strong>.&nbsp;Inhaled silica crystals are phagocytosed by macrophages and cause the release of IL-1 and IL-18. This causes the <strong>recruitment</strong> <strong>of</strong> more inflammatory cells and <strong>fibroblasts</strong> to the site, leading to <strong>collagen deposition</strong>.</p>\n<p>Silicosis can present in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acute</strong> <strong>silicosis</strong> occurs due to <strong>exposure to high concentrations</strong> of silica in closed spaces<strong>.</strong> Patients have clinical manifestations <strong>within a few months to years</strong> of exposure.</li>\n<li><strong>Chronic</strong> <strong>silicosis</strong> occurs<strong>&nbsp;</strong>due to <strong>long-term exposure to silica</strong>, often 10 to 30 years</li>\n<li><strong>Progressive massive fibrosis</strong> can occur following both acute and chronic silicosis. The patients present with <strong>more severe cough</strong> and <strong>dyspnea</strong> than simple silicosis, and might develop <strong>respiratory failure </strong>and cor pulmonale.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since <strong>silicosis</strong> leads to macrophage dysfunction, it <strong>increases</strong> the <strong>risk of tuberculosis</strong> in patients. Silica also has immunoadjuvant properties, and might lead to <strong>autoimmune diseases</strong> such as rheumatoid arthritis. Silica exposure is also considered to be a <strong>risk factor for lung cancer</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Calcification of hilar lymph nodes</strong> producing a characteristic <strong>eggshell pattern</strong> is seen in many cases of silicosis. The <strong>fibrotic areas</strong> present in the lung parenchyma can be <strong>identified on </strong>the <strong>HRCT</strong> of the lung. <strong>Acute silicosis</strong> may show <strong>diffuse ground-glass opacities</strong> with thickening of the interlobular septae, which is termed as <strong>crazy pavement appearance</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Some common
