This is known as <strong>immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)</strong>. IRIS is seen in up to <strong>30% of the patients</strong> who are started on ART, and is particularly common in patients with <strong>untreated mycobacterial or fungal infections</strong>, or with <strong>CD4+ T-cell counts &lt;50 cells/&mu;L</strong>.

The<strong> most frequently encountered </strong>causal <strong>organism</strong> is <em><strong>Candida albicans</strong></em> which is acquired from the donor. The prompt <strong>surgical intervention</strong> of a ruptured mycotic aneurysm necessitates an <strong>expeditious graft nephrectomy procedure.</strong></p>\n<p>The<strong> post-renal transplant</strong> can be complicated by the formation of a <strong>hematoma</strong> that has the potential to form within the transplant bed during the initial days following the surgical procedure. This phenomenon frequently occurs as a result of haemorrhaging from<strong> minute disconnected blood vessels</strong> in the renal hilum that were<strong> not discernible</strong> during the surgical procedure. In the present scenario, the patient exhibits hemodynamic stability, hence allowing for the utilization of<strong> CT angiography </strong>as a means of investigation. Following this, a<strong> subsequent re-exploration procedure can be conducted to facilitate the removal of the hematoma.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anastomotic haemorrhage</strong>, albeit infrequent, may also manifest as a potential complication. The observed condition manifests as haemorrhagic shock, characterized by a decrease in haemoglobin levels to<strong> less than 50 g/L</strong>. The current scenario poses a significant risk to the patient's life, necessitating an <strong>urgent return to the operating theatre</strong>.

Infection with the BK virus is almost universal during childhood, with latent infection in the <strong>epithelium of the urinary tract.</strong> Immunosuppression causes lytic BK virus replication with graft involvement in 1–5% of renal transplants. Infection with the polyomavirus BK has been found in association with progressive nephropathy and ureteral obstruction <strong>more commonly 6 months post-transplant</strong>. Detection of BK viral DNA in blood and urine has been useful for diagnosis and monitoring response to therapy. BK virus-associated nephropathy is controlled by cidofovir, IV immunoglobulin. The only effective treatment is to reduce the level of immunosuppression. </p><p><strong><span class=\"TextRun SCXW193804827\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW193804827\">T</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW193804827\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW193804827\">he most common Opportunistic Infections in R</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW193804827\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW193804827\">enal T</span></span>ransplant Recipients:<span class=\"EOP SCXW193804827\"> </span></strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Peritransplant</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(less than 1 month)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Early (1-6 months)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Late (more than 6 months)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wound infection</td>\n<td>Pneumocystis jiroveci</td>\n<td>Aspergillus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Herpes virus</td>\n<td>Cytomegalovirus</td>\n<td>Nocardia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oral candidiasis</td>\n<td>Hepatitis B</td>\n<td>BK Virus (polyoma)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Urinary tract infection</td>\n<td>Listeria</td>\n<td>Herpes Zoster</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

Primary CNS lymphoma is rarer than cerebral toxoplasmosis in HIV infection. Generally, patients with multiple ring-enhancing lesions on the CT scan with mass effect are treated empirically for toxoplasma infection for two weeks with a combination of pyrimethamine and sulphadiazine.

It is characterized by cough, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis. </li>\n<li><strong>Aspergilloma</strong>- They are mass-like fungus balls that are typically composed of Aspergillus fumigatus and are a non-invasive form of pulmonary aspergillosis. They occur in patients with normal immunity but structurally abnormal lungs, with pre-existing cavities. The most common underlying condition is pulmonary tuberculosis.</li>\n<li><strong>Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA</strong>)- It is an eosinophilic pulmonary disorder caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to the colonization of airways by Aspergillus fumigatus. It occurs almost exclusively in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. In chronic cases, repeated episodes of bronchial obstruction, inflammation, and mucoid impaction lead to central bronchiectasis, fibrosis, and respiratory failure. Some patients can also develop chronic cavitary lesions. It is diagnosed serologically, based on the presence of:\n<ul>\n<li>Serum IgE &gt; 1000 IU/ml</li>\n<li>Positive skin prick test in response to A.fumigatus extract</li>\n<li>Detection of Aspergillus-specific antibodies</li>\n<li>Eosinophilia &gt;500 cells/μL.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Diagnosis is established using-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Serological assays- Serum fungal biomarkers such as <strong>galactomannan</strong> and <strong>1,3 Beta D Glucan levels</strong> may be used. 1,3-β-d-glucan (BDG) is a cell wall polysaccharide found in candida, aspergillus, and pneumocystis jiroveci. 1,3 beta D Glucan assay is a chromogenic, quantitative enzyme immunoassay (EIA) designed to detect beta D Glucan by using purified, lysed Limulus polyphemus amebocytes. These cells contain components of the Limulus clotting cascade, including factors C and G, which initiate coagulation in the presence of bacterial liposaccharide and Beta D Glucan, respectively. By eliminating factor C from the lysate, activation of the cascade is limited to BDG alone and can therefore detect the presence of the same. 1,3 Beta D Glucan levels of ≥80 pg/mL are considered positive.</li>\n<li>Imaging- Chest imaging such as CT scan reveals nodules with surrounding ground-glass opacities. This is called the <strong>\"halo sign\".</strong> It may also reveal cavitations with air-fluid levels. This is called the<strong> \"air-crescent sign\"</strong>. </li>\n<li>Fungal staining and culture- Can be done from sputum samples, and bronchoalveolar lavage. They can be cultured on Sabouraud's agar at 25-37°C, the colonies have characteristic features- A.fumigatus shows dark green colonies, A.niger is black, and A .flavus is yellow-green.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Voriconazole is the drug of choice in the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.  </p>\n<p>The characteristic microscopic appearance of Aspergillus fumigatus is shown below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vesicle is conical.</li>\n<li>Phialides are arranged in a single row.</li>\n<li>Conidia arise from the upper third of the vesicle and are hyaline.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b26bbc37ec8f46c4b37d827b50e18a45x720x679.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

SCID is a defect in <strong>both humoral</strong> and <strong>cell-mediated</strong> immune responses. Usually, the defect lies in the T-cell compartment with secondary impairment in humoral immunity.</p>\n<p>Affected infants present with prominent thrush (<strong>oral candidiasis</strong>), extensive diaper rash, and<strong> failure to thrive. </strong>Some patients develop a <strong>morbilliform rash </strong>shortly<strong> after birth</strong> because <strong>maternal T cells</strong> are transferred across the placenta and <strong>attack</strong> the <strong>fetus,</strong> causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).</p>\n<p>Persons with SCID are extremely susceptible to recurrent, <strong>severe infections</strong> by a wide range of pathogens, including: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Candida albicans</em></li>\n<li><em>Pneumocystis jiroveci</em></li>\n<li><em>Pseudomonas</em></li>\n<li>Cytomegalovirus</li>\n<li>Varicella</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are 2 <strong>types of SCID</strong> based on inheritance:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>X-linked </strong>SCID is the most common form and hence it<strong> </strong>is<strong> more common </strong>in<strong> boys </strong>than in girls. The genetic defect is the <strong>mutation </strong>in the<strong> common γ-chain (γc) </strong>subunit of<strong> cytokine </strong>receptors. <strong>T-cell</strong> numbers are greatly <strong>reduced</strong>, and although <strong>B cells</strong> may be <strong>normal</strong> in number, <strong>antibody</strong> synthesis is <strong>impaired</strong> because of the <strong>lack of T-cell</strong> help. The thymus contains lobules of<strong> undifferentiated </strong>epithelial cells resembling fetal thymus.</p>\n<p>2.<strong> Autosomal recessive </strong>is most commonly caused due to<strong> deficiency </strong>of the enzyme<strong> adenosine deaminase </strong>(ADA). The<strong> deficiency</strong> of ADA leads to the <strong>accumulation</strong> of <strong>deoxyadenosine</strong> and its derivatives (e.g., deoxy-ATP). They are <strong>toxic</strong> to rapidly dividing immature lymphocytes, especially those of the <strong>T-cell lineage</strong>. Hence, there may be a greater reduction in the number of T lymphocytes.</p>\n<p>In the two most common forms (γc mutation and ADA deficiency), the <strong>thymus </strong>is <strong>small </strong>and <strong>devoid </strong>of <strong>lymphoid cells. </strong>In SCID caused by <strong>ADA</strong> <strong>deficiency</strong>, remnants of <strong>Hassall’s corpuscles</strong> can be found.</p>\n<p>Note: X-linked SCID is the first human disease in which gene therapy has been successful.</p>\n<p>Other Options:<br />Option A <strong>Chronic granulomatous disease</strong> is due to a<strong> defect in phagocytes oxidase </strong>which is required for the generation of superoxide. Its defect results in recurrent <strong>infections</strong> with <strong>catalase-positive microbes.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B <strong>Transient hypogammaglobulinemia</strong> can be seen in children less than 6 months old and is characterized by a low <strong>IgG</strong> level. This condition resolves after 6 months after birth.</p>\n<p>Option D <strong>Reduced immunoglobulin</strong> titres is the defect in Bruton's agammaglobulinemia.

Thus, most patients present with pneumonia due to<strong> catalase-positive</strong> organisms lik<em>e <strong>Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Serratia marcescens,</strong></em><strong> Nocardia, </strong>and<strong> Aspergillus species.</strong> </p>\n<p>The<strong> catalase test </strong>is demonstrated by placing a microbial colony in hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The catalase enzyme <strong>degrades hydrogen peroxid</strong>e to water and oxygen. The<strong> liberated O</strong><sub><strong>2</strong> </sub>is seen as <strong>gas bubbles</strong> and is a positive test.</p>\n<p>Patients have recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. The symptoms begin within the first two years of life, affecting the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, and lymphatic drainage of these organs.<strong> Nitroblue tetrazolium</strong> is used as a diagnostic test. The <strong>yellow-colored</strong> Nitroblue tetrazolium dye is <strong>converted</strong> to a <strong>purple insoluble</strong> substance (positive) in the presence of oxidative burst by the <strong>free oxygen radicals</strong> so formed.
