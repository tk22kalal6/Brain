The swing phase accounts for <strong>40 percent </strong>of the gait cycle and includes the following events:</p>\n<p>- <strong>Acceleration:</strong> Once the foot leaves the ground, the leg moves forward with the help of hip flexors.<br />- <strong>Mid swing:</strong> The midpoint of the leg’s forward motion.<br />- <strong>Deceleration:</strong> The leg slows down to prepare the foot for the next heel strike.</p>",
