      "solution": "<p>A <strong>narrow confidence interval</strong> corresponds to a <strong>smaller standard error</strong> and not a larger standard error. </p>\n<p>Confidence interval = Mean <strong>± </strong>2 standard error. Therefore, a smaller standard error results in a narrower confidence interval.</p>\n<p>Research is usually done with samples drawn from a population rather than by using the entire population. In order to get a fair idea of the population parameters, sample statistics and estimates of error in the sample are used to get a range of values. This range is the <strong>confidence interval (CI)</strong>. It is estimated based on a desirable confidence level.</p>\n<p>The<strong> confidence interval</strong> is calculated as the <strong>difference </strong>between<strong> upper </strong>and <strong>lower confidence limits. </strong></p>\n<p>The width of the CI is an indication of the utility of our population parameter estimation. Factors affecting the width of the confidence interval include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Desired confidence level: the width of the CI is directly proportional to the confidence level</li>\n<li><strong>Variability</strong> in the sample: the width of the CI is <strong>directly proportional</strong> to the variability in the data </li>\n<li><strong>Sample size:</strong> the width of the CI is <strong>inversely</strong> related to the sample size</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, <strong>increases</strong> in <strong>variability</strong> and <strong>confidence levels </strong>and<strong> decreases in sample size</strong> lead to <strong>wider confidence intervals.</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Standard error</strong> = SD/√ n, where SD is the standard deviation and n is the sample size. The standard error will reduce when the sample size is increased. Thus, the confidence interval will decrease in proportion to the square root of the sample size. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Precision</strong> is the degree to which a particular value (such as an estimate of a population mean) is immune from random variation. A <strong>narrow confidence interval</strong> indicates <strong>more precision,</strong> while a wider confidence interval indicates less precision.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Confidence Limits and Interval</h3><p><strong>Confidence limits</strong> are the upper and lower limits of standard errors within which a parameter value is expected to lie.</p>\n<p>Generally, 95% confidence limits are used and they are approximately equal to the sample mean plus or minus two standard errors, i.e., <strong>95% confidence limits =</strong> <strong>Sample mean</strong> <strong>(</strong><strong>x̄) &plusmn; 2 standard errors.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>general formula </strong>is <strong>confidence limits = x̄ &plusmn; z</strong><strong>&sigma; </strong><strong><sub>x̄</sub></strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where z is 3 for 99.7% Cl</li>\n<li>z is 2 for 95% Cl</li>\n<li>z is 1 for 68% Cl</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>difference </strong>between<strong> upper</strong> and <strong>lower confidence limits </strong>is called the <strong>confidence interval.&nbsp;</strong>Since the standard error will decrease in proportion to the square root of the sample size, the<strong> width </strong>of the<strong> confidence interval </strong>will also <strong>decrease</strong> in <strong>proportion </strong>to the<strong> square root </strong>of the<strong> sample size.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: The Standard Error and Related Aspects</h3><ol>\n<li><strong>Sampling Errors:&nbsp;</strong>They refer to <strong>natural, expected, random variations</strong> in the data. They are not errors per se. Hence, the mean of the sample always differs from the mean of the total population.&nbsp;<strong>For example</strong>, consider a population with a mean weight of 75. If we take a sample of 500 people from this population, the mean weight of this sample will not be exactly 75.</li>\n<li><strong>Random Sampling Distribution of Means</strong> (or Sampling Distribution):\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">This refers to the distribution formed when <strong>all possible sample means from a population</strong> are plotted in a <strong>frequency distribution.</strong></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Sampling distributions provide information into how <strong>different the samples are from each other and from the population mean.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<strong>For example,</strong> the hemoglobin levels of 100 randomly selected women in a city are measured and their sample mean is calculated. This is done every day for a year with the same sample size but different women each time.&nbsp;<strong>If all the sample means</strong> of hemoglobin levels of all women are plotted on frequency distribution, the resulting distribution would be called the <strong>sampling distribution</strong>. It would resemble a <strong>normal distribution.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Central Limit Theorem:&nbsp;</strong>According to this theorem, as the <strong>sample size increases:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The sampling distribution tends towards a <strong>normal distribution</strong> curve (bell curve)\n<ol>\n<li>Regardless of the population's actual distribution shape</li>\n<li>Assuming all samples are identical in size</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>sample mean</strong> and standard deviations become <strong>closer</strong> to the <strong>population mean</strong> and standard deviations&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Standard Error of Mean</strong> (SE or &sigma; x̄ ):\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The standard error is a <strong>measure</strong> of the<strong> extent</strong> to which the <strong>sample means deviate</strong> from the true <strong>population mean</strong>. It is nothing but the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.</li>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">Sample means closer to the population mean lead to a lower SE and a narrower and thinner distribution curve&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">More variation in sample means leads to a higher SE and a broader curve&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n</ul>\nSE = Standard deviation / &radic;Sample size</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &sigma; x̄ = &sigma;/&radic;n</p>\n<p>Hence, <strong>SE</strong> is <strong>inversely related</strong> to <strong>&radic;sample size.&nbsp;</strong></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Among the given options, the <strong>A, B, O blood groups</strong> can be measured on a<strong> nominal</strong> scale.</p>\n<p>Data will always fall into one of the following four scales:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nominal</li>\n<li>Ordinal</li>\n<li>Interval</li>\n<li>Ratio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nominal scale data</strong> can be divided into <strong>qualitative</strong> categories or groups. Examples include <strong>male/female</strong>, black/white, or red/green. No order or ratio from the data is implied. Nominal data that falls exclusively into two groups is known as <strong>dichotomous data</strong>. A, B, O blood groups can be clearly divided into qualitative groups and hence can be measured on a nominal scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Ordinal scale data</strong> holds meaning when it is placed in a <strong>particular order</strong>. An example is the ranking of students in a class. But, there is no information about the interval size. This means that the difference between the marks of the first and second students may or may not be the same as the difference between the second and third. An example is the <strong>Glasgow coma scale </strong>and <strong>Child-Pugh score</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Interval scale data</strong> is similar to ordinal data because it can be placed in a meaningful order. Additionally, they have meaningful <strong>intervals</strong> between the items, usually <strong>measurable quantities</strong>. For example, the difference between 100° and 90° is the same as that between 50° and 40° on the temperature scale. But these scales do not have absolute zeroes, which makes ratios between the items meaningless. </p>\n<p><strong>Ratio scale data</strong> have similar properties to interval scale data. In addition, they have an <strong>absolute zero</strong>. Most biomedical variables can be measured on a ratio scale. Examples are weight in pounds or grams, pulse rate in beats/minute, and blood pressure in millimeters of mercury. A pulse rate of 0 indicates a lack of pulse, and a rate of 120/minute is twice as fast as a rate of 60/minute. This means it is possible to calculate <strong>meaningful ratios</strong>. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Glasgow coma scale can be measured on the <strong>ordinal</strong> scale.</p>\n<p>Option C: Intelligence quotient can be measured on the <strong>interval</strong> scale.</p>\n<p>Option D: Respiratory rate<strong> </strong>can be measured with the <strong>ratio</strong> scale.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Scales of data measurement</h3><p>Data can be <strong>quantitative</strong> (numerical values) or <strong>qualitative</strong> (types, labels).</p>\n<p>Quantitative data can be <strong>discrete variables </strong>or<strong> continuous variables.</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Description</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Example</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Discrete data</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Can take&nbsp;<strong>certain values and none in between</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Number of cancer patients in a hospital.&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Continuous data</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Can <strong>take any value </strong>usually in between limits or a range.&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Most biomedical data is continuous.</p>\n<p>Height, weight, blood pressure, etc.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Data always forms one of four <strong>scales of measurement</strong> &ndash; <strong>nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio</strong> scales (mnemonic: <strong>NOIR):</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Nominal Scale Data</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Ordinal Scale Data</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Interval Scale Data</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Ratio Scale Data</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Example</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Male/female; red/green; sub-urban/rural</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Students ranked 1st/2nd/3rd in their class.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A customer feedback survey using terms like very good, good, poor and very poor or the <strong>Likert Scale.</strong></p>\n<p>Severity of a disease as mild, moderate, severe</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>Measurements on the celsius scale.</td>\n<td>Pulse rate;&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Notes</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Have <strong>no quantitative value</strong>.</p>\n<p>They have no order or ratio.&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Arranged in a <strong>meaningful order.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>No size interval is defined</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Arranged in a <strong>meaningful order </strong>with a<strong> well defined size interval</strong>.</p>\n<p>Example: Temperature in Celsius.
