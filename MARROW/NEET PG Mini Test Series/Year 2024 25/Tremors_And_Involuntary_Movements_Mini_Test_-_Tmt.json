      "solution": "<p>This<strong> </strong>patient's history of tremors that increase on standing with relief on walking as well as <strong>ripples</strong> in the <strong>quadriceps muscles</strong> on standing makes a diagnosis of <strong>orthostatic</strong> tremor likely.</p>\n<p><strong>Orthostatic tremor </strong>is characterized by a tremor that mostly affects the lower extremities, exhibiting high frequency and low amplitude. Frequently, individuals experience symptoms of shakiness or unsteadiness <strong>while assuming an upright position </strong>and<strong> </strong>commonly express relief after transitioning to a seated or ambulatory state. Falls are often observed occurrences.</p>\n<p>The tremor can typically be detected by palpating the lower extremities while assuming an upright posture. Some authors consider this entity as a <strong>variant of essential tremor. </strong>Multiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy<strong> </strong>of<strong> Levodopa, Gabapentin </strong>and<strong> Clonazepam </strong>in the <strong>treatment</strong> of <strong>Orthostatic tremors.</strong></p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Degeneration of substantia nigra is seen in <strong>Parkinson's disease</strong>, also known as paralysis agitans. It shows an accumulation of synucleins. <strong>Bradykinesia</strong>, rigidity, resting tremors, and postural instability are classic features of Parkinson's disease. Lack of tremors in other regions of the body as well as the absence of bradykinesia make this diagnosis unlikely. Also, improvement of symptoms after walking (no postural instability) further helps rule out this diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Postural hypotension</strong> is unlikely as this patient does not complain of dizziness or loss of consciousness immediately after standing and not tremors that appear on standing and disappear during ambulation.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Physiological tremor</strong> is typically detectable through auxiliary testing due to its <strong>minimal amplitude</strong> which is caused due to the <strong>inherent</strong> <strong>frequency</strong> of<strong> muscle stretch responses</strong>. Several metabolic conditions, such as hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, and ethanol withdrawal syndrome, have the potential to exacerbate physiological tremor to the extent that it becomes visibly apparent. This patient's history of tremor and increases on standing which <strong>relieves on walking</strong> is characteristic of orthostatic tremor.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Abnormal movements</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Movement</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Site</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cause</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intentional tremor</td>\n<td>Cerebellum</td>\n<td>Only on activity&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Trauma</li>\n<li>Stroke</li>\n<li>Alcohol</li>\n<li>Drugs</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resting tremor</td>\n<td>\n<p>Substantia nigra</p>\n<p>Red nucleus</p>\n</td>\n<td>Disappear on movement</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Parkinsonism</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hyperkinetic tremor</td>\n<td>Sympathetic overactivity&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Precipitated by emotion , stress</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Anxiety&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Hyperthyroidism&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Asterixis</td>\n<td>Cortex</td>\n<td>Inability to sustain a muscle contraction while performing a complex motor movement</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Hepatic encephalopathy&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chorea</td>\n<td>Caudate nucleus and putamen</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Rapid jerky movement</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Rheumatic chorea</li>\n<li>Huntington chorea</li>\n<li>Drug induced&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hemibalismus</td>\n<td>Subthalamic nucleus</td>\n<td>Unilateral wild flinging violent movement of large proximal joints</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Vascular&gt;degenerative&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Athetosis</td>\n<td>Basal ganglia- Globus Pallidum</td>\n<td>Slow writhing movement involving distal joints</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Vascular&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Degenerative&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Infiltrative</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario is suggestive of<strong> chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy </strong>(CIDP) with this patient's tremor characteristic to that of an entity known as <strong>tremor polyneuropathy.</strong></p>\n<p>Patients with polyneuropathy very commonly develop tremors which very closely simulate coarse essential or ataxic tremors. They are caused due to IgM antibodies developing against the myelin associated glycoprotein and are found among patients with CIDP and paraproteinemias. Unlike other causes of organic tremors, the tremor associated with polyneuropathy sees a reduction following the <strong>loading test</strong>. Also, antibodies <strong>positive for neurofascin-155</strong> are very <strong>closely related </strong>to tremor polyneuropathy associated with <strong>CIDP</strong>, thus making this diagnosis very likely. The tremor is characterised by a low frequency, and high amplitude with both positional and intentional components.</p>\n<p>CIDP is an <strong>autoimmune</strong> condition. It has a <strong>chronic</strong> course with an <strong>onset </strong>of <strong>&gt;9 weeks</strong> when compared with Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) which has an acute onset. However, both CIDP and GBS have similar presenting features.</p>\n<p>The <strong>clinical features</strong> include <strong>symmetric proximal weakness.</strong> If there is involvement of the cranial nerves, <strong>external ophthalmoplegia</strong> may be seen. Some patients may also present with isolated motor or sensory involvement. If sensory involvement is present it can be seen as chronic inflammatory sensory polyradiculopathy (CISP)  or distal acquired demyelinating symmetric (DADS) variants. </p>\n<p><strong>CSF </strong>is usually <strong>acellular</strong> and shows <strong>elevated protein </strong>levels.

Although it can appear in children, its prevalence increases in people aged over 70 years. It is characterized by high-frequency tremors (6–10 Hz), most commonly involving the upper extremities. These tremors are usually symmetrical and bilateral. These tremors manifest when the person is trying to do some activity and are typically made worse by stress and improved by alcohol. Approximately half the patients with ET have a positive family history. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Intentional</strong> tremors are seen in cerebellar diseases and are known to increase during goal-directed activity. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Patterns of Neuropathic Disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Pattern</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Consideration</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Symmetric proximal and distal weakness with sensory loss</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (GBS and CIDP)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Symmetric distal sensory loss with or without distal weakness</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cryptogenic or idiopathic sensory polyneuropathy (CSPN)</p>\n<p>Diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders</p>\n<p>Drugs, toxins, familial (HSAN)</p>\n<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease</p>\n<p>Amyloidosis, and others</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Symmetric sensory loss and distal areflexia with upper motor neuron findings</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vitamin B12, vitamin E, and copper deficiency with combined system degeneration with peripheral neuropathy, hereditary leukodystrophies (e.g., adrenomyeloneuropathy)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Asymmetric proprioceptive sensory loss without weakness</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Causes of a sensory neuronopathy &nbsp;(ganglionopathy):</p>\n<p>Cancer (paraneoplastic)</p>\n<p>Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome</p>\n<p>Idiopathic sensory neuronopathy (possible GBS variant)</p>\n<p>Cisplatin and other chemotherapeutic agents</p>\n<p>Vitamin B6 toxicity</p>\n<p>HIV-related sensory neuronopathy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">\n<p>Asymmetric distal weakness with sensory loss</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>With involvement of multiple nerves:</strong></p>\n<p>Multifocal CIDP</p>\n<p>Vasculitis</p>\n<p>Cryoglobulinemia</p>\n<p>Amyloidosis, sarcoid</p>\n<p>Infectious (leprosy, Lyme, hepatitis B, C, or E, HIV, CMV), HNPP, tumor infiltration</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>With involvement of single nerves/regions:</strong></p>\n<p>May be any of the above but also could be compressive mononeuropathy, plexopathy, or radiculopathy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Asymmetric proximal and distal weakness with sensory loss</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Polyradiculopathy or plexopathy due to diabetes mellitus</p>\n<p>Meningeal carcinomatosis or lymphomatosis</p>\n<p>Hereditary plexopathy (HNPP, HNA), idiopathic</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Sensory Loss In peripheral Neuropathies</h3><p>Symmetrical Sensory Loss</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cryptogenic or idiopathic sensory polyneuropathy (CSPN)</li>\n<li>Diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders</li>\n<li>Drugs and toxins</li>\n<li>Familial (HSAN), CMT, amyloidosis</li>\n<li>Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (GBS and CIDP)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asymmetrical Sensory Loss</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cancer (paraneoplastic)</li>\n<li>Sjögren&rsquo;s syndrome</li>\n<li>Idiopathic sensory neuronopathy (possible GBS variant)</li>\n<li>Cisplatin and other chemotherapeutic agents</li>\n<li>Vitamin B6 toxicity</li>\n<li>Multifocal CIDP, vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia, amyloidosis, sarcoid, infectious (leprosy, Lyme, hepatitis B, C, or E, HIV, CMV), tumor infiltration&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Compressive mononeuropathy, plexopathy, or radiculopathy</li>\n<li>Polyradiculopathy or plexopathy due to diabetes mellitus</li>\n<li>Cryptogenic or idiopathic sensory polyneuropathy (CSPN)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

When a patient diagnosed with <strong>dystonia</strong> experiences a <strong>tremor</strong> in a body region that is <strong>not</strong> <strong>affected</strong> <strong>by</strong> <strong>dystonia</strong>, it is referred to as a \"tremor associated with dystonia\" (<strong>TAWD</strong>). On certain occasions, patients can experience delirium tremens (DT) in addition to withdrawal from alcohol dependence (TAWD). Although dystonia can manifest in various body parts, it is commonly observed in individuals with cervical dystonia, often presenting as head tremors.</p>\n<p>Dystonia (DT) can be <strong>mitigated</strong> or <strong>eradicated</strong> through the performance of a manoeuvre, also known as \"<strong>sensory</strong> <strong>trick</strong>\" or \"geste antagoniste.\" Additionally, when the affected body part is positioned in the direction of dystonia and the movement, tremor, or abnormal posture ceases, this is commonly referred to as the \"<strong>null point</strong>.\" On the other hand, the intensity of dystonic tremor (DT) <strong>escalates</strong> when the <strong>affected</strong> <strong>body</strong> part is <strong>deliberately</strong> <strong>positioned</strong> in opposition to the <strong>primary</strong> <strong>direction</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>dystonia</strong>-<strong>induced</strong> <strong>contraction</strong>. For instance, a patient experiencing right torticollis may experience an exacerbation of DT when rotating the head towards the left or attempting to sustain the primary posture of the head.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Intentional tremors</strong> are seen in<strong> cerebellar diseases </strong>and are known to <strong>increase</strong> during <strong>goal</strong>-<strong>directed</strong> <strong>activity</strong>.

Moreover, it was observed that individuals diagnosed with functional tremors exhibited a higher degree of distractibility during tasks involving alternate finger tapping and mental attention. Additionally, they displayed increased amplitude when exposed to a tuning fork, and experienced a worsening of symptoms when engaging in hyperventilation. These tremors are<strong> not known</strong> to be <strong>associated</strong> with <strong>concomitant dystonia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Physiological tremor</strong> is typically detectable through auxiliary testing due to its minimal amplitude which is caused due to the inherent frequency of muscle stretch responses.
