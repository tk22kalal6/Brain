The daily need for phosphorus supplementation is 1–3 g of elemental phosphorus divided into 4–5 doses. Frequent dosing helps prevent prolonged decrements in serum phosphorus levels because there is a rapid decline after each dose. In addition, frequent dosing decreases diarrhea, which is a complication of high-dose oral phosphorus. Calcitriol is administered 30–70 ng/kg/day divided into 2 doses. </p>\n<p>Further, <strong>Joulie's solution </strong>is also useful in the <strong>treatment</strong> of familial hypophosphatemic rickets. Joulie's solution includes contains<strong> 30.4 mg of phosphate/mL</strong>. The most common side effect is diarrhea. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p><strong>Option A </strong>is seen in <strong>proximal renal tubular acidosis (Type 2 RTA)</strong>. Serum phosphate is low due to phosphate wasting, serum calcium is usually normal, serum PTH is elevated due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, and urine pH is initially acidic but may become less acidic as bicarbonate loss worsens, resulting in metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B</strong> can be seen in <strong>rickets associated with chronic renal failure.</strong> Serum phosphate levels are typically elevated due to impaired renal excretion. Serum calcium levels may be low or normal because the kidneys are unable to produce sufficient active vitamin D, leading to impaired calcium absorption and phosphate retention. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are elevated due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which occurs as a compensatory response to low calcium and high phosphate and pH levels in the blood may be normal or low, reflecting the presence of metabolic acidosis often associated with reduced kidney function.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C </strong>shows the set of reports in the case of <strong>nutritional rickets</strong>. It commonly occurs due to the deficiency of vitamin D, thereby affecting the metabolism of calcium and phosphate ions in the body. In vitamin D deficiency, low calcium levels may be seen in the blood. To raise serum calcium levels, the secretion of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) rises. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7ff4e4536b9a45368e5a72050a744e4fx1280x1326.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Vitamin D activation and Rickets</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/fc2bbad956284f25ac60ba74c376ac0ex780x802.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Radiological Features of Rickets</h3><p>Radiological features of rickets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Loss of provisional zone of calcification: </strong>earliest radiological finding of rickets. </li>\n<li>Delayed appearance of the epiphysis</li>\n<li><strong>Widening of growth plate: </strong>normal width of growth plate is 2-4mm.

The serum potassium is low (<strong>hypokalemia</strong>), suggestive of <strong>either type I or type II renal tubular acidosis.</strong> Type III RTA is rare and is seen mostly in children, while type IV RTA is associated with hyperkalemia.</p>\n<p>The urine pH is initially 5.1 (&lt;5.5, acidic), which increased to 5.8 (&gt;5.5) following administration of sodium bicarbonate (alkali therapy), suggestive of <strong>poor bicarbonate reabsorption</strong> in the proximal tubules of the kidney, making the diagnosis of <strong>type II (proximal) renal tubular acidosis.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Type II RTA&nbsp;</strong>is commonly caused due to generalized proximal tubular dysfunction, associated with&nbsp;<strong>Fanconi syndrome (glycosuria, aminoaciduria,</strong> and <strong>phosphaturia).</strong> The bicarbonate is poorly reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule, leading to its increased excretion <strong>(bicarbonaturia).</strong> This leads to decreased plasma bicarbonate levels and metabolic acidosis.</p>\n<p>As the plasma bicarbonate levels fall below the renal threshold for reabsorption of the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>in patients with type II RTA, all the bicarbonate is reabsorbed thus maintaining the urinary pH acidic (&lt;5.5). When sodium bicarbonate is administered intravenously, it increases the plasma bicarbonate levels above the limited renal threshold, leading to increased excretion of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-&nbsp;</sup>causing increased urinary pH (&gt; 5.5).</p>\n<p><strong>Alkali therapy</strong>&nbsp;for correcting plasma bicarbonate in type II RTA should be carried out with caution, as sudden increased availability of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>to the distal tubules stimulates the secretion of potassium, further exaggerating the <strong>hypokalemia</strong>. Hence, potassium salts are usually administered along with alkali therapy. An oral solution of a combination of<strong> sodium and potassium citrate</strong> is commonly prescribed alkali therapy for this reason.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Interpretation of Acid-Base Disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>pH&lt;7.35 is acidosis</p>\n<p>pH&gt;7.45 is alkalosis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A primary change in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is termed metabolic</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>If the change in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>&nbsp;is in keeping with the pH (i.e. if there are acidosis and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>&nbsp;is decreased) the problem is metabolic.</p>\n<p>If the change in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>&nbsp;is opposite with the pH (i.e. if there is acidosis and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>&nbsp;is increased or normal) the problem is compensatory metabolic.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A primary change in CO<sub>2 </sub>is termed as respiratory</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>If the change in CO<sub>2 </sub>keeping in line with the pH (if in acidosis CO2 is raised) the problem is termed respiratory</p>\n<p>If the change in CO<sub>2</sub> is in the opposite direction of that of the pH (i.e. if there&nbsp;are acidosis and CO<sub>2</sub> is decreased or normal ) the problem is termed compensatory respiratory</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of Metabolic Acidosis</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>High Anion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis (MUDPILES)</td>\n<td>Normal Anion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis (FUSED CAR)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>M</strong>ethanol</td>\n<td><strong>F</strong>istula pancreatic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>U</strong>remia (Renal failure - Acute or Chronic)</td>\n<td><strong>U</strong>reterosigmoidostomy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>D</strong>iabetic ketoacidosis</td>\n<td><strong>S</strong>mall bowel fistula</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>P</strong>araldehyde</td>\n<td><strong>E</strong>xtra chloride (Hyperalimentation)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>I</strong>ron tablets, INH</td>\n<td><strong>D</strong>iarrhea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>L</strong>actic acidosis</td>\n<td><strong>C</strong>arbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>E</strong>thylene glycol</td>\n<td><strong>A</strong>ddison's disease</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>S</strong>alicylates</td>\n<td><strong>R</strong>enal tubular acidosis</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Characteristics of renal tubular acidosis (RTA)</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Hypokalemic RTA&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Hyperkalemic RTA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Type 1 RTA</p>\n</td>\n<td>Type 2 RTA&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Type 4 RTA</p>\n<p>Most Common</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Primary</p>\n<p>defect</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Impaired distal acidification</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Reduced proximal</p>\n<p>HCO<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;resorption</p>\n</td>\n<td>Decreased aldosterone secretion or aldosterone resistance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Plasma HCO3</p>\n<p>(mEq/L)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;<span class=\"symbol\">&lt;</span>15</td>\n<td>12 to 20</td>\n<td>&gt;17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plasma potassium</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp; Low</p>\n<p>(normalizes with alkalinization)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;Low</p>\n<p>(Decreased further by alkalinization)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>High</strong></p>\n<p>(correcting the hyperkalemia alone will improve the acidosis by increasing ammonium availability)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Urine pH</td>\n<td>&gt;5.5</td>\n<td>\n<p>&gt; 5.3 if the serum HCO<sub>3&nbsp;</sub>exceeds the tubule's&nbsp;HCO<sub>3&nbsp;</sub></p>\n<p>reabsorptive threshold.</p>\n<p><strong>&lt; 5.3</strong> when the serum HCO<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;is reduced to levels that can be largely reabsorbed despite defective proximal tubule reabsorptive mechanisms.</p>\n</td>\n<td>&lt;5.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Urine</p>\n<p>anion gap</p>\n</td>\n<td>Positive</td>\n<td>Negative</td>\n<td>Positive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Nephrolithiasis/ Nephrocalcinosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Yes</td>\n<td>&nbsp;No</td>\n<td>&nbsp;No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This prevents the reabsorption of amino acids like <strong>cystine</strong>, ornithine, lysine, and arginine. The only known complication of this disease is the <strong>formation of calculi</strong>, because of the low solubility of cystine in the urine. Cystine is more likely to precipitate in acidic urine.</p>\n<p>Prevention of stone formation in patients with cystinuria can be done by <strong>increasing fluid intake</strong> and <strong>alkalinization of the urine</strong> with sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate. Chelating agents such as <strong>penicillamine</strong> have also been found to be useful. <strong>Tiopronin</strong> is currently the best choice drug for cystine reduction, but side effects like nephrotic syndrome may limit its long-term use. A <strong>diet low in methionine</strong> may theoretically reduce the excretion of cystine in the urine by directly reducing its formation.</p><p class=\"p1\">Other options-</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option (A):<strong> Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy </strong>(ESWL) is a non-invasive method that generates shockwaves outside the body, which are focused on the stones. It is the most common method of treating urinary tract stones. Stones <strong>up to</strong> approximately <strong>1.5 cm</strong> in size <strong>are suitable</strong> for this form of treatment. <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Cystine stones which are are <strong>often multiple</strong>, <strong>and very hard</strong> are relatively <strong>resistant</strong> <strong>to ESWL</strong> due to their hardness.</span></p><p> Option (C):<strong> Open surgery- </strong>A <strong>longstanding obstructing calculus </strong>can result in <strong>chronic inflammatory</strong> change in the kidney. Open surgeries are generally indicated for xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). Generally, in such cases, a <strong>subcapsular nephrectomy</strong> is performed. In extremely rare cases where both PCNL and ESWL are contraindicated, one might resort to open/laparoscopic surgery. </p>\n<p>Option (D):<strong> Ureteroscopic removal- </strong>Semi-rigid ureteroscopes are frequently used to directly visualize ureteric calculi. Advances in the design of ureterorenoscopy have made it easier to access these stones by endoscopic examination.  Stones can also be fragmented using mechanical disintegration using the lithoclast.
