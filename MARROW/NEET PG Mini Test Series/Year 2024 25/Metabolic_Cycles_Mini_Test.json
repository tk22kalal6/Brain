Both lead to impaired phenylalanine-to-tyrosine conversion.<br><br>Classical PKU has elevated levels of phenylalanine metabolites and decreased levels of tyrosine, which gives rise to typical clinical features (Intellectual disability, light skin color, blue eyes).<br><br>Non-classical PKU, caused by dihydro pteridine reductase deficiency, results in normal phenylalanine levels but decreased catecholamines and 5-hydroxytryptophan due to impaired tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis.<br><br>Pearl PM2196: Amino Acid Derivatives<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7b53b3afcc1c47e792f684ad0097deeex1280x1310.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "The false statements regarding glycogen metabolism are 1 and 4.<br><br>Acetyl coenzyme A is a common product of carbohydrate, protein, or fat catabolism. Statement 1 is false because it cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose (or glycogen) because of the irreversible nature of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA. It can only be used to produce ketone bodies.<br><br>Glycogen is a storage form of glucose and a number of enzymes and substrates tightly regulate its synthesis. Statement 4 is false because the increase in insulin and glucose-6-phosphate following a meal activates glycogen synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogenesis by dephosphorylation. Thus, high insulin:glucagon ratio increases glycogenesis.<br><br>An increase in glucagon or epinephrine causes the phosphorylation of enzymes, making glycogen synthase inactive. Glycogen breakdown occurs by glycogen phosphorylase which is activated by phosphorylation. Glycogen synthase and phosphorylase are reciprocally regulated.<br><br>Statement 2 is true. Active phosphorylase A, which phosphorylates and activates the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme, is allosterically inhibited by ATP and glucose-6-phosphate. Thus, glucose-6-phosphate leads to the inhibition of glycogenolysis.<br><br>Statement 3 is true. Impaired breakdown or synthesis of glycogen leads to a variety of disorders. Pompe's disease (type 2 glycogen storage disease) occurs due to α-1,4-glucosidase (acid maltase) deficiency. It is the only glycogen storage disease that is a lysosomal storage disease and causes lysosomal glycogen accumulation in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells. The clinical symptoms of Pompe disease are hypotonia (floppy infant), skeletal muscle weakness, hepatomegaly, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and macroglossia.<br><br>Pearl PM0964: Glycogen Storage Diseases<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/782e85c36f0648698a222dca988adfabx1280x1863.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Enzyme deficiency</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type 0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glycogen synthase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Early death</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type Ia</p>\n<p><strong>Von Gierke's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glucose-6- phosphatase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hepatomegaly and renomegaly due to glycogen accumulation</p>\n<p>Severe fasting hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Growth failure</p>\n<p>Lactic acidosis</p>\n<p>Hyperuricemia</p>\n<p>Hyperlipidemia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type Ib</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Endoplasmic reticulum glucose-6- phosphate transporter</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Same as Von Gierke's disease</p>\n<p>Recurrent infections due to impaired neutrophil function</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type II</p>\n<p><strong>Pompe's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lysosomal α1,4:1,6 glucosidase</p>\n<p>(Acid maltase)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle weakness</p>\n<p>Death by age ~ 2 years (infantile variant)</p>\n<p>Cardiomegaly and heart failure</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type III</p>\n<p><strong>Cori's/Forbes disease</strong></p>\n<p>(Limit dextrinosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glycogen debranching enzyme</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle weakness</p>\n<p>Fasting hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Hepatomegaly due to accumulation of branched-chain polysaccharide (limit dextrins)</p>\n<p>Growth retardation</p>\n<p>Normal lactate and uric acid levels</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type IV</p>\n<p><strong>Andersen disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Glycogen branching enzyme</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Failure to thrive</p>\n<p>Hepatomegaly due to accumulation of polysaccharides with few branch points</p>\n<p>Death at age ~ 5 years</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type V</p>\n<p><strong>McArdle disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle glycogen phosphorylase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exercise-induced cramps</p>\n<p>Renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria</p>\n<p>Second wind phenomenon</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type VI</p>\n<p><strong>Her's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Liver glycogen phosphorylase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Generally benign</p>\n<p>Mild hypoglycemia</p>\n<p>Hepatomegaly</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>GSD type VII</p>\n<p><strong>Tarui's disease</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Muscle phosphofructokinase</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Exercise-induced muscle cramps and weakness</p>\n<p>Growth retardation</p>\n<p>Hemolytic anemia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Pearl PM2312: Enzymes active in phosphorylated and dephosphorylated state<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Phosphorylated state</strong></p>\n<p>(Low insulin)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Dephosphorylated state</strong></p>\n<p>(High insulin)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Fructose 2,6 bisphosphatase</li>\n<li>PEP carboxykinase</li>\n<li>Pyruvate carboxylase</li>\n<li>Glycogen phosphorylase</li>\n<li>Hormone-sensitive lipase</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Phosphofructokinase</li>\n<li>Pyruvate dehydrogenase</li>\n<li>Glycogen synthase</li>\n<li>Acetyl CoA carboxylase</li>\n<li>HMG CoA reductase</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
