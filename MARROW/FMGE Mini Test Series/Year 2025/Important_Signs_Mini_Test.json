      "solution": "<p>In patient <strong>A</strong>, the hand's attitude while attempting to make a fist is called the<strong> Benediction hand sign</strong> and is seen in <strong>proximal median nerve injury</strong>. In patient <strong>B</strong>, a similar attitude seen at rest or while extending the fingers is called the<strong> partial claw hand</strong> and is seen in <strong>distal ulnar nerve injury. </strong></p>\n<p>The 2 main muscles that are paralyzed in ulnar and median nerve injuries leading to characteristic hand deformities are the<strong> lumbricals </strong>and the <strong>flexor digitorum profundus</strong>. <strong>Distal</strong> <strong>nerve lesions </strong>affect only the<strong> lumbricals</strong> while <strong>proximal nerve injuries</strong> affect<strong> both muscles</strong>. This forms the basis of the different deformities of the hand seen.</p>\n<p>The lumbricals are small muscles of the hand and are<strong> 4</strong> in number. The function of the lumbricals is to<strong> flex metacarpophalangeal joints </strong>and<strong> extend</strong> the<strong> interphalangeal joints</strong> of <strong>2nd–5th </strong>digits. The <strong>first</strong> and <strong>second lumbrical</strong> (lateral 2) are supplied by the <strong>median nerve</strong> while the<strong> third</strong> and<strong> fourth lumbrical</strong> (medial 2) are supplied by the <strong>deep branch</strong> of the <strong>ulnar nerve.</strong></p>\n<p>In the forearm, the <strong>flexor digitorum profundus</strong> is a flexor of the distal phalanges after the <strong>flexor digitorum superficialis</strong> has flexed the middle phalanges. It secondarily flexes the other joints of the fingers and the wrist. The <strong>medial half</strong> of this muscle is supplied by the<strong> ulnar nerve </strong>while the<strong> lateral half</strong> is supplied by the <strong>anterior interosseous nerve </strong>(branch of median nerve).</p>\n<p><strong>Ulnar nerve injuries:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Distal injury</strong>: Thus an injury to the <strong>distal ulnar nerve </strong>affects the<strong> 3rd and 4th lumbricals</strong> sparing the flexor digitorum profundus. This causes <strong>hyperextensio</strong>n at the <strong>metacarpophalangeal joints</strong> and<strong> flexion</strong> at the <strong>interphalangeal joints</strong>, involving the ring and little fingers. This attitude of the hand known as the<strong> ulnar claw hand </strong>may be seen at rest and is more pronounced on attempting to extend the fingers as seen in <strong>patient B</strong>.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c1d8773435744cefb28b49533fe26abax720x540.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Proximal injury:</strong> Since the opposing flexor digitorum profundus of the<strong> 4th</strong> and <strong>5th digit</strong> that causes the clawing is also affected, the clawing of the hand is<strong> less pronounced</strong> in distal injuries of the ulnar nerve.

Thus, on attempting to make a fist, the flexion of the <strong>4th</strong> and<strong> 5th digits</strong> is<strong> affected </strong>while the 2nd and 3rd digits are normal.</p>\n<p>In both cases of <strong>ulnar nerve palsy</strong>, the <strong>sensory loss</strong> is confined to the<strong> medial one-third</strong> of the<strong> palm</strong> and the <strong>medial 1½ fingers</strong> including their <strong>nail beds.</strong> The medial half of the dorsum of the hand also shows sensory loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Median nerve injuries</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Distal injury</strong>: Thus an injury to the distal median nerve affects th<strong>e 1st </strong>and<strong> 2nd lumbrical</strong> sparing the flexor digitorum profundus. This causes<strong> hyperextension </strong>at the <strong>metacarpophalangeal joints </strong>and <strong>flexion</strong> at the <strong>interphalangeal joints</strong>, involving the index and middle fingers. This attitude of the hand known as the<strong> median claw hand</strong> may be seen at rest and is more pronounced on attempting to extend the fingers (attitude is similar to proximal ulnar injury).</p>\n<p><strong>Proximal injury:</strong> Since the opposing <strong>flexor digitorum profundus</strong> of the 2nd and 3rd digit that causes the clawing is also affected, the clawing of the hand is<strong> less pronounced</strong> in distal injuries of the ulnar nerve.
