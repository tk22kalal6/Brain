Mutation of <strong>PTCH gene </strong>is seen in this condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Gorlin syndrome</strong> also known as <strong>nevoid basal cell carcinoma  syndrome</strong> is an <strong>autosomal dominant </strong>condition caused by mutations in the <strong>PTCH gene</strong> which codes for <strong>PATCHED protiens</strong>.
