It is seen in the shaft of the long bones of an adult.</li>\n<li><strong>Red marrow </strong>-<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is made up predominantly of <strong>hemopoietic tissue</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is seen&nbsp;throughout the <strong>skeleton of the fetus.&nbsp;</strong>It persists till about <strong>five years</strong> of age after which, the red marrow in the shaft of long bones is gradually replaced by the yellow marrow.
