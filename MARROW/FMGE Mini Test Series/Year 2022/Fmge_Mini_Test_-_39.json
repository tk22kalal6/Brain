      "solution": "<p>The presence of tachycardia can be explained by the <strong>Bainbridge</strong> <strong>reflex.</strong></p>\n<p>It is a compensatory cardiac reflex where there is an <strong>increase in the heart rate </strong>in response to <strong>raised atrial stretch. </strong></p>\n<p>In fluid overload states, commonly after <strong>excessive fluid infusion</strong>, there is <strong>distension of the atria</strong> due to increased blood volume. This <strong>distension</strong> activates the atrial stretch receptors which transmit the afferent signals to the medulla via the vagus nerve. The efferent signals are then transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves. This leads to an increase in the strength of contraction of the heart and <strong>tachycardia.</strong> This reflex helps in preventing excess accumulation of blood in the atria, veins, and in the pulmonary circulation.</p>\n<p>Other options - </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Bezold-Jarisch reflex</strong> is due to the activation of <strong>chemosensitive vagal C fibers</strong> in the cardiopulmonary region. They can be elicited after administering certain irritants like <strong>capsaicin</strong> or serotonin. It can also be activated during myocardial infarction and on exposure to radioactive dyes during coronary angiography. This reflex is characterized by <strong>profound brady­cardia, hypotension</strong>, and a brief period of <strong>apnea</strong> followed by <strong>rapid shallow breathing</strong>. </p>\n<p>Option B<strong>: Pulmonary chemoreflex</strong> is due to the stimulation of the <strong>J-receptors</strong> (C receptors/juxta-pulmonary capillary receptors) which are stimulated when there is hyperinflation of the lung. This produces reflex <strong>apnea</strong> followed by a <strong>rapid increase in breathing rate</strong>, <strong>bradycardia,</strong> and <strong>hypotension</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Cushing's reflex </strong>is seen when the <strong>intracranial pressure </strong>is<strong> raised </strong>where the blood supply to ventrolateral medulla neurons is compromised. The local hypoxia and hypercapnia stimulate the neurons producing <strong>hypertension, bradycardia</strong>, and<strong> irregular respiration</strong>.</p><p>*Note: Bainbridge reflex causes<strong> tachycardia</strong>, whereas all the other mentioned reflexes predominately cause <strong>bradycardia</strong>. </p>",
