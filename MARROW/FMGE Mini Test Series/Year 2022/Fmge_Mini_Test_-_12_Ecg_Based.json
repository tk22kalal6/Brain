The mechanism triggering multifocal atrial tachycardia is the <strong>automaticity of multiple atrial foci</strong>.</p>\n<p>The given ECG shows narrow QRS complexes with irregular RR intervals, hence it can be atrial fibrillation or multifocal atrial tachycardia. The next step is to look at the p waves. Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is characterized by at least<strong> 3 distinct P-wave morphologies</strong> (shown by arrows in the image).&nbsp;Whereas, in atrial fibrillation, there would be no distinct p waves seen.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/3ca1f22af8114d94ba32e0c4cd65fa6bx1280x697.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Multifocal atrial tachycardia </strong>(MAT) occurs due to impulses arising from <strong>multiple abnormal foci</strong> in the atria. This leads to supraventricular tachycardia with p waves and QRS complexes of different morphologies. It is usually encountered in patients with <strong>chronic pulmonary disease and acute illness.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"ng-scope\">\n<div class=\"ng-scope\">\n<p>Identifying features in ECG:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Heart rate &gt; 100</strong>,&nbsp;typically between 100 and 150 beats/min</li>\n<li><strong>Irregular</strong>&nbsp;rhythm</li>\n<li>Narrow QRS complex</li>\n<li><strong>Discrete P</strong>&nbsp;waves with&nbsp;<strong>more than 3 different morphologies&nbsp;</strong></li>\n<li>Variable PR interval</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Therapy for MAT is directed at <strong>treating the underlying disease</strong> and correcting any metabolic abnormalities.
