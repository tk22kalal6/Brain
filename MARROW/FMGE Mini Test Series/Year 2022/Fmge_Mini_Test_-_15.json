Enzymes that contain flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as prosthetic groups are known as flavoenzymes (e.g., succinic acid dehydrogenase, monoamine oxidase, glutathione reductase). FAD is a cofactor for methyltetrahydrofolate reductase and therefore modulates homocysteine metabolism.

Risk factors include alcoholism and a poor diet with a low intake of milk products.

Milk and other dairy products, enriched bread, cereals, meat, fish, eggs, broccoli, and legumes are good sources of riboflavin.
