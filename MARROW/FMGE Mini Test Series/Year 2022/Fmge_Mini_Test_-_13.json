Point A is at the end of systole when the ventricular volume is about <strong>50 mL</strong>. This volume is called <strong>end-systolic volume.</strong> The pressure at this point is about 2 to 3 mm Hg. These volume and pressure go on increasing as the blood from the atrium flows to the ventricle during diastole. At the <strong>end </strong>of<strong> diastole</strong>, marked by point <strong>B</strong>, the ventricle will have a volume of <strong>around 120 mL</strong>. This volume is called <strong>end-diastolic volume.</strong> The pressure is slightly raised to 5-7mm Hg.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase II</strong>- It is the phase of <strong>isovolumetric contraction</strong>, and extends between <strong>points B</strong> and<strong>&nbsp;C</strong>. At the end of diastole (point B), a slight increase in the ventricular pressure <strong>closes</strong> the <strong>mitral valve</strong>, and contraction starts. The ventricle contracts while both mitral and aortic valves are closed. Therefore, the pressure within the ventricle slowly rises without any changes in the volume.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase III</strong>- It is the phase of <strong>ejection</strong> and extends between <strong>point C</strong> and <strong>point D</strong>. Point <strong>C</strong> is the place where the <strong>aortic </strong>valve <strong>opens</strong>. The pressure within the left ventricle rises slowly during isovolumetric contraction until it is sufficient to open the aortic valve. Once the aortic valve opens, blood within the left ventricle is ejected into the aorta. This decreases the volume of the left ventricle, while increasing the pressure within the ventricle.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase IV</strong>- It is the period of <strong>isovolumetric relaxation</strong>. It extends between <strong>points D</strong> and <strong>A</strong>. At the end of the ejection (Point D), the aortic valve closes. However, the ventricular relaxation continues despite closed aortic and mitral valves. Therefore, the ventricular pressure continues to fall while the volume remains the same. The ventricle returns to its starting point, with about 50 ml of blood left in the ventricle and pressure of about 2 to 3 mm Hg</p>\n<p><strong>End-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ESPVR</strong> is the <strong>maximum pressure</strong> that can be developed by the ventricle at the <strong>end-systolic volume</strong>. It is determined by the line intersecting the upper left corners of the loops. This line can be extended down to the x-axis. The slope of this line is called as ESPVR slope.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/76202439afbd4b4f88576c49193b05c2x1280x1316.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Now coming to the question, when the <strong>contractility</strong> of the heart is <strong>decreased</strong>, the force of <strong>ejection decreases</strong> leading to decreased stroke volume, and <strong>increased end-systolic volume.</strong> Therefore, the volume-pressure diagram <strong>shifts</strong> to the <strong>right</strong>. If the diagram shifts to the right, then ESPVR also changes, leading to a <strong>change</strong> in the <strong>slope</strong> of the ESPVR curve.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e8152288950741fcb3748d8010af752dx1280x1259.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Options A and D- End diastolic volume and pressure curve (<strong>EDPVR</strong>) mainly assesses the <strong>compliance</strong> of the ventricle, rather than contractility. The slope of this curve increases when the compliance decreases, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Option C- ESPVR shifts to right with change in slope.</p>",
