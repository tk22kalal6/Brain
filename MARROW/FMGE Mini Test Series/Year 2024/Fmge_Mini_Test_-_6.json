Usually, the onset, nadir and recovery of the deceleration occur after the start, peak and end of the uterine contraction respectively. It suggests uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal hypoxia (50%). Causes of late deceleration: (i) Placental pathology (postmaturity, hypertension, diabetes, placental<strong> </strong>abruption); (ii) Excessive uterine contractions; (iii) Injudicious use of oxytocin; (iv) Regional anaesthesia (spinal or epidural)</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e2d898d60ccc46a9b57829f8e273c12dx720x637.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Variable</strong> deceleration: The <strong>most common</strong> type of deceleration. Here the decelerations are <strong>variable</strong>, with&nbsp;varying parameters of size, shape, depth, duration, and timing with respect to uterine contractions. They indicate <strong>cord compression</strong> and may disappear when the patient's position is altered. Accelerations often precede and follow this type of deceleration.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/530baff365cf48d389485c5e72e8ee11x1280x1092.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3. Prolonged deceleration</strong> is the <strong>abrupt decrease in FHR</strong> to levels below the baseline, and it <strong>lasts for &gt;3</strong>&nbsp;min but <strong>&lt;10 min</strong>. If it lasts for &gt;10 min, it is a baseline change.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Lag period</strong>: It is the time taken for the <strong>FHR to reach</strong> the nadir (the <strong>lowest poin</strong>t of the FHR dip) from the apex of the preceding uterine contraction. In deceleration, the lag period is &gt;30 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Sinusoidal pattern</strong>: It resembles a sine wave. It has a stable baseline <strong>FHR with fixed</strong> or absent baseline variability lasting <strong>&gt;20 min</strong>. Accelerations are absent. It is often associated with<strong> fetal anaemia </strong>and<strong> fetomaternal haemorrhage</strong>. It may occur when <strong>narcotics</strong> are given to the mother. Such FHR patterns are called <strong>pseudo-sinusoidal</strong> as the fetus is well-oxygenated.</p>",
