Left lateral geniculate nucleus</p>\n<p>Hemianopia or hemianopsia refers to loss of sight in half the visual field. <strong>Bitemporal hemianopia</strong> refers to loss of sight in the <strong>temporal halves</strong> of the visual field, seen in lesions affecting the optic chiasma. The <strong>most common cause</strong> of this is <strong>pituitary gland tumours</strong>. Other causes include <strong>suprasellar aneurysms</strong>,<strong> chronic arachnoiditis</strong>, and suprasellar tumours like <strong>craniopharyngioma </strong>and<strong> suprasellar meningioma</strong>.</p>\n<p>Damage to the middle part of the optic chiasm <strong>affects</strong> <strong>fibres crossing</strong> at the <strong>nasal retina</strong> of each eye, leaving the uncrossed fibres from the <strong>temporal retinas intact</strong>. The resulting <strong>loss of vision</strong> is confined to the <strong>temporal visual field</strong> of each eye and this is known as bitemporal hemianopia. It is also called <strong>heteronymous</strong> <strong>hemianopia</strong> to emphasize the fact that the parts of the visual field that are lost in each eye do not overlap.</p>\n<p>Individuals with this condition are able to see in both left and right central visual fields, with both eyes open. However, all information from the most peripheral parts of visual fields (which are seen only by the nasal retinas) is lost.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Lesions in the optic pathway</h3><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/99e36d0f854b491da018065066ccac41x1280x2202.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5e6706752b2243f395c0320ea0a3ef7cx1280x1910.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Transection</strong> of the <strong>pathways</strong> at the locations indicated by the letters causes the visual field defects shown in the diagram above.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The fibers from the nasal half of each retina decussate in the optic chiasm, so that the fibers in the optic tracts are those from the temporal half of one retina and the nasal half of the other.</li>\n<li>A <strong>lesion</strong> that interrupts<strong>&nbsp;the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>optic nerve</strong> causes <strong>blindness</strong> in <strong>that eye</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Lesions</strong> affecting the <strong>optic chiasma</strong> destroy fibers from both nasal hemiretinas and produce a <strong>heteronymous</strong> (opposite sides of the visual fields) <strong>hemianopia.</strong></li>\n<li>A <strong>lesion</strong> in <strong>one optic tract</strong> causes blindness in half of the visual field and is called <strong>homonymous</strong> (same side of both visual fields)&nbsp;<strong>hemianopia (half-blindness).</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Occipital lesions</strong> may <strong>spare</strong> the fibers from the <strong>macula</strong>&nbsp;because of the separation in the brain of these fibers from the other subserving vision.</li>\n</ul>",
