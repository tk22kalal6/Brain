Absence of this H antigen results in absence of A and B antigens. Their plasma contains anti-A, anti-B, and strong anti-H antibodies. Therefore, they do not react with anti-A, anti-B, and anti-AB antiserums, and get recognized as O blood group on cell typing.</p>\n<p>However, the O blood group has an H antigen. Thus if a patient with the Bombay blood group is transfused with the O blood group blood, the anti-H antibodies in the Bombay blood group patient react with the H antigen present in the O blood group.

Therefore, patients with the Bombay blood group require the same blood group during transfusion. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other less common systems of blood grouping include MNSs, Lutheran, Kell, and Kidd systems of blood grouping.</p>",
