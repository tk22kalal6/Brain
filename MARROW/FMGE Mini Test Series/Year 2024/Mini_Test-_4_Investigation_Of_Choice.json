      "solution": "<p> <strong>Cranial Ultrasonography</strong> is the preferred modality for diagnosis of<strong> intraventricular hemorrhage </strong>(IVH) because of the high sensitivity, ease of access and lack of radiation exposure. </p>\n<p>The most important risk factor for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is <strong>prematurity</strong> with high incidence in <strong>very low birth weight (VLBW)</strong> infants weighing &lt;1500 g at birth. The risk of GMH-IVH increases with decreasing gestational age and birth weight. Some other risk factors that increase its incidence include respiratory distress, mechanical ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and hypotension.</p>\n<p>The origin of bleeding is the small blood vessels in the <strong>germinal matrix</strong>, located between the caudate nucleus and the thalamus at the level of the foramen of Monro. In preterm infants, a weak structural support system makes the germinal matrix vulnerable to hemorrhage and injury particularly when there is hemodynamic instability.</p>\n<p> Most cases present on the first day of life and the majority in the first few days of life. The most common presentation is a stuttering course with <strong>altered levels</strong> of <strong>consciousness</strong>, <strong>respiratory cycle alterations</strong>,<strong> hypotonia</strong>, <strong>decreased spontaneous</strong> and <strong>elicited movements,</strong> and subtle changes in eye position and movement. Catastrophic deterioration occurs in very few patients with <strong>seizures</strong>, <strong>coma</strong> and <strong>decerebrate posturing</strong> progressing over minutes to hours. Some patients may have a clinically silent presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Ultrasound</strong> is the preferred modality because of the high sensitivity, ease of access and lack of radiation exposure. Routine ultrasound screening is recommended for infants born at &lt; 28 weeks gestation. CT scan is useful to detect cortical neuronal injury and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to evaluate any hypoxic ischemic brain injury.</p>",

Clinically, this condition presents with profuse, <strong>recurrent spontaneous epistaxis</strong>, <strong>progressive nasal obstruction</strong>, <strong>conductive hearing loss</strong>, and <strong>otitis media with effusion</strong>. It may also cause additional features such as proptosis, cheek swelling, and broadening of the nasal bridge.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical presentation, with <strong>CECT </strong>serving as the preferred imaging technique to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the tumor. <strong>Carotid angiography</strong> may be performed to evaluate the<strong> vascularity</strong> of the tumor and its feeding vessels, typically arising from the external carotid artery, and potentially from the internal carotid system in cases of larger tumors with intracranial extension. <strong>Biopsy </strong>of the mass is generally <strong>avoided</strong> due to the risk of <strong>severe bleeding</strong>.</p><p><strong>Staging of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage</td>\n<td>Spread</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IA</td>\n<td>Limited to the nose and/or nasopharynx</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IB</td>\n<td>Extension into ≥ one paranasal sinus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IIA</td>\n<td>Minimal extension into the sphenopalatine foramen with minimal part of pterygopalatine fossa</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IIB</td>\n<td>Full occupation of pterygopalatine fossa with Holman-Miller sign, may with erosion of orbital bones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IIC</td>\n<td>Extension into the cheek, temporal fossa, or posterior to pterygoids through the pterygomaxillary fossa</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IIIA</td>\n<td>Erosion of skull base with minimal intracranial</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IIIB</td>\n<td>Erosion of skull base with extensive intracranial with or without cavernous sinus</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><strong>Surgery </strong>is the <strong>treatment of choice</strong>.
