They can develop along any external surface of the brain or within the ventricular system, originating from the stromal arachnoid cells of the choroid plexus.</p>\n<p>A major risk factor for meningiomas is <strong>prior radiation therapy</strong> to the head and neck. The most common cytogenetic abnormality associated with these tumors is the loss of <strong>chromosome 22,</strong> particularly the long arm (22q). Meningiomas are frequently seen in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), often occurring at multiple sites, especially alongside acoustic neuromas or glial tumors.</p>\n<p>The tumor mass is usually encapsulated but may also grow<strong> en plaque</strong>, where it spreads in a <strong>sheetlike manner</strong> along the dura, often leading to hyperostotic reactive changes in the adjacent bone.
