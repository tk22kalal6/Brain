It is zoonotic, with<strong> fruit bats</strong> from the Pteropodidae family as its <strong>natural hosts.</strong> <strong>Transmission</strong> occurs from animals, such as <strong>bats and pigs, to humans</strong>, as well as between humans.Symptoms range from <strong>asymptomatic (subclinical) </strong>infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis.</p>\n<p>Currently, <strong>no treatment or vaccine</strong> exists for humans or animals, and <strong>supportive care</strong> is the main form of treatment for those infected. Nipah virus is also listed among the WHO's Blueprint priority diseases.</p><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Japanese encephalitis : Humans</strong> serve as dead-end hosts for the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, which is transmitted through the <strong>bite of Culex mosquitoes</strong>, particularly Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex vishnui, commonly found in India. The <strong>transmission </strong>cycle involves <strong>birds, mosquitoes, and humans</strong>.The JE virus also infects various non-human hosts, such as<strong> pigs </strong>and birds like pond herons.</p>\n<p>The main transmission cycles are:<br />(a) Pig → Mosquito → Pig<br />(b) Bird → Mosquito → Bird</p>\n<p><strong>Herons act as reservoir hosts</strong>, while<strong> pigs</strong> function as <strong>amplifier hosts</strong>. Control measures focus on mosquito control, relocating pig farms away from human habitation, and vaccinating pigs.</p><p>Option B: <strong>Zika virus</strong> is transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of an infected <strong>Aedes </strong>species mosquito (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus).</p>\n<p>Anyone who lives in or travels to a region with risk of Zika infection, and has not already been infected with Zika virus can get it from mosquito bites. Once a person has been infected, they are likely to be protected from future infections</p>\n<p>A <strong>pregnant woman </strong>can pass Zika virus to her fetus during pregnancy. Zika is a cause of <strong>microcephaly</strong> and other severe fetal brain defects. Zika virus has also been found in <strong>breast milk</strong>. Possible Zika virus infections have been identified in breastfeeding babies, but Zika virus transmission through breast milk has not been confirmed.<br />Zika can be passed through sexual intercourse, even if the infected person does not have symptoms at the time.<br />To date, there have not been any confirmed blood transfusion transmission cases in the United States. There are reports of laboratory acquired Zika virus infections, although the route of transmission was not clearly established in all cases<br /> </p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Rabies</strong> is a fatal infection of the central nervous system transmitted by the bite of a <strong>rabid animal</strong>. It is caused by <strong>rhabdoviruses</strong>. These viruses are enveloped, rod or<strong> bullet</strong> shaped and contain <strong>single-stranded RNA</strong>. This virus attaches to the cells via its glycoprotein spikes and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor acts as the cellular receptor.</p>",

The proton is very fast when it enters the patient&rsquo;s body and deposits only a small dose on its way. The absorbed dose increases very gradually with greater depth and lower speed, suddenly rising to a peak when the proton is ultimately stopped. This is known as the Bragg peak. The behavior of the proton can be precisely determined and the beam can be directed so the Bragg peak occurs exactly within the tumor site. Immediately after this burst of energy, the proton completely stops to irradiate and the particles come to rest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Proton therapy therefore allows to <strong>target tumors</strong> <strong>inside the body,</strong> <strong>precisely localize the radiation dosage</strong> and <strong>spare the patient&rsquo;s healthy cells</strong>, offering a much less invasive alternative to treat cancer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/62c4f6d692354217afdc5a9e9ef3ce48x1280x901.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
