Initially, the ferric <strong>non-heme iron</strong> is <strong>reduced</strong> to ferrous iron by <strong>duodenal cytochrome B (ferric reductase)</strong>&nbsp;or by <strong>vitamin C</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The reduced ferrous iron is then transferred into the enterocyte by <strong>DMT 1 (divalent metal transporter)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Heme iron moves into the cytoplasm with the help of transporters. Here, it is metabolized to release ferrous iron, which then follows the same pathway as non-heme iron.</p>\n<p>Once inside the enterocyte, it can <strong>either</strong> get <strong>stored as ferritin</strong> or <strong>transferred</strong> across the basolateral membrane<strong> by ferroportin.</strong>&nbsp;In the <strong>plasma</strong>, iron is transported in the <strong>Fe<sup>3+</sup> form bound to transferrin</strong>, which is a transport protein.

When the body&rsquo;s iron stores are adequate it downregulates the expression of <strong>ferroportin</strong> and thereby iron absorption too. Thus,<strong> iron is trapped</strong> in the intestinal cells which is eventually sloughed off. Hepcidin also <strong>inhibits</strong> the release of <strong>iron from macrophages</strong> by binding to ferroportin.&nbsp;High hepcidin levels are seen in systemic inflammation and low hepcidin levels are seen in hemochromatosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Iron</strong> is an important <strong>component</strong> of</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hemoglobin</li>\n<li>Myoglobin</li>\n<li>Cytochrome P450 groups of enzymes</li>\n<li>Components of the electron transport chain</li>\n<li>Ribonucleotide reductase</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Factors affecting iron absorption</h3><p><strong>Enhancers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ascorbic acid</li>\n<li>Citric acid</li>\n<li>Amino acid</li>\n<li>Sugars in the diet</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Inhibitors:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tannins</li>\n<li>Carbonate</li>\n<li>Oxalate</li>\n<li>Phosphate</li>\n</ul>",

This condition arises due to<strong> thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency</strong>, which impairs the function of the <strong>pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme</strong>. The current standard of <strong>treatment</strong> for patients with symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy is to give <strong>thiamine 100 mg intravenously before administering glucose-containing IV fluids</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Thiamine</strong> is an essential cofactor for the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, a key component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. This conversion is critical for linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, thereby facilitating energy production in the body.</p>\n<p>Without sufficient thiamine, the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is severely impaired, leading to an accumulation of pyruvate and lactate in the blood, causing lactic acidosis. This biochemical disturbance contributes to the neurological symptoms observed. Immediate administration of thiamine is crucial in treating Wernicke's encephalopathy.
