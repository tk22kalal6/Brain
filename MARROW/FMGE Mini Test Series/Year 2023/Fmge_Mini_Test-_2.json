Drug-induced parkinsonism is a condition that is caused by certain drugs that have <strong>D<sub>2</sub> antagonistic action</strong> like <strong>typical antipsychotics</strong>. Due to the decrease in dopaminergic activity, they result in an unbalanced cholinergic activity. Benzhexol acts by restoring the balance of the cholinergics in the striatal interneurons.</p>\n<div class=\"ng-star-inserted\">\n<div class=\"table-responsive font-weight-light answer-scroll answer-html ng-star-inserted\">\n<p>The following drugs are implicated in drug-induced parkinsonism:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Drug class</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Examples&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Typical antipsychotics</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Phenothiazines, haloperidol</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Atypical antipsychotics</strong></td>\n<td>Risperidone, olanzapine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dopamine depleters</strong></td>\n<td>Reserpine, tetrabenazine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Antiemetics</strong></td>\n<td>Metoclopramide, levosulpiride</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong></td>\n<td>Flunarizine, cinnarizine</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n</div>\n</div>",
