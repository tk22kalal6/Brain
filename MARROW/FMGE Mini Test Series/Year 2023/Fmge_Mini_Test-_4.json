It is directly proportional to the following factors: Arterial plasma colloid osmotic pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Filtration fraction : </strong>An <strong>increase in filtration fraction </strong><strong>concentrates the plasma proteins </strong><span>and <strong>raises the glomerular colloid osmotic pressure</strong> which in turn <strong>decreases the GFR.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>Other options : </strong></span></p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Efferent Arteriole Dilation</strong> reduces the resistance to blood leaving the glomerulus. This leads to a <strong>decrease in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure. </strong>A reduction in hydrostatic pressure lowers the driving force for filtration, resulting in a decreased GFR.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Afferent Arteriole Constriction</strong> decreases blood flow into the glomerulus. This <strong>lowers the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure.</strong> Lower pressure reduces the filtration rate across the glomerular capillary wall, leading to a decrease in GFR.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Increase in Glomerular Plasma Flow: </strong>If glomerular plasma flow increases but the efferent arteriole doesn't constrict, the extra blood flow is quickly carried away. This prevents a significant rise in the pressure inside the glomerular capillaries. As a result, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) doesn't significantly increase, because the necessary increase in filtration pressure doesn't occur.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Factors Affecting GFR</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Determinants</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Physiological/Pathophysiological Causes</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&darr;K<sub>f</sub>&nbsp;(filtration coefficient)&rarr; &darr;GFR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Renal disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&uarr;P<sub>B</sub>&nbsp;&rarr; &darr;GFR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Urinary tract obstruction (e.g., kidney stones)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&uarr;&pi;<sub>G </sub>&rarr; &darr;GFR</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&darr; Renal blood flow&nbsp;increased plasma proteins</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&darr;P<sub>G</sub>&nbsp;&rarr; &darr;GFR</p>\n<p>a) &uarr;afferent arteriolar resistance (R<sub>A</sub>&nbsp;)&rarr; &darr;P<sub>G</sub></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&uarr; Sympathetic activity, (e.g., norepinephrine, endothelin)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>b) &darr;systemic arterial pressure(A<sub>P</sub>&nbsp;)&rarr; &darr;P<sub>G</sub></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;Arterial pressure</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>c) &darr;efferent arteriolar resistance (R<sub>E </sub>)&rarr; &darr;P<sub>G</sub></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&darr; Angiotensin II (drugs that block angiotensin II formation)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>P<sub>G :&nbsp;</sub>Glomerular hydrostatic pressure</p>\n<p>&pi;<sub>B :&nbsp;</sub>Colloid osmotic pressure of the proteins in Bowman&rsquo;s capsule</p>\n<p>P<sub>B :&nbsp;</sub>Hydrostatic pressure in Bowman&rsquo;s capsule</p>\n<p>&pi;<sub>G :&nbsp;</sub>Colloid osmotic pressure of glomerular capillary plasma proteins&nbsp;</p>",

The point mutations within the coding sequences of the DNA (i.e., the region of the DNA that&nbsp; codes for proteins) are of two types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Missense mutations</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Non-sense mutations</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>1. Missense mutations: </strong>These mutations may involve <strong>alteration of a single base in a triplet of bases</strong> and lead to the <strong>replacement of one amino acid by another in the gene product.</strong>&nbsp;Because these mutations alter the meaning of the sequence of the encoded protein, they are often referred to as missense mutations.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Based on the substituted amino acid coded, the missense mutations are again of two types:</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;<strong>Conservative missense mutation: </strong>The substituted amino acid is biochemically similar to the original. It typically causes little change in the function of the protein.</p>\n<p>b)&nbsp;<strong>Non-conservative missense mutation: </strong>This type of mutation replaces the normal amino acid with a biochemically different one. An example of this type of mutation is <strong>sickle-cell anemia, </strong>which is characterized by point mutation affecting the <strong>&beta;-globin chain of the hemoglobin, </strong>where the nucleotide triplet <strong>CTC</strong> (or GAG in mRNA), which encodes glutamic acid, is changed to <strong>CAC</strong> (or GUG in mRNA), which <strong>encodes valine</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Nonsense mutations: </strong>It is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon. For example, a point mutation affecting the codon for glutamine (CAG) creates a <strong>stop codon (UAG)</strong> if U is substituted for C. This change leads to premature termination of &beta;-globin gene translation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded. The resulting deficiency of &beta;-globin chains can give rise to a severe form of anemia called&nbsp;<strong>&beta;<sup>0</sup> t</strong><strong>halassemia.</strong></p><p><strong>The illustration below shows various types of point mutations:</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a42b131ed0b94da48af9e2f5309f4eebx1280x917.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Other options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Option b: The &alpha;-thalassemias</strong> are caused by inherited deletions that result in the reduced or absent synthesis of &alpha;-globin chains.</li>\n<li><strong>Option c: Sickle-cell anemia</strong> is an example of non-conservative missense mutation.</li>\n<li><strong>Option d: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS)</strong> is an inherited disorder caused by intrinsic defects in the red cell membrane skeleton that render red cells spheroid less deformable and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction.</li>\n</ul>",
