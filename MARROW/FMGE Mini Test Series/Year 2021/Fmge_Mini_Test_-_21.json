The papule may have an adherent crust or small pustule.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Below image-&nbsp;Lichen scrofulosorum</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b6fd896c61b047cdba419c47e46d8a1dx512x357.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other types of tuberculids are</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Papulonecrotic tuberculids</strong>&nbsp;consist of&nbsp;symmetrical, <strong>hard, dusky red papules</strong>.

They present with crops of small, tender, and painful erythematous or dusky nodules or&nbsp;plaques on the <strong>calves</strong> which may ulcerate.
