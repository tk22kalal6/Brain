      "solution": "<p>Multiple FLAIR <strong>hyperintense lesions</strong> arranged perpendicular to the lateral ventricles in a triangular configuration (<strong>Dawson's fingers</strong>) is typical for <strong>multiple sclerosis.</strong></p>\n<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the <strong>most common immune-mediated</strong> <strong>inflammatory demyelinating disease</strong> of the central nervous system. It is the second most common cause of neurological impairment in young adults, after trauma.</p>\n<p>MS is characterized pathologically by multifocal areas of <strong>demyelination with the loss of oligodendrocytes and astroglial scarring</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Dawson fingers</strong> are a radiographic feature depicting <strong>demyelinating plaques</strong> through the corpus callosum, arranged at right angles along medullary veins (callososeptal location). They are relatively specific signs for multiple sclerosis (MS)<em>,</em> which presents as T2 hyperintensities.</p>\n<p>The arrow in the below image show's the Dawson fingers:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f615fead85294cd7a9e4eaad5e41fd2ax630x630.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: The 2017 Revised McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Sclerosis</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Clinical</strong><br /><strong>(Attacks)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Objective</strong><br /><strong>Lesions</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Additional requirements to make the diagnosis</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 or more</td>\n<td>2 or more</td>\n<td>None*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 or more</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>None*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 or more</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Dissemination in space demonstrated by an additional clinical attack implicating a different CNS site or by MRI</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;1&nbsp;</td>\n<td>2 or more</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dissemination in time demonstrated by an additional clinical attack or by MRI</p>\n<p>or demonstration of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;1<br /><br /></td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dissemination in space demonstrated by an additional clinical attack implicating a different CNS site or by MRI</p>\n<p><strong>AND</strong></p>\nDissemination in time demonstrated by an additional clinical attack or by MRI&nbsp;<strong>OR</strong> demonstration of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>* No additional test needed.
