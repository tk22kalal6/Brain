Heterozygosity of the gene has been linked to the development of PCOS. Defects in this gene also lead to congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</p><p>PCOS and PCOD are two different diseases. In PCOD, the ovaries begin to release immature eggs, resulting in hormonal imbalances and enlarged ovaries, whereas in PCOS, it is an endocrine disorder that causes the ovaries to create excess androgens, making the eggs prone to cyst formation. However, unlike with PCOD, these cysts will not be expelled and will instead accumulate in the ovaries.</p>",
