This prevents the growth of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina. Its <strong>absence</strong> causes a condition called&nbsp;<strong>bacterial vaginosis&nbsp;</strong>where pathogenic organisms&nbsp;replaces the normal flora of the vagina.&nbsp;In this condition,<strong> clue cells</strong> are visible.</p>\n<p>Option B: <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em> is the most common organism involved in bacterial vaginosis. As the patient in the given question is healthy, this is not the correct option.</p>\n<p>Option C:<em> Trichomonas vaginalis</em> is flagellated protozoa that causes trichomonas vaginitis. The organism and the nucleus of epithelial cells appear equal in size on the pap smear. This criterion is used for the identification of trichomonas as flagella are not visible on a pap smear.</p>\n<p>Option D: Frisch bacillus is another name for<em> Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. </em>It is not seen on Pap smears.</p>",
