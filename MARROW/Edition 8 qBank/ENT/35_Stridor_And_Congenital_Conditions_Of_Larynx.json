      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario of a<strong>&nbsp;child</strong>&nbsp;presenting with <strong>chronic hoarseness</strong>&nbsp;(3 months) of voice and <strong>respiratory distress</strong> for 2 weeks suggests the diagnosis of <strong>respiratory papillomatosis</strong> (<strong>juvenile papillomatosis</strong>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Croup</strong> (Option A) and <strong>acute epiglottitis </strong>(Option D), which cause <strong>acute</strong> upper respiratory tract obstruction, are ruled out due to the chronic nature of the symptoms. In <strong>croup</strong>, the <strong>upper airway obstruction</strong> becomes <strong>apparent</strong> <strong>after</strong> <strong>1 to 3 days</strong> of low-grade <strong>fever</strong>, rhinorrhea, and pharyngitis. On the other hand, in<strong> epiglottitis</strong>, a child experiences<strong> respiratory distress within hours</strong> of developing a<strong> fever</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Vocal nodules</strong> (Option C) are not typically associated with respiratory distress.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Respiratory papillomatosis</strong> is the most common respiratory tract neoplasm in children. They are simple warts (benign tumors) caused by <strong>human</strong> <strong>papillomavirus types 6 and 11</strong> commonly seen in children aged<strong> 3 to 5 years</strong>.</p>\n<p>The course involves remissions and exacerbations of<strong> recurrent papillomas</strong>, mostly affecting the <strong>glottic area (vocal cords)</strong>, and supraglottis. The patient presents with progressively worsening <strong>hoarseness</strong>, sleep-disordered breathing, dyspnea,<strong> stridor,</strong> and severe <strong>airway obstruction</strong> if left untreated.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis confirmed by <strong>direct laryngoscopy, </strong>which shows<strong> grape-like </strong>projections (shown below), and <strong>biopsy</strong>. Treatment consists of <strong>micro laryngoscopy</strong> and <strong>CO2 laser excision</strong>. <strong>Antivirals</strong> like interferon alpha2a, ribavirin, cidofovir, and acyclovir are used as adjunct therapies.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c7954eba67c1480ca325d34483fca183x512x422.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) </strong>is<strong>&nbsp;</strong>caused by the <strong>parainfluenza virus</strong>. The patient initially presents with an upper respiratory tract infection (rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, cough, low-grade fever) followed by a characteristic<strong> barking cough</strong>, <strong>hoarseness</strong>, and <strong>inspiratory stridor</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Vocal nodule</strong> (singer&rsquo;s or screamer's nodule) occurs as a result of chronic vocal abuse. They appear symmetrically at the junction of the <strong>anterior one-third</strong> and <strong>posterior two third</strong> of the vocal cord. The patient presents with <strong>chronic hoarseness</strong> and voice fatigue.</p>\n<p>The image below shows symmetric vocal nodules:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/eca1736b7fe0438f991214e2cb19153fx512x380.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D:<strong> Acute epiglottitis</strong> is caused by streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci, Hemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by an acute rapidly progressive course of<strong> high-grade fever,</strong> dyspnea, and<strong> stridor.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Acute Stridor/ Noisy breathing</h3><p>Stridor indicates an upper airway problem. Look for a history of foreign body aspiration and signs of toxicity.</p>\n<p>Important differentials:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Condition</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Findings</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Croup</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Non-toxic, viral prodrome, barking cough</p>\n<p>X-ray neck shows <strong>steeple sign</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Epiglottitis</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Toxic child, drooling saliva</p>\n<p>Lateral X-ray neck shows <strong>thumb sign</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diphtheria</strong></td>\n<td>Unimmunized child, cervical lymph nodes (bull neck), dirty grey/ white membrane</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Foreign body aspiration</strong></td>\n<td>Choking, decreased air entry, unilateral hyperinflation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
