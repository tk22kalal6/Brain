The artery which is most commonly ligated in a case of refractory posterior epistaxis is the <strong>s</strong><strong>phenopalatine artery.</strong></p>\n<p>Posterior epistaxis is most commonly seen in <strong>older age groups</strong>. The bleeding is <strong>spontaneous</strong>, often due to hypertension, and is severe, requiring hospitalization. Refractory epistaxis is defined as recurrent or persistent bleeding after appropriate packing or multiple episodes of epistaxis during a short period, each requiring medical attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Sphenopalatine artery ligation</strong> gives <strong>high success </strong>in the control of refractory posterior bleed<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Therefore, transnasal<strong>&nbsp;endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation</strong> (TESPAL) is the preferred method.</p>\n<p>It is ligated at <strong>sphenopalatine foramen </strong>situated 1 cm behind the posterior end of middle turbinate.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Anterior epistaxis</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Posterior epistaxis</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Age</td>\n<td>Children &amp; young adults</td>\n<td>&gt;40 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Incidence</td>\n<td>Most common type</td>\n<td>Less common</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cause</td>\n<td>Trauma</td>\n<td>Spontaneous; often due to Hypertension or arteriosclerosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Site</td>\n<td>Little&rsquo;s area - anteroinferior part of the nasal septum</td>\n<td>Posterosuperior part of the nasal cavity; difficult to localize</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bleeding</td>\n<td>Mild- can be controlled by local pressure or nasal packing.</td>\n<td>Severe-often requires hospitalization and posterior nasal packing.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7c485a7502d64fbe8c9e0d0ef678c33fx1280x2104.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
