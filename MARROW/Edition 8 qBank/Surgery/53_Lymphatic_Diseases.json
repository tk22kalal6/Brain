It is a common complication of breast cancer treatment involving <strong>axillary lymph node dissection</strong> and <strong>radiotherapy.</strong><strong> Sentinel lymph node dissection</strong> (SLND) reduces the risk of lymphedema significantly.</p>\n<p>Clinical signs and symptoms are observed in the <strong>ipsilateral arm.</strong> A significant increase in the limb size due to swelling is seen. Other symptoms are heaviness, tightness, numbness, tingling, limb fatigue, and reduced limb mobility.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong> is predominantly based on the clinical swelling of the arm. The girth of the affected arm &gt;2 centimeters than the normal limb, a 200-mL or more increase in limb volume, or a 5% or greater limb volume change are other diagnostic criteria.</p>\n<p>Management:</p>\n<p><strong>Limb elevation</strong>, <strong>elastic arm stockings</strong>, and<strong> pneumatic compression devices</strong> can help reduce swelling. </p>\n<p><strong>Dry skin</strong> can be seen due to fluid accumulation, which can lead to <strong>cellulitis/skin infections.</strong> Using a <strong>low pH water-based moisturizer</strong> is helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Manual lymphatic drainage</strong> (MLD) by a therapist followed by <strong>simple lymphatic drainage</strong> (SLD) by the patient daily aids interstitial fluid evacuation.</p>\n<p><strong>Benzpyrones</strong> and <strong>flavonoids</strong> are some naturally occurring substances that may be of use to treat lymphedema.</p>\n<p>Surgical options are <strong>lymphaticovenular anastomosis</strong>, liposuction, and debulking.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B:   <strong>Stewart-Treves syndrome</strong> refers to <strong>lymphangiosarcoma</strong> seen in chronic <strong>long-standing</strong> lymphedema following mastectomy (more than 10 years).
