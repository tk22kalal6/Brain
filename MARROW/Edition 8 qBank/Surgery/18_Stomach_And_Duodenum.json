      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario and the image showing the presence of <strong>hypertrophied gastric mucosal folds</strong> are characteristic of <strong>Menetrier&rsquo;s disease</strong>. <strong>Gastrectomy</strong> is the treatment of choice in <strong>severe cases</strong> of Menetrier's disease.</p>\n<p>Menetrier's disease is a <strong>premalignant</strong> condition. The disease seems to be caused by overexpression of transforming growth factor-alpha i.e., <strong>TGF-alpha</strong> (not TNF-alpha), which stimulates the EGFR pathway, resulting in increased proliferation of mucus cells/foveolar hyperplasia. This results in gross <strong>hypertrophy</strong> of the gastric mucosal folds, mucus production, and <strong>hypochlorhydria</strong>. The antrum is usually spared.</p>\n<p>There is a loss of albumin (up to 10 g/day), across the gastric mucosa leading to <strong>hypoproteinemia</strong>. Secondary symptoms include weight loss, diarrhea, and peripheral edema.</p>\n<p>Histologically, it is characterized by <strong>hyperplasia of foveolar mucous cells.</strong> The glands are cystically dilated and elongated with a <strong>corkscrew-like appearance</strong> as shown in the image below.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/39baee5e43484a74af07c6d6ed580a1fx800x533.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Cetuximab</strong>, an EGFR inhibitory antibody, is now considered the <strong>first-line treatment</strong> for Menetrier's disease, leaving <strong>total gastrectomy</strong> for <strong>severe disease</strong> with persistent and substantial protein loss refractory to cetuximab.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Risk factors for carcinoma stomach</h3><p><strong>Risk factors for carcinoma stomach:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dietary\n<ul>\n<li>Low fat or protein consumption</li>\n<li>Consumption of <strong>salted meat</strong> or fish with <strong>high nitrate content</strong></li>\n<li>High complex carbohydrate consumption</li>\n<li>Smoking,&nbsp;<strong>alcohol </strong>consumption</li>\n<li>Spicy food, high salt diet</li>\n<li>Lack of fresh fruits and vegetables</li>\n<li>Dietary anti-oxidant deficiency</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Genetic and familial</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>E cadherin</strong> &ndash; hereditary diffuse type of gastric cancer</li>\n<li><strong>Blood group A</strong></li>\n<li>FAP</li>\n<li>Li-Fraumeni syndrome</li>\n<li>HNPCC</li>\n<li>BRCA 2 mutation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Premalignant lesions</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chronic atrophic gastritis</strong></li>\n<li>Adenomatous polyp (FAP)</li>\n<li>Pernicious anemia</li>\n<li><strong>Intestinal metaplasia (H. pylori)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Menetrier&rsquo;s disease</strong></li>\n<li>Stump carcinoma from stomach remnants in Billroth II GJ or vagotomy GJ</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Others\n<ul>\n<li>Low socioeconomic status</li>\n<li>Male gender</li>\n<li>Rubber and coal workers</li>\n<li><strong>EBV infection</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
