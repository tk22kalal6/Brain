      "solution": "<p>Most of the soft tissue sarcomas undergo <strong>hematogenous</strong> dissemination to metastasize to lungs, liver, bones, and subcutaneous tissue.&nbsp;Regional lymph node involvement is relatively uncommon. However, the most common subtypes with nodal metastasis are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clear cell sarcoma</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Liposarcoma</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Rhabdomyosarcoma</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Angiosarcoma</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Epitheloid sarcoma</strong></li>\n<li>Malignant fibrous histiocytoma</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lymph node involvement is an important prognostic indicator for survival. Hence, lymph node dissection is mandatory in these cases.</p>",
