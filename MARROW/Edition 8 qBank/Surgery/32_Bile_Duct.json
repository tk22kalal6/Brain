MRCP shows irregular, cystic dilation of the large proximal intrahepatic bile ducts with a <strong>normal common bile duct.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Primary sclerosing cholangitis </strong>(PSC)&nbsp;is an autoimmune condition characterized by inflammatory strictures involving the <strong>intra and extra-hepatic</strong> biliary tree. It is a progressive condition that leads to <strong>secondary biliary cirrhosis.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MRCP or ERCP</strong> will show demonstrate multifocal, diffuse dilatation and strictures of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees, this pattern is a <strong>beading or chain of lakes</strong> <strong>appearance</strong>. <strong>Pseudodiverticula</strong> of extrahepatic bile ducts are pathognomic of PSC.&nbsp;<strong>MRCP</strong> is useful in<strong> diagnosis</strong> and surveillance, while <strong>ERCP</strong> is reserved for the <strong>treatment</strong> of dominant strictures and to exclude malignancy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The below image shows a cholangiogram of primary sclerosing cholangitis:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/615f6ae3c19f4f27a8acdddfd78aa2f3x315x307.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>The common age group of primary sclerosing cholangitis is <strong>30-45 years</strong>. <strong>Men</strong> are affected twice as commonly as women. Two-thirds of these cases are associated with <strong>ulcerative colitis.&nbsp;</strong>It is also associated with <strong>Riedel&rsquo;s&nbsp;thyroiditis</strong> and<strong> retroperitoneal fibrosis.</strong>&nbsp;10&ndash;20% of patients develop <strong>cholangiocarcinoma. </strong></p>\n<p>Clinical features of a patient with PSC include pruritis, fever, chills, right upper quadrant discomfort, jaundice, and weight loss.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Liver function tests show a cholestatic pattern with an <strong>elevation of ALP </strong>and <strong>GGT</strong> and smaller rises in the aminotransferases. Bilirubin values may be variable.</p>\n<p>Liver biopsy <strong>excludes</strong> other causes of cholestatic liver disease and defines the <strong>stage</strong> of PSC. It shows <strong>onion skin concentric periductal fibrosis</strong>. With disease progression, periportal fibrosis occurs, progressing to bridging necrosis, and eventually biliary cirrhosis.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is <strong>no known effective medical therapy.</strong>&nbsp;Surgical management involving&nbsp;<strong>resection of extrahepatic biliary tree </strong>and<strong> hepaticojejunostomy</strong>&nbsp;has shown reasonable effects. For patients with&nbsp;advanced liver disease, <strong>liver transplantation </strong>is the&nbsp;only available option.</p>\n<p>Other options:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C: Oriental cholangitis, also known as<strong> recurrent pyogenic cholangitis</strong> is characterized by recurrent attacks of cholangitis due to bile stasis and stone formation. Patients between <strong>30-40 years</strong> and<strong> both sexes</strong> are equally affected. It is caused due to infections (liver flukes, E.coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Proteus). Patients present with Charcot's triad (intermittent fever, pain, and jaundice). <strong>MRCP</strong> shows intra or extrahepatic <strong>calculi,</strong> dilatation of ducts, and strictures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D: Biliary carcinoma&nbsp; (cholangiocarcinoma) most commonly affects patients <strong>&gt;60 years</strong> and presents with fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, and features of obstructive jaundice. <strong>MRCP</strong> shows irregular <strong>narrowing</strong> of the bile duct involved by the <strong>tumor,</strong> with asymmetric upstream dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Differences between primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)  and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Primary Biliary Cholangitis</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Antibodies</td>\n<td>\n<p>Antimitochondrial antibodies positive in most patients</p>\n<p>Antinuclear antibodies positive</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 860\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Antimitochondrial antibodies /AMA typically negative</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>p-ANCA</strong>-positive</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Age group</td>\n<td>40&ndash;60 years</td>\n<td>30-45 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gender predominance</td>\n<td>Females</td>\n<td>Males</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Site</td>\n<td>Intrahepatic&nbsp;bile ducts only</td>\n<td>Intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Associated with</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sjogren syndrome</p>\n<p>Hashimoto's thyroiditis&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CREST&nbsp;syndrome</p>\n<p>Rheumatoid arthritis</p>\n<p>Celiac disease</p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Ulcerative colitis</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Diagnosis</td>\n<td>Biopsy</td>\n<td>MRCP/ERCP-strictures&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Biopsy findings</td>\n<td>&nbsp;<strong>Florid duct lesion</strong> (granuloma)</td>\n<td>Concentric \"<strong>onion-skin\"</strong>&nbsp;fibrosis &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Long-term complication</td>\n<td>Cirrhosis</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cirrhosis</p>\n<p>Cholangiocarcinoma</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
