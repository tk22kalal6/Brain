      "solution": "<p>The given scenario of polyuria following a head injury and an absence of a pituitary bright spot on the MRI brain is suggestive of<strong> central diabetes insipidus</strong>. The drug of choice for this condition&nbsp;is <strong>desmopressin,</strong>&nbsp;a <strong>V<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist.</strong></p>\n<p>Mechanism of action of desmopressin is: It stimulates the V2 receptors on the basolateral membrane of the principal cells in the collecting tubules. This increases the&nbsp;insertion of <strong>water channels (aquaporin 2)</strong> into the apical membrane. This leads to increased water reabsorption in the collecting ducts.&nbsp;Activation of V<sub>2</sub> receptors also increase the permeability of urea.</p><p>Option B: Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic. It is indicated for lithium-induced <strong>nephrogenic diabetes insipidus</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: Thiazides paradoxically exert an antidiuretic effect in DI but are not the drugs of choice. They are generally used in <strong>nephrogenic DI</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: Triamterene is also a potassium-sparing diuretic that can be used to treat <strong>nephrogenic DI</strong>.</p>\n<p>Note: Patients with DI usually do not develop overt signs of dehydration due to increased intake of water to compensate for polyuria. But when water intake is impaired they can present with dehydration.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types of vasopressin receptors and their functions</h3><div class=\"ng-scope\">\n<div class=\"ng-scope\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Receptor</td>\n<td>Localization</td>\n<td>Functions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V<sub>1a</sub></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Vascular smooth muscle</li>\n<li>Platelets</li>\n<li>Hepatocytes</li>\n<li>Myometrium</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Vasoconstriction</li>\n<li>Platelet aggregation</li>\n<li>Glycogenolysis</li>\n<li>Uterine contraction</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V3/V<sub>1b&nbsp;</sub></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Anterior pituitary</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>ACTH release</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>V<sub>2</sub></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Basolateral membrane of collecting tubule</li>\n<li>Vascular endothelium</li>\n<li>Vascular&nbsp; smooth muscle</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Upregulation of Aqp2</li>\n<li>vwF &amp; factor 8 release</li>\n<li>Vasodilation</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n</div>\n</div>",
