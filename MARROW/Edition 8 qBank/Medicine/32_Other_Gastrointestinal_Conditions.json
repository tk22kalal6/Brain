      "solution": "<p>The given case scenario is suggestive of&nbsp;<strong>chronic mesenteric ischemia.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Chronic mesenteric ischemia occurs due to&nbsp;<strong>atherosclerosis</strong> of the celiac or mesenteric arteries.&nbsp;It is common in <strong>older women</strong>, and they usually have a history of <strong>smoking,</strong> coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral artery disease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The important <strong>clinical features</strong> of chronic mesenteric ischemia are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Postprandial abdominal pain&nbsp;</strong>occurs as a result of a mismatch between the increased demand and decreased blood flow to the intestine. This is called <strong>intestinal angina</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Weight loss</strong>- patients avoid eating due to postprandial pain and this leads to significant weight loss</li>\n<li><strong>Diarrhea</strong>- occurs as a result of decreased absorption</li>\n<li>Physical examination may reveal epigastric <strong>bruit</strong> in almost half of the patients.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>gold standard</strong> investigation to diagnose the blockade is <strong>mesenteric angiography.&nbsp;</strong>Once the disease is confirmed, the patients have to be started with antiplatelets and <strong>mesenteric angioplasty </strong>and <strong>stenting</strong>&nbsp;should be performed.</p>\n<p>Option A: Acute mesenteric ischemia present with acute abdomen, bloody diarrhea and nausea. Angiography will show occlusion of superior mesenteric artery.</p>\n<p>Option C: Wilkie's syndrome occurs due to&nbsp;compression&nbsp;of the third portion of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery. It can present similarly, however is associated with vomiting and rapid weight loss. It usually occurs in young, asthenic women.</p>\n<p>Option D: Nutcracker syndrome occurs due to compression of the left renal vein, between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. It presents with varicoceles and hematuria.</p>",
