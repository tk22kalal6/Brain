Patients usually present with <strong>weakness</strong> and fatiguability of the muscles, which <strong>worsens</strong> on <strong>repeated use</strong> or late in the day and improves on rest. The cranial muscles, particularly the eyelids and extraocular muscles are involved early in the course of MG. <strong>Diplopia</strong> and <strong>ptosis</strong> are common initial complaints. When MG becomes generalized, the <strong>proximal muscles</strong> of the limbs are affected first. Despite the muscle weakness, the <strong>deep tendon reflexes remain normal</strong>. <strong>Snarling</strong> expression on smiling (facial weakness), <strong>nasal timbre</strong> of speech (weakness of palate and tongue), and difficulty swallowing may be seen.&nbsp;<strong>Bulbar weakness</strong> and <strong>respiratory depression</strong> are seen more frequently in <strong>MuSK antibody&ndash;positive MG</strong>.</p>\n<p>MG is an <strong>autoimmune</strong> disorder most commonly caused by <strong>antibodies</strong> against the <strong>acetylcholine receptor</strong> (AChR). These antibodies cause damage to the postsynaptic muscle membrane and increased endocytosis of the AChR. This autoimmune response against the AChR seems to be mediated by the <strong>thymus</strong>. The myoid (muscle-like) cells present in the thymus express AChRs on their surface and are postulated to provide the autoantigen which triggers this autoimmune reaction. <strong>Thymic hyperplasia</strong> is seen in 65% of the patients, and <strong>thymomas</strong> are seen in 10% of the patients.</p>\n<p>The tests which are used to confirm the diagnosis of MG include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anti-AChR antibody</strong> immunoassay: 85% of myasthenic patients have detectable anti-AChR antibodies, but only 50% of patients with weakness limited to ocular muscles. The presence of anti-AChR antibodies is highly suggestive of MG, but a <strong>negative test does not exclude the disease</strong>.

Intravenous <strong>eculizumab</strong>, which binds to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>terminal complement <strong>component</strong> 5, is also effective.</p>\n<p>Myasthenic crisis is the life-threatening exacerbation of MG leading to respiratory failure. Treatment for myasthenic crisis should take place in <strong>intensive care units</strong>.&nbsp;It is important to <strong>rule out excessive anticholinesterase medication</strong> as a cause of deterioration by temporarily discontinuing these drugs.&nbsp;<strong>Plasmapheresis</strong> and intravenous immunoglobulin (<strong>IVIg</strong>) are beneficial in hastening recovery.</p>",
