It usually results from coronary vasoconstriction (<strong>vasospasm</strong>) and tends to involve the right coronary artery.</p>\n<p>It is a <strong>supply</strong> <strong>ischemia</strong> and usually causes transmural ischemia (subendocardial in classic angina pectoris).</p>\n<p>It often affects women under 50 years of age. It characteristically occurs in the early morning, awakening patients from sleep, and may be associated with arrhythmias or conduction defects.</p>\n<p>The clinical diagnosis of PVA is made by the detection of transient <strong>ST-segment elevation</strong> with rest pain. Coronary angiography demonstrates transient <strong>coronary spasm</strong> which is the diagnostic hallmark of PVA.</p>\n<p>Nitrates and calcium channel blockers both can be used in alleviating symptoms in Prinzmetal's angina. However due to the development of nitrate tolerance in some individuals, they are less preferred and calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, diltiazem are used as first-line agents.</p>",
