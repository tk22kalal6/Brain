Musculoskeletal symptoms such as <strong>arthritis</strong> and <strong>arthralgia</strong> are common. Gastrointestinal symptoms can include <strong>abdominal pain</strong>, vomiting, diarrhea, and <strong>bleeding</strong>. <strong>Renal involvement</strong> may lead to&nbsp;gross or microscopic<strong> hematuria</strong>, nephritic syndrome, or <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong>. Renal manifestations are <strong>more severe in adults</strong>. A rapidly progressive form of glomerulonephritis is seen in some cases. Nephritis usually follows the appearance of the rash.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Diagnosis of HSP is primarily based on <strong>clinical findings</strong>, including the palpable purpura, along with the presence of other symptoms. Laboratory tests are not specific to HSP but may show nonspecific markers of inflammation and sometimes elevated levels of IgA. Imaging studies and biopsies of affected tissues can provide additional diagnostic information</p>\n<p>Treatment of HSP is generally supportive, focusing on hydration, pain relief, and nutrition. <strong>Corticosteroids</strong> may be used in severe cases or for significant <strong>gastrointestinal involvement</strong>. Intravenous immune globulin (<strong>IVIG</strong>) and <strong>plasma exchange</strong> are occasionally employed for severe disease. <strong>Nephritis</strong>&nbsp;due to IgA vasculitis should be treated with immunosuppressants like&nbsp;<strong>prednisolone</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>azathioprine</strong>. Complications of HSP can include serious gastrointestinal problems, kidney disease, and recurrences, but overall, the prognosis for childhood HSP is <strong>favorable</strong>. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and urine is recommended to detect and manage potential complications.</p>",
