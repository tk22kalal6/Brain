      "solution": "<p>The <strong>scaphoid</strong> (labelled as <strong>A</strong>) is the <strong>most commonly fractured carpal bone</strong> after a <strong>fall on an outstretched hand</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is more susceptible to fracture because it <strong>lies obliquely</strong> across the two rows of carpal bones. It also <strong>lies along the line of loading</strong> (i.e, in the line of weight transmission) between the forearm and thumb. A combination of <strong>forced carpal movement</strong> and <strong>compression</strong>, such as in a <strong>fall on the dorsiflexed (outstretched) hand</strong>, exerts severe stress on the scaphoid making it liable to fracture.</p>\n<p>Due to its blood supply originating from the dorsal distal pole, the scaphoid's proximal pole possesses a poor blood flow, making it less prone to heal and resulting in non-union.<br /><br /></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/23e48c040f1741ee8cdddea7d88381a9x1280x1415.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
