Pelvic ring fractures are classified into 3 types:&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tile classification</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Stability</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Management</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type A</td>\n<td>Rotationally and vertically <strong>stable</strong></td>\n<td>Conservative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type B</td>\n<td>Rotationally unstable and vertically stable</td>\n<td>External fixation is used for definitive management. Anterior fixation is additionally done if pubic bones have separated by more than 2.5 cm.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type C</td>\n<td>Rotationally and vertically <strong>unstable</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;Posterior fixation is done for vertical stability along with external fixation.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>2.
