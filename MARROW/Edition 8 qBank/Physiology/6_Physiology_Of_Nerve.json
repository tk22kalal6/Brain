Such conduction is called <strong>orthodromic. </strong>Conduction in the opposite direction is called <strong>antidromic.</strong> Under natural conditions, impulse conduction is normally only orthodromic. Antidromic conduction is usually only seen when a nerve fibre is stimulated under artificial conditions. </p>\n<p>In a chemical synapse, conduction is always orthodromic. As the transmission in a chemical synapse is due to the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic membrane which activate receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, antidromic conduction (i.e. from the postsynaptic membrane to presynaptic membrane) is not possible. Any impulse travelling in such direction would die as it encounters the first synapse. </p>\n<p> </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e8cb76a81b214de7ab6b6105f411ebf7x648x600.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>This MCQ has been revised for factual accuracy</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>The tetanizing frequency of the muscle, based on the given diagram, is 20 per second.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tetanizing frequency = 1/contraction period. </strong>It is the frequency at which <strong>individual muscle fibres twitch</strong> that fuse and cause sustained muscle contraction, where the <strong>contraction period</strong> is the time taken from <strong>latent period</strong> to <strong>maximum force of contraction.</strong></p>\n<p>In this case, the time tracer was taken using a <strong>100Hz tuning fork.</strong> Which means the tracer recorded 100 waves per second.<br />Therefore, the<strong> duration of each wave</strong> in time tracer = <strong>0.01 seconds.</strong></p>\n<p>In the image given in the question, between the <strong>point B</strong> (end of latent period) to<strong> point C </strong>(maximum force of contraction), there are about 5 waves.<br />Hence, the <strong>duration</strong> <strong>of contraction</strong> = 5 x 0.01 = 0.05 seconds.</p>\n<p>Substituting the value in the formula, we get:<br /><strong>Tetanizing frequency</strong> = 1/0.05 sec = 100/5 = <strong>20/sec.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/037de34e007545d79a483088b1b50c03x1280x2823.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tetanization</strong>:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The features of muscle contraction can be demonstrated by eliciting single muscle twitches. The adding together of individual twitch contractions to increase the intensity of overall muscle contraction is <strong>Summation. </strong>Summation occurs in two ways:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">by increasing the number of motor units contracting simultaneously, which is <strong>multiple ﬁber summations.</strong></li>\n<li class=\"li1\">by increasing the frequency of contraction, which is called frequency<strong> summation and can lead to tetanization.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">When the frequency of a contraction reaches a critical level, the successive contractions eventually fuse together, and the whole muscle contraction appears to be completely smooth and continuous, this is called<strong> tetanization. </strong>Beyond this point, a further increase in the frequency, will not result in increased force of contraction.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tetanization </strong>occurs in two ways:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Complete tetanus </strong>occurs when no relaxation occurs between stimuli.</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Incomplete tetanus </strong>when periods of incomplete relaxation take place between the summated stimuli.</li>\n</ul>",
