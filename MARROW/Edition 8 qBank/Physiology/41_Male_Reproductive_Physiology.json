This cholesterol is continually added to the cellular membrane covering the sperm acrosome, toughening this membrane and preventing the release of its enzymes.</li>\n<li>After ejaculation, the sperm deposited in the vagina swim away from the cholesterol vesicles upward into the uterine cavity, and they gradually lose much of their other excess cholesterol during the next few hours. In doing so, the membrane at the head of the sperm (the acrosome) becomes much weaker.</li>\n<li>The membrane of the sperm also becomes much more permeable to calcium ions, so calcium now enters the sperm in abundance and changes the activity of the flagellum, giving it a powerful whiplash motion in contrast to its previously weak undulating motion. In addition, the calcium ions cause changes in the cellular membrane that cover the leading edge of the acrosome, making it possible for the acrosome to release its enzymes rapidly and easily as the sperm penetrates the granulosa cell mass surrounding the ovum, and even more so as it attempts to penetrate the zona pellucida of the ovum.</li>\n</ul>",
