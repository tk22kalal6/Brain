In non-pregnant women, it is called melasma.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chloasma is very common in the&nbsp;<strong>3rd trimester</strong> of pregnancy and is most marked in brunettes.</p>\n<p>It&nbsp;is due to increased levels of<strong>&nbsp;estrogen</strong> and<strong> progesterone,</strong> stimulating the activity of melanocytes. Histopathology shows no increase in number but&nbsp;<strong>hyper-functional melanocytes</strong>.&nbsp;It&nbsp;resolves&nbsp;on its own after pregnancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Melasma</strong> is the most common cause of&nbsp;<strong>chronic facial melanosis.&nbsp;</strong>It&nbsp;is manifested by hyperpigmented macules that&nbsp;become more pronounced <strong>after sun</strong> exposure. Hypermelanosis affects mainly the upper lip, the malar regions, forehead, and chin.&nbsp;It is more common in women between 20-40 years.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is frequently seen in women on oral contraceptives.</p>\n<p><strong>Wood's lamp </strong>examination is useful to differentiate the&nbsp;level of pigmentation and treatment&nbsp;<strong>response:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Epidermal</strong> melasma-&nbsp;shows enhanced color contrast&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Dermal</strong> melasma<strong>-</strong> shows <strong>less color contrast</strong>&nbsp;(more resistant to treatment)</li>\n<li><strong>Mixed melasma.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Melasma is more chronic and requires treatment with depigmenting agents like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kligman's triple combination&nbsp;</strong>- topical hydroquinone + tretinoin + corticosteroid compound cream<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(first line)</li>\n<li>Hydroquinone (reduces tyrosinase activity)</li>\n<li>Kojic acid (tyrosinase inhibitor)</li>\n<li>Chemical peels</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Key Chart to help differentiate lesions on face</h3><p><strong>Key Chart to help Differentiate Lesions on face</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0a5140c64ee04126a3fec16990765703x1280x2116.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following images show the findings in -</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Melasma</strong></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1b24d22d7e6a4de493c0d240ebd6ec77x512x379.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rosacea</strong></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0b3b7051b30c4603b4fc56b6170151f5x484x237.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Butterfly-shaped malar rash in<strong> SLE&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/96558496ccf84739a55a7acab31585ffx512x584.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acne</strong></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/22d3e7b84f47471a8b58f938dc1a03f2x640x480.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8897f6677285496484b6281ce6100c65x640x427.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/20f4612e49014dcbb32ac3481718547fx640x480.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f248bc3b24f94e969561e2bf7be0b6b7x800x536.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nevus of Ota</strong></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0f16c38775234b8789ab421ee8988755x512x494.PNG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Portwine stain</strong></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2ff136c533da46809a1e8615c5c9afa2x1280x959.5486600846262.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Infantile hemangioma</strong></li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/828bdd67837445a583f2c34441ecc984x450x600.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",
