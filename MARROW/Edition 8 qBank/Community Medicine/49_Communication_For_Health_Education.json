A <strong>message</strong> is the information which the communicator transmits to his audience. <strong>Channel</strong> is the media of communication between the sender and the receiver (e.g., interpersonal communication, mass media, traditional or folk media). The audience who receives, understands, and acts upon the message is called the <strong>receiver</strong>. <strong>Feedback</strong> is the reaction to the message which flows from the receiver to the sender.</p>",
