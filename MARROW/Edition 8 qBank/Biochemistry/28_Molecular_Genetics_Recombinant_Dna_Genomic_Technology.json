      "solution": "<p>The wobble hypothesis explains the <strong>degeneracy</strong> of the genetic code.</p>\n<p>The <strong>wobble hypothesis</strong> states that codon-anticodon pairing follows the traditional<strong> Watson–Crick </strong>rules (G pairs with C and A pairs with U) for the <strong>first two bases</strong> of the codon but can be less stringent for the third/last base. It has been observed that a tRNA can recognize more than one codon for a specific amino acid, especially in the last nucleotide of the codon triplet. This is referred to as degeneracy and its mechanism can be explained by the wobble hypothesis.</p>\n<p>The first base of the anticodon moves to permit <strong>nontraditional pairing </strong>with the last base of the codon. This movement is called <strong>wobble</strong> and is possible because the first base of the anticodon is not as spatially defined as the other two bases. Due to the wobbling, 61 tRNA species are not required to read the 61 codons.</p>\n<p>For example, three codons for glycine—GGU, GGC, and GGA—can form a base pair from one anticodon, 3′ CCI 5′ ie, I, inosine, can base pair with U, C, and A, as shown in the diagram below.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The genetic code is <strong>universal</strong> because it is the same for all living organisms.</p>\n<p>Option B: The genetic code is <strong>unambiguous</strong> because each codon is specific for only one amino acid. Example: GGA only codes for Glycine.</p>\n<p>Option D: The genetic code is <strong>non-punctuated. </strong>This means that once the reading commences at a specific start codon, it is continuous and is read continuously as triplets until a stop codon is reached without stopping.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1e2ad80f76c940efad91da49b943c477x562x1198.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
