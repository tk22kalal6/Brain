It helps redirect transcription of only the desired exons of a gene to yield a product. <strong>Alternative splicing</strong> utilizes different promoters to code slightly different products from the same gene. </p>\n<p>In this question, the desired <strong>product A</strong> has segments <strong>1,3,4,5</strong> whilst the other <strong>product B</strong> has <strong>1,2,4,5</strong>. The difference between both is the presence of seg 3 in product A and the presence of seg 2 in product B. As the product in question is A, only seg 3 is required while excluding seg 2 and ensuring seg 1,4 and 5 intact.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seg 1- Needs to be transcribed and so <strong>W is essential</strong></li>\n<li>Seg 2- <strong>Does not need to be transcribed.</strong></li>\n<li>Seg 3- Needs to be transcribed and so <strong>Y is essential</strong></li>\n<li>Seg 4- <strong>Needs to be transcribed</strong> but Z is not essential as<strong> Y continues the transcription in the direction shown by the arrow</strong>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The answer is hence promoter W and Y.</p>",
