      "solution": "<p><strong>2, 3 and 4</strong> statements correctly explain the reason behind increased ketogenesis as seen in type1 DM.</p>\n<p><strong>Type 1 DM</strong> is characterized by a<strong> deficiency in insulin</strong> production. Since insulin is deficient, GLUT4 (insulin-dependent uptake) mediated glucose uptake is not possible in the heart or skeletal muscles. So <strong>adipose tissue mobilizes fat</strong> to be used as an energy source. These<strong> FFA</strong> (free fatty acids) are<strong> oxidized</strong> to <strong>acetoacetyl CoA</strong> which serves as a precursor for<strong> ketone body</strong> <strong>synthesis</strong>.</p>\n<p>As the level of serum FFA is raised, proportionately<strong> more</strong> of the <strong>acetyl-CoA</strong> produced from their breakdown is <strong>converted to ketone bodies</strong> and<strong> less</strong> is oxidized <strong>via the citric acid cycle</strong> to CO2. A fall in the concentration of oxaloacetate, particularly within the mitochondria, can impair the ability of the citric acid cycle to metabolize acetyl-CoA and divert fatty acid oxidation toward ketogenesis. Such a fall may occur because of an <strong>increase in the (NADH)/(NAD+) ratio</strong> caused when increased β-oxidation alters the equilibrium between oxaloacetate and malate so that the <strong>concentration of oxaloacetate is decreased</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Beta-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase</strong> is one of the enzymes used in ketone body synthesis.
