Features usually start <strong>before 3 years</strong> of age and is&nbsp;<strong>more common in boys</strong>. Autism is characterized by the <strong>2 core features</strong> of autism spectrum disorder:&nbsp;<strong>deficits in social communication</strong> and <strong>restricted, repetitive patterns</strong> of behavior, interests, or activities.</p>\n<p>In addition, autism is also usually marked by <strong>language impairment</strong>, which&nbsp;occurs early in the developmental period.
