The normal movements of the chest wall are prevented. There is a gross compression of the chest and usually abdomen by a powerful force, due to which chest expansion and diaphragmatic lowering are prevented. For example stampede deaths, crushing by falls of the earth in coal mines, or earthquakes.</p>\n<p>Option D<strong>: Overlaying </strong>or <strong>compression suffocation</strong> results due to compression of the chest, so as to prevent breathing. It occurs when an intoxicated parent or other person shares a bed with an infant. The thoracic movements are limited and respiratory exchange is either reduced or completely prevented which leads to death. It is always accidental.</p>\n<p>Below image below shows overlaying.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d375230c6deb44e4a3ee3e341a63027dx1280x1317.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
