      "solution": "<p>The given chest X-ray image depicts <strong>Chilaiditi sign, </strong>characterized by the anterior interposition of the colon between the liver and the right hemidiaphragm, which can <strong>mimic air under the diaphragm,</strong> leading to <strong>pseudo-pneumoperitoneum.</strong></p>\n<p>Chilaiditi sign is typically an <strong>incidental</strong> finding on imaging and is most often asymptomatic. However, when associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain and distension, it is referred to as <strong>Chilaiditi syndrome.</strong> </p>\n<p>An erect X-ray showing this sign may mislead clinicians into suspecting pneumoperitoneum, prompting unnecessary urgent surgical intervention, which is not required. To differentiate Chilaiditi syndrome from true pneumoperitoneum, a <strong>contrast-enhanced CT </strong>or a<strong> left lateral decubitus radiograph</strong> can be performed. In the left lateral decubitus view, distended colonic loops with <strong>haustral markings</strong> will be visible, showing that the air is within the bowel and not in the peritoneal cavity. </p>\n<p>Other conditions with the Chilaiditi sign are curvilinear pulmonary collapse, distended viscus, omental fat, and apposition of gas-distended bowel loops mimicking the double-wall sign.</p>\n<p>Below is the chest X-ray and CT showing the presence of herniated bowel loops under the diaphragm.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1eb94e5aa9794d82b391bb59ec3815c1x1100x900.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7b873798d05f4ec2a95d763aa06ffc48x629x596.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows free intraperitoneal gas which is suggestive of<strong> pneumoperitoneum</strong>. The presence of free intra-abdominal gas almost always indicates perforation of a hollow viscus. Free intraperitoneal gas is also detectable under the hemidiaphragm on an erect chest X-ray as given below. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8f95d711477b40a78c8b90a36fa044c2x1279x1410.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5ceb9fee1f3f4108989503a04eb97167x1280x1093.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option B: The existence of extraluminal gas within the mediastinum is referred to as <strong>pneumomediastinum.</strong> Gas may originate from the peritoneal cavity, lungs, trachea, central bronchi, oesophagus, or peritoneal cavity and travel to the neck or abdomen via the mediastinum.  <strong>Spinnaker sign</strong> (also called angel wing sign) is a radiographic sign seen in neonates with pneumomediastinum. The pressure from the collected gas displaces the two lobes of the thymic tissue upward and laterally from its normal position. This results in large, wedge-shaped opacities on radiograph resembling the spinnaker headsails of a boat.  Other signs of pneumomediastinum are<strong> </strong>the<strong> V sign of Naclerio</strong> and<strong> continuous diaphragm</strong> sign. </p>\n<p>Below is a chest X-ray showing spinnaker sign and CT showing the presence of pneumomediastinum.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/81476a2fb96645928ea52c43d1531f87x510x500.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5f5915a981de46109d2ad93a25b1c18ax442x301.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
