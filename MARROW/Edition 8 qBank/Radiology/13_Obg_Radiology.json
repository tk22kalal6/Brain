The appearance is described as<strong> </strong>a<strong> 'snowstorm' appearance. </strong>Theca lutein cysts may be seen in the ovary.</li>\n<li>In <strong>partial mole</strong>, the fetus is present along with molar components.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The patient presents with a characteristic history of abdominal pain, <strong>vaginal bleeding </strong>or spotting, and vomiting during the<strong> first trimester</strong>. Also, there may be a history of passing <strong>grape-like vesicles</strong> vaginally. </p>\n<p>The snowstorm appearance on USG, combined with a <strong>raised hCG </strong>and a <strong>uterus larger</strong> than the date of pregnancy, leads to the diagnosis of a <strong>complete hydatidiform mole</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Suction and evacuation</strong> is the treatment of choice. Serum <strong>hCG</strong> levels are checked <strong>within 48 hours</strong> of evacuation and are used as a baseline for future comparisons. It is then checked every week until it normalizes, which usually takes 4 to 8 weeks. After the hCG values return to normal, a regular follow-up is done <strong>monthly </strong>for <strong>6 months</strong>. </p>\n<p> </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Complete vs. Partial Mole</h3><p>Hydatidiform mole is a <strong>benign</strong> abnormal condition of the placenta characterized by partial degenerative or proliferative changes of the <strong>chorionic villi</strong>. Though benign, it has malignant potential. It is commonly seen in pregnancies of extreme reproductive age groups - <strong>teenage</strong> and women <strong>above 35 years</strong> of age. A previous <strong>history of molar pregnancy</strong> is also a strong risk factor for recurrence of this condition.</p>\n<p>Molar pregnancy is of 2 types - complete mole and partial mole.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Feature</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Partial mole</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Complete mole</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Karyotype</strong></td>\n<td>69 XYY or 69 XXY</td>\n<td>46 XX or 46 XY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diagnosis</strong></td>\n<td>Missed abortion</td>\n<td>Molar gestation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Uterus size</strong></td>\n<td>Small for date</td>\n<td>Large for date</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Theca-lutein cysts</strong></td>\n<td>Rare</td>\n<td>25&ndash;30% of cases</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Initial hCG levels</strong></td>\n<td>&lt;1 lakh mIU/ml</td>\n<td>&gt;1 lakh mIU/ml</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Medical complications</strong></td>\n<td>Rare</td>\n<td>Uncommon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rate of subsequent GTN</strong></td>\n<td>1&ndash;5%</td>\n<td>15&ndash;20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Embryo-fetus</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;Often present</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Amnion, fetal erythrocytes</strong></td>\n<td>Often present</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Villous edema</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;Focal</td>\n<td>Widespread</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Trophoblastic proliferation</strong></td>\n<td>Focal, slight to moderate</td>\n<td>Slight to severe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Trophoblast atypia</strong></td>\n<td>Mild</td>\n<td>Marked</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>p57KIP2 immunostaining</strong></td>\n<td>Positive</td>\n<td>Negative</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/abb92edd8fe94b1997c1f9c5bf1a559ex1280x2039.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Radiological Signs in Obstetrics</h3><p><strong>Bagel Sign</strong> (USG)</p>\n<p>It is seen in <strong>unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy</strong>.
