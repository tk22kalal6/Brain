      "solution": "<p>Following damage to the hypothalamus, all the hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary will decrease except <strong>prolactin.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The<strong> hypothalamus</strong> plays an important role in controlling the hormones released from the anterior pituitary. It mainly stimulates the production of all the other anterior pituitary hormones except prolactin. It <strong>inhibits prolactin production</strong>&nbsp;by releasing prolactin inhibitory hormones.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Therefore, any injury to the hypothalamus or damage to the&nbsp;hypothalamic-hypophysial portal system, the levels of other anterior pituitary hormones are decreased, while the prolactin levels are increased.</p>\n<p>Prolactin&nbsp;is secreted by the <strong>lactotropes</strong> of the <strong>anterior pituitary</strong>. Structurally it is <strong>similar</strong> to&nbsp;<strong>human growth hormone</strong> and human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS).</p>\n<p>Levels of prolactin are increased during <strong>exercise</strong>,&nbsp;surgical and psychological stresses, <strong>stimulation of the nipple</strong>, <strong>sleep</strong>, pregnancy, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, etc.</p>\n<p>The important function of prolactin is to cause <strong>milk secretion</strong> and <strong>prevent ovulation</strong> in a lactating mother. It increases the production of casein and lactalbumin. Increased prolactin <strong>decreases</strong> the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormones, and subsequently decreases the secretion of <strong>gonadotropins</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clinical correlation - <strong>Dopamine</strong> released from the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus <strong>decreases</strong> the secretion of prolactin. Therefore, <strong>L dopa</strong> which is a precursor of dopamine&nbsp;<strong>decreases</strong> prolactin secretion, and dopamine antagonists like <strong>chlorpromazine</strong> and antipsychotics<strong> increase</strong> the prolactin secretion.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Factors affecting prolactin secretion</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Increased Prolactin Secretion</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Decreased Prolactin Secretion</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sleep</td>\n<td>Dopamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stress</td>\n<td>L-Dopa</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Strenuous exercise</td>\n<td>Apomorphine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sexual intercourse in women</td>\n<td>Bromocriptine and related ergot derivatives</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pregnancy</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nursing</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Breast stimulation in non-lactating women</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Estrogen</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hypothyroidism</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TRH</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Opioids</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Phenothiazines, butyrophenones</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Atypical antipsychotics - Risperidone</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Dopamine synthesis inhibitors - &alpha;-Methyldopa</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;\n<p>H<sub>2</sub> antagonists - Cimetidine, ranitidine</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Imipramines - Amitriptyline, amoxapine</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Serotonin reuptake inhibitors -Fluoxetine</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Calcium channel blockers - Verapamil</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;\n<p>Thioxanthenes</p>\n<p>Metoclopramide</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Catecholamine depletors - Reserpine</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
