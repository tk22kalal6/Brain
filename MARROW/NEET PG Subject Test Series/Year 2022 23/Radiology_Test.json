It is the most common open neural tube disorder. Spina bifida is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column with a corresponding defect in the skin so that the<strong> meninges and spinal cord are exposed.</strong></p>\n<p>The 3 main types of spina bifida:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spina bifida occulta</strong> - This is the mildest form of spina bifida. The defect in the vertebral arches is covered by the skin. The splits in the vertebrae are so small that the spinal cord does not protrude. The skin at the site of the lesion may be normal, or it may have some hair growing from it.</li>\n<li><strong>Meningocele</strong> - The defect in the vertebra allows the meninges to protrude through the defect.</li>\n<li><strong>Myelomeningocele</strong> (meningomyelocele) - A defect in the vertebral column allows the spinal cord with the meningeal coverings to protrude. </li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4898652bfb914bfd95154ad132c676aex500x254.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>The <strong>lemon sig</strong>n is related to changes in the configuration of the fetal frontal bone, which <strong>loses convexity</strong> and appears concave or linear on ultrasonography; this sign can be detected during the<strong> first six months</strong> of gestation.</p>\n<p>The<strong> banana sign </strong>is another sign that is seen in <strong>spina bifida</strong> associated with Arnold-Chiari II malformation.

The condition usually affects the colon, most commonly the sigmoid colon. Less frequently, the right colon and terminal ileum (referred to as cecal volvulus), the cecum alone, and rarely, the transverse colon can also be affected.</p>\n<p>This may present as acute or subacute intestinal obstruction. The patients complain of sudden onset severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. The abdomen is generally markedly distended and tympanitic.</p>\n<p><strong>Plain abdominal X Rays</strong> typically reveal a markedly dilated sigmoid colon resembling a bent inner tube, with the apex in the right upper quadrant - <strong>Coffee bean sign </strong>or<strong> Bent inner tube sign</strong>. An air-fluid level may be visualized in the dilated loop of the colon, and the rectum usually does not contain gas. </p>\n<p>On a <strong>supine abdominal</strong> x-ray, the apex of the sigmoid volvulus is seen above (cranial to) the transverse colon, known as the <strong>Northern exposure sign</strong>. This sign is considered highly <strong>specific for sigmoid volvulus</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>CT</strong> demonstrates a characteristic<strong> whorl sign </strong>caused due to the <strong>twisting of the mesentery and mesenteric vessels</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Treatment of the sigmoid volvulus involves appropriate resuscitation, followed by nonoperative decompression in most cases.

Sometimes expectorant cough with orange mucus plugs may be seen.</p>\n<p>Radiographic findings in ABPA include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobar collapse</li>\n<li>Non-segmental areas of opacities commonly involving the upper lobe</li>\n<li>Branching thick tubular opacities due to distended bronchi filled with fungus and mucus -&nbsp;<strong>Finger-in-glove appearance&nbsp;</strong></li>\n<li>Pulmonary cavitation is rarely seen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other features of aspergillus infection:</p>\n<p><strong>Aspergilloma:&nbsp;</strong>Aspergillomas are mass-like fungus balls that are typically composed of&nbsp;<em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>&nbsp;and are a non-invasive form of&nbsp;pulmonary aspergillosis.&nbsp;Aspergillomas occur in patients with normal immunity but structurally abnormal lungs, with pre-existing cavities. The most common underlying condition is&nbsp;pulmonary tuberculosis. Radiographic findings of aspergilloma include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Air crescent sign&nbsp;</strong>- The fungal ball can be seen on both plain film and CT as an intracavitary mass surrounded by a crescent of air.</li>\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>mass usually moves within the cavity when the patient moves</strong>&nbsp;and this sign is called the&nbsp;<strong>Monod sign.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Angioinvasive aspergillosis:</strong> It is seen in immunocompromised individuals, especially in patients with neutropenia. <strong>Halo sign</strong> is the typical CT finding in these patients.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>halo sign</strong>&nbsp;in chest imaging is a feature seen on&nbsp;HRCT where&nbsp;ground glass opacity&nbsp;surrounds a pulmonary nodule or mass and represents hemorrhage.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Air crescent sign:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e6b15a2554cf4e488e7df5c11d916f97x550x354.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Halo sign:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/bc2446b2409d419abf362b45c381fb78x850x1146.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A-<strong> Bronchiectasis</strong>&nbsp;is characterized by local and irreversible dilatation of bronchi.
