      "solution": "<p>The clinical scenario of a<strong> </strong>32-year-old, <strong>thin-built male</strong>, presenting with polyuria, polydipsia, lethargy with laboratory investigation <strong>showing low C-peptide</strong>, and <strong>positive anti-GAD antibodies</strong> is suggestive of <strong>latent autoimmune diabetes in adults</strong> (LADA). </p>\n<p>LADA is adult-onset diabetes with features of<strong> both type 1</strong> and <strong>type 2</strong> diabetes mellitus (DM). They phenotypically appear as type 2 but have autoantibodies like anti-GAD in favor of type 1. The general characteristics of LADA include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age of onset <strong>more than 30</strong> years</li>\n<li>Family history of autoimmunity</li>\n<li>Low or normal body mass index</li>\n<li>Low C-peptide levels</li>\n<li>Anti-GAD antibodies positive</li>\n<li><strong>Do not present with ketoacidosis </strong>initially due to the slow progression of beta-cell destruction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diagnosis can be made based on three criteria as given by The Immunology of Diabetes Society:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adult age of onset (&gt;30 years of age),</li>\n<li>Positive circulating autoantibodies, and</li>\n<li>No need for insulin treatment initially for several months after diagnosis</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Initially</strong>, they <strong>don't require insulin</strong> but are more likely to be on insulin treatment within 5 years of onset. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes </strong>patients are usually middle-aged men who are <strong>overweight</strong> and have a positive family history of diabetes. They have features similar to classic type 2 diabetes but often present with <strong>severe hyperglycemia</strong> and <strong>severe ketosis</strong> as in type 1 diabetes. Autoantibodies against beta-cells are negative in these patients. </p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>MODY</strong> or maturity-onset diabetes of the young is an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> monogenic form of diabetes that occurs in patients less than <strong>25 years </strong>of age. This is due to beta-cell dysfunction that impairs insulin secretion. The patients are non-ketotic and do not have pancreatic autoantibodies.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Type 1 diabetes mellitus </strong>most commonly develops before <strong>20 years </strong>of age with most of them having evidence of <strong>islet-directed autoimmunity</strong>. Most of the patients present with <strong>hyperglycemia </strong>and <strong>ketoacidosis</strong>. There is increased lipolysis and ketone body production which results in muscle wasting, polyphagia, fatigue, and weakness.<br />In LADA, the destruction of islet cells proceeds at a much slower speed. This is why they present later, and may not require insulin treatment initially (unlike Type 1 DM). </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Comparative Features between MODY and Type 2 DM</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Type 2 DM</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>MODY</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Age of onset</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Predominantly middle to old age</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Predominantly young (&lt; 25 years)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Beta cell dysfunction</p>\n<p>Insulin resistance</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Only Beta cell dysfunction</p>\n<p>No insulin resistance</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Family history</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Positive</p>\n<p>Inheritance - Polygenic&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vertical transmission through <strong>successive generations</strong> is <strong>not essential </strong>for diagnosis</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Positive</p>\n<p>Inheritance &ndash; Monogenic / <strong>Autosomal dominant</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vertical transmission through at <strong>least two successive generation</strong> (ideally three) is <strong>essential</strong> for diagnosis</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Insulin dependence</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Non-insulin dependent</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Non-insulin dependent</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Obesity</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Common</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Uncommon</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>DKA</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Uncommon</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Uncommon</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Serum insulin level</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>High</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Low</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
