The dissection begins at the neck and slowly works its way down the body and the organ is removed as a bloc. A cut is first made at the larynx to separate the esophagus from the pharynx.

In this case, the patient&rsquo;s or attendant&rsquo;s negligence should be the direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.</p>\n<p>So, contributory negligence occurs when <strong>both the doctor and patient are negligent</strong>. The direct or proximate cause of the injury should be the patient&rsquo;s negligence, which means that if the patient was not negligent, the injury could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>Contributory negligence usually occurs when the doctor is negligent and the<strong> patient:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fails to give an accurate medical history, and as a result, the doctor may misdiagnose or mistreat the patient.</li>\n<li>Fails to follow the doctor&rsquo;s instructions</li>\n<li>Refuses to take the treatment</li>\n<li>Leaves the hospital against doctor&rsquo;s advice</li>\n<li>Does not inform the doctor or seek further medical assistance if the symptoms persist or worsens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contributory negligence is a defence </strong>for doctor&rsquo;s negligence in civil cases. However, from case to case, the liability of a doctor may vary from complete non-liability to substantial liability for the damages. Under the <strong>doctrine of comparative negligence</strong>, the court has the right to hold both parties liable for their negligent actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations / Exceptions to contributory negligence:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. The doctor will be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. The doctor failed to provide proper instructions to the patient</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and did not tell the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>no</strong> <strong>proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient develops numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is negligent</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<strong>Last clear chance doctrine: </strong>It is applicable when the doctor fails to take necessary action to prevent damage due to a negligent act of the patient, even after getting a clear chance to take such action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex: </strong>Doctor applies a tight plaster cast (<strong>doctor is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>) to the patient&rsquo;s leg and told the patient to inform if he develops any numbness (<strong>gave proper</strong> <strong>instruction</strong>). The patient developed numbness and has not informed the doctor (<strong>patient is</strong> <strong>negligent</strong>). Next day patient informed the doctor, but the doctor did not remove the cast and said he was busy (<strong>There was a clear last chance, but the doctor neglected again</strong>). After few days patient developed a permanent injury.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>B. The doctor/person will not be held guilty in the following conditions:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Avoidable consequences rule: </strong>It occurs when an injury is caused due to doctor&rsquo;s negligence, and the patient has done a negligent act, which further aggravated the injury caused by the doctor, and the patient could have avoided the consequence by not doing such act. In such cases, the<strong> doctor need not pay anything</strong>, and the<strong> patient will be held guilty</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A patient had a lacerated wound. The doctor examined the patient and had not done any dressing or provided any antibiotics (the doctor is negligent). However, the doctor instructed the patient to avoid contamination and asked him to visit the clinic next week. When the patient went home, he applied cow dung on his wound every day thinking that the wound would heal faster and didn't visit the doctor after one week. The wound got infected and developed pus and aggravated the injury.</span></li>\n<li><span>Here, <strong>despite the doctor being negligent </strong>in the first instance, the <strong>patient is responsible for his injury</strong> as he <strong>performed an unnecessary, avoidable act</strong>, which aggravated the injury. The doctor need not pay anything.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Good Samaritan doctrine: </strong>A person who assists another person who is in serious danger cannot be charged with contributory negligence. unless such assistance is reckless or rash.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Ex:</strong> A person was travelling on a road and saw a car accident, where the victim was unconscious and was stuck inside the car. He called the ambulance. The paramedical staff instructed him not to mobilize the victim until they arrived. Meanwhile, the car was caught in fire (<strong>serious danger</strong>), and the person tried to remove the victim carefully out of the car <strong>(assisted the victim and was not reckless)</strong>. However, the victim already had a cervical bone fracture due to the accident, which got mobilized while he was being removed out of the car and as a result, suffered an injury to the spine that led to paralysis (<strong>victim&rsquo;s injury was aggravated</strong>). In such a case, the good samaritan doctrine would apply and the person who tried to help, <strong>will not be charged under contributory negligence.</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",

These interfere with cellular respiration, damaging mitochondrial enzymes. It is present in&nbsp;fruit sprays, copper and gold <strong>mineral deposits</strong>, weed-killers, insecticides, rat poisons, wallpapers, and artificial flowers.</p>\n<p>There are several types of arsenic poisoning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fulminant</strong>&nbsp;- When massive doses are rapidly absorbed, death occurs in 1&ndash;3 hours due to shock and peripheral vascular failure.</li>\n<li><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong>&nbsp;- This is the most common form of acute poisoning and resembles <strong>bacterial food poisoning.</strong> There is a constriction in the throat and difficulty in swallowing. The stools are dark-colored, stinking, and bloody initially and later take a colorless odorless watery form similar to the rice-water stools of cholera.</li>\n<li><strong>Chronic </strong>poisoning - It occurs due to repeated daily exposure. The main features include <strong>finely mottled, raindrop pigmentation</strong> that appears on the skin of flexures, temples, eyelids, and neck. In prolonged contact, <strong>hyperkeratosis </strong>of the<strong> palms and soles</strong> occurs along with the development of a <strong>transverse white line in the fingernails</strong> called the&nbsp;<strong>Aldrich-Mees lines.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tests to detect arsenic poisoning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>24-hour urinary excretion of arsenic</li>\n<li>Detection of arsenic by <strong>atomic absorption spectroscopy</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Marsh</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Reinsch tests</strong> are now considered obsolete.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The preferred treatment option is freshly prepared hydrated <strong>ferric oxide</strong>, which converts toxic arsenic to non-toxic ferric arsenite. <strong>DMSA</strong> (Succimer), British anti-Lewisite (<strong>BAL</strong>), and <strong>penicillamine</strong>&nbsp;can also be used.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/09c931c4a8fe40b29a16f696d15edb50x1280x4900.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A -&nbsp;<strong>Phosphorus </strong>is an inorganic irritant poison that exists in two forms&mdash;highly toxic <strong>white phosphorus</strong> and non-toxic <strong>red phosphorus</strong>.&nbsp;The white form is used in fertilizers, insecticides, fireworks, etc., whereas the red form is seen on the sides of a matchbox.</p>\n<p>Phosphorus poisoning presents with clinical features like severe abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, hematemesis, jaundice, and hemorrhages. In chronic poisoning,&nbsp;<strong>phossy jaw</strong> may occur. It is the osteomyelitis and necrosis of the jaw with multiple sinuses discharging foul-smelling pus.</p>\n<p><strong>Gastric lavage</strong> with <strong>potassium permanganate</strong> oxidizes phosphorus into phosphoric acid and phosphates making it harmless. <strong>Activated charcoal</strong> helps in the <strong>adsorption</strong> of the poison.</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Acute copper poisoning</strong> is due to inhalation of a large amount of copper dust or fumes, which leads to <strong>upper respiratory tract irritation</strong>, conjunctivitis, and sinus irritation. Contact with the skin may lead to irritant contact dermatitis and a<strong> greenish-blue discoloration</strong> of the skin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In <strong>chronic poisoning</strong>, symptoms mostly resemble those of&nbsp;<strong>Wilson's disease</strong>, mainly including <strong>gradual anemia, peripheral neuritis</strong>, and <strong>muscle atrophy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Acute mercury poisoning</strong> presents with corrosive bronchitis with fever, chills, and dyspnea, which may progress to pulmonary edema and fibrosis. The symptom profile in children is similar to that of <strong>Kawasaki disease&nbsp;</strong>(mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome).</p>\n<p><strong>Chronic exposure</strong> to elemental mercury leads to a classic <strong>triad</strong> of <strong>gingivitis,</strong> <strong>tremors</strong>, and <strong>neuropsychiatric</strong> changes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The characteristic <strong>Danbury tremors</strong> occur first in the hands and later progress to the lips and tongue, eventually involving the arms and legs.

The most severe form is <strong>concussion mercurialis</strong> in which all activity is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Acrodynia</strong> or <strong>pink disease</strong> - It is an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction to chronic mercury exposure, seen particularly in children.
