The human colostrum is also rich in lgA antibodies and gives protection to the neonate</li>\n<li><strong>Artificial passive </strong>immunity: It is the resistance passively transferred to a recipient by the administration of antibodies.

This is followed by full course of tetanus toxoid vaccine.

By ingesting <strong>undercooked pork</strong> containing cysticerci, humans acquire infections that lead to intestinal tapeworms. Infections that cause human cysticercosis follow the ingestion of T. solium eggs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In <strong>cysticercosis</strong>, the clinical manifestations are variable. <strong>Cysticerci</strong> can be found <strong>anywhere</strong> in the body, most commonly detected in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skeletal muscle, subcutaneous tissue, or eye. Neurologic manifestations (<strong>neurocysticercosis)</strong> are the most common.

The cysticercal lesions appear as a <strong>small ring like</strong> <strong>hypodensities</strong> with a <strong>bright central spot</strong>. Clinical criteria includes detection of specific anticysticercal antibodies or cysticercal antigens by well- standardized immunodiagnostic tests. </p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>\n<p>About 70% of <strong>adult-onset epilepsy</strong> is due to neurocysticercosis.</p>\n<p>MRI of the brain in neurocysticercosis.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/eef83360be9448318ec488874710dbf2x468x455.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Commonly known names of some important parasites</h3><p><strong>a.
