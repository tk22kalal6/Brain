They are often discovered incidentally and typically remain asymptomatic. However, they become symptomatic when the stones obstruct the cystic duct. In such cases, patients may experience dull or <strong>colicky</strong> right upper quadrant or epigastric <strong>pain</strong> radiating to the back, along with symptoms like nausea and vomiting. </p>\n<p>Only about 10% of gallstones are radiopaque.<strong> Ultrasonography (USG)</strong> is the most accurate initial imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of gallbladder stones.
