It has a proximal end connected to a breathing circuit while a distal end is connected to an elliptical cuff which can be inflated through a pilot tube.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is inserted in a deflated manner following lubrication blindly into the hypopharynx. After inflation, it forms a low-pressure seal around the laryngeal entry.&nbsp;Ideally positioned cuff will have the base of the tongue superiorly and the upper esophageal sphincter inferiorly. Pyriform sinuses should be present laterally.</p>\n<p>It is <strong>indicated</strong> in cases with <strong>difficult</strong> <strong>airways</strong> where endotracheal intubation is not possible or not available.
