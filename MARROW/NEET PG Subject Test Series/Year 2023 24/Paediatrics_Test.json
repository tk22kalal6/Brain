ATP7B is the&nbsp;molecular defect seen in this patient.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wilson's disease is an&nbsp;<strong>autosomal recessive</strong>&nbsp;disorder.&nbsp;The abnormal gene for Wilson disease is present on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q14.3). It encodes<strong>&nbsp;ATP7B&nbsp;</strong>which is responsible for biliary copper excretion and for the incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. In Wilson's, copper is not incorporated into ceruloplasmin, which decreases ceruloplasmin half-life and hence<strong>&nbsp;decreased ceruloplasmin levels (&lt;20 mg/dL)&nbsp;</strong>are seen.</p>\n<p>Clinical features of Wilson disease:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hepatomegaly (with or without splenomegaly)</li>\n<li>Acute/subacute/chronic hepatitis</li>\n<li>Cirrhosis, ascites, portal hypertension</li>\n<li>Tremor, dystonia, parkinsonism, behavioral, and psychiatric changes</li>\n<li><strong>Kayser-Fleischer ring</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia</strong>&nbsp;(due to large amounts of copper released from damaged hepatocytes)</li>\n<li>Renal Fanconi syndrome</li>\n<li>Endocrinopathies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important molecule defect and disease:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ATP7A&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Menke&rsquo;s&nbsp;disease&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ATP7B&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Wilson disease&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CFTR&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Cystic fibrosis&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SERPINA 1&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&alpha;-1 antitrypsin deficiency&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ABCC2&nbsp;(MRP2 protein defect)&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Dubin&nbsp;Johnson syndrome&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
