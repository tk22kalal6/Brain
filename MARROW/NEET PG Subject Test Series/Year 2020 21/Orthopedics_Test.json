Ilizarov described this as &ldquo;<strong>the tension stress effect</strong>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The most important application of the tension-stress principle is known as&nbsp;<strong>callus distraction</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>callotaxis</strong>). A careful fracture of the bone is performed, followed by a short wait. The young callus formed is gradually distracted using a circular or unilateral external fixator.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Osteogenesis requires a dynamic state by either a controlled distraction or a controlled compression. This dynamic force causes&nbsp;<strong>dormant mesenchymal cells</strong>&nbsp;at the non-union site to differentiate into functioning osteoblasts. This results in bone synthesis and fracture healing. The&nbsp;fixation system is called a&nbsp;<strong>ring fixator</strong>.&nbsp; Distraction or compression can be applied by twisting nuts on the fixation system at the fracture or corticotomy site.&nbsp; Distraction or compression is carried out at the rate of&nbsp;<strong>1 mm per day</strong>.

When there is a spasm of the muscles, the stronger flexors pull the hip in flexion. <strong>Soft tissue contractures</strong> can convert this into a <strong>fixed flexion deformity</strong>, making locomotion impossible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Thomas test is used to evaluate the degree of flexion deformity. The aim is to <strong>eliminate compensatory lumbar lordosis</strong> and <strong>reveal the obvious flexion deformity</strong> for measurement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the test, the patient lies supine on a hard surface with legs straight. The patient may compensate for the flexion deformity by arching the lower back, creating excessive lumbar lordosis. The <strong>easy passage of the examiner's hand between the bed and the back of the patient </strong>is considered a <strong>positive test</strong> as normally this is not possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By gradually flexing the unaffected hip, the pelvis tilts and eliminates lumbar lordosis, causing the affected hip to assume the flexed position.
