It also destroys some taste and odour&nbsp;producing components. It <strong>controls algae and slime</strong> organisms and <strong>aids in coagulation</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>The action of chlorine:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid </strong>are formed when chlorine is added to water. <strong>Hypochlorous acid</strong> ionizes to form <strong>hydrogen and hypochlorite ions.</strong></li>\n<li>H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub> &rarr; HCl + HOCl<br /> HOCl &rarr; H + OCl</li>\n<li>The disinfecting action of chlorine is predominantly due to <strong>hypochlorous acid</strong>. <strong>Hypochlorous acid</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;the most<strong>&nbsp;effective</strong> form of chlorine and it is <strong>almost 70 &ndash; 80 times</strong>&nbsp;more effective than<strong>&nbsp;hypochlorite ions</strong>.</li>\n<li>Chlorine acts best in <strong>water</strong> that has a <strong>pH of around 7</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Principles of chlorination:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The water to be disinfected must be <strong>clear of turbidity</strong> as turbidity <strong>impedes efficient chlorination</strong>.</li>\n<li>The <strong>chlorine demand</strong> of water is the <strong>difference between the amount of chlorine added to the water</strong> and the <strong>amount of residual chlorine</strong> remaining at the end of a specific period of contact (usually 60 minutes) at a given temperature and pH of the water. This has to&nbsp;be estimated<strong> before&nbsp;</strong>chlorination is done.</li>\n<li>The <strong>point</strong>&nbsp;at which<strong>&nbsp;the chlorine demand </strong>of&nbsp;water&nbsp;is met is called the <strong>breakpoint</strong>. It is beyond this that<strong> residual free chlorine</strong> begins to appear.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact period</strong>&nbsp;of free chlorine for at least<strong>&nbsp;one hour</strong> is required to kill bacteria and viruses.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;<strong>Minimum recommended concentration</strong>&nbsp;of free chlorine is<strong>&nbsp;0.5 mg/litre</strong>&nbsp;for<strong>&nbsp;one hour</strong>. Free residual chlorine provides a margin of <strong>safety</strong> against <strong>microbial contamination</strong> that occurs in storage or transport.</li>\n<li>The <strong>sum</strong> of the <strong>chlorine demand</strong> of the specific water plus <strong>free residual chlorine</strong>&nbsp;of 0.5<strong> mg/litre</strong> constitutes the <strong>correct dose of chlorine</strong> to be applied.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Methods of chlorination:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chlorine gas</strong>: It is the <strong>first choice</strong> as it is <strong>cheap, quick and efficient</strong> in action, and easy to apply. Special <strong>chlorinating equipments</strong> like <strong>Paterson&rsquo;s chloronome</strong> are used for the application of chlorine gas.</li>\n<li><strong>Chloramines</strong>: These<strong>&nbsp;loose compounds of chlorine and ammonia</strong> give more persistent forms of residual chlorine. They have <strong>slow action</strong> and thus are not widely used.</li>\n<li><strong>Perchloron</strong> or <strong>high test hypochlorite (H.T.H.)</strong>: It is a <strong>calcium compound</strong> that has <strong>60 &ndash; 70% of available chlorine</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Break point chlorination:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The point at which the <strong>chlorine demand of water</strong>&nbsp;is met is called<strong>&nbsp;the breakpoint. </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Free chlorine</strong> (HOCl and OCl) appears when <strong>chlorine is added beyond the breakpoint</strong>.</li>\n<li>In other words, at the breakpoint, if chlorine is added, then <strong>all the combined chlorines</strong>&nbsp;would have been completely<strong>&nbsp;destroyed</strong> and <strong>free residual chlorines </strong>begin to&nbsp;<strong>appear</strong>.</li>\n<li>This corresponding dosage to achieve the appearance of free residual chlorine is called <strong>breakpoint dosage</strong> and this method is called <strong>breakpoint chlorination</strong>.</li>\n<li>It is also called <strong>controlled superchlorination</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Superchlorination </strong>followed by <strong>dechlorination </strong>is used to disinfect highly polluted waters whose quality fluctuates greatly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Orthotolidine (OT) test:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>It is a <strong>test for chlorination</strong> and determines <strong>free and combined chlorine</strong> in water, rapidly and accurately.</li>\n<li>The reagent used is <strong>analytical grade Orthotolidine</strong> dissolved in a 10% solution of hydrochloric acid.</li>\n<li>When added to water that contains chlorine, it turns <strong>yellow</strong> with varying intensity. This is <strong>faster</strong> in the presence of <strong>free chlorine</strong> and <strong>slower</strong> in the presence of <strong>combined chlorine</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Orthotolidine - arsenite (OTA) test:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This is a <strong>modification of the OT test</strong> which <strong>nullifies the errors</strong>&nbsp;due to interfering substances<strong>&nbsp;</strong>like <strong>iron, nitrites, manganese</strong>, etc.</li>\n<li>It determines <strong>free</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;combined chlorine separately.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Silicosis</strong> is associated with an <strong>increased risk</strong> of developing&nbsp;<strong>tuberculosis</strong>.</p>\n<p>Patients with silicosis are more prone to develop tuberculosis, a condition called <strong>silico-tuberculosis.</strong>&nbsp;This is because silica causes dysfunction of the alveolar macrophages. Patients are also at greater risk of atypical mycobacteria, and fungal infections.&nbsp;Due to this increased risk of tuberculosis, the recommended treatment of latent tuberculosis in silicosis patients is longer.</p>\n<p>Silicosis is a form of&nbsp;<strong>pneumoconiosis</strong> which is a cause of permanent disability and mortality. It occurs in people working in&nbsp;<strong>sandblasting</strong>, pottery, and ceramics industry, mining, and construction work. It occurs due to the inhalation of silica dust. The patient presents with cough, exertional dyspnea, and chest pain.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>In simple silicosis, the chest X-ray shows&nbsp;small rounded&nbsp;<strong>opacities</strong>&nbsp;in the upper lobes, and there is no impairment in lung function. When there is progressive nodular fibrosis, irregular masses &gt;1 cm are seen, referred to as complicated silicosis. When these masses enlarge further, it is called progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) and is associated with significant impairment of lung function.</p>\n<p><strong>Eggshell calcification</strong>&nbsp;of hilar lymph nodes and&nbsp;<strong>crazy paving pattern</strong>&nbsp;may be seen on HRCT.</p>\n<p>As there is no effective treatment for this condition, prevention should be done by rigorous dusting measures and regular examination of the workers.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Silicosis is categorized as a <strong>notifiable disease</strong> under the Factories Act, 1948.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Asbestosis is a form of pneumoconiosis occurring in asbestos industry workers mainly involving the basal lobes. It can be associated with <strong>mesothelioma,</strong> a form of lung malignancy on long-term exposure.</p>\n<p>Option C: Anthracosis is also known as coal worker's pneumonia and occurs in people working with coal dust. It tends to cause <strong>pulmonary fibrosis.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option D: Siderosis occurs due to prolonged exposure to <strong>iron deposits.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Some common
