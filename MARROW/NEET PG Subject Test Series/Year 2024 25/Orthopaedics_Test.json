Other high-risk injuries are crush injuries and circumferential burns.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>intra-compartmental pressure</strong>&nbsp;(ICP) is measured using a <strong>split catheter</strong> introduced into the compartment. Earlier, the ICP values alone were used to determine the critical threshold for compartment syndrome. However, it was noted that different individuals had different levels of tolerance for raised ICP.

Alternatively, skin grafting can be done.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Acute Compartment and Crush Syndromes</h3><p><strong>1. Acute Compartment Syndrome</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Acute compartment syndrome is an elevation of the intracompartmental pressure (ICP) which increases the risk for tissue ischemia and necrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Fractures (70%) and severe soft tissue injuries (30%). Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. </p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. </p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>2. Crush Syndrome </strong></p>\n<p>Crush syndrome is the systemic manifestation of muscle necrosis. It is commonly caused due to prolonged external compression of an extremity. </p>\n<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Crush injuries sustained during motor vehicle accidents, earthquakes, mining and other occupational accidents.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Underperfusion of muscle causes myonecrosis. When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",

It is not a sequela of fat embolism syndrome. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Acute compartment syndrome</strong> refers to an elevation of the intracompartmental pressure (ICP) which increases the risk for tissue ischemia and necrosis. It can occur following fractures(commonly) or soft tissue injuries and is a<strong> localized condition involving the affected limb</strong>.

This is used in limb lengthening or filling of large segmental defects in the bone.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/47ed227996da4c54b15ba2e01db8469dx1280x2560.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "<p>The clinical presentation and the x-ray showing<strong> Shepherd's crook deformity</strong> are both suggestive of <strong>fibrous dysplasia </strong>of the proximal femur. </p>\n<p>Fibrous dysplasia is a condition that affects bone development and is characterized by the replacement of the bone with fibrous tissue. It is commonly monostotic (involves a single bone), but in 20% of cases, it can be polyostotic.</p>\n<p>Clinical features:</p>\n<p>The patient presents with a progressive limb deformity or a fracture through a previously asymptomatic lesion. Presentation is often in the <strong>second decade</strong>. Other symptoms include nonspecific bone pain, tenderness, and swelling in the affected area. The commonly involved sites are the <strong>proximal femur, tibia, pelvis, and foot</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>McCune-Albright syndrome</strong>: It is characterized by <strong>polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, precocious puberty</strong>, and <strong>cafe-au-lait spots</strong> with irregular borders.</p>\n<p>Radiological findings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Well-defined, expansile intramedullary lesions</li>\n<li>Hazy, <strong>ground-glass appearance</strong> is seen in the majority of cases</li>\n<li><strong>Shepherd's crook deformity</strong> - Expansion with marked varus in the proximal femur</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<p>Bisphosphonates are used to manage bone pain. Surgical stabilization and realignment are done when there is a progressive deformity or pathological fracture. </p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Osteoid osteoma</strong> is a benign tumor formed of osteoid and woven bone surrounded by a halo of reactive bone. It is most commonly seen in the <strong>diaphysis</strong> of the <strong>proximal femur</strong>. They most often present with <strong>pain</strong> that is classically <strong>worse at night</strong> and relieved by <strong>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</strong>. Plain X-ray demonstrates an area of dense sclerosis with a small rounded area of osteolysis. The preferred treatment is <strong>CT-guided radiofrequency ablation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Chondrosarcoma</strong> is the second most common primary malignant bone tumor after osteosarcoma. It can present between the 3rd and 8th decades of life. They are <strong>slow-growing tumors</strong> that produce deep pain with an enlarging mass and arise in any bone derived from enchondral ossification. Radiographically, they appear as large, intraosseous, osteolytic tumors with irregular, granular calcifications, giving a <strong>honeycomb </strong>or <strong>popcorn </strong>appearance. CT and MRI are useful in the diagnosis. Chondrosarcoma is <strong>resistant</strong> to both <strong>chemotherapy and radiation</strong>. Surgical excision is the only treatment.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Ewing sarcoma</strong> is related to <strong>neuroectodermal tumors</strong> and arises from the mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow. The characteristic translocation involved is <strong><em>t(11:22). </em></strong>The tumor<strong> </strong>usually develops between 10 and 20 years of age and is usually located in the diaphysis of the long bones (<strong>femur-most common</strong>). Pain is followed by swelling and a low-grade fever. On radiography, a periosteal reaction with an '<strong>onion peel'</strong> appearance is seen. Treatment includes preoperative chemotherapy, wide excision, and radiotherapy, if required.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classical Radiological Appearance of Bone Tumors</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>RADIOLOGICAL APPEARANCE&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TUMORS</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Sunray appearance / Codman&rsquo;s triangle</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Osteosarcoma (but can be seen in any malignant lesion)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Onion peel appearance&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ewing&rsquo;s sarcoma (but can be seen in any malignant lesion or chronic osteomyelitis)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Soap bubble appearance&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Giant cell tumor, adamantinoma&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ground glass appearance / Shepherd's</p>\n<p>crook deformity&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fibrous dysplasia&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Patchy calcification&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Chondrogenic tumors (chondrosarcoma and chondroblastoma)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Popcorn, punctate or comma-shaped calcification</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Chondrosarcoma&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Stippled or Punctate calcification</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Chondroblastoma&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Homogeneous calcification&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Osteogenic tumors (osteosarcoma)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Fallen fragment / Trap door sign</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Simple bone cyst</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Double-density fluid levels and intra-lesional septation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Aneurysmal bone cyst</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Winking owl sign</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vertebral metastasis&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Polka dot sign / Corduroy / Jailhouse sign</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vertebral hemangioma</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Moth eaten bone</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Multiple myeloma</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Summary of Bone Tumors</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bone tumor</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Most common site</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Simple bone cyst</td>\n<td>Proximal Humeral Metaphysis</td>\n<td>&lt;20years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enchondroma</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hand bones</p>\n<p>(Metaphysis of small bones of hand)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;&amp; 5<sup>th</sup></p>\n<p>Decade</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Osteochondroma</p>\n<p>(Exostosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>Distal Femoral Metaphysis</td>\n<td>&lt;18years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Osteoid osteoma</td>\n<td>Diaphysis of Femur</td>\n<td>\n<p>2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;&amp; 3<sup>rd</sup></p>\n<p>decade</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Osteoblastoma</td>\n<td>Posterior column of vertebra</td>\n<td>\n<p>2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;&amp; 3<sup>rd</sup></p>\n<p>decade</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Osteoclastoma (GCT)</p>\n</td>\n<td>Distal femoral epiphysis</td>\n<td>\n<p>2<sup>nd</sup> -4<sup>th</sup></p>\n<p>Decade</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aneurysmal Bone Cyst</td>\n<td>Long bone Metaphysis</td>\n<td>&lt;18years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Osteosarcoma</td>\n<td>Distal Femoral Metaphysis</td>\n<td>\n<p>BIMODAL</p>\n<p>Primary- 2<sup>nd</sup> Decade Secondary-6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> Decade</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ewings sarcoma</td>\n<td>Diaphysis of Femur</td>\n<td>5-25 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chondrosarcoma</td>\n<td>Any site in the bone - mc in proximal femur</td>\n<td>3<sup>rd</sup>-5<sup>th</sup> decade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clear cell chondrosarcoma</td>\n<td>Proximal femoral epiphysis</td>\n<td>&nbsp;3<sup>rd</sup>-5<sup>th</sup> decade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adamantinoma</td>\n<td>Diaphysis of Tibia</td>\n<td>&nbsp;20-40 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Fibrous dysplasia</td>\n<td>&nbsp;The upper end of femur &gt; tibia</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1st to 3rd decade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Chordoma</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Sacrum</td>\n<td>&nbsp;5th to 7th decade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple myeloma</td>\n<td>Vertebrae</td>\n<td>5th to 7th decade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Periosteal reaction in osteosarcoma is irregular, unlike in osteomyelitis where it is smooth.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A <strong>biopsy</strong> of the tumor should <strong>always</strong> be carried out before starting treatment (statement 4). The <strong>biopsy tract</strong> has to be <strong>removed during definitive surgery</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>CT scan of the chest</strong> is also&nbsp;<strong>mandatory</strong> in all cases of osteosarcoma (statement 5) because <strong>lung metastases</strong> at the time of presentation are common.</p>\n<p><strong>Treatment </strong>is by<strong> wide excision</strong> and reconstruction&nbsp;<strong>if</strong> the tumor is <strong>resectable</strong> and there are no skip lesions. It is done after starting <strong>neoadjuvant chemotherapy</strong> for 8-12 weeks. There is <strong>no</strong> role of <strong>radiotherapy</strong> in the treatment of osteosarcoma (statement 1).&nbsp;<strong>Limb salvage</strong>&nbsp;<strong>surgeries</strong>&nbsp;are preferred over amputation.&nbsp;The principal first-line chemotherapeutic agents used in osteosarcoma are doxorubicin, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and methotrexate.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/daeaa5479a0f429cbaa6cf8c08f3e674x1280x2155.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Summary of Bone Tumors</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bone tumor</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Most common site</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Age</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Simple bone cyst</td>\n<td>Proximal Humeral Metaphysis</td>\n<td>&lt;20years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enchondroma</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hand bones</p>\n<p>(Metaphysis of small bones of hand)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;&amp; 5<sup>th</sup></p>\n<p>Decade</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Osteochondroma</p>\n<p>(Exostosis)</p>\n</td>\n<td>Distal Femoral Metaphysis</td>\n<td>&lt;18years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Osteoid osteoma</td>\n<td>Diaphysis of Femur</td>\n<td>\n<p>2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;&amp; 3<sup>rd</sup></p>\n<p>decade</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Osteoblastoma</td>\n<td>Posterior column of vertebra</td>\n<td>\n<p>2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;&amp; 3<sup>rd</sup></p>\n<p>decade</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Osteoclastoma (GCT)</p>\n</td>\n<td>Distal femoral epiphysis</td>\n<td>\n<p>2<sup>nd</sup> -4<sup>th</sup></p>\n<p>Decade</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aneurysmal Bone Cyst</td>\n<td>Long bone Metaphysis</td>\n<td>&lt;18years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Osteosarcoma</td>\n<td>Distal Femoral Metaphysis</td>\n<td>\n<p>BIMODAL</p>\n<p>Primary- 2<sup>nd</sup> Decade Secondary-6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> Decade</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ewings sarcoma</td>\n<td>Diaphysis of Femur</td>\n<td>5-25 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chondrosarcoma</td>\n<td>Any site in the bone - mc in proximal femur</td>\n<td>3<sup>rd</sup>-5<sup>th</sup> decade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clear cell chondrosarcoma</td>\n<td>Proximal femoral epiphysis</td>\n<td>&nbsp;3<sup>rd</sup>-5<sup>th</sup> decade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adamantinoma</td>\n<td>Diaphysis of Tibia</td>\n<td>&nbsp;20-40 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Fibrous dysplasia</td>\n<td>&nbsp;The upper end of femur &gt; tibia</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1st to 3rd decade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Chordoma</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Sacrum</td>\n<td>&nbsp;5th to 7th decade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple myeloma</td>\n<td>Vertebrae</td>\n<td>5th to 7th decade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
