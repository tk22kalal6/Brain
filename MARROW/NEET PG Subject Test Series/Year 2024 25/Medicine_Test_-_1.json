His pulmonary function test is likely to show a <strong>restrictive pattern</strong> corresponding to <strong>curve D</strong>.   </p>\n<p><strong>Myasthenia gravis</strong> presents with <strong>ventilatory restriction</strong> due to reduced respiratory muscle strength and shows a <strong>restrictive pattern</strong> on the flow-volume curve. It is characterized by <strong>decreased</strong> total lung capacity and vital capacity. Hence, <strong>the loop shrinks or narrows</strong> and <strong>shifts toward the right,</strong> as seen in Curve D in comparison to <strong>Curve A,</strong> which represents the <strong>normal</strong> flow-volume curve.</p>\n<p><strong>Curve B</strong> represents an <strong>obstructive pattern</strong> of the flow-volume curve in which the <strong>expiratory</strong> limb is concave upward. This is also called a <strong>scooped-out </strong>or<strong> coved </strong>pattern and is observed in conditions responsible for <strong>airflow obstruction</strong>, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. </p>\n<p>Tracheal stenosis shows a <strong>fixed upper airway obstruction pattern </strong>on the flow-volume curve, as seen in <strong>curve C</strong>.

However, two areas - <strong>Griffith's</strong> point (splenic flexure) and <strong>Sudeck's</strong> point (sigmoid flexure) are areas with decreased blood flow.

There may also be nausea, vomiting, transient diarrhoea, anorexia, and bloody stools.

The pathophysiology of TTP involves the accumulation of ultra-large multimers of von Willebrand factor as a result of decreased activity of the plasma proteases. These multimers cause MAHA.
