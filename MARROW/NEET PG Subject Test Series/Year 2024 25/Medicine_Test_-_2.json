Patients will have <strong>elevated 24-hour urinary cortisol levels</strong>; they have elevated levels of plasma cortisol, which are <strong>not suppressed by dexamethasone</strong>. If these are elevated, it confirms that the patient has elevated levels of cortisol.</p>\n<p>The next step is to evaluate if the elevated cortisol levels are due to <strong>elevated ACTH</strong> or are <strong>independent of ACTH levels</strong>. In this patient, the ACTH levels are elevated, which means that increased ACTH has caused increased production of cortisol. Increased ACTH can be due to a pituitary tumor that produces ACTH or ectopic ACTH production that is seen in tumors like bronchial or pancreatic carcinoids, medullary thyroid carcinoma, etc.</p>\n<p>The source of ACTH production can be identified using an MRI of the pituitary, a corticotropin-releasing hormone test, and a high-dose dexamethasone test. If the ACTH production is due to an adenoma in the pituitary, it responds to the administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and is <strong>suppressed by the administration of dexamethasone.</strong> In this patient, both of these <strong>tests are negative</strong>, which means that ACTH production is not from the pituitary but is due to <strong>ectopic production of ACTH. </strong>The patient has to be evaluated for underlying tumours. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7b1a8d7d4f454ac69827eaedef7700a5x1200x2435.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/67f4448b6b654c48b078f570f7512206x1280x2864.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Pituitary adenoma has elevated levels of cortisol and is normal to high ACTH levels.

It occurs either secondary to brain injury or degeneration and involves the left cerebral hemisphere to a greater extent. Both written and spoken communication are affected. Audio-visual understanding is also deranged.</p>\n<p>There is difficulty in finding words, leading to poorly understood content for the listener. These patients also find it difficult to repeat sentences and name things properly. Aphasia is diagnosed in patients with deficits in the formal aspects of language, such as word-finding, word choice, comprehension, spelling, or grammar.</p>\n<p>Many specific aphasic syndromes have been reported. The most common are <strong>Broca, Wernicke, conduction</strong>, and <strong>global</strong> aphasias.
