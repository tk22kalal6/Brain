      "solution": "<p>The disorder in the given scenario can be identified as <strong>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder </strong>(ADHD) is a neuropsychiatric condition affecting <strong>children</strong>, <strong>adolescents</strong>, and <strong>adults</strong> around the world, characterized by a pattern of <strong>diminished sustained attention</strong>, and increased impulsivity or <strong>hyperactivity</strong>. They often have significant impairment in academic functioning and social and interpersonal situations.</p>\n<p>ADHD was historically believed to be a childhood condition resulting in delayed development of impulse control that would be generally outgrown by adolescence. Over the past few decades, a significant number of adults with ADHD have been found, diagnosed, and given effective treatment. <strong>Utah</strong> <strong>Criteria</strong> for Adult Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) include retrospective diagnosis of ADHD in childhood and evidence of current impairment from ADHD symptoms in adulthood. </p>\n<p>Adults with<strong> residual illness</strong> exhibit impulsivity and attention deficit symptoms, such as <strong>trouble focusing</strong>, <strong>difficulty organizing</strong> and<strong> finishing tasks</strong>, <strong>increased distractibility</strong>, and <strong>making snap decisions</strong> without considering the repercussions. Many individuals with the illness also suffer from a secondary depressive disorder, which is linked to low self-esteem as a result of their diminished performance, which has an impact on social and professional functioning.</p>\n<p>A variety of medications and behavioural interventions are used to treat ADHD. The most widely used medications are <strong>methylphenidate</strong> and <strong>atomoxetine</strong>. A combination of medication and <strong>psychotherapy</strong> is more effective than either treatment alone.</p><p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: Patients with <strong>chronic depression</strong> will usually have low mood and loss of interest in general and this does not fit into the given scenario.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Borderline personality disorder</strong> is characterized by extraordinarily unstable affect, mood, behaviour, object relations, and self-image. Instability in affect due to a marked reactivity of mood. It is characterized by repeated suicidal behaviour, unstable interpersonal relationships, prolonged feelings of emptiness, inappropriate, intense anger, or difficulty in controlling anger. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Manic disorder</strong> is usually seen with grandiosity and other psychotic symptoms that do not fit into the given situation.</p>",

In a child with parental preferences not to start an addictive medication, <strong>atomoxetine</strong> can be used.   </p>\n<p>Pharmacotherapy is the first line of treatment for ADHD. <strong>CNS stimulants</strong> are the first-choice agents as they have shown the <strong>greatest efficacy</strong> with mild, tolerable side effects. The CNS stimulants used are dopamine agonists like <strong>methylphenidate </strong>(Option A), amphetamine salts, and <strong>dextroamphetamine</strong> (Option C). These medications have a risk of <strong>dependence</strong> and <strong>addiction</strong>. <strong>Non-stimulant</strong> medications used in the treatment of ADHD include <strong>atomoxetine</strong> (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), clonidine, and guanfacine (Alpha agonists). They are preferred in patients with a family history of addiction or patient preference. </p>\n<p><strong>Psychosocial interventions</strong> such as academic organization skills remediation, parent training, behaviour modification in the classroom and at home, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and social skills training are also used as adjuncts to pharmacotherapy.</p>\n<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a <strong>neuropsychiatric condition</strong> characterized by a pattern of <strong>diminished attention span and increased impulsivity or hyperactivity. </strong>The <strong>prefrontal cortex</strong> of the brain has been implicated in its aetiology, and <strong>dopamine</strong> is the main neurotransmitter. </p>\n<p>ADHD can begin during infancy but is usually recognised between <strong>1-3 years</strong> of age. ADHD was known as minimal brain dysfunction earlier.

      "solution": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Sublimation</strong><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>is a <strong>mature </strong>defense mechanism, unlike introjection, regression, and somatization, which are immature defense mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Sublimation</strong> is a <strong>mature</strong> defense mechanism. It means to gratify an impulse by changing the end goal from a <strong>socially objectionable</strong> one to a <strong>socially valued one</strong>. Sublimation of <strong>aggressive impulses</strong> generally takes place through <strong>games </strong>or<strong> sports</strong>. Sublimation allows instincts to be channelled and not dammed up or diverted. Hence, in sublimation, feelings are acknowledged, modified, and directed toward a socially valued/acceptable goal so that modest instinctual satisfaction is achieved.</p>\n<p><strong>Mature defense mechanisms </strong>are healthy and adaptive throughout the life cycle. They are socially adaptive and useful in the integration of personal needs and motives, social demands, and interpersonal relations. They can underlie seemingly admirable and virtuous patterns of behaviour.</p>\n<p>Other mature defense mechanisms are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anticipation</li>\n<li>Humor</li>\n<li>Altruism</li>\n<li>Asceticism</li>\n<li>Suppression</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Immature</strong> <strong>defense mechanisms</strong> are usually triggered due to anxieties related to intimacy or its loss. These mechanisms are fairly common in <strong>preadolescent</strong> years and <strong>adult</strong> character disorders. Although they are regarded as <strong>socially awkward</strong> and <strong>undesirable</strong>, improvement in interpersonal relationships and personal maturity can alleviate it. Some of the immature defense mechanisms are:</p>\n<p>Option B. <strong>Introjection </strong>involves taking up features from the <strong>external world</strong> and <strong>making</strong> them a <strong>part of oneself</strong>. Introjection of a <strong>loved object</strong> involves internalizing the characteristics of the object to ensure closeness and constant presence of the object in order to reduce the anxiety associated with separation from or loss of the object. Similarly, the introjection of a <strong>feared object</strong> involves internalizing the aggressive characteristics of the object and using it defensively to have the aggression under their control. Introjection can also take place from a <strong>sense of guilt</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C. <strong>Regression</strong> involves a return to a previous stage of development or functioning to avoid the anxieties or hostilities involved in later stages. This reflects a basic tendency to achieve instinctual gratification or to escape instinctual tension by returning to earlier modes and levels of gratification when later and more differentiated modes fail or involve intolerable conflict.</p>\n<p>Option D. In <strong>somatization,</strong> psychic derivatives are converted into bodily symptoms and tend to react to somatic symptoms rather than psychic ones.</p>\n<p>Other immature defenses include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acting out</li>\n<li>Blocking</li>\n<li>Hypochondriasis</li>\n<li>Passive–aggressive behaviour</li>\n<li>Projection (non-psychotic)</li>\n<li>Schizoid

This is followed by <strong>compensatory behaviours</strong> such as <strong>self-induced vomiting</strong>, laxative abuse, and the use of enemas. This is done to prevent weight gain. This pattern is seen at least <strong>once</strong> a<strong> week</strong> for<strong> ≥3 months</strong>. It is commonly seen in <strong>women</strong>. The weight is usually within the <strong>normal range</strong>. In some cases, the patients are obese or underweight. Sexual activity remains unaffected, unlike anorexia nervosa patients, who are usually not interested in sex.</p>\n<p>It can be treated with <strong>cognitive-behavioural therapy</strong> (CBT) and pharmacotherapy. CBT involves <strong>disrupting the cycle</strong> of repeated binge eating-purging and <strong>changing </strong>the<strong> patient's beliefs</strong> about food, body weight, and body image. Important drugs used in the treatment of bulimia nervosa are <strong>fluoxetine</strong>, imipramine, desipramine, trazodone, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Anorexia nervosa</strong> is diagnosed by the presence of <strong>restriction </strong>of<strong> food intake</strong> that leads to significantly<strong> low body weight</strong>.

This mutation results in the loss of function of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is important for normal neural development.</p>\n<p>Studies have shown that individuals with Fragile X syndrome have a significantly higher prevalence of autism traits. The symptoms can include social anxiety, communication difficulties, and repetitive behaviours—traits that overlap with those seen in ASD.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>While Turner syndrome, Down syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome can all be associated with various developmental and social challenges, Fragile X syndrome is the genetic condition that is most strongly linked to autism spectrum disorder.</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Turner Syndrome</strong> is a chromosomal condition that affects females, characterized by the absence of a part or all of a second sex chromosome (45X). Individuals with Turner syndrome may experience social difficulties and learning challenges, the overall association with ASD is weaker compared to Fragile X syndrome. The incidence of autism in Turner syndrome is not as prevalent.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Down syndrome</strong>, also known as trisomy 21, is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21. It is characterized by intellectual disability, distinct facial features, and a higher risk of certain medical conditions. Individuals with Down syndrome can exhibit autism-like behaviours, the prevalence of ASD is however lower than that found in individuals with Fragile X syndrome. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Klinefelter syndrome</strong> occurs in males with an extra X chromosome (47XXY). It can lead to various physical and developmental challenges, including infertility and learning difficulties. There is some evidence to suggest that males with Klinefelter syndrome may have a higher risk of developmental delays and social difficulties.

The aetiology is complex, with genetic and potentially environmental and perinatal contributions. It predominantly affects<strong> boys</strong> after <strong>3 years</strong> of age. It is usually <strong>not</strong> associated with <strong>mental retardation,</strong> and a <strong>normal IQ</strong>, along with competencies in social skills, is considered a <strong>good prognostic</strong> factor.</p>\n<p>Asperger syndrome is characterised by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impairment</strong> in <strong>social interaction</strong> and development:\n<ul>\n<li>markedly <strong>abnormal nonverbal communicative gestures</strong></li>\n<li>failure to develop peer relationships at the expected level</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Restricted interests</strong> and patterns of behaviour</li>\n<li><strong>No significant delay</strong> in <strong>language</strong>, clinically significant <strong>cognitive</strong> delay, or adaptive impairment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment of Asperger's syndrome involves promoting social communication and peer relationships. Very often, these children are highly verbal and have excellent academic achievement. To help these individuals in social and work settings, <strong>self-sufficiency</strong> and <strong>problem-solving techniques</strong> can be utilised.</p>\n<p>As per the current updates (DSM-5), <strong>autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</strong> includes several conditions that are characterized by early onset of severe delay in the development of social and communicative skills and also unusual responses to the environment.</p>\n<p>The <strong>diagnostic criteria</strong> for autism spectrum disorder are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Persistent deficits</strong> in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts</li>\n<li><strong>Restricted, repetitive patterns</strong> of behaviour, interests, or activities</li>\n<li>Symptoms must be present in the <strong>early developmental period</strong></li>\n<li>Symptoms cause clinically <strong>significant impairment</strong> in social, occupational, or other important areas of social functioning</li>\n<li>These disturbances are <strong>not</strong> better explained by <strong>intellectual disability</strong> or <strong>global developmental delay.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Rett’s syndrome</strong> is seen <strong>exclusively</strong> in <strong>girls</strong>, where <strong>deterioration</strong> of developmental <strong>milestones</strong>, <strong>head circumference</strong>, and overall growth occurs after <strong>5 months</strong> of age. The absence of such a history of deterioration from previous normal development, along with the absence of other characteristic features of Rett's syndrome like- <strong>stereotypic motions</strong> (eg-hand wringing), poor coordination, <strong>ataxia</strong>, <strong>complete loss</strong> of <strong>verbal</strong> abilities, <strong>respiratory difficulties</strong>, and <strong>seizures </strong>makes a diagnosis of Rett syndrome unlikely.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Options C &amp; D:<strong> Heller syndrome/Childhood disintegrative disorder,</strong> occurring between the ages of <strong>3–5 years, </strong>is characterized by a significant developmental regression after a period of <strong>normal development </strong>for<strong> at least two years</strong>. This results in a <strong>deterioration</strong> of<strong> behavioural</strong> and<strong> adaptive functioning,</strong> including self-help skills, with <strong>loss of language </strong>and<strong> social skills, </strong>along with <strong>stereotyped movements</strong> and <strong>compulsive</strong> behaviour.

      "solution": "<p>The given history of long-standing suspiciousness, not trusting people,<strong> </strong>and bearing grudges for insults is suggestive of <strong>paranoid personality disorder.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Paranoid personality disorder</strong>, a part of <strong>cluster A</strong> personality disorders, is characterized by pervasive<strong> suspiciousness and mistrust</strong> in all interpersonal relationships. They are excessively fearful of <strong>perceived threats</strong> and deceit and often read hidden demeaning or <strong>threatening meanings</strong> into benign remarks. They are <strong>reluctant to</strong> <strong>confide</strong> in others due to the fear that the information they provide will be used against them maliciously.</p>\n<p>They tend to be <strong>extremely jealous,</strong> <strong>hostile, argumentative,</strong> and <strong>defensive</strong>. Their paranoia prevents them from establishing any overly involved relationship. They persistently <strong>bear grudges</strong> and can get irritable and angry easily. They use the defense mechanism of <strong>projection</strong> by displacing their insecurities on others. </p>\n<p>They may not be willing to accept that they need psychiatric help. <strong>Psychotherapy</strong> is the treatment of choice. Care should be taken by the therapist to <strong>not behave defensively</strong> if accused of making a mistake. <strong>Pharmacotherapy</strong> is generally used to deal with anxiety and agitation. <strong>Diazepam</strong> is used as an anxiolytic, while antipsychotics like <strong>haloperidol</strong> or <strong>pimozide</strong> may be required to deal with agitation.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Individuals with <strong>schizoid personality disorder</strong> are usually <strong>eccentric and isolated</strong>. They neither desire nor enjoy close relationships. They always choose to be <strong>alone and lack close friends. </strong>They are <strong>emotionally cold</strong> and appear<strong> indifferent</strong> to praise or criticism.</p>\n<p>Option B: Individuals with <strong>schizotypal personality disorder</strong> appear odd and strange to surrounding people. They have <strong>ideas of reference, odd or magical thinking</strong>, <strong>inappropriate or constricted affect</strong>, and suspiciousness.</p>\n<p>Option D: Individuals with <strong>histrionic personality disorder </strong>have <strong>excessive emotional </strong>and<strong> attention-seeking behaviour</strong>. They are uncomfortable in situations where they are not the centre of attraction. They also have inappropriate, sexually seductive, or provocative behaviour. They try to use their physical appearance to draw others' attention.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Personality Disorders</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Key features of Personality disorders</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Cluster A (Odd, Weird, Eccentric)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Paranoid</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Suspicious, distrustful, hypervigilant</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Schizoid</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Prefers to be loner, detached, unemotional</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Schizotypal</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Eccentric &amp; odd thoughts, perceptions &amp; behavior, magical thinking and beliefs</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Cluster B (Dramatic, Emotional and Erratic)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Antisocial</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Disregard for and violation of rights of others, illegal activities</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Borderline</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Chaotic relationships, sensitivity to abandonment, labile mood, impulsivity, inner emptiness, self-harm</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Histrionic</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Dramatic, superficial, attention-seeking</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Narcissistic</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Grandiosity, lack of empathy</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>Cluster C (Anxious, Fearful, Introvert)</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Avoidant</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Avoidance due to fears of criticism and rejection</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Dependent</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Submissive, clingy, needs to be taken care of</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span>Obsessive-compulsive/</span></div>\n<div><span>Anankastic</span></div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Rigid, controlling, perfectionist</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The affected mothers are <strong>emotionally labile</strong> and the symptoms include changes in mood, <strong>sudden crying outbursts</strong>, and a <strong>lack </strong>of<strong> interest</strong> in the<strong> baby</strong>. They may also have insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and irritability.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These feelings have been ascribed to rapid changes in women's hormonal levels, the stress of childbirth, and the awareness of the increased responsibility that motherhood brings. This usually <strong>resolves spontaneously</strong> within <strong>10-14 days</strong>. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Management involves <strong>reassurance, education, </strong>and <strong>support.</strong> The patient must be followed-up and assessed for the possible development of a major depressive disorder.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option B: Symptoms should<strong> persist </strong>for<strong> &gt;2 weeks</strong> to make the diagnosis of <strong>post-partum depression.</strong> A <strong>minimum</strong> of <strong>5 symptoms</strong> of major depressive disorder i.e. impaired sleep, interest, guilt, energy, concentration, appetite, psychomotor activity, and suicidal ideation must be present.

The predominant symptoms are <strong>hallucinations</strong>, <strong>delusions</strong>, <strong>suicidal</strong> <strong>thoughts</strong>, and<strong> thoughts</strong> of <strong>harming </strong>the <strong>baby</strong>. The onset of psychotic symptoms is usually preceded by signs such as insomnia, restlessness, labile mood, and agitation. <strong>Lithium</strong>, often in combina­tion with an <strong>antidepressant</strong>, is the treatment of choice.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Option D: Episodes of <strong>delirium </strong>in the <strong>postpartum period</strong> are characterized by a <strong>fluctuating</strong> <strong>level</strong> of <strong>awareness</strong> or attention.
