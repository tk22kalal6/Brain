      "solution": "<p>The first line intervention for a symptomatic varicocele is <strong>percutaneous embolisation of gonadal veins.</strong></p>\n<p>That patient presents with classic symptoms of <strong>varicocele</strong>-<strong>dragging discomfort in the scrotum,</strong> which, on palpation, feels like a <strong>bag of worms</strong>. When the discomfort is significant, then <strong>percutaneous embolisation of the gonadal veins</strong> is the usual <strong>first-line intervention</strong>. If this is not possible, or if the varicocele recurs (as it does in around 20% after embolisation), then <strong>surgical ligation of the testicular veins</strong> (Option B) is the appropriate treatment, although recurrence can occur even after such surgery.</p>\n<p>Percutaneous embolisation is typically done under local anaesthesia as an outpatient procedure. Through a tiny skin incision, a small catheter (tube) is inserted into the varicocele vein under X-ray guidance. A tiny quantity of contrast, or X-ray dye, is injected to verify the catheter's location. Subsequently, small balloons, platinum or stainless steel coils, or other materials are introduced into the vein. They are employed to obstruct it and terminate the varicocele's pressure or backflow. The catheter is taken out after establishing that there is no flow in the affected vein.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Plication </strong>(Lord’s) is performed in a case of <strong>Hydrocele</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Aspiration and Excision</strong> are performed for <strong>Epididymal cyst</strong> and <strong>Spermatocele</strong>.</p>",

It is present in the scrotum and occasionally jumps to lie in the inguinal canal. They are more common than true undescended testes. The scrotum of a boy with such a retractile testis is normal.</p>\n<p>Therefore, any stimulation of the skin of the scrotum or thigh causes the testis to ascend and temporarily disappear into the inguinal canal.

Germ cell tumors can be classified as either seminomatous or nonseminomatous. Seminoma constitutes more than 50% of all testicular cancers. </p>\n<p>Most patients present with testicular pain or a testicular mass. Respiratory symptoms, back pain, weight loss, or gynecomastia may indicate metastatic disease (10–20%). A testicular mass is considered malignant till proven otherwise. Similarly, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy in young men should be considered metastatic testicular cancer. </p>\n<p>The gold standard for the excision of a primary testicular tumor is a <strong>radical inguinal orchiectomy</strong> (Option A). A partial orchiectomy via an inguinal route may be considered in certain circumstances, such as lymphomas. <strong>Chest and abdominal axial imaging are </strong>the main<strong> staging </strong>tools<strong> </strong>for testicular tumors. The spread of testicular cancer follows an extremely predictable pattern. The interaortocaval lymph node is typically the first site of metastasis for right testicular cancer, followed by the paracaval and paraaortic lymph nodes. Left-sided testicular cancer rarely crosses to the paracaval lymph nodes. Tumor markers, distant metastases, and local stages are all included in clinical TNM staging.</p>\n<p><strong>P</strong><strong>ercutaneous testicular biopsy</strong>(Option 3) is contraindicated due to the <strong>risk of seeding</strong> in the scrotal wall. An open testicular biopsy by delivery of the testicle through the inguinal canal is recommended in cases where metastatic disease to the testicle is suspected. <strong>Recurrence </strong>usually occurs within the<strong> first two years </strong>and in the<strong> retroperitoneum</strong>(Option 4).</p>",

The <strong>lower</strong> pole <strong>ureter</strong> is associated with vesicoureteric reflux <strong>(VUR)</strong> due to its insertion into the bladder through a <strong>short</strong>&nbsp;<strong>submucosal tunnel.</strong> The <strong>upper</strong> pole <strong>ureter</strong> commonly gets in <strong>obstructed</strong> resulting in scarring.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Often, the ureter that supplies the upper half of the kidney becomes obstructed. If the upper pole collecting system of the kidney is completely obstructed, only the normally draining lower pole collecting system is visualized on the <strong>intravenous urogram</strong> and it looks like a <strong>drooping lily.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The condition is <strong>asymptomatic</strong> in <strong>adults</strong> while <strong>children</strong> have <strong>VUR.</strong> Females are more commonly affected. <strong>Voiding</strong> is <strong>normal</strong> but <strong>prolonged dribbling</strong> of urine is seen.</p>\n<p>According to Weigart Meyer's rule of congenital complete duplication of the ureter:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ureter draining the <strong>upper segment</strong> of the kidney inserts in the bladder<strong> inferior </strong>and<strong> medial</strong> to the ureter draining the lower segment of the kidney (Weigert&ndash;Meyer rule). The<strong> lower moiety</strong> of the completely duplicated system is generally <strong>normal.</strong>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>In case of an incomplete duplication, there is only one ureteric orifice on that side of the bladder.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/84d5a6cbf7424571a50b77ecb558926fx1280x1588.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Ureteropelvic junction obstruction in a patient with duplicated collecting system can be managed with laparoscopic procedures such as&nbsp;<strong>pyeloplasty.&nbsp;</strong>Other options include a partial or complete nephrectomy.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: IVU signs and associated conditions</h3><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Medullary sponge kidney</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bouquet of flowers/ paintbrush appearance</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">It refers to the cystic dilatation of the distal collecting tubules</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8f2786a330a940aaa19ecbbf32156f4dx510x542.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Duplex kidney</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Drooping lily sign</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It refers to the inferolateral displacement of the lower pole due to an obstructed upper pole in a duplicated collecting system</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/05ef8241719949f8a3949f3fdd38676ax510x514.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Horseshoe kidney</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Handshake sign - due to the position of the lower poles closer to the spine, and the lower calyces closer to each other</li>\n<li>Flower vase sign - due to medially rotated calyces</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c72498faeb6a49d19adfabbc4b79e00bx510x615.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Retroperitoneal fibrosis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Maiden waist deformity&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It refers to the medially drawn ureters caused by fibrosis at the lumbosacral junction</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/12454083a31f4e26b5ef692f0ea8de70x1280x827.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Retrocaval ureter&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Fish hook / Reverse J deformity&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Right ureter hooks behind the IVC as it passes posterior to it</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f9fbf9d4e5544ea9a2ce4ebddc1adfeax510x610.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Ureterocele</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Cobra/ Adder head appearance</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It refers to the dilation of the distal ureter</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/903af92cf55f4e3aa983cf7e7e256e3ax1280x827.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>Transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Goblet sign</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It is due to the focal dilation of the ureter by an intraluminal mass</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0f65ba8b0a8943e2ade74d16de10d077x510x542.GIF\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",
