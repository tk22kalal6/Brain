      "solution": "<p>x and y descents are prominent in constructive pericarditis (blue arrows). Constrictive pericarditis is a disorder in which the pericardium is abnormal and inelastic. This thickened and rigid pericardium limits the complete filling of the ventricles in diastole by restricting the normal diastolic ventricular expansion. The pressures in all the chambers of the heart are elevated due to this external compression. The JVP is elevated as it reflects the right atrial pressures. Normally,</p>\n<p><strong>X-descent: Occurs due to relaxation of the right atrium during atrial diastole</strong>, it follows the 'a' wave which coincides with atrial contraction.</p>\n<p><strong>Y-descent: Occurs due to right ventricular filling</strong>; As blood moves from the right atrium to the ventricle, right atrial pressure drops.</p>\n<p><strong>Friedrich's sign</strong> describes a steep x/y descent seen in Pericarditis (although, in reality at the bedside, the waves are hard to discern)</p>\n<p>Constrictive pericarditis has a chronic pathophysiology and develops slowly allowing the heart to develop compensatory mechanisms allowing 70-80% of the normal ventricular diastolic filing to occur in 25-30% of the diastolic duration leading to the rapid y descent. Although, rapid x descents occur in both constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tamponade, y-descent is not prominent in cardiac tamponade because tamponade occurs rapidly and impedes ventricular filing almost completely. It is a fatal condition requiring immediate treatment.</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/0a36ab60f5e44641a78607aa4aa49d6fx750x262.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

At that stage, the QRS complex begins to widen and the P wave amplitude decreases. Complete loss of observed P waves may occur. In that situation, sinus rhythm typically persists but the P wave amplitude is so small that it is not recorded on the surface ECG. Very marked hyperkalemia leads to asystole, sometimes preceded by a slow undulatory (sinusoidal wave) pattern on the ECG caused by marked QRS widening.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/9d4668f408a54cdb82ac1b1bd0627630x491x360.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Hypokalemia, in contrast, is associated with hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and increased action potential duration.
