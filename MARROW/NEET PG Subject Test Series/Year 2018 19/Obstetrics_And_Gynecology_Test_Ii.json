By the third month, this side of the chorion becomes smooth, and is called the<strong> chorion laeve.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e0e416fc1ec94ddb89d83ced476326a7x1280x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>As the fetus grows, the<strong>&nbsp;chorion laeve</strong> comes into contact with the <strong>decidua parietalis</strong> on the opposite side of the uterus, and <strong>fusion</strong> occurs. Thus, the <strong>uterine lumen</strong> is <strong>obliterated</strong>.&nbsp;The amnion and chorion fuse, to form the amniochorionic membrane. Rupture of the amniochorionic membrane during labor is called 'breaking of waters'.</p>\n<p>Note: Superfetation can theoretically occur till the time the uterine lumen is not obliterated.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f49aef412d834055a26c8e026e177f72x1280x2202.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
