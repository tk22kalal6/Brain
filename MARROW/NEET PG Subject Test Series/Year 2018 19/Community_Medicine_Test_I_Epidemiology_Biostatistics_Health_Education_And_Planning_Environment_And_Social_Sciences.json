Examples include <strong>male/female</strong>, black/white, or red/green. No order or ratio from the data is implied. Nominal data that falls exclusively into two groups is known as <strong>dichotomous data</strong>. A, B, O blood groups can be clearly divided into qualitative groups and hence can be measured on a nominal scale.</p>\n<p><strong>Ordinal scale data</strong> holds meaning when it is placed in a <strong>particular order</strong>. An example is the ranking of students in a class. But, there is no information about the interval size. This means that the difference between the marks of the first and second students may or may not be the same as the difference between the second and third. An example is the <strong>Glasgow coma scale </strong>and <strong>Child-Pugh score</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Interval scale data</strong> is similar to ordinal data because it can be placed in a meaningful order. Additionally, they have meaningful <strong>intervals</strong> between the items, usually <strong>measurable quantities</strong>. For example, the difference between 100° and 90° is the same as that between 50° and 40° on the temperature scale. But these scales do not have absolute zeroes, which makes ratios between the items meaningless. </p>\n<p><strong>Ratio scale data</strong> have similar properties to interval scale data. In addition, they have an <strong>absolute zero</strong>. Most biomedical variables can be measured on a ratio scale. Examples are weight in pounds or grams, pulse rate in beats/minute, and blood pressure in millimeters of mercury.
