It can occur in injuries to the spinal cord and after a thalamocortical stroke. It is also associated with <strong>complex regional pain syndromes </strong>(CRPS), multiple sclerosis, migraine, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyperalgesia</strong> is the augmented response to a stimulus that is usually painful (noxious stimulus). It can also accompany spinal cord injuries and CRPS.</li>\n<li><strong>Dysesthesia</strong> is an <strong>abnormal, unpleasant sensation</strong>, either spontaneous or evoked. For example, when pressure causes burning pain. This is not to be confused with <strong>paresthesia</strong>, which is a <strong>abnormal but not unpleasant</strong> <strong>sensation</strong>, either spontaneous or evoked. For example, when rubbing gently gives the sensation of pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased sensory experience</strong> with a stimulus is called <strong>hyperesthesia.</strong></li>\n</ul>",
