      "solution": "<p><strong>Gettler test</strong> is done for<strong> drowning</strong>. It estimates the <strong>chloride content </strong>of<strong> blood </strong>from <strong>both sides of the heart</strong>.</p>\n<p>Normally, chloride content is equal in the right and left chambers of the heart (approx. 600 mg/100 ml). In<strong> freshwater drowning</strong>, due to <strong>hemodilution</strong>, the chloride content is<strong> decreased on the left side o</strong>f the heart by<strong> 50%</strong>.<strong> </strong>In<strong> saltwater drowning</strong> due to <strong>hemoconcentration</strong>, the chloride content is<strong> increased </strong>in the<strong> left side </strong>of the heart by <strong>30-40%</strong>.</p>\n<p>This test is said to be <strong>negative </strong>in<strong> post-mortem drowning</strong>. </p>\n<p>Limitations of the test:</p>\n<p>No value in atypical drowning, or congenital cardiac defects, if the drowning medium contains the same amount of chloride. There is a progressive loss of chlorine from blood after death. Therefore, the test has to be made within a reasonably short time after death.</p><p><strong>Drowning:</strong></p>\n<p>Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid. <strong>Accidental drowning is the most common</strong> form of drowning, seen among fishermen, bathers, dock workers, intoxicated, and epileptics.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong></p>\n<p>In cases of seawater drowning, <strong>hypernatremia</strong> and <strong>myocardial anoxia</strong> are seen. Seawater being <strong>hypertonic</strong> to plasma causes a shift of fluid from the blood to alveoli causing pulmonary edema. There is a net decrease in blood volume causing <strong>hemoconcentration</strong> and a fall in blood pressure.</p>\n<p>This hemoconcentration in seawater drowning causes increased viscosity of blood and <strong>myocardial anoxia </strong>leading to heart failure. Hyperkalemia is not seen in seawater drowning because RBCs get shrunken in contrast to freshwater drowning.</p>\n<p><strong>Freshwater is hypotonic</strong> to plasma and is rapidly absorbed from the alveoli into the RBCs resulting in <strong>hemodilution</strong> and <strong>hyponatremia</strong>. The RBCs finally swell up and lyse resulting in the release of intracellular potassium causing <strong>hyperkalemia</strong>. Increased intravascular blood volume combined with hyperkalemia causes <strong>arrhythmia</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Autopsy findings in drowning:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Froth in the air passages</strong> - The most useful autopsy sign in drowning. It consists of a proteinaceous exudate and surfactant mixed with the water of the drowning medium.</li>\n<li><strong>Waterlogging of the lung</strong> - Frothy fluid will exude from the bronchi when the lung is squeezed or when sectioned with a knife. </li>\n<li><strong>Emphysema aqueosum</strong> - Overinflation of the lungs.</li>\n<li><strong>Paltauf’s spots</strong> - Subpleural hemorrhages due to rupture of alveolar walls</li>\n<li>Dilation of the right heart and great veins - This is a very subjective and non-specific finding.</li>\n<li><strong>Foreign material in the stomach</strong> - The stomach may contain watery fluid or even foreign material from the water, such as silt, weed, or sand. </li>\n<li><strong>Hemorrhage into the middle ears</strong> and into the <strong>temporal bone</strong> - This has been postulated as a positive sign of drowning, but it is a non-specific finding.</li>\n<li>Presence of <strong>fluid in the middle ear</strong> or paranasal sinuses - Also not a reliable diagnostic sign of drowning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, the autopsy findings in drowning are mostly nonspecific and none give conclusive evidence of drowning.
