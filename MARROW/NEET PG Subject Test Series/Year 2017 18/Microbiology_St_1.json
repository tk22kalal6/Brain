      "solution": "<p>The method used for the <strong>isolation of the bacteria </strong>is <strong>streak culture</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Streak culture</strong> is routinely used for the <strong>isolation</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>bacteria</strong> in pure culture from clinical specimens. It is prepared by picking the specimen using platinum loops or straight wires and transferring it onto a well-dried plate. The inoculum is then distributed thinly over the plate by streaking it with the loop in a series of parallel lines in different segments of the plate. </p>\n<p>Other methods used in bacterial culture:</p>\n<p><strong>Lawn culture/carpet culture</strong>: It is used for <strong>bacteriophage</strong> <strong>typing</strong> and <strong>antibiotic</strong> <strong>sensitivity</strong> testing. It is prepared by flooding the surface of the plate with a liquid culture.</p>\n<p><strong>Stab culture</strong> is prepared by puncturing a suitable medium with a <strong>long, straight, charged wire</strong>. The <strong>oxygen-requiring bacteria</strong> will grow on the <strong>surface</strong>, and the bacteria that do not require oxygen will grow at the bottom.</p>\n<p><strong>Stroke culture</strong>: It provides pure growth of bacterium for slide agglutination and other diagnostic tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Pour plate culture</strong>: It gives an estimate of <strong>viable bacterial count</strong> in a suspension. It is prepared by adding appropriate dilutions of the inoculum (1 ml) to the molten (40-45°C) agar, which is mixed and poured into sterile Petri dishes. After incubation, colonies are seen to be distributed throughout the depth of the medium. </p>\n<p><strong>Liquid culture</strong>: These are preferred for <strong>inocula containing antibiotics</strong> and other inhibitory substances. It is prepared by inoculating liquid cultures in tubes, bottles, or flasks by touching them with a charged loop, pipettes, or syringes. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e64cfd0a5fae4677866d86de0cace7d6x1280x7594.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

The antibodies produced there <strong>inhibit</strong> the multiplication and shedding of <strong>wild&nbsp;</strong>(naturally occurring)<strong> virus</strong>.

This may also develop the capacity for sustained circulation among the community, and is known as a <strong>circulating VDPV (cVDPV)</strong>.
