Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. On the passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited.&nbsp;</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paresthesia:&nbsp;</strong>Paresthesia and hypoesthesia may be noted due to compression of nerves traversing the affected compartment.

The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paralysis:</strong>&nbsp;Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a <strong>late sign</strong>.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pulselessness:&nbsp;</strong>Usually, the peripheral pulses and&nbsp;capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury.

In the case of compartment syndrome in the leg, <strong>Fasciotomy</strong> means opening all four compartments (anterior, lateral, deep posterior and superficial compartments).

There is no hemolysis or underlying liver disease.

The culture medium depicted in the given image is the <strong>Castenada biphasic medium</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brucella are small, non-motile, aerobic, capnophilic <strong>coccobacilli</strong>. The most important species that are pathologic to humans are <strong>B.melitensis, B. suis,&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> B.abortus.</strong></p>\n<p>Brucellosis is a <strong>zoonosis</strong>. It is transmitted to humans from contact with or consumption of contaminated products from goats, sheep, cattle, buffaloes, pigs, and other animals.</p>\n<p>Once the infection is transmitted, these bacteria&nbsp;resist intracellular digestion and proliferate within the<strong> reticuloendothelial</strong> system for a long time. This is the reason why brucellosis often becomes chronic and is resistant to simple antimicrobial therapy. The host immune response is mainly cell-mediated involving activated macrophages, helper T-cells, and mediators such as TNF alpha, TNF gamma, IL-1, and IL-12.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clinically, patients may present with an acute infection comprised of <strong>undulant fever, </strong>as in this patient, characterized by a rising and falling fever. They may also have&nbsp;arthralgia, muscular pain,&nbsp;sweating, loss of weight, and appetite.

Preferred method and medium of culture includes the<strong> Castaneda method</strong>. It is a biphasic medium. The solid component is the agar slant and the liquid is the broth. The medium is inoculated with the specimen and incubated for four days in an upright position. Serial subcultures can be obtained by slanting the broth over the agar periodically to inoculate new colonies.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Serological methods include <strong>standard agglutination test</strong> (SAT),&nbsp;<strong>complement fixation test,</strong> <strong>Coomb&rsquo;s antiglobulin test</strong>, and <strong>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</strong> (ELISA). Cut-offs for significant titers are variable depending on the endemicity. Endemic areas or history of laboratory exposure require&nbsp;agglutinin titers of 1:320&ndash;1:640 or higher and in nonendemic areas, a titer of more than or equal to 1:160 is considered diagnostic.</li>\n<li>Tests for animals and animal products include tests such as the&nbsp;<strong>milk ring tests</strong> and <strong>Rose Bengal card</strong> tests.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milk ring test</strong>- A sample of milk is mixed well with hematoxylin stained brucella antigen and incubated. If the sample contains antibodies to brucella antigens, agglutination occurs with the agglutinate rising to the top as a<strong> blue ring</strong>. If&nbsp;the sample does not contain antibodies to brucella antigens, the whole of the sample is uniformly stained blue.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment includes antimicrobial therapy with at least two agents for six weeks duration. The preferred combination is IM <strong>streptomycin</strong> 0.75-1g per day for two to three weeks along with <strong>doxycycline</strong> 100mg BD for six weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 1241\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Prevention of Brucellosis is important by screening and abiding by safety standards in farms and dairy industries, and also by <strong>pasteurization</strong> of milk and milk products.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
