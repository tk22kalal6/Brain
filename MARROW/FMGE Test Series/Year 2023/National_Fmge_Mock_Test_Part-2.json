      "solution": "<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong> (OCD) is<strong> commonly associated</strong> with <strong>depression</strong>. The lifetime <strong>prevalence</strong> of major depressive disorder in patients with OCD is <strong>67%</strong>. Other common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with OCD are social phobia, alcohol use disorders, panic, and personality disorders.</p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) comprises symptoms that include intrusive thoughts, preoccupations, and compulsions. These recurrent obses&shy;sions or compulsions cause severe distress to the patient. The patient might have an obsession, a compulsion, or both. The prevalence of OCD among the general population is <strong>2-3 %</strong></span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">An <strong>obsession</strong> is a <strong>thought</strong>, feeling, or sensation that is repetitive and intrusive.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;A&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">compulsion</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;is a conscious, recurrent <strong>behaviour</strong>, eg: counting, or checking, and is done to reduce the anxiety associated with the obsession. However, this act may not reduce the anxiety and might increase the anxiety even more.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Symptom patterns:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Contamination</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;- This is the <strong>most common</strong> symptom pattern of OCD.&nbsp; The patient feels that the objects are contaminated. They repeatedly wash their hands or avoid touching objects which are thought to be contaminated. In extreme cases, patients may rub the skin off their hands due to excessive hand washing or may refuse to leave the house for fear of germs.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pathological doubt</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;- This is the <strong>second most common</strong> symptom pattern. The patient presents with an obsession with doubt and a compulsion to check. This obsession arises due to possible danger or violence (e.g., forgetting to turn off&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">the stove or not locking a door) which is followed by multiple trips to check. For example, repeated checking if the stove is turned off, if the door is locked, etc.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Intrusive thoughts</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;-This is the <strong>third most common</strong> symptom pattern. These patients have intrusive obsessional thoughts without compulsion. These thoughts could be sexual or an aggressive act that the patient doesn't agree with. The patients might report themselves to the police or confess to a spiritual leader.</span></li>\n<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Symmetry</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;- This is the fourth most common pattern which can lead to a compulsion of slowness.

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario suggests a diagnosis of <strong>MEN 1 syndrome</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple endocrine neoplasia</strong> (MEN) syndromes are characterized by tumors of two or more endocrine glands. There are <strong>four major types</strong> of MEN (MEN 1&ndash;4), and they either show an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> pattern of inheritance or occur sporadically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>MEN 1</strong>,&nbsp;also known as <strong>Wermer&rsquo;s syndrome</strong>,&nbsp;is characterized by the triad of <strong>parathyroid</strong>, <strong>pancreatic islet cell</strong>, and <strong>anterior pituitary&nbsp;</strong><strong>tumors</strong>. Adrenal cortical tumors, carcinoid tumors, facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, thyroid tumors, and lipomas may also occur. MEN 1-associated tumors are usually multiple, larger, and more aggressive, resulting in resistance to treatment and poor patient outcomes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Parathyroid tumors-</strong>&nbsp;<strong>primary hyperparathyroidism</strong> is the <strong>most common</strong> feature of MEN 1. <strong>Hypercalcemia</strong> with or without symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, dyspepsia), nephrolithiasis, and osteitis fibrosa cystica may also occur.&nbsp;All four parathyroid glands are usually affected with multiple adenomas or hyperplasia.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Pancreatic islet cell tumors-</strong>&nbsp;these are <strong>neuroendocrine tumors</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gastrinoma</strong> (gastrin-secreting tumors)- associated with increased gastric acid secretion and multiple peptic ulcers (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Patients may present with diarrhea and steatorrhea. Gastrinomas are the<strong> major cause</strong> of <strong>mortality</strong> and morbidity.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Insulinoma</strong>&nbsp;(insulin-secreting tumors)- patients present with <strong>hypoglycemic symptoms</strong> (weakness, headaches, sweating, seizures, weight gain) that develop after fasting or exertion and improve after glucose intake. Along with increased plasma insulin levels and hypoglycemia, increased C peptide and proinsulin levels help in diagnosing the condition.</li>\n<li><strong>Glucagonoma</strong>&nbsp;(glucagon-secreting tumors)- may be associated with necrolytic migratory erythema, weight loss, anemia, and stomatitis.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>VIPomas</strong> (Vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIP]-secreting tumors): The VIPoma syndrome, also known as Verner-Morrison syndrome, is characterized by watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria. These are mostly located in the <strong>tail</strong> of the <strong>pancreas</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>PPomas</strong> (Pancreatic polypeptide-secreting tumors) and <strong>nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors-</strong>&nbsp;are associated with a <strong>worse prognosis</strong> as they often go undiagnosed due to the absence of both clinical features and biochemical abnormalities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pituitary tumors-</strong>&nbsp;manifestations depend on the hormone secreted (symptoms of&nbsp;hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, or Cushing&rsquo;s disease) and tumor size (visual disturbances or hypopituitarism due to compression of the optic chiasm or normal pituitary tissue).&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Surgical excision</strong> of the nonmetastatic tumor after localization is the <strong>curative treatment</strong>. Appropriate medical therapy can be used for some tumors when surgery is contraindicated or unsuccessful (calcimemetics for parathyroid tumors, parietal cell H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitors for gastrinomas). In case of metastasis, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, and artery embolization may be successful.</p>\n<p>MEN 1 occurs due to a mutation in the <em>MEN1&nbsp;</em>gene located on <strong>chromosome 11q13</strong>. Mutational genetic analysis is necessary to confirm the clinical diagnosis and identify family members who harbor the mutation and require screening for tumor detection and early treatment.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Options B and C: <strong>MEN 2</strong>, also called <strong>Sipple&rsquo;s syndrome</strong>, is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytomas, and parathyroid tumors. This occurs due to mutations of the <strong>rearranged during transfection (RET) protooncogene</strong>. There are three clinical variants -</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>MEN 2A</strong> (most common): MTC is associated with pheochromocytomas in 50% of patients and parathyroid tumors in 20% of patients. MEN 2A may also be associated with Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease and cutaneous lichen amyloidosis.</li>\n<li>MEN 2B<strong>&nbsp;(MEN</strong> <strong>3</strong>): MTC is associated with pheochromocytoma, along with Marfanoid habitus; mucosal neuromas of the lips, tongue, and eyelids; medullated corneal fibers; and intestinal autonomic ganglion dysfunction leading to multiple diverticulae and megacolon.

It is associated with a&nbsp;<strong>very low recurrence rate.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Gilbert repair</strong> (plug and patch repair) - It&nbsp;is an <strong>extension</strong> of <strong>Lichtenstein&rsquo;s original mesh repair</strong> and has now become the <strong>most commonly</strong> performed <strong>primary anterior inguinal hernia repair</strong>. In this technique, a <strong>cone-shaped plug</strong> of<strong> polypropylene mesh</strong> is used. It is deployed like an upside-down umbrella when inserted into the internal inguinal ring to occlude the hernia</li>\n<li><strong>Stoppa-Rives repair</strong>&nbsp;- It is used for the repair of large, recurrent, or bilateral hernias. In this method, a sub-umbilical&nbsp;<strong>midline incision </strong>is given to place a<strong> large mesh</strong> into the <strong>preperitoneal space.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Herniotomy</strong> - It is used to treat <strong>inguinal hernia</strong> in a<strong> child </strong>which&nbsp;occurs due to the<strong> presence</strong> of a&nbsp;<strong>patent processus vaginalis</strong>.

It occurs due to defective GPI anchors on the red blood cell surface which are normally used to anchor CD 59 (cell-protective proteins) to the surface. These patients can present with episodes of dark brown urine in the morning, anemia, pancytopenia, and recurrent abdominal pain due to thrombosis of abdominal veins.</p>\n<p>Option (D): <strong>Hereditary elliptocytosis</strong> is also a type of inherited hemolytic anemia that results from spectrin and similar surface protein mutations.
