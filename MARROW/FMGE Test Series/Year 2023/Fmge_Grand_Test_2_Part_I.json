Pigs are considered the major vertebrate hosts and amplifiers for the JE virus. <strong>Humans</strong> are the <strong>dead-end hosts</strong> for this virus. When a mosquito bites an infected pig, the virus is transmitted to the mosquito. The virus, in turn, is transferred to other pigs or humans due to mosquito bites and this cycle continues. Horses are the only known domestic animals that present with signs of JE infection.</p>\n<p>The control measures include mosquito control by areal or ground fogging with <strong>ultra-low-volume insecticides </strong>such as malathion and fenitrothion, locating piggeries away from human dwellings, and vaccinating pigs. Ultra-low-volume fogging is a method of insecticide application where a small volume (&lt;500 ml/hectare) of liquid insecticide is applied to provide maximum killing of disease vectors.</p>\n<p>JE vaccine is given in two doses- at 9-12 months of age and at 16-24 months of age in areas that are endemic to the disease, according to the National Immunisation Schedule.</p>\n<p>The transmission cycle of the <strong>Japanese encephalitis virus</strong> is shown below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a4b932113b4b4d34a28c9fa1019683eex1280x1547.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Anopheles mosquito</strong> is the vector for <strong>malaria.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Anopheles mosquito/Mansoni Mosquito </strong>could be the vectors for<strong> filariasis.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Aedes mosquito </strong>is the vector for<strong> yellow fever.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: The Mosquito</h3><p><strong>The mosquito as a vector:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mosquitoes are <strong>global in distribution.</strong></li>\n<li>The main species of mosquitoes include the <strong>Anopheles, Culex, Aedes </strong>and <strong>Mansonia.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Flight range</strong> varies up to <strong>11 kms,&nbsp;</strong>except Aedes for which it is 100 metres.</li>\n<li>Life span of mosquitoes is around <strong>8 to 34 days.</strong></li>\n<li>Their morphology consists of a head with a <strong>proboscis</strong>, a pair of <strong>palpi</strong> and a pair of <strong>antennae</strong>; a thorax and an abdomen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Charateristics:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Characteristics</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Anopheles</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Culex</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Aedes</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Mansonia</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EggsUsually 100-250.
