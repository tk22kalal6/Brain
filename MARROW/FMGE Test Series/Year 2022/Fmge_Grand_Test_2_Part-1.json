NHL affects the <strong>elderly age group</strong> and <strong>extranodal presentation</strong> is common. DLBCL can involve CNS, and <strong>CNS involvement</strong> is particularly <strong>common</strong> in the <strong>testicular</strong>, paranasal sinus, or bone marrow involvement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Primary testicular lymphoma</strong> is common in NHL compared to Hodgkin lymphoma. Primary testicular lymphoma(PTL) is an aggressive and uncommon form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma(NHL) usually affecting the elderly age group(&gt;60y). It typically presents as a painless, firm testicular mass. Constitutional symptoms are uncommon, and if present warrant a systemic involvement. Metastasis involves the central nervous system (CNS), skin, contralateral testis, and pleura resulting in local complications.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even though <strong>ataxia</strong> is seen as a paraneoplastic symptom due to cerebellar degeneration in <strong>Hodgkin lymphoma</strong>, testicular involvement is very rare and so far only <strong>5 cases</strong> have been reported. Hodgkin lymphoma arises in a single node or chain of nodes and spreads first to anatomically contiguous lymphoid tissues. The <strong>extranodal</strong> presentation is <strong>rare</strong>. The extranodal disease can occur at any site like lung, liver, bone, and bone marrow is most common if it occurs. The central nervous system and the testis are exceptionally rare sites for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thus Hodgkin's lymphoma can be ruled out.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Other options:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A) <strong>Glioblastoma multiforme</strong> is a highly malignant tumor,&nbsp;common in older adults in the fifth and sixth decades.

In diabetes, <strong>low insulin</strong> corresponds to an increase in HSL activity. This promotes the <strong>breakdown of lipids and a release of TG</strong> and free fatty acids from the adipose tissue.<br /><br />Insulin induces the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) which is present on the <strong>capillary walls.</strong> LPL promotes hydrolysis of TG and the degradation of the transport proteins, VLDL and chylomicrons. In diabetes, <strong>low insulin</strong> leads to <strong>decreased LPL</strong> activity which corresponds to an <strong>increase in VLDL and TG.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/930c5ce53b9a48df908e15bf24113255x800x552.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hormone sensitive lipase  Vs lipoprotein lipase</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;HSL</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Lipoprotein lipase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Location</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Adipocyte</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Capillaries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Action</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Hydrolyse TAG in adipose&nbsp; &nbsp;tissue</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Hydrolyse TAG in chylomicron , VLDL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Acts in the state of</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Fasting (Glucagon)</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Fed (Insulin)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
