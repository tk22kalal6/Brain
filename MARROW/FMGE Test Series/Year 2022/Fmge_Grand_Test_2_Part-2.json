A <strong>mesenteric fat pad</strong> is normally present <strong>between</strong> the <strong>SMA</strong> and the <strong>third part</strong> of the <strong>duodenum</strong>. In situations of <strong>rapid weight loss,</strong> abdominal surgery, etc, it is possible to <strong>lose this fat pad</strong>. This results in a narrowing of the above-mentioned angle. Patients begin to display <strong>symptoms when</strong> the <strong>angle falls below 20 degrees</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The result is that the third part of the duodenum now gets compressed between these two vessels leading to obstructive symptoms. The common presentation is <strong>postprandial abdominal pain</strong> with <strong>bilious vomiting</strong> and <strong>abdominal distension</strong>. Repeated episodes of vomiting can result in dehydration.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis </strong>can be made with a<strong> barium meal</strong> and <strong>follow-through&nbsp;</strong>or <strong>abdominal CT scan.</strong></p>\n<p>The image below shows<strong> barium follow through </strong>with <strong>dilatation </strong>of the <strong>duodenum </strong>and an<strong> abrupt cut-off&nbsp;</strong>at its <strong>third part. </strong>The cut-off is coinciding with the expected location of the <strong>SMA, depicted by the red line</strong> in the x-ray:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2b94ce6ed6d94a23a06c014f0a892299x720x662.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />The<strong> abdominal CT scan with contrast</strong> shown below depicts the reduced angle between the SMA and the abdominal aorta shown within the red circle-</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/157e2cac42a348a589c3985d67beda80x986x1032.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />This condition is <strong>first treated conservatively</strong> with gastric <strong>decompression</strong>, intake of <strong>smaller meals</strong>, and <strong>postural changes</strong> like knee-elbow position and left lateral decubitus position.

It&nbsp;is the process of the <strong>physician</strong> <strong>unconsciously displacing</strong> onto the patient patterns of behaviors or emotional reactions as if he/she were a significant figure from earlier in the physician's life. Psychiatrists should be alert to signs of countertransference issues like missed appointments by the psychiatrist, boredom, or sleepiness during a session. Supervision and personal therapy can help&nbsp;the psychiatrist recognize and deal with these issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Transference</strong> is the positive and <strong>negative feelings expressed</strong> by the patients towards the <strong>healthcare professional</strong>. It is the process of the <strong>patient unconsciously displacing</strong> onto individuals patterns of behavior and emotional reactions that originated with significant figures from the past (generally in childhood). This displacement is onto the psychiatrist in a clinical scenario, who is a parent surrogate.&nbsp;The patient may be angry, hostile, demanding, or obedient to an extreme degree because of former relationships and patterns of behaviors. Failure to recognize this can make the psychiatrist react to the patient's behavior like a personal attack.</p>\n<p>These are not defense mechanisms but are commonly encountered during clinical practice or while giving psychotherapy.
