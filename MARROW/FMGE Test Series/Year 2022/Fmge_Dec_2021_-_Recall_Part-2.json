      "solution": "<p>The used cotton swabs are disposed of in the <strong>yellow-coloured bags </strong>after use<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>biomedical waste management</strong> rule applies to all those who<strong> collect, receive, store, dispose </strong>and<strong> treat </strong>biomedical waste. The wastes are categorised and segregated at the point of generation of waste. A colour coding system with <strong>4</strong> colours namely<strong> yellow, red,</strong> <strong>white,</strong> and <strong>blue</strong> is used for <strong>waste segregation. </strong></p>\n<p>The segregated waste is then disposed of by various methods. They are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Incineration</strong> - this is a <strong>dry oxidation</strong> process done using <strong>high temperatures</strong>. The types are rotary kiln, pyrolytic incinerator, and single chamber incinerator.  </li>\n<li><strong>Chemical disinfection </strong>- chemicals are added to waste to kill or inactivate the microorganisms. Mostly used for treating<strong> liquid wastes</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Wet and dry thermal treatment </strong>- shredded infectious waste is exposed to high temperature, high-pressure steam and it resembles an<strong> autoclave</strong> sterilization process.</li>\n<li><strong>Microwave irradiation </strong>- microorganisms are killed using high-frequency microwaves. Its efficiency should be checked routinely.</li>\n<li><strong>Land disposal </strong>- either municipal disposal sites or sanitary landfills are used.</li>\n<li><strong>Inertization</strong> - waste is mixed with <strong>cement</strong> and other substances before disposal to <strong>reduce toxicity. </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Disposal by<strong> deep burial</strong> is permitted only in<strong> rural areas</strong> that lack common bio-medical treatment facilities. Permission from the concerned authority is needed and guidelines issued by the central pollution control board should be followed. </p>\n<p>Cytotoxic and biohazard materials will have separate non-washable and visible symbols as shown below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/eec1328dcf434f109d46cd1a14881496x1280x782.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Biomedical waste disposal</h3><p>The changes as per the new <strong>Biomedical waste management (amendment) rules, 2018</strong> have been included in the above table and highlighted in <span><strong>green</strong>.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><span><strong>&nbsp;<span> Yellow bag <span>(non-chlorinated)</span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Type of Waste</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Treatment and Disposal Options</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Human anatomical waste</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Animal anatomical waste</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Incineration</strong>/Plasma pyrolysis/Deep Burial</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Soiled Waste: </strong>Items like dressings, cotton swabs and plaster casts contaminated with blood and body fluids and bags containing residual discarded blood.</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Incineration</strong>/Plasma pyrolysis/Deep Burial</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>Autoclaving/Microwaving/ Hydroclaving</p>\n<p>Later - Shredding/mutilation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Discarded linen, mattresses, beddings contaminated with blood or body fluid, <span>routine masks, and gowns</span></strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Non- chlorinated chemical disinfection<br />followed by incineration or Plazma<br />Pyrolysis or for energy recovery.<br />In absence of above facilities, shredding<br />or mutilation or combination of<br />sterilization and shredding.&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Microbiology, Biotechnology, Clinical Laboratory waste</strong></p>\n<p>(Autoclave safe plastic bags used)</p>\n<p>Blood bags, Laboratory<br />cultures, stocks or<br />specimens of microorganisms,<br />live or<br />attenuated vaccines,<br />human and animal cell<br />cultures used in<br />research, industrial<br />laboratories, production<br />of biological, residual<br />toxins, dishes and<br />devices used for<br />cultures.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Pre-treatment with nonchlorinated chemicals</p>\n<p>Later - Incineration</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Expired/discarded medicine, cytotoxic drugs</p>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Incineration/ plasma pyrolysis/ Disposal in a&nbsp;

Since the patient appears normal apart from the delusion, the clinical scenario is likely to be of a <strong>delusional disorder,</strong> more specifically <strong>delusion of persecution</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Delusions are&nbsp;<strong>false belief</strong>, that is <strong>firmly</strong> held despite objective and obvious contradictory proof. Other members of the culture do not share this belief. It can be present in conditions like schizophrenia, mania, major depressive disorders, and delusional disorders.&nbsp; Important types of delusion are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delusion of <strong>persecution</strong>- The patient thinks that he or she is being conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged, maliciously maligned, or harassed.</li>\n<li>Delusion of <strong>Grandeur</strong>- The person thinks that he has great power, importance, or identity.</li>\n<li>Delusion of <strong>control</strong>- The patient thinks that his thoughts are being controlled by some external forces.</li>\n<li><span class=\"s1\">Delusion of <strong>infidelity</strong>: The patient f</span>alsely believes that one&rsquo;s lover is unfaithful.</li>\n<li>Delusion of<strong> reference</strong>- The patient believes that events, objects, or behavior of others have a special significance. They might also feel that&nbsp;others are talking about them.</li>\n<li>Delusion of <strong>self-accusation</strong>- Feeling of remorse or guilt</li>\n<li><strong>Erotomania</strong>- This is also called <strong>de Cl&eacute;rambault syndrome</strong> and is more common in women. The patient feels that someone is deeply in love with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Cotard syndrome</strong>- This is also called nihilistic delusional disorder. Patients feel that they have lost their possessions, status, strength, their body organs have stopped functioning, and the world around them will come to an end.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Illusion </strong>is an incorrect perception or misinterpretation of a sensory stimulus. Eg: There is a rope in front of you but you see it as a snake.</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Hallucination</strong>: Perception in the absence of any stimulus. Eg: There is nothing in front of you but you can see a snake.</p>\n<p>Option D:&nbsp;<strong>Cotard syndrome</strong>&nbsp;is a condition in which an individual feels like they have lost all possessions and status, including their entire being and all internal organs.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types of delusions</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>THE TYPES OF DELUSIONS</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Delusion&nbsp;of control</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>False belief that a person&rsquo;s will, thoughts, or feelings are being controlled by external forces.</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Delusion&nbsp;of grandeur </strong>or<strong> Megalomania</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Exaggerated conception of one&rsquo;s importance, power, or identity.</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Delusion&nbsp;of infidelity </strong>or morbid jealousy or <strong>Othello syndrome</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>False&nbsp;belief that one&rsquo;s lover is unfaithful.&nbsp;Sometimes called pathological jealousy.</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Delusion of love </strong>or<strong> erotomania</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>False belief that another person is in love with them.
