This procedure involves the removal of the duodenum and the pancreatic head and the distal part of the bile duct.</p>\n<p>The original pancreatoduodenectomy, as proposed by <strong>Whipple</strong>, included resection of the gastric antrum. <strong>Preserving the antrum </strong>and the <strong>pylorus</strong> is thought to result in a better physiological outcome, with no difference in survival or recurrence rates. Currently, the pylorus is removed in cases when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>entire duodenum has to be removed (e.g. in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)),</li>\n<li>tumor encroaches in the first part of the duodenum, or stomach</li>\n<li>A clear resection margin is not achieved by PPPD</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For <strong>tumors of the body and tail</strong>, <strong>distal pancreatectomy</strong> is the preferred surgical management.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Whipple's procedure</strong> is a complex surgery done for carcinomas involving the head of the pancreas. It is done only in cases when the entire duodenum has to be removed e.g. in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), tumor encroaches in the first part of the duodenum, or stomach or a clear resection margin is not achieved by pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy.</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Radical pancreaticoduodenectomy</strong> involves removing the head of the pancreas, the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), the gallbladder, and part of the bile duct. It is primarily performed to treat pancreatic cancer and other tumors in the pancreatic head region, though it may also be used for chronic pancreatitis in some cases.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Cholecystojejunostomy</strong> is a surgical bypass procedure that creates a connection between the gallbladder and jejunum. It is done for unresectable pancreatic head tumors causing biliary obstruction, distal common bile duct obstruction and when hepaticojejunostomy is not feasible.</p>",

In positive feedback, the response to a stimulus amplifies the stimulus rather than counteracting it.
