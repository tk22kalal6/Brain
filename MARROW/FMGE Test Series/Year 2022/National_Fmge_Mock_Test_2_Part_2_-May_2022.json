      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario of a 28-year-old man presents with a two-month history of<strong> diarrhoea, weight loss, and fever.</strong> Endoscopic examination reveals <strong>ulcers </strong>with areas of normal mucosa in between, and the<strong> rectum </strong>remains unaffected. These findings are indicative of<strong> Crohn's disease.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Crohn's disease</strong> is a <strong>chronic inflammatory bowel disease </strong>(IBD) that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus, but most commonly involves the<strong> terminal ileum and colon. </strong>It is characterized by<strong> transmural inflammation,</strong> which can lead to complications such as <strong>strictures, fistulas, </strong>and<strong> abscess formation</strong>. Symptoms include abdominal pain, persistent diarrhoea, weight loss, and fatigue. Patients may also experience extraintestinal manifestations such as arthritis, <strong>erythema nodosum,</strong> uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. The disease follows a relapsing-remitting course, with periods of flare-ups and remission.</p>\n<p>The exact cause of Crohn’s disease remains unclear, but it is believed to result from a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, immune system dysregulation, and environmental triggers such as diet, smoking, and gut microbiota imbalance. Diagnosis is made through a combination of clinical presentation, endoscopy with biopsy, imaging studies, and laboratory markers like <strong>faecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein</strong>. Treatment aims to control inflammation, relieve symptoms, and prevent complications. This includes medications such as <strong>aminosalicylates, corticosteroids</strong>, immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies targeting tumour necrosis factor-alpha (<strong>TNF-α) or integrins</strong>. In severe cases, surgical intervention may be required, but recurrence after surgery is common. Long-term management involves dietary modifications, smoking cessation, and regular monitoring to reduce disease progression and complications. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Crohn's disease</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Ulcerative colitis</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Age of onset&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td>2nd-4th decades &amp; 7th-9th decades</td>\n<td>2nd-4th decades &amp; 7th-9th decades&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;Location</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Most common- Terminal Ileum(Ileocolitis)</strong></p>\n<p>Skip lesions; can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus, the rectum is usually spared</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Most common-Rectum(Proctitis)</strong></p>\n<p>Mainly affects colon and rectum in a continuous manner.</p>\n<p>Anus is spared</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Protective factors</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp;None&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Smoking&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Appendicectomy</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Risk factors</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>OCP</p>\n<p>Smoking</p>\n<p>Antibiotic during first year of life&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&alpha;-Methyldopa</p>\n<p>Antibiotic during first year of life</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>T cell involved</strong></td>\n<td><strong>TH1&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td><strong>TH2</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Gross findings/ endoscopic findings</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Transmural</strong> involvement</p>\n<p><strong>Segmental</strong> involvement</p>\n<p><strong>Skip lesions&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Cobblestone appearance</p>\n<p>Creeping fat</p>\n<p>Longitudinal ulcers</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Mucosal</strong> involvement&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Continuous</strong> involvement</p>\n<p>Pseudopolyps&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Backwash ileitis&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Collar button ulcers</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Earliest finding</strong></td>\n<td>Aphthous ulcer</td>\n<td>Erythematous mucosa with a fine granular surface</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Microscopic findings&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Granulomas</strong></p>\n<p>Pyloric metaplasia&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Cryptitis and crypt abscess&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Paneth cell metaplasia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Complications&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Fistulas&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Strictures</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hemorrhage</p>\n<p>Toxic megacolon</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Radiological findings&nbsp;</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Aphthous ulcer</p>\n<p>Rose thorn appearance</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Mucosal granularity</p>\n<p><strong>Lead pipe appearance</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Extraintestinal manifestations</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 807\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 807\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 807\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Episcleritis, uveitis&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Migratory polyarthritis</p>\n<p>Ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 807\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 807\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Erythema nodosum</p>\n<p>Pyoderma gangrenosum- MC in UC</p>\n<p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis- MC in UC</p>\n<p>Renal Calculi- MC in CD</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p><br /><br /></p>",
