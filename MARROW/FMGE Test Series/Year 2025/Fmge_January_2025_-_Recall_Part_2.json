It consists of a series of actions that, when performed promptly and effectively, <strong>increase</strong> the<strong> chances of survival.</strong> Traditionally, the chain includes<strong> five</strong> key links: <strong>early recognition</strong> and <strong>activation</strong> of emergency response, <strong>early CPR</strong> (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), <strong>rapid defibrillation</strong>, <strong>advanced life</strong> <strong>support,</strong> and <strong>post-cardiac arrest care</strong>. Each of these steps plays a vital role in <strong>ensuring timely intervention, restoring circulation,</strong> and providing <strong>critical care</strong> to improve patient outcomes.</p>\n<p>In recent updates, the AHA has introduced a<strong> sixth link</strong> to the Chain of Survival<strong>: Recovery</strong>. This emphasizes the importance of <strong>long-term rehabilitation</strong>, <strong>psychological support,</strong> and<strong> follow-up care </strong>for cardiac arrest survivors. Recovery includes interventions such as<strong> physical therapy,</strong> lifestyle modifications, and<strong> emotional support</strong> to help survivors regain quality of life and reduce the risk of future cardiac events.

They often have significant impairment in academic functioning as well as in social and interpersonal situations.</p>\n<p>ADHD was historically believed to be a childhood condition resulting in delayed development of impulse control that would be generally outgrown by adolescence. Over the past few decades, a significant number of adults with ADHD have been found, diagnosed, and given effective treatment. <strong>Utah Criteria</strong> for Adult Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) include retrospective diagnosis of ADHD in childhood and evidence of current impairment from ADHD symptoms in adulthood. </p>\n<p>Adults with <strong>residual illness</strong> exhibit impulsivity and attention deficit symptoms, such as <strong>trouble focusing, difficulty organizing</strong> and <strong>finishing tasks</strong>, <strong>increased distractibility</strong>, and <strong>making snap decisions</strong> without considering the repercussions. Many individuals with the illness also suffer from a secondary depressive disorder, which is linked to low self-esteem as a result of their diminished performance, which has an impact on social and professional functioning.</p>\n<p>A variety of medications and <strong>behavioural interventions</strong> are used to treat ADHD. The most widely used medications are <strong>methylphenidate</strong> and <strong>atomoxetine</strong>. A combination of medication and psychotherapy is more effective than either treatment alone.</p>\n<p>Other options: </p>\n<p>Option A: Patients with <strong>chronic depression</strong> will usually have low mood and loss of interest in general and this does not fit into the given scenario.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Borderline personality disorder</strong> is characterized by extraordinarily unstable affect, mood, behaviour, object relations, and self-image. Instability in affect due to a marked reactivity of mood. It is characterized by repeated suicidal behaviour, unstable interpersonal relationships, prolonged feelings of emptiness, inappropriate, intense anger, or difficulty in controlling anger. </p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Manic disorder</strong> is usually seen with grandiosity and other psychotic symptoms that do not fit into the given situation.</p>",

This condition is characterized by <strong>hemolysis</strong> and <strong>dark-coloured</strong> <strong>urine</strong> (due to hemoglobinuria), and the <strong>negative</strong> <strong>CD55 </strong>and<strong> CD59</strong> markers indicate a deficiency of protective proteins in red blood cells, which is a hallmark of PNH.</p>\n<p><strong>PNH</strong> is an <strong>acquired chronic hemolytic anaemia</strong> with persistent <strong>intravascular hemolysis</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is due to an <strong>acquired</strong> mutation in the <strong>X-linked </strong>phosphatidylinositol class A<strong> PIG-A gene</strong> causing deficiency of <strong>GPI</strong>. GPI is a glycolipid that anchors membrane protective factors such as <strong>CD59 </strong>and <strong>CD55</strong> to the membrane. The deficiency of CD55 and CD59 makes the RBC sensitive to <strong>complement-mediated intravascular</strong> hemolysis.</p>\n<p>PNH is characterized by hemolytic anaemia, pancytopenia, and venous thrombosis involving cerebral, hepatic, renal, portal, and abdominal veins.</p>\n<p>Laboratory findings show-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decreased haemoglobin concentration</li>\n<li>Decreased haptoglobin levels </li>\n<li>Increased unconjugated haemoglobin</li>\n<li>Elevated LDH </li>\n<li>Increased reticulocyte count </li>\n<li>Negative Coombs test.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PNH is diagnosed using <strong>flow cytometry.</strong></p>\n<p>Note-</p>\n<p>The tendency of red cells to lyse at night is explained by a slight decrease in blood pH during sleep. This increases the activity of complement.</p><p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP</strong>) occurs due to antibody-mediated destruction of <strong>platelets</strong>. Autoantibodies, most often directed against platelet membrane glycoproteins<strong> IIb–IIIa or Ib–IX</strong> are found. The patient can present with petechiae, ecchymoses, easy bruising, nosebleeds, and gingival bleeding. The disease manifests first with melena, hematuria, or excessive menstrual flow.</p>\n<p>Option B: In <strong>Acquired Immune Hemolytic Anemia(AIHA</strong>) , autoantibodies against RBC antigens are produced which coat the RBC membrane. The Fc portion of the antibody is recognized by the Fc receptor on macrophages causing phagocytosis. RBC destruction takes place in extravascular sites where macrophages are abundant.It is divided into <strong>warm</strong> and <strong>cold</strong> subtypes.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Polycythemia vera </strong>is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder associated with a mutation of <strong>Janus kinase-2 (JAK2)</strong> which results in <strong>neoplastic proliferation</strong> of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Findings include <strong>high hemoglobin</strong>, hematocrit, or red cell count which are seen in other causes of erythrocytosis. <strong>Aquagenic pruritis</strong> is one of the most common symptoms associated with polycythemia vera. </p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification of Hemolytic Anemias</h3><p>Hemolytic anemias can be classified in 2 ways:</p>\n<p>1.

These findings suggest a likely diagnosis of <strong>Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy </strong>(AIDP).</p>\n<p><strong>AIDP</strong> is the most common type of Guillain-Barre syndrome(GBS). <strong>GBS</strong> is usually associated with a history of upper respiratory infection (<strong>URI</strong>) or acute gastroenteritis (AGE) <strong>1-3 weeks prior.</strong> The causative organisms may be <strong>Campylobacter jejuni</strong>, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.</p>\n<p>It presents with <strong>ascending motor paralysis</strong>, primarily affecting the <strong>lower limbs</strong> before progressing to the upper limbs. Sensory deficits may or may not be present, while <strong>deep tendon reflexes </strong>are<strong> absent.</strong> In severe cases, <strong>transient bladder dysfunction</strong> can occur. Autonomic manifestations include loss of vasomotor control, <strong>postural hypotension</strong>, and cardiac dysrhythmias.<br /><br />Histological examination shows <strong>inflammation</strong> of <strong>peripheral nerves</strong>, manifested as perivenular and endoneurial infiltration by lymphocytes, macrophages, and a few plasma cells.

This leads to <strong>low calcium, high phosphate, </strong>and<strong> very high PTH</strong>, as the kidneys and bones do not respond to PTH signals. The associated short stature and developmental delay are characteristic of <strong>Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy</strong> (AHO), a subtype of PHP.</p>\n<p>In<strong> hypoparathyroidism</strong>, there is <strong>low PTH</strong>, leading to<strong> low calcium </strong>and<strong> high phosphate</strong>. However, in this case, the child has very high PTH, which suggests that the parathyroid glands are producing enough hormone, but the body's tissues are not responding to it properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Pseudohypoparathyroidism</strong> is an <strong>inherited disorder</strong> that is characterized by hypocalcemia and characteristic skeletal features, known as Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). It is due to the <strong>loss of function mutation</strong> in genes encoding the alpha subunit of the stimulatory <strong>G-protein Gsα</strong>. This blocks the action of PTH, leading to reduced serum calcium and increased serum phosphate. AHO features include <strong>short stature, short metacarpals</strong> and metatarsals (brachydactyly), round facies, <strong>intellectual impairment</strong>, and heterotropic calcifications.</p>\n<p>Although serum calcium is low and serum phosphate is high (like hypoparathyroidism), PTH levels are also found to be elevated, and thus this disorder is termed pseudohypoparathyroidism. Urinary cAMP excretion is low because PTH is unable to act on its downstream pathways.</p><p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Hypoparathyroidism</strong> is due to the decreased production of parathormone from the parathyroid glands. It is characterized by low calcium and low parathormone levels with elevated phosphate. Clinical features of hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism include paresthesias, seizures, carpopedal spasm, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, and prolongation of the QT interval.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Hypothyroidism</strong> generally presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and dry skin. It does not typically cause elevated parathyroid hormone levels or the specific constellation of symptoms seen in this patient (recurrent kidney stones, abdominal pain, and altered mentation).</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Rickets</strong> occurs due to inadequate intake of dairy products rich in vitamin D, lack of vitamin supplementation, and decreased sunlight exposure. It results in a mild decrease in calcium levels, elevated parathormone levels due to secondary hyperparathyroidism, and low phosphate levels.</p>",

Although there is a <strong>risk of potential thromboembolism </strong>if the patient has not been put on anticoagulation before, the <strong>need for rate control outweighs this risk</strong>. In these patients, heart rate control is achieved using <strong>IV β-blockers </strong>or <strong>calcium channel blockers</strong> like <strong>verapamil (Option B)</strong> or diltiazem.

In chronic cases, the thenar eminence is wasted. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common cause and can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, acromegaly, hypothyroidism and gout. The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds but <strong>nerve conduction studies</strong> can confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Median nerve injuries:</p>\n<p>Distal injury: Thus an injury to the distal median nerve affects the <strong>1st and 2nd lumbricals </strong>sparing the flexor digitorum profundus. This causes <strong>hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints</strong> and<strong> flexion at the interphalangeal joints,</strong> involving the index and middle fingers. This attitude of the hand known as the median claw hand may be seen at rest and is more pronounced on attempting to extend the fingers (attitude is similar to proximal ulnar injury).</p>\n<p>Proximal injury: Since the opposing flexor digitorum profundus of the 2nd and 3rd digit that causes the clawing is also affected, the <strong>clawing of the hand </strong>is less pronounced in distal injuries of the ulnar nerve.

The <strong>water hammer pulse</strong> and <strong>pistol shot sounds</strong> over the <strong>femoral arteries </strong>suggest high-pressure blood flow due to <strong>aortic insufficiency</strong>.
