This <strong>distension</strong> activates the atrial stretch receptors which transmit the afferent signals to the medulla via the vagus nerve. The efferent signals are then transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves. This leads to an increase in the strength of contraction of the heart and <strong>tachycardia.</strong> This reflex helps in preventing excess accumulation of blood in the atria, veins, and in the pulmonary circulation.</p>\n<p>Other options - </p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Bezold-Jarisch reflex</strong> is due to the activation of <strong>chemosensitive vagal C fibers</strong> in the cardiopulmonary region. They can be elicited after administering certain irritants like <strong>capsaicin</strong> or serotonin. It can also be activated during myocardial infarction and on exposure to radioactive dyes during coronary angiography. This reflex is characterized by <strong>profound brady­cardia, hypotension</strong>, and a brief period of <strong>apnea</strong> followed by <strong>rapid shallow breathing</strong>. </p>\n<p>Option B<strong>: Pulmonary chemoreflex</strong> is due to the stimulation of the <strong>J-receptors</strong> (C receptors/juxta-pulmonary capillary receptors) which are stimulated when there is hyperinflation of the lung. This produces reflex <strong>apnea</strong> followed by a <strong>rapid increase in breathing rate</strong>, <strong>bradycardia,</strong> and <strong>hypotension</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Cushing's reflex </strong>is seen when the <strong>intracranial pressure </strong>is<strong> raised </strong>where the blood supply to ventrolateral medulla neurons is compromised. The local hypoxia and hypercapnia stimulate the neurons producing <strong>hypertension, bradycardia</strong>, and<strong> irregular respiration</strong>.</p><p>*Note: Bainbridge reflex causes<strong> tachycardia</strong>, whereas all the other mentioned reflexes predominately cause <strong>bradycardia</strong>. </p>",

It is zoonotic, with<strong> fruit bats</strong> from the Pteropodidae family as its <strong>natural hosts.</strong> <strong>Transmission</strong> occurs from animals, such as <strong>bats and pigs, to humans</strong>, as well as between humans.Symptoms range from <strong>asymptomatic (subclinical) </strong>infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis.</p>\n<p>Currently, <strong>no treatment or vaccine</strong> exists for humans or animals, and <strong>supportive care</strong> is the main form of treatment for those infected. Nipah virus is also listed among the WHO's Blueprint priority diseases.</p><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Japanese encephalitis : Humans</strong> serve as dead-end hosts for the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, which is transmitted through the <strong>bite of Culex mosquitoes</strong>, particularly Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex vishnui, commonly found in India. The <strong>transmission </strong>cycle involves <strong>birds, mosquitoes, and humans</strong>.The JE virus also infects various non-human hosts, such as<strong> pigs </strong>and birds like pond herons.</p>\n<p>The main transmission cycles are:<br />(a) Pig → Mosquito → Pig<br />(b) Bird → Mosquito → Bird</p>\n<p><strong>Herons act as reservoir hosts</strong>, while<strong> pigs</strong> function as <strong>amplifier hosts</strong>. Control measures focus on mosquito control, relocating pig farms away from human habitation, and vaccinating pigs.</p><p>Option B: <strong>Zika virus</strong> is transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of an infected <strong>Aedes </strong>species mosquito (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus).</p>\n<p>Anyone who lives in or travels to a region with risk of Zika infection, and has not already been infected with Zika virus can get it from mosquito bites. Once a person has been infected, they are likely to be protected from future infections</p>\n<p>A <strong>pregnant woman </strong>can pass Zika virus to her fetus during pregnancy. Zika is a cause of <strong>microcephaly</strong> and other severe fetal brain defects. Zika virus has also been found in <strong>breast milk</strong>. Possible Zika virus infections have been identified in breastfeeding babies, but Zika virus transmission through breast milk has not been confirmed.<br />Zika can be passed through sexual intercourse, even if the infected person does not have symptoms at the time.<br />To date, there have not been any confirmed blood transfusion transmission cases in the United States. There are reports of laboratory acquired Zika virus infections, although the route of transmission was not clearly established in all cases<br /> </p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Rabies</strong> is a fatal infection of the central nervous system transmitted by the bite of a <strong>rabid animal</strong>. It is caused by <strong>rhabdoviruses</strong>. These viruses are enveloped, rod or<strong> bullet</strong> shaped and contain <strong>single-stranded RNA</strong>. This virus attaches to the cells via its glycoprotein spikes and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor acts as the cellular receptor.</p>",

Its action is independent of anti-thrombin, which means it can reach and inactivate fibrin-bound thrombin in thrombi. It is excreted by the <strong>kidney</strong> and should be used with great caution in patients with renal insufficiency as no antidote exists. </p>\n<p>Its most adverse reaction is <strong>bleeding.</strong> The risk of bleeding can be reduced by implementing an appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment strategy. Thus, coagulation profile monitoring is required for lepirudin.</p>\n<p>Like heparin, lepirudin must be administered parenterally and is monitored by <strong>aPTT</strong>. Lepirudin was approved for use in patients with thrombosis related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Its production was discontinued by the manufacturer in 2012.</p>\n<p>Other options :</p>\n<p>Option B - <strong>Enoxaparin</strong> is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) that inhibits activated factor X with less effect on thrombin. Hence, it has a smaller effect on the coagulation profile and <strong>does not need monitoring</strong>. </p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Fondaparinux</strong> avidly binds antithrombin, resulting in efficient inactivation of factor Xa. It is effective in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and does not appear to cross-react with pathologic HIT antibodies in most individuals. Like LMWH, it <strong>does not require monitoring</strong> of the coagulation profile.</p>\n<p>Option D - <strong>Dabigatran</strong> is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor approved for the reduction in risk of stroke and systemic embolism with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and VTE prophylaxis following hip or knee replacement surgery.

These rhabditiform larvae in the bowel can develop directly into filariform larvae that penetrate the colonic wall or perianal skin and enter the circulation to repeat the migration.

This condition results from defects in<strong> LPL</strong> or <strong>apo C-II</strong>, causing <strong>elevated</strong> levels of <strong>chylomicrons</strong> and<strong> VLDL</strong>, with decreased levels of LDL and HDL. Patients often develop <strong>eruptive xanthomas</strong> but are not at risk for coronary artery disease.

The size of these droplet nuclei is <strong>&lt;5 μm</strong> in diameter, and they can remain suspended in the air for significant periods of time, allowing them to be <strong>transmitted over distances</strong> &gt;1 m.  There's no need for close proximity or contact. Diseases like chickenpox, measles, <strong>tuberculosis</strong>, and influenza can spread through airborne transmission.</p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para\"><strong>Droplet transmission</strong> occurs when one coughs or sneezes, and contagious droplets from the infected person travel shortly in the air and directly comes in contact with another person's conjunctiva, mouth, or nasal mucosa. The particle size here is <strong>&gt;5 μm </strong>in diameter. Transmission here requires<strong> close proximity</strong> and<strong> direct contact</strong>. Examples of diseases spread via this route include the <strong>common cold</strong>, diphtheria, and whooping cough.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Direct</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Indirect</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Direct contact</p>\n<p>Droplet infection</p>\n<p>Contact with soil</p>\n<p>Inoculation into skin or mucosa</p>\n<p>Vertical (transplacental)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Vehicle-borne</p>\n<p>Vector borne – mechanical or biological</p>\n<p>Air borne – droplet nuclei or dust</p>\n<p>Fomite borne</p>\n<p>Unclean hands and finger</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

This facilitates easy removal and allows the user to ensure that the IUD remains in the uterus.</p>\n<p>It functions mainly by causing an <strong>inflammatory response</strong> within the uterus that impair the viability of the sperms and reduce its chances of fertilization. The same response also makes it <strong>difficult</strong> for <strong>blastocyst implantation. </strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>IUCD</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Life span</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cu T 380A</strong></td>\n<td><strong>10 years</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CuT 200</td>\n<td>4 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 596\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>levonorgestrel IUD</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>7 years</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Progestasert</td>\n<td>1 year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nova-T</td>\n<td>5 years</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>The image below shows different types of IUDs.</p>\n<p> </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/9b294109467f40fea73cff0ddba7922ax1280x5453.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Methods of contraceptions</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methods</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Advantages</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Disadvantages</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Barrier</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents STD, I-IV</li>\n<li>The incidence of Ca cervix reduced</li>\n<li>Effective if used properly</li>\n<li>No contraindication use</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Cumbersome</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Coital dependent</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Short term</li>\n<li>&nbsp;High failure rate</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Lactation</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Beneficial to the newborn</li>\n<li>Contraceptive action (non-ovulatlon) 6 months</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>Short-term benefit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>IUCD</strong></td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Long-term use</li>\n<li>Effective</li>\n<li>Coital Independent</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>Side effects<br />&bull; Failure rate 1-3\"'<br />&bull; Contraindicated In few</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hormones</strong></td>\n<td>Effective 99-100% long-term use of beneficial effects<br />of OC coital independent</td>\n<td>Side effects<br />&bull; Not used during lactation<br />&bull; Contraindicated In few<br />&bull; Requires Surgery for implantation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Surgery</strong></td>\n<td>Permanent and effective</td>\n<td>Surgical complications surgery required.<br />&bull; Not suited in low parity women</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Postcoital</strong></td>\n<td>Effective 95-98% short-term use</td>\n<td>Failure in 1-5%<br />Not used as contraceptives</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification Of Contraceptives Based On Effectiveness</h3><p><strong>Classification Of Contraceptives Based On Effectiveness</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Failure rate in first year</strong></td>\n<td>&nbsp; <strong>Example</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>First tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;&lt; 2 %</td>\n<td>IUD, Implants, Sterilization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Second tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;3-9 %</td>\n<td>Hormonal (oral, injected, transdermal patches, transvaginal rings)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Third tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;10-20 %</td>\n<td>Barrier, Fertility awareness method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fourth tier</td>\n<td>&nbsp;21-30 %</td>\n<td>Spermicidal preparations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",

This happens as follows: When there is increased sodium, there is increased <strong>sodium-potassium ATPase activity </strong>which leads to increased ATP hydrolysis causing more adenosine formation. The adenosine receptors on the macula densa cells stimulate it to release more <strong>calcium</strong>, so that there is vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, thereby decreasing the GFR.</li>\n<li><strong>Granular cells/JG cells:</strong> Modified smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole, they secrete <strong>renin</strong>.
