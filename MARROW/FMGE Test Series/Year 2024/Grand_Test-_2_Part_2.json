The recipient twin lacks a cardiac system, while the donor twin does the work of supplying blood for both twins. Blood from the donor twin reaches the iliac vessels of the recipient twin through the umbilical arteries. Therefore the <strong>recipient twin</strong> appears <strong>malformed</strong>, as only the lower body is developed, while the upper body is poorly developed. The <strong>donor twin</strong> may show signs of <strong>heart failure</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Single uterine artery</strong> is a malformation seen in some fetuses with an associated genetic condition.

However, unlike TTTS, </strong>the<strong> amniotic fluid volumes </strong>in<strong> TAPS </strong>are similar for both fetuses.</p>",
