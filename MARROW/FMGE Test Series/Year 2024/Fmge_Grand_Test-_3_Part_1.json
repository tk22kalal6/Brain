The clinical features include non-specific symptoms like fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss. The pulmonary findings are characterized by severe asthmatic attacks and pulmonary infiltrates.

The enzyme <strong>deficient</strong> in this condition is <strong>β-hexosaminidase A.</strong></p>\n<p>Tay-Sachs disease is a lipid storage disorder due to the deficiency<strong> </strong>of<strong> </strong>hexosaminidase<strong> </strong>A leading to the <strong>accumulation</strong> of<strong> GM2 gangliosides. </strong>It is classified into infantile, juvenile, and adult-onset forms based on the age at onset and clinical features.</p>\n<p>Affected infants usually develop normally until 4-5 months of age. Clinical features of Tay-Sachs disease include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Muscle weakness (hypotonia)</strong></li>\n<li>Seizures</li>\n<li><strong>Exaggerated startle response</strong></li>\n<li>Macrocephaly</li>\n<li>Mental retardation</li>\n<li><strong>Macular</strong> <strong>cherry-red spots</strong></li>\n<li>Blindness</li>\n<li><strong>Developmental delay</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The deficiency of <strong>β-hexosaminidase A </strong>and<strong> B</strong> causes <strong>Sandhoff's</strong> <strong>disease</strong>.

Infants with Sandhoff disease have hepatosplenomegaly, cardiac involvement, and mild bony abnormalities.</p><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Fabry disease</strong> is an <strong>X-linked</strong><strong> lysosomal storage disorder</strong> caused due to deficiency of <strong>α-Galactosidase. </strong>This leads to the accumulation of <strong>globotriaosylceramide</strong>. Clinical features include angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, corneal and lenticular opacities, and painful acroparesthesias. <strong>Angiokeratomas</strong> are dark red to blue-black, flat or slightly raised, punctate lesions, usually seen between the umbilicus and the knees (called the <strong>bathing suit area</strong>) and the trunk.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Metachromatic leukodystrophy</strong> is a <strong>lysosomal storage disease</strong> caused due to deficiency of the enzyme <strong>arylsulfatase A</strong>. It leads to demyelination and the patient has a neurodegenerative course.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Gaucher disease</strong> is an <strong>autosomal recessive </strong>lysosomal storage disorder with a deficiency of <strong>acid-β-glucosidase.</strong> It leads to the accumulation of <strong>glucosylceramide.</strong> The features of this disease include growth retardation, <strong>hepatosplenomegaly,</strong> thrombocytopenia, anemia, and <strong>Erlenmeyer flask deformity</strong> of the distal femur. Histology shows the presence of <strong>Gaucher cells </strong>with a characteristic <strong>wrinkled</strong>-<strong>paper</strong> <strong>appearance</strong>.
