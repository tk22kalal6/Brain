This is done to <strong>rule out pregnancy.</strong></p>\n<p>A<strong> urine pregnancy test detects</strong> pregnancy by identifying the presence of the hormone <strong>human chorionic gonadotropin</strong> (hCG), which is produced by the developing placenta shortly after a fertilized egg implants in the uterine wall. The test contains <strong>antibodies</strong> that specifically bind to hCG, typically providing a visible result when the hormone is detected. <strong>hCG levels rise rapidly in early pregnancy,</strong> allowing the test to indicate pregnancy as early as <strong>one to two weeks after conception.</strong> This sensitivity makes urine hCG tests a reliable early indicator of pregnancy.</p>\n<p>In the reproductive age group, <strong>anovulatory uterine bleeding </strong>is encountered <strong>less often</strong>. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded. Pregnancy complications such as <strong>miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and molar pregnancies may present with AUB,</strong> hence, these need to be ruled out by urine β-hCG levels. This is done for all women in the reproductive age group. </p>\n<p>The urine pregnancy test is<strong> non-invasive, cost-effective, and provides rapid results, </strong>making it an essential initial step in the diagnostic workup.</p>\n<p>Other investigations to be done for AUB are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pap smear</strong>: to rule out cervical cancer and preinvasive lesions (CIN). Cervical cancer screening should <strong>start </strong>at age <strong>21</strong>.

It is done after evaluating β-hCG. This is more comfortable for a patient than a transabdominal ultrasound, as it doesn't require a full bladder.  is the <strong>first-line </strong>investigation in a patient with <strong>post-menopausal bleeding.</strong> All postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding should be evaluated for endometrial malignancy since age is a significant risk factor for this.</li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Ketamine</strong> is a phencyclidine derivative that inhibits <strong>NMDA</strong> (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors resulting in a decrease in excitatory stimulation by glutamate in the brain. It is a strong <strong>analgesic</strong> and <strong>amnestic </strong>agent. </p>\n<p>On the <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>, it directly has a cardio-depressive effect and <strong>indirectly</strong> <strong>stimulates</strong> it by activating the <strong>sympathetic system</strong> and <strong>inhibiting</strong> the <strong>vagus nerve</strong>. It predominantly shows a <strong>stimulatory effect</strong> hence causing tachycardia, increased cardiac output, and increased systemic and pulmonary hypertension.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>respiratory system</strong>, it has a <strong>bronchodilator effect</strong> on bronchial smooth muscles. It <strong>increases salivary secretion</strong> and <strong>bronchial secretion</strong>. It also acts on other systems and <strong>increases </strong>the<strong> intracranial </strong>and<strong> intraocular pressures</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Uses:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ketamine is the <strong>intravenous agent of choice</strong> for patients with <strong>shock, low cardiac output states,</strong> and reactive airway diseases.</li>\n<li>It is also used in patients with <strong>congenital heart diseases,</strong> especially with right-to-left shunts</li>\n<li>Perioperative analgesia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ketamine should be avoided in patients with a history of seizures, psychiatric illness, or vascular aneurysms.

Induction dose is usually 1-2 mg/ kg and the maintenance dose is 100-200 µg/ kg/ min. Propofol is formulated as a <strong>lipid emulsion</strong> and appears as a <strong>milky white liquid.</strong> It has <strong>antiemetic</strong> properties which help reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Midazolam</strong> is a <strong>benzodiazepine</strong> that facilitates <strong>GABA-A receptors</strong>' action by increasing the frequency of opening of <strong>GABA-mediated chloride channels.</strong> It is used in <strong>treating seizures</strong> and is used in <strong>daycare surgeries</strong> as an induction agent due to its short half-life. </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Thiopentone sodium</strong> belongs to the <strong>barbiturate</strong> group which acts on the<strong> GABA-A receptors</strong>. This site is separate from the GABA-A site to which benzodiazepines bind.

It can occur secondary to trauma, endoscopic instrumentation, corrosive ingestion, or severe repetitive vomiting against a closed GE junction. It presents with <strong>retrosternal chest pain</strong> and other symptoms depending on the size of the perforation and contamination of the mediastinum. Late signs may include mediastinitis as well as surgical emphysema. The initial investigation that is performed in this condition is a <strong>contrast esophagogram (gastrograffin) </strong>which will show the extravasation of the contrast. <strong>Water-soluble contrast</strong> (iohexol) should be used instead of barium contrast to <strong>prevent</strong> barium-related inflammation of the mediastinum if there is perforation. If the esophagogram is normal, <strong>contrast-enhanced CT</strong> is useful in identifying the injury. If the suspicion of esophageal perforation is high and the radiological investigations are normal, then the <strong>endoscopy </strong>can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.<br /><br />Other options<br />Options A: <strong>Mallory-Weiss tear </strong>is characterized by <strong>mucosal lacerations</strong> at the gastroesophageal junction, typically following forceful vomiting.

The <strong>serum anion gap</strong> is a test that can be used to measure the recovery of the patient.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p>In DKA, due to the absence of <strong>insulin,</strong> there is a decrease in glucose uptake in cells in the body leading to a state of starvation. This leads to an increase in levels of <strong>glucagon</strong> and <strong>ketone</strong> bodies in order to provide a constant source of energy to the cells including the <strong>myocardial</strong> and <strong>neural tissue.</strong> An increase in the serum ketones widens the anion gap which is why DKA is an <strong>Anion gap metabolic acidosis</strong>.  Serum anion gap can be used to measure the response to treatment and also helps in planning further management. As the patient receives <strong>insulin,</strong> there is a cessation of production of <strong>ketoacids</strong> and this in turn leads to the <strong>normalization</strong> of the <strong>serum anion gap</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"ng-binding\">In DKA, the <strong>insulin-to-glucagon</strong> ratio is decreased which promotes <strong>gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis,</strong> and <strong>ketone</strong> body formation in the liver.

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario is an uncomplicated inguinal hernia.  An uncomplicated<strong> inguinal </strong>hernia is<strong> </strong>repaired by the reduction of the content, repair of the defect and reinforcement with <strong>mesh placement(Lichtenstein mesh repair).</strong></p>\n<p>A hernia is a protrusion of the contents outside the cavity containing it. Groin hernias arising lateral to the inferior epigastric artery are <strong>indirect</strong> and hernia arising medial to it are <strong>direct </strong>inguinal hernias. Hernias have two cardinal features- reducibility and cough impulse. A <strong>Lichtenstein mesh repair</strong> is currently one of the most frequently used methods for treating an<strong> inguinal hernia</strong>. It is done for the <strong>reconstruction</strong> of the <strong>inguinal floor</strong> in <strong>adults</strong>. It is an <strong>anterior tension-free mesh repair</strong> that reduces the chances of <strong>recurrence</strong> of a hernia. A piece of prosthetic nonabsorbable <strong>mesh is used</strong> to fit the canal to bridge the defect in this repair.</p>\n<p>Other surgical methods used to repair a hernia are:</p>\n<p><strong>Bassini repair</strong> is done for the <strong>reconstruction</strong> of the <strong>inguinal floor</strong> in <strong>adults</strong>. In this method, a <strong>mesh is not</strong> used. It is associated with a <strong>high</strong> <strong>recurrence</strong> and is not used frequently now. It is used only in cases of hernial strangulation and peritonitis where the use of a mesh is not preferred. It is performed by <strong>suturing</strong> the transversus abdominis and internal oblique musculoaponeurotic arches/<strong>conjoined tendons</strong> to the<strong> inguinal ligament</strong>.  <strong>Shouldice repair</strong> is a <strong>multilayered repair,</strong> where the posterior wall of the inguinal canal is strengthened by <strong>continuous sutures.</strong> It involves <strong>double-breasting</strong> of the<strong> transversalis fascia</strong>. It is associated with a <strong>very low recurrence rate. </strong>These are herniorraphies (Option C)</p>\n<p><strong>Herniotomy</strong> is used to treat <strong>inguinal hernia</strong> in a<strong> child </strong>which occurs due to the<strong> presence</strong> of a <strong>patent processus vaginalis</strong>. Therefore in herniotomy, the repair of the inguinal ring is not done. (Option B)</p>\n<p><strong>McVay repair</strong> (Cooper's ligament repair) is used for the correction of direct inguinal hernia, large indirect hernia, recurrent hernia, femoral hernias (particularly suited for strangulated femoral hernias). In this method, the transversus abdominis aponeurosis is approximated to Cooper's ligament.</p>\n<p><strong>Stoppa-Rives repair</strong> is used for the repair of large, recurrent, or bilateral hernias.

However, once the head is delivered, the body usually follows without significant issues. The scenario described involves difficulty after the head is delivered, specifically with the shoulders, which is not characteristic of face presentation.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Occipito-sacral arrest-</strong> This refers to the baby being in a <strong>persistent occiput posterior position</strong> (with the baby facing up towards the mother’s abdomen rather than down). Labor may progress more slowly or stop when the baby’s head fails to rotate and descend properly. However, like with CPD, occipito-sacral arrest typically results in <strong>difficulty before the head is delivered, not after. </strong>If the head has been delivered but the shoulders are stuck, it indicates a different issue.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Cephalopelvic disproportion(CPD)</strong> - CPD occurs when the baby's head or body is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis. This can lead to labor not progressing or being arrested before the baby’s head is fully delivered. In CPD,<strong> labor arrest or failure to descend is seen</strong>, and the baby’s <strong>head may not pass through the pelvis at all.</strong> Since in the scenario described above, the head is already delivered and the shoulders are the issue, CPD is less likely to be the cause.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/65a1a65be4a944a594200e5b13846248x720x874.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

The most common site of compression is at the<strong> middle meatus</strong>, where the nerve may be impinged by anatomical variations, inflammation, or other pathologies affecting the paranasal sinuses.</p>\n<p><strong>The anterior ethmoidal nerve </strong>enters the nasal cavity by descending through the <strong>cribriform plate</strong> near the crista galli. Once in the nasal cavity, the nerve descends along the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. It runs above the <strong>superior border</strong> of the <strong>middle meatus</strong> and provides sensory innervation to the mucosa of the anterior part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity</p>\n<p>The patient typically presents with severe, sharp, and <strong>stabbing pain </strong>localized to the <strong>forehead</strong> and the <strong>root of the nose</strong>, often radiating to the periocular region. The pain is usually unilateral but can occasionally be bilateral. Associated symptoms may include tenderness over the affected area and occasionally nasal congestion or discharge if there is concurrent sinusitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Computed Tomography</strong> (CT) or <strong>Magnetic Resonance Imagin</strong>g (MRI) of the paranasal sinuses can be employed to identify anatomical variations, mucosal thickening, or other potential sources of nerve compression.</p>\n<p>Management involves <strong>analgesics </strong>(such as NSAIDs or acetaminophen) and, in more severe cases, neuropathic pain medications like gabapentin or pregabalin can be used to alleviate pain.<br /><strong>Nasal corticosteroids</strong> or saline nasal irrigation may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and relieve associated nasal symptoms.<br /><strong>Surgical Intervention </strong>is considered in cases where conservative treatments are ineffective and anatomical abnormalities are identified.</p>",

Patients present with proximal muscle <strong>weakness of the lower limbs</strong>, <strong>ptosis</strong>, and <strong>diplopia</strong>.  <strong>Treatment</strong> involves <strong>plasmapheresis</strong>, <strong>immunotherapy</strong>, and drugs such as <strong>3,4-diaminopyridine </strong>(3,4-DAP) and <strong>pyridostigmine</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C:<strong> Duchenne muscular dystrophy</strong> (DMD) is an X-linked muscular dystrophy due to mutations in the dystrophin gene. It most commonly affects boys in their childhood. Patients initially present with <strong>proximal muscle weakness</strong> predominantly in the lower limbs. <strong>Calf muscle hypertrophy</strong> is a cardinal feature. Other features include mental retardation, cardiac failure, and myoglobinuria. Treatment includes corticosteroids, <strong>Eteplirsen,</strong> and <strong>Casimersen.</strong> </p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Myotonic dystrophy</strong> is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting multiple systems. It is associated with <strong>skeletal muscle weakness, cataracts, endocrinopathy, </strong>and<strong> cardiomyopathy</strong>. The <strong>treatment</strong> is mainly <strong>symptomatic</strong> however, <strong>mexiletine</strong> is indicated for reducing myotonia.</p>",
