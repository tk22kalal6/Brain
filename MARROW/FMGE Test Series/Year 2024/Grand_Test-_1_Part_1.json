It is commonly seen in young athletes. The <strong>heart rate increases</strong> during<strong> inspiration</strong> and decreases during expiration, especially when the depth of breathing is increased. This is due to the fluctuations in <strong>parasympathetic output </strong>to the heart. </span></p>\n<p><span>During inspiration, the <strong>stretch receptors</strong> of the lungs send signals to the vagus nerves. The vagi then inhibits the <strong>cardiac inhibitory area </strong>of the medulla oblongata. The tonic vagal tone thus decreases, and the heart rate increases. The opposite occurs <strong>during expiration</strong>, with a resultant<strong> increase</strong> in<strong> vagal tone</strong>. The cardiac inhibitory area also receives signals from the <strong>medullary respiratory center.</strong>  </span></p>\n<p><span>Other options:</span></p>\n<p><span>Option B: <strong>Cardiac output</strong> is directly proportional to <strong>preload </strong>over a certain range. Preload can be determined by <strong>venous return</strong>, which<strong> increases</strong> in the <strong>supine</strong> position as compared to standing. Thus, the cardiac output increases when supine as compared to standing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Option C: <strong>Degeneration </strong>of the <strong>sino-atrial node</strong> is a cause of <strong>sick sinus syndrome</strong>. It is more commonly seen in elderly people. Sick sinus syndrome includes sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia-tachycardia. </span></p>\n<p><span>Option D: <strong>Ectopic foci</strong> in the atrium result in <strong>premature atrial contractions</strong> (PACs). In this, the P wave occurs too soon in the cardiac cycle, followed by a <strong>compensatory pause</strong>. They can occur in healthy people, especially athletes.</span></p>",

Simple random sampling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In simple random sampling, samples are drawn in such a way that <strong>every element in a population has equal chances</strong> of being included.</li>\n<li>A random is defined by the <strong>method of picking the sample</strong> and not the outcome.</li>\n<li>For example, picking 4 random cards from a bag full of cards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Stratified random sampling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In stratified random sampling, the <strong>population is first divided into homogeneous groups</strong>, or <strong>strata</strong>. From these <strong>strata,</strong> random samples are drawn.</li>\n<li>For example, dividing a population into the strata of men, women and children and then picking samples randomly from these strata.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Cluster sampling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In cluster sampling, the <strong>population is divided into internally heterogeneous groups.</strong>&nbsp;Then a <strong>simple random sampling is done of these clusters</strong> and taken as the samples.</li>\n<li>In other words, the <strong>clusters</strong> are the <strong>sampling unit.</strong></li>\n<li>For example, if a researcher wants to do a study on 100 doctors working in hospitals in Bangalore, he would select a <strong>cluster</strong> of 10 hospitals (clusters) and then take 10 doctors from each hospital as part his sample.</li>\n<li>This is usually done when large scale simple random sampling or stratified sampling is laborious or expensive.</li>\n<li>This is the method used in assessing <strong>immunization status of children</strong>.</li>\n<li>Cluster sampling involves <strong>design effect</strong>, which is an adjustment to allow for design structure.

Systematic random sampling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>In systematic sampling, there is a <strong>systematic pattern</strong> to selecting the elements of a sample.</li>\n<li>For example, <strong>every</strong> <strong>10<sup>th</sup> person</strong> to be admitted to the hospital can be selected or every 3<sup>rd</sup> baby to be born can be selected.</li>\n</ul>",

The <strong>secretion</strong> of<strong> protons</strong> by an activated <strong>H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase</strong> (proton pump) in the <strong>parietal cells</strong> into the gastric lumen is the <strong>final step</strong> involved in the production of<strong> gastric acid</strong>&nbsp;and inhibition of this enzyme prevents acid secretion into the stomach.</p>\n<p>Once PPIs irreversibly inactivate the H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, acid secretion resumes only after new pump molecules are synthesized and inserted into the luminal membrane. This leads to <strong>prolonged suppression of acid secretion</strong> for up to 24-48 hours, despite having a shorter plasma half-life of only 30 minutes to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>In most individuals, once-daily dosing is enough to achieve effective acid inhibition. If necessary, a second dose can be given before an evening meal.</p>\n<p>The number of H<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump molecules increases after fasting and food decreases the oral bioavailability of the drug. Hence, PPIs are given around 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.</p>\n<p>PPIs <strong>cannot inhibit</strong> all gastric acid pumps with oral dosing because <strong>not all pumps are active</strong> during the short half-life of the PPI in the blood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PPIs cause maximum suppression of gastric acid. They reduce the daily production of <strong>both basal</strong> and <strong>stimulated acid secretion</strong> by 85&ndash;90%.&nbsp;<br /><br />There are available in the form of <strong>delayed-release</strong> tablets, capsules, and oral suspension packets and for immediate acid suppression, there are <strong>intravenous formulations</strong> for PPIs like lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole. Therefore, the <strong>release of the drug</strong> depends upon the drug <strong>formulation.</strong></p><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/79f8d7a356254942ac77ef98dbd915b6x912x630.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

In β-thalassemia major, anemia manifests 6 to 9 months after birth. <strong>HbF</strong> levels are markedly <strong>elevated</strong>. The presence of bony anomalies such as frontal bossing, prominent facial bones, and dental malocclusion is typical.</p>\n<p>The image below shows <strong>thalassemic facies</strong> (frontal bossing and maxillary hyperplasia) in a child with thalassemia major. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1a2fcda0c2c74489b0ad2ad11b3e416dx512x357.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Laboratory findings:</strong> Infants with severe β-thalassemia diseases experience increasing anemia following the newborn stage. The RBCs exhibit<strong> microcytosis, hypochromia, and target cells. </strong>Usually observed are <strong>nucleated RBCs, a distinct anisopoikilocytosis, and relative reticulocytopenia. </strong>Without transfusions, the Hb level frequently drops to 6 g/dL in a gradual manner.</p>\n<p>The <strong>RDW</strong> shows<span> the <strong>size difference</strong> in the red blood cells. <strong>Low RDW</strong> means all the red blood cells are small and <strong>uniform</strong> in <strong>size,</strong> while a <strong>large RDW</strong> means that the cells <strong>vary in size. </strong>It is<strong> normal </strong>in case of<strong> thalassemia </strong>as all cells are uniformly small in size. It <strong>increases</strong> in<strong> iron deficiency anaemia</strong> because of presence of small and normal sized RBCs.</span></p>\n<p><strong> High-performance liquid chromatography</strong> (<strong>HPLC</strong>) confirms the diagnosis of thalassemia.

It is caused by insufficient vitamin B12 absorption through the gastrointestinal pathway, leading to vitamin B12 insufficiency.<strong> Macro-ovalocytes </strong>and<strong> hypersegmented neutrophils</strong> are frequent observations in the peripheral smear associated with megaloblastic anemia.

This type of horizontal gene transfer may occur by two mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lytic cycle&nbsp;</strong>- In the lytic cycle, also known as the virulent cycle, a large number of progeny phages build up inside the host bacterium; eventually, the host cell ruptures, releasing the bacteriophages.

Rather, the phage DNA becomes integrated with the bacterial chromosome. This phage DNA multiplies with the host cell and is transferred to daughter cells.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Option A -&nbsp;<strong>Conjugation</strong> is the method of&nbsp;gene transfer in bacteria that involves physical contact by a male or donor bacterium with a female or recipient bacterium through an extracellular protein extrusion or appendage called the <strong>sex pili.</strong> The genetic material that is transferred is usually derived from plasmids.&nbsp;The bacteria that possess the ability to form the sex pili contain the F<sup>+</sup> plasmid and are designated as F<sup>+</sup>.
