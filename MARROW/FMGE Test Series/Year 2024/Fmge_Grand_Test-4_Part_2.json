Only some tumor cells will be in the sensitive phase of the cell cycle when the radiation is given. Hence, giving another dose at a later time helps in killing the other cells that were in the resistant part of the cell cycle, thus increasing the success rate of the therapy.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Re-oxygenation</strong>: Hypoxic cells are less sensitive to the indirect effects of radiation. The tumor cells which are closer to oxygen sources are killed first and in the intervening time, the other relatively hypoxic cells can improve their oxygenation so that the next fraction of radiation is effective on them. </p>\n<p>3. <strong>Repair</strong>: The ability to repair DNA is more for healthy cells than malignant cells and thus when a radiation dose has been received, the healthy cells repair their DNA faster than the malignant cells. The malignant cells whose DNA is not fully repaired are highly susceptible to the next dose of radiation.</p><p>Types of fractionation:</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Fractionation</strong>: Radiotherapy(RT) is given once daily for 5 days/week, not more than 2 Gy/fraction.</p>\n<p><strong>Accelerated Fractionation</strong>:(Option C) Any fractionation schedule that gives &gt;10 Gy/week.

However, due to the possible adverse effects, it is only indicated <strong>in severe cases</strong> and after the child attains puberty in moderate cases.

It occurs due to <strong>defective GPI anchors</strong> on the <strong>red blood cell surface</strong> which are normally used to anchor CD 59 (cell-protective proteins) to the surface. These patients can present with episodes of <strong>dark brown urine</strong> in the <strong>morning</strong>, anemia, pancytopenia, and recurrent abdominal pain due to thrombosis of abdominal veins. </p>\n<p>Bone marrow transplantation is done for the treatment.

The preferred beta-blocker drug is&nbsp;<strong>e</strong><strong>smolol, a cardio-selective beta blocker.&nbsp;</strong>These&nbsp;reduce cardiac contractility and blood pressure. It can be used in patients with <strong>bronchospastic disorders</strong>.<strong> Labetalol</strong>, a non-selective beta blocker decreases systemic vascular resistance without impairing the cardiac output.<strong>&nbsp;Enalapril</strong> and other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can be used if there is decreased <strong>renal perfusion</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Calcium channel blockers</strong> like diltiazem may be used IV if beta-blockers cannot be employed.</p>\n<p>Once hypertension is controlled,<strong> definitive surgical repair</strong> of aortic dissection is done. <strong>Nitroprusside</strong>, a direct vasodilator is given after adequate beta-blockade is achieved. Definitive management is by surgical repair.</p>\n<p><strong>Types:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stanford type A <strong>(DeBakey&nbsp;types</strong> <strong>I</strong> and <strong>II)</strong> requires <strong>surgical intervention</strong> once the patient's blood pressure is stabilized.</li>\n<li>Stanford type B <strong>(DeBakey&nbsp;type III)</strong> is best managed by <strong>antihypertensive drugs.
