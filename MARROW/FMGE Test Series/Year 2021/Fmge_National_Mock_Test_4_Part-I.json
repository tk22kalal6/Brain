This is because, during the initial stimulus, the amount of acetylcholine released is large enough to compete with the drug at the motor endplate and causes the maximal contraction of the muscle. But, during the successive stimuli, the amount of acetylcholine released is not sufficient to compete with the drug and results in diminished contractions sequentially.
