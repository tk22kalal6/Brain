This occurs due to increased insulin secretion from acute carbohydrate introduction.<br><br>This is due to a shift from catabolism to anabolism, which leads to a number of metabolic changes. One of these changes is increased insulin secretion. This increase in insulin promotes glycogenesis, protein synthesis and also activates the sodium-potassium ATPase symporter, leading to movement of potassium into the cells Magnesium and phosphate are also taken up similarly, which can lead to hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia. Additionally, insulin can inhibit the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate, which can lead to hypophosphatemia - the hallmark of refeeding syndrome. Hyperglycemia is seen due to the acutely increased body insulin production not being able to keep up with the rapidly increasing blood sugar levels. <br><br>Refeeding syndrome is a fatal condition that can occur with rapid and excessive feeding of patients with severe underlying malnutrition which may be due to: Starvation, Alcoholism, Delayed nutritional support, Anorexia nervosa, Massive weight loss in obese patients<br><br>These electrolyte disorders can result in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, respiratory dysfunction, liver dysfunction, seizures, confusion, coma, tetany, and death.<br><br>Prevention of refeeding involves correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, administering thiamine and increasing calorie intake gradually.<br><br>Options A, B and C: The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the metabolic changes that lead to refeeding syndrome.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7df2897f35cc4684b76f52c34c9763a6x628x1246.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are used in which the rapid-acting and rapidly eliminated artemisinin component is paired with a slower-acting and slower-eliminated partner drug with a distinct antiparasitic mechanism of action. Such an approach is required because artemisinins, when administered alone, require more than 7 days of therapy to eliminate parasites, but when paired with an effective partner, the duration of treatment gets reduced.<br><br>Chloroquine is highly effective against the erythrocytic forms of P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, P. knowlesi, and chloroquine-sensitive strains of P. falciparum. Chloroquine rapidly controls the clinical symptoms and parasitemia of acute malaria. Most patients become completely afebrile within 24 to 48 hours after receiving therapeutic doses. Sulfadoxine is a slow-acting blood schizonticide and is more active against P. falciparum than P. vivax.<br><br>Primaquine, in contrast to other antimalarials, acts on exoerythrocytic tissue stages of Plasmodium spp. in the liver to prevent and cure relapsing malaria. Primaquine is primarily used for terminal chemoprophylaxis and radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale (relapsing) infections due to its high activity against the latent tissue forms (hypnozoites) of these Plasmodium species. It also has gametocytocidal activity against P. falciparum and other Plasmodium species.

These most frequently include the wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP), and proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP) in the upper limb, and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints in the lower limb. Note that distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) involvement is not seen in RA and usually represents coexistent osteoarthritis.<br><br>The patients complain of early morning joint stiffness lasting for more than an hour, which improves with activity. As the disease progresses, the following deformities may be seen:<br><br>* Trigger finger occurs due to tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons<br><br>* Ulnar deviation of the hand occurs due to MCP joint subluxation<br><br>* Swan-neck deformity occurs due to hyperextension of the PIP and flexion of the DIP<br><br>* Boutonnière deformity occurs due to flexion of the PIP and the hyperextension of the DIP<br><br>Pearl PM2038: The 'most commons' of rheumatoid arthritis<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Feature of RA</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Most common </strong> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Involved joints</td>\n<td>MCP, Wrist, PIP(DIP spared) </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spine involvement</td>\n<td>Cervical spine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Extra-articular manifestation</td>\n<td>Subcutaneous nodules (mostly extensor surface)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cardiac manifestation</td>\n<td>Pericarditis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Valvular abnormality</td>\n<td>Mitral regurgitation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pulmonary manifestation</td>\n<td>Pleuritis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hematological manifestation</td>\n<td>Normochromic normocytic anemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Neurological manifestation</td>\n<td>Compression neuropathies (mostly carpal tunnel syndrome)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ocular manifestation</td>\n<td> Keratoconjunctivitis sicca</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lymphoma</td>\n<td>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cause of death</td>\n<td>Cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>Pearl PM1921: Joint Involvement in Various Arthritis<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong> Joint Disorders</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Joints Commonly Involved</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Joints Com</strong><strong>monly </strong><strong>Spared</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p> <strong>Osteoarthritis</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cervical and lumbosacral spine, PIP, DIP, 1st CMC, hip, knee, 1st MTP, </p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p> Elbow, Wrist, Ankle, MCP </p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Rheumatoid Arthritis</strong></td>\n<td>Shoulder, Wrist, MCP, PIP, Knee, MTP </td>\n<td>DIP </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ankylosing Spondylitis</strong></td>\n<td>Sacroiliac joint, intervertebral joints</td>\n<td> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Psoriatic Arthritis</strong></td>\n<td>PIP, DIP</td>\n<td>Ray distribution* </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br><br>*Ray distribution: Joint involvement tends to follow a pattern with all of the joints of one finger involved sparing the adjacent finger completely.<br><br>Pearl PM1563: Deformities in rheumatoid arthritis<br><br>Boutonnière deformity: Flexion of the PIP joint with hyperextension of the DIP joint.  <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f0250f1148284de1bd77c8d6e470c56fx720x960.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br> <br><br>Swan-neck deformity: Hyperextension of the PIP joint with flexion of the DIP joint. <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/560c6a73ecfc46e7aed6682bc24af2a4x720x1017.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br> <br><br>Z line deformity: Radial deviation of the wrist with ulnar deviation of digits.  <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c60e1966a5314bbf8fd6c20a5ed7f625x800x600.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Eversion at hindfoot (subtalar joint), hallux valgus (shown below), hammertoe. <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/798b7febef7a44699a664b1f1a5363cdx720x919.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Windswept deformities of toes - Valgus deformities of toes in one foot and varus in the other foot. <br><br>Piano-key movement of the ulnar styloid. <br><br>Trigger finger due to flexor tendon synovitis.",

Tamponade results in elevated right atrial pressure and elevated right ventricular pressures. This results in a prominent x descent and a diminished or absent y descent in the JVP. The resultant JVP is elevated but nonpulsatile in nature due to the persistently raised pressures in the right side of the heart. <br><br>Orthopnea, right hypochondriac region pain, and shortness of breath within 2-3 hours after going to bed are seen in cardiac failure.<br><br>Cardiac failure is a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood, leading to cardinal manifestations of dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention.<br><br>Orthopnea refers to dyspnea that occurs in the recumbent position within 1–2 minutes of lying down. It occurs due to the redistribution of fluid from the abdomen and lower body into the chest, increased work of breathing due to decreased lung compliance and elevation of the diaphragm in patients with ascites or hepatomegaly. The symptoms may be relieved by raising the head and chest with pillows or an adjustable bed.<br><br>Right hypochondriac region pain occurs due to stretching of the hepatic capsule resulting from hepatic congestion in right heart failure.<br><br>Shortness of breath within 2-3 hours after going to bed is known as Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea. It refers to episodes of shortness of breath that awaken a patient from sleep with feelings of anxiety and suffocation.

Hence, the patient should be treated with Meropenem. In septic shock, there is peripheral vasodilation due to toxins from the infectious agent causing endothelial injury and fluid leak, leading to hypotension, which can be refractory to fluid therapy in the early stages.<br><br>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in diabetic patients due to poor metabolic control, altered immune status, poor bladder control and incomplete voiding. E. coli is the most common organism to cause urinary tract infections. Other organisms causing infections include Klebsiella spp, Proteus spp, Enterobacter spp and Enterococci. A complicated urinary tract infection is accompanied by symptoms that suggest the infection extends beyond the bladder, such as a fever or signs and symptoms of systemic illness.<br><br>ESBL-positive E. coli is an emerging pathogen responsible for urinary tract infections. Oral antibiotic therapy may not consistently be effective against this organism. For complicated infections caused by ESBL-positive E. coli, it is recommended to use empiric therapy with a carbapenem.<br><br>Carbapenems, including doripenem, imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, offer the most reliable coverage for strains containing extended-spectrum β-lactamases.

Fourth and fifth-generation cephalosporins can be used for complicated UTIs.<br><br>Option D: Nitrofurantoin is used for the treatment of uncomplicated infections.

Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease where infection occurs due to the adhesion of gonococci to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces with the help of pili. By the third day of infection, the cocci have penetrated intracellular spaces and reached subepithelial tissue. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 8 days. The main symptoms are urethral discharge and dysuria.<br><br>In males, the disease starts as acute urethritis. This infection has the potential to spread down the urethra and into the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis. Chronic urethritis can lead to stricture formation. Infections in the periurethral tissues can lead to abscesses and multiple discharging sinuses known as watercan perineum.<br><br>In females, the infection begins in the cervix and urethra and may spread to the Bartholin glands, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. The vaginal mucosa is usually unaffected in adults because the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to cocci infection and also because vaginal secretions have an acidic pH. Rarely, peritonitis may develop with perihepatic inflammation known as Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome.<br><br>The discharge is collected and subjected to Gram's stain, which reveals gram‐negative intracellular diplococci within phagocytes. Stuart's transport medium is used. Specifically, Thayer-Martin agar is used to isolate Neisseria gonorrhoeae.<br><br>The image below shows the Gram stain of a urethral exudate showing typical intracellular Gram-negative diplococci.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/2ef2c0310ad9419c8b7e3aba5800b7a5.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Pearl PM2456: Sexually transmitted infections<br><br>Genital herpes- caused by herpes simplex virus (human herpesvirus 1 and 2).<br><br>* It appears as blisters (usually multiple) that lead to ulcer formation on breaking.<br><br>* The ulcers are painful.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8ba0cafb8f724e8caf99ab7778d022acx630x761.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br> <br><br>Granuloma inguinale / Donovanosis- caused by Klebsiella granulomatis (formerly known as Calymmatobacterium granulomatis).<br><br>* It usually causes beefy red genital ulcers that may bleed on touch.<br><br>* The ulcers are usually painless.<br><br>* Lymphadenopathy is usually absent but subcutaneous granulomas cause pseudo buboes. <br><br>* Microscopy shows Donovan bodies with closed safety pin appearance<br><br>The given images show genital ulcer in granuloma inguinale: <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4aaa8224b2e7443e94743e1015a44778x560x358.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br> <br><br>Chancroid/ Soft chancre- caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.<br><br>* Causes genital ulcers that are non indurated with undermined edges.<br><br>* The ulcer is painful.<br><br>* Multiple/ Kissing ulcers develop due to autoinoculation from the primary ulcer.<br><br>* It usually causes tender unilateral inguinal buboes. <br><br>* Microscopy- School of fish/Railroad track appearance<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/875f994ab0a44d3a8d26f376c6b54874x597x313.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br> <br><br>Syphilitic chancre/ Hard chancre- caused by Treponema pallidum.<br><br>* It presents as a small, button-like, indurated ulcer that is usually round/oval.<br><br>* The ulcer is painless.<br><br>* Causes painless lymphadenopathy.<br><br>* Microscopy- Spirochetes seen on dark ground illumination.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/03d21e32213a42c9ab3487da627b053ex336x288.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br> <br><br>Lymphogranuloma venereum- caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.<br><br>* It usually presents with a transient single shallow ulcer that heals rapidly and usually goes unnoticed.<br><br>* The secondary stage presents with tender inguinal buboes.<br><br>* Groove sign is seen when the lymph nodes above and below the inguinal ligament are enlarged leading to the appearance of a groove.<br><br>The given images show the ulcer and the groove sign seen in LGV: <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6faad0dd79004ce4898a0d4ec94391e9x495x711.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/be01c14fe5b34f6fb923eca0f40d42cex253x357.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br> <br><br>Gonorrhea- caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.<br><br>* It leads to purulent inflammation of the genital mucous membranes.<br><br>* It may present as urethritis, cervicitis, epididymo‐orchitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease.<br><br>* The usual presentation is acute urethritis with complaints of burning dysuria and purulent discharge.<br><br>The given image shows purulent genital inflammation due to gonorrhea: <br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f4fd185c143045fe944bb99f1299a4bbx379x412.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
