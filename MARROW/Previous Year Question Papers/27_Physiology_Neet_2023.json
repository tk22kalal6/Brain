Severe hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and paralysis. The management of hyperkalemia includes treating the underlying cause, administering medications to stabilize the cardiac membrane (e.g., calcium gluconate), promoting the movement of potassium into cells (e.g., insulin and glucose, beta-agonists), and enhancing the removal of potassium from the body (e.g., diuretics, ion-exchange resins, or hemodialysis).</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Resting membrane potential (RMP) in tissues</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Tissue</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>RMP(mV)</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Neuron</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>-70</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Skeletal muscle</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>-90</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Myocardial muscle</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>-90</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Smooth muscle</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>-20 to -65</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
