The light rays refracting from B focus on the retina, whereas those refracting from A focus in front of the retina. </p>\n<p>To correct this error, a negative cylindrical lens (DC) is used to focus the myopic rays of meridian A on the retina. This correction needs to occur at 90 degrees (meridian A). The axis of a cylindrical lens is perpendicular to the required correction and thus, the spectacles will have an axis of 180 degrees.</p>\n<p>There is no spherical refractive error since the light rays from meridian B lies on the retina.

It can be used to test for horizontal and vertical deviations, and when used in conjunction with another Maddox rod, for cyclo deviations.</p>\n<p>A patient is asked to fix on a point light in the center of Maddox tangent scale placed 6 meters away. A Maddox rod is placed in front of one eye with the axis of the rod parallel to the axis of deviation. The patient will see a point light with one eye and a red line with the other. Due to dissimilar images of the two eyes, fusion is broken and heterophoria becomes manifest. The number on the Maddox tangent scale where the red line falls will be the amount of heterophoria in degrees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4a7b036a4fb4427784ad623020d5641ex1280x1103.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/1477e0b1a03549fa98d85a3c4049a8fdx1280x1471.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/badc687c600047f6b432e3c34472d32bx1280x2324.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/fbeee932a8e242bd9714fb6163e74196x1280x2108.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
