This indicates <strong>Chance fracture</strong>.</p>\n<p>Chance fracture is also known as <strong>seat-belt injury</strong> or the <strong>jack-knife injury. </strong>This injury is typically located in the <strong>upper lumbar spine</strong> in people involved in motor vehicle collisions while wearing a <strong>lap seat belt</strong> <strong>without</strong> a <strong>shoulder harness</strong>. The sudden deceleration causes <strong>flexion and</strong> <strong>posterior distraction </strong>of the spine. This causes the mid-lumbar spine to bend like a jack-knife around an axis anterior to the vertebral column.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is a <strong>tear </strong>in the<strong> vertebra</strong> that passes <strong>transversely</strong> through the bones (bony Chance fracture), or the ligamentous structures (soft Chance fracture), or both. There is little or no crushing of the vertebral body.

      "solution": "<p>The clinical features and radiograph showing<strong> onion peel </strong>type of <strong>periosteal reaction</strong> point towards a diagnosis of <strong>Ewing’s sarcoma</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ewing's</strong> <strong>sarcoma</strong> is a malignant tumour that occurs more frequently in males, typically <strong>between 10 and 20 years of age</strong> and has a diaphyseal long-bone location. The femur is the most common long-bone site, followed by the tibia, humerus and fibula. Ewing’s sarcoma is believed to arise from mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Pain</strong> is the <strong>earliest</strong> <strong>symptom</strong>, followed by swelling and a low-grade fever. Radiographically, an aggressive, permeative, poorly defined osteolytic lesion with cortical destruction, periosteal reaction and large, radiolucent soft-tissue mass may be found. Periosteal reaction is common in young patients with the lamellar ‘<strong>onion</strong>-<strong>skin</strong>’ appearance causing fusiform bone enlargement. Ewing’s sarcoma is composed of primitive, undifferentiated, <strong>small</strong>, <strong>round</strong> <strong>blue</strong> <strong>cells</strong> with large nuclei and scant cytoplasm. The characteristic translocation between chromosomes <strong>11</strong> and <strong>22</strong> results in a fusion gene, <strong>EWSR1-FL11</strong>, which is present in 90% of cases. </p>\n<p>Preoperative chemotherapy frequently results in extensive tumour necrosis and shrinkage. Agents used in Ewing’s sarcoma include <strong>vincristine</strong>, <strong>ifosfamide</strong>, <strong>doxorubicin</strong> and <strong>etoposide</strong>. Wide excision may be combined with adjuvant radiotherapy if surgical margins are poor. A more favourable outcome is expected with younger age, distal appendicular sites, small tumour volume, normal ESR and greater chemotherapy necrosis response.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/0fe9ab3f5b57492cac9b9f566b049027x1280x1407.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:<strong> Osteosarcoma</strong> has a periosteal reaction characterised as the <strong>Codman triangle.</strong> It can also be seen in Ewing’s sarcoma.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/6bf488ad27fb4708a0239ce482f7b71cx570x570.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C:<strong> Giant cell tumor</strong> has a characteristic <strong>soap bubble appearance.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5fab855f530c4dc1ba509dc98275ca4ex720x912.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D: <strong>Acute osteomyelitis</strong> in children presents with <strong>fever</strong>, <strong>pain</strong>, refusal to bear weight, <strong>elevated WBC count</strong>, <strong>elevated CRP</strong>, and <strong>elevated ESR</strong>.

It is most commonly of extension type followed by flexion type. <strong>Gartland classification</strong> is used for supracondylar fractures. The <strong>three-point bony relationship</strong> is <strong>maintained</strong> in supracondylar fracture (option B). Three-point bony landmarks in the elbow are the tips of medial and lateral epicondyles and the olecranon.</p>\n<p>Nerve and vessel injury:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The most common nerve to be injured in extension type - anterior interosseous nerve &gt; Median nerve &gt; Radial nerve &gt; Ulnar nerve. (<strong>AMRU</strong>)</li>\n<li>The most common nerve to be injured in the flexion type the ulnar nerve.</li>\n<li>The most common vessel to be injured - the brachial artery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Radiological findings: An undisplaced fracture may show a <strong>triangular lucency</strong> like a sail of a yacht (sail sign), also called a fat pad sign. This is due to the fat pad around the elbow being pushed forward by the hematoma. <strong>Baumann’s angle</strong> (humeral-capitellar angle) can help in assessing the degree of medial angulation before and after reduction.</p>\n<p>The <strong>most common complication</strong> of supracondylar fracture is <strong>malunion</strong>. This leads to <strong>cubitus varus</strong> or <strong>gunstock deformity</strong>. Malunion occurs due to improper reduction and not due to physeal damage, as the fracture is extraphyseal Other complications include <strong>myositis ossificans</strong>, <strong>compartment syndrome</strong>, and <strong>Volkmann ischemic contracture. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Undisplaced</strong> supracondylar humerus fractures are treated by an <strong>above-elbow plaster slab</strong> with the elbow in 90º flexion. <strong>Displaced</strong> fractures are treated by <strong>closed reduction</strong> and K-wire fixation since they tend to slip after reduction. Open fractures or those associated with brachial artery injury are treated by open reduction and internal fixation.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Options A and D: Salter and Harris created a classification of physeal injuries for risk stratification.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type 3: Here, the fracture splits the epiphysis and then goes transversely in either direction into the hypertrophic layer of the physis. This leads to damage of the growth plate leading to growth disturbance. </li>\n<li>Type 4: The fracture splits the epiphysis and extends into the metaphysis. Displacement can occur in these types leading to asymmetrical growth.</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Named classification systems for  fractures and dislocations</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Classification</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n<td><span><strong>Site</strong></span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Stanmore Instability Classification</p>\n</td>\n<td>Shoulder instability&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Neer&rsquo;s&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture proximal humerus&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Gartland&rsquo;s</p>\n</td>\n<td>Supracondylar fracture humerus&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Milch&rsquo;s</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Fracture lateral condyle of humerus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Mayo classification</p>\n</td>\n<td>Olecranon fracture</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Denis and AO/ASIF</td>\n<td>Fracture spine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anderson and D&rsquo;Alonzo</td>\n<td>Odontoid fracture</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Ferguson and Allen classification</p>\n<p>Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification (SLIC)</p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture subaxial cervical spine (C3-C7)&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AO-Magerl classification</td>\n<td>Thoracolumbar spine fractures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wiltse&minus;Newman classification</td>\n<td>Spondylolisthesis&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tile classification</p>\n<p>Young and Burgess classification</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Pelvis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Judet,</p>\n<p>Letournel&rsquo;s</p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture acetabulum&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Pauwel&rsquo;s</p>\n<p>Garden&rsquo;s</p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture neck of femur</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Pipkin&rsquo;s</p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture head of femur</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Boyd &amp; Griffin</p>\n</td>\n<td>Fracture inter trochanter femur</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Thompson and Epstein&rsquo;s</p>\n</td>\n<td>Posterior dislocation of the hip</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Winquist and Hansen&rsquo;s</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fracture shaft of femur</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hawkin&rsquo;s</td>\n<td>\n<p>Fracture neck of talus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bado's&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Monteggia fracture dislocations&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types of Salter–Harris fractures- Mnemonic</h3><p>There are <strong>nine types</strong> of Salter-Harris fractures.
