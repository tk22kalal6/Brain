      "solution": "The imaging modalities contraindicated in pregnancy among the given options is CT Scan. <br><br>CT is a high-resolution technique using x-rays to generate cross-sectional images of any area of the body. It is associated with high radiation doses. Hence, CT scan is avoided during pregnancy due to the potential adverse effects of radiation on the fetus. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: MRI is useful for high soft tissue contrast and acquisition of images. It is devoid of any ionizing radiation and found to have no fetal harmful effect at any gestational age. However, the gadolinium contrast MRI in pregnancy should be used with caution as gadolinium crosses the placenta.<br><br>Option C: Ultrasound is the most commonly used imaging tool in obstetrics. There is no documented harmful effects to the fetus from diagnostic ultrasound. <br><br>Option D: Color Doppler is based on the principle of Doppler frequency shift. Doppler ultrasound is used to measure the speed at which blood is moving within a vessel. The effects of ultrasound on tissues are: temperature elevation, formation of microbubbles and cavitation. However, there is no clear evidence till date that diagnostic ultrasound examination during pregnancy is harmful. Ultrasound should be done with shortest duration possible to avoid unnecessary exposure, especially with the Doppler.",

A distinct histological pattern, termed cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis (CNGM), is believed to be caused by Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii. This condition primarily occurs in young women who are parous, typically manifesting within the initial few years postpartum. It manifests as one or more inflammatory breast masses (central or peripheral), which may or may not progress to form an abscess. It may be associated with skin ulceration, nipple retraction, sinus formation, peau d’orange, and axillary lymphadenopathy. <br><br>A needle biopsy of a solid mass establishes the diagnosis of IGM. Histologically, CNGM often shows lipogranulomas with cystic spaces and neutrophilic infiltrates. In symptomatic patients and in those with infection, treatment with NSAIDs and antibiotics with or without drainage is indicated. In cases of persistent symptoms or progression, treatment with prednisolone (oral or topical) with or without methotrexate has helped in regression of IGM. A major milk duct excision is indicated in patients with a mammary duct fistula. Excision of chronic abscess cavities is performed in patients with recurrence.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a close differential, but histology should show caseating granulomas, which is not the case here. However, to rule out TB, along with histopathology, evidence on imaging, microbiological analysis, and GeneXpert is required to establish a diagnosis. <br><br>Option C: Cryptococcus neoformans is more common in immunocompromised patients, shows yeast on biopsy, and does not typically cause neutrophil-rich cystic lesions.<br><br>Option D: Corynebacterium minutissimum usually causes erythrasma, a superficial skin infection, and not deep granulomatous mastitis.",

However, its effect on renal perfusion is not entirely clear. Some studies report it can decrease renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate, while others suggest it may enhance perfusion and exert renoprotective effects, depending on context and dosage. Among the given options, the role of magnesium sulphate in increasing renal perfusion is not well proven and hence, is the correct answer here.",

The presence of a fluid wave suggests ascites, and the detection of a pelvic mass on examination further supports an ovarian origin.<br><br>A markedly elevated CA-125 level of 990 U/L is strongly indicative of epithelial ovarian cancer, particularly the serous subtype, which is the most common and typically presents with high CA-125 levels.

They are hormonally active and often produce estrogen, leading to symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding or endometrial hyperplasia, which are not seen in this patient. Additionally, granulosa cell tumors rarely cause massive ascites or omental caking, and they do not typically result in such a high CA-125 level as seen here (990 U/L). <br><br>Option B: Endometroid adenofibroma is a rare and benign tumor that does not typically produce symptoms like abdominal distension, early satiety, or pelvic discomfort. These tumors are usually small, unilateral, and typically doesn't present with ascites, elevated CA-125, or peritoneal spread. Bilateral solid masses and omental caking are inconsistent with this diagnosis.<br><br>Option C: Mucinous cystadenoma is a benign epithelial ovarian tumor that is usually large and unilateral, often presenting as a multilocular cystic mass.
