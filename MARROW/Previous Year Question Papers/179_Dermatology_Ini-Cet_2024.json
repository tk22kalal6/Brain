      "solution": "<p><strong>Urticaria</strong> is not associated with <strong>annular</strong> <strong>lesions</strong>. It is characterized by wheals.</p>\n<p><strong>Urticaria </strong>is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by itchy wheals, which develop due to evanescent edema of dermis.</p>\n<p>A weal is a descriptive term for<strong> transient, well‐demarcated, superficial pink </strong>or<strong> pale swellings</strong> of the dermis due to reversible exudation of plasma in the skin that fade, usually within hours, without leaving a mark . Weals are usually <strong>very itchy</strong> and associated with a <strong>surrounding red flare</strong> when they arise. Lesions begin as <strong>erythematous macules</strong>, which rapidly evolve into pale pink edematous wheals with a surrounding flare.</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Tinea corporis/ ringworm infection</strong> is caused by the dermatophyte <em><strong>Trichophyton</strong> <strong>rubrum</strong></em>. It results from invasion and proliferation of the causal fungi in the <strong>stratum corneum</strong> with lesions on the trunk and limbs. <strong>Characteristic lesions</strong> are circular, usually sharply marginated with a raised edge with central resolution.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Pityriasis Rosea (PR)</strong> is an unknown etiology, self-limiting condition that typically lasts between 2 to 10 weeks. It is characterized by a herald patch, followed by a secondary eruption with typical lesions that are oval, annular, erythematous, and plaque-like with a collarette of scales. These lesions commonly appear on the trunk in a \"fir tree\" pattern along lines of cleavage. Differential diagnoses include guttate psoriasis, secondary syphilis, and drug rash. There is no specific treatment for PR; symptomatic treatment is usually sufficient.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Porokeratosis</strong> is a <strong>clonal expansion of keratinocytes </strong>which differentiate abnormally. But they are not hyperproliferative. It may present as single or multiple lesions and may be localized or disseminated.<strong> </strong>Porokeratoses present with<strong> single or multiple papules or plaques </strong>which develop into <strong>annular lesions</strong> with a <strong>thin raised border.</strong></p>",
