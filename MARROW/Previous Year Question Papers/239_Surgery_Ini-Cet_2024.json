It usually signifies <strong>mild</strong> to <strong>moderate chronic vascular occlusive disease. </strong>The pain is brought on by walking, not present on taking the first step. Relieved by rest in both the standing and sitting positions, usually within 5 minutes (option A). The distance that a patient can walk without stopping is known as <strong>claudication distance</strong>. It varies only slightly from day to day. The superficial femoral artery (70%) is the <strong>most commonly </strong>affected artery by claudication and manifests as pain in the <strong>calf</strong> muscles. Aorto-iliac occlusion may cause thigh or buttock claudication. <strong>Leriche's syndrome</strong> occurs due to aortoiliac occlusion and presents with a triad of claudication, impotence, and absent femoral pulses.</p>\n<p><strong>Boyd's classification</strong> of claudication: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grade I: Patient complains of pain after walking. If the patient continues to walk, due to increased blood flow in muscle and opening of collaterals metabolites causing pain are washed away and the <strong>pain subsides</strong>.</li>\n<li>Grade II: <strong>Pain persists</strong> on continuing to walk; but can walk with effort.</li>\n<li>Grade III: The patient has to <strong>take</strong> <strong>rest</strong> to relieve the pain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Rest pain</strong> occurs when the occlusive disease progresses in severity. Though this pain is present during the day, it is exacerbated on lying down at night due to loss of gravity-dependent perfusion of the foot. This may be relieved by hanging the foot out of the bed to restore the gravitational effects.</p>\n<p>Option B: The development of pain on taking the <strong>first step </strong>of walking is a classic sign of <strong>osteoarthritis</strong>. </p>\n<p>Option C: Pain aggravated by standing and relieved by bending forward is seen in <strong>n</strong><strong>eurogenic claudication.</strong> It may be seen in cases of <strong>nerve compression</strong> from lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse or spinal stenosis.</p>",
