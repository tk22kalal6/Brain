The <strong>two ligaments</strong> providing support are&nbsp;<strong>acromioclavicular</strong>(intrinsic ) and&nbsp;<strong>coracoclavicular</strong>(extrinsic). The <strong>acromioclavicular </strong>ligament has a <strong>superior part</strong> that extends between the upper aspect of the clavicle's lateral end and the adjacent acromion. Its <strong>inferior part</strong>, extends between the lower surface of the clavicle's lateral end and the adjoining acromion. Additionally, it serves as an <strong>attachment</strong> site for the <strong>intra-articular disc</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>coracoclavicular ligament</strong> connects the clavicle with the coracoid process of the scapula. Although it is separate from the acromioclavicular joint, it plays a crucial role in <strong>maintaining</strong> the <strong>alignment </strong>of the <strong>acromion</strong> and the <strong>clavicle</strong>. Therefore, it contributes significantly to the suspension mechanism of the scapula. The ligament has two parts -&nbsp;trapezoid and conoid parts.</p>\n<p>The primary cause of injury is <strong>direct impact</strong> to the <strong>lateral aspect</strong> of the shoulder or the acromion process while the arm is in an <strong>adducted</strong> position. It can also be caused by falling onto an <strong>outstretched hand</strong> or <strong>elbow</strong>.</p>\n<p>Standard X-rays are sufficient for diagnosing acromioclavicular joint injuries and should be utilized to assess other potential sources of shoulder pain resulting from trauma. By <strong>comparing</strong> the<strong> coracoclavicular interspace</strong> distance with the contralateral view, the injury can be identified.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/16ca0cb1ef2542acb3801cf7e1835239x1280x935.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",
