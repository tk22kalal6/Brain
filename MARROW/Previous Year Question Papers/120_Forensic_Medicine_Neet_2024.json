      "solution": "<p>The clinical scenario points to <strong>iron toxicity</strong>, which is managed with <strong>deferoxamine</strong> (also known as <strong>desferrioxamine</strong>), <strong>calcium EDETATE</strong> and <strong>DTPA </strong>whereas Dimercaprol, also known as <strong>BAL</strong> (British anti-Lewisite), is used to treat <strong>arsenic, mercury poisoning, and Wilson's disease.</strong></p>\n<p>Large amounts of ferrous salts can be fatal in <strong>children</strong>. Initial symptoms include <strong>abdominal pain</strong>, diarrhea, vomiting, and <strong>gastrointestinal bleeding</strong>. In severe cases, <strong>cyanosis</strong> and hyperventilation due to <strong>acidosis</strong> can develop. This can sometimes be followed by an <strong>asymptomatic phase</strong>. Later, hypoglycemia and hepatic and renal failure can develop. <strong>Pyloric stenosis</strong> and gastric scarring can develop due to its corrosive nature. Ultimately, if left untreated, the child can die.</p>\n<p>The gastric contents can be used for an iron color test to estimate the iron concentration in plasma. As iron tablets are <strong>radiopaque</strong>, an X-ray can be used to assess the number of pills taken. <strong>Deferoxamine (Option B)</strong> is selectively used as a chelating agent to manage cases of<strong> acute iron poisoning</strong>, hemochromatosis, and patients with iron overload from repetitive blood transfusions. Desferrioxamine can be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously <strong>but not orally</strong>. Side effects include pruritus, wheals, rash, and anaphylaxis. </p>\n<p><strong>Deferiprone</strong> and <strong>deferasirox</strong> are other <strong>oral</strong> iron chelators used to treat iron overload in<strong> thalassemia</strong> patients. </p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option C : Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (<strong>EDTA</strong>) is used for <strong>acute lead poisoning.</strong> It is <strong>not suitable</strong> for the management of chronic lead poisoning. The calcium salt of EDTA can be used in the management of<strong> heavy metal poisonings</strong> where the metal in question has a higher affinity for EDTA than calcium in vivo. Because of their lower affinity to EDTA, mercury and arsenic cannot be effectively chelated. </p>\n<p>Option D : Diethylenetriamene pentaacetate (<strong>DTPA</strong>) is a chelating agents which works by binding and holding on to <strong>radioactive materials </strong>(plutonium, americium, and curium) and poisons like iron. <strong>Calcium DTPA</strong> is well tolerated and effective as desferrioxamine in mobilising iron than<strong> Zinc DTPA.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Specific antidotes for poisoning</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ANTIDOTE</strong></td>\n<td><strong>POISONING</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4-methyl pyrazole</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>100% oxygen </strong></td>\n<td>Carbon monoxide, cyanide, methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ammonium chloride </strong></td>\n<td>Phencyclidine, amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Amyl nitrate </strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide, hydrogen sulphide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Atropine</strong></td>\n<td>Carbamate and organophosphorus poisoning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bupropion</strong></td>\n<td>Nicotine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium disodium edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, magnesium, nickel, uranium, zinc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium gluconate </strong></td>\n<td>Precipitates fluorides, magnesium and oxalates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Chlorpromazine</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Deferoxamine</strong></td>\n<td>Iron, aluminium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diazepam</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine, chloroquine, alcohol withdrawal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dicobalt edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dimercaprol (BAL)</strong></td>\n<td>Antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and gold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diphenhydramine</strong></td>\n<td>Phenothiazines and related drugs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disodium calcium edetate</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMPS *, (Unithiol)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Mercury</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMSA ** </strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>D-Penicillamine (Cuprimine) </strong></td>\n<td>Copper, lead, mercury, chromate, nickel, zinc, arsenic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ethanol</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fab fragment</strong></td>\n<td>Digoxin, digitoxin, oleander tea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Flumazenil</strong></td>\n<td>Benzodiazepine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Glucagon</strong></td>\n<td>Propranolol and other beta-blockers toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hydroxocobalamin</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Labetalol hydrochloride</strong></td>\n<td>Hypertensive crisis due to cocaine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methionine</strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methylene blue</strong></td>\n<td>Methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>N-acetylcysteine </strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol, acetaminophen toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nalorphine</strong></td>\n<td>Morphine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Naloxone (Naltrexone)</strong></td>\n<td>Narcotic, opiates, CNS depressants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nicotinamide</strong></td>\n<td>Vacor poisoning, phenylurea pesticide toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pancuronium bromide</strong></td>\n<td>Neuromuscular blocking agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Penicillamine</strong></td>\n<td>Copper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Physostigmine salicylate </strong></td>\n<td>Coma, convulsions from anticholinergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pralidoxime (2-PAM) </strong></td>\n<td>Organophosphorus insecticides, nerve agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Propranolol</strong></td>\n<td>Cocaine intoxication, beta adrenergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Protamine sulphate </strong></td>\n<td>Heparin overdose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prussian blue</strong></td>\n<td>Thallium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pyridoxine (Vit.

It is known for its <strong>bitter-sweet taste</strong> and is absorbed mainly through<strong> ingestion</strong> rather than skin contact. Upon ingestion, ethylene glycol is <strong>metabolized</strong> in the <strong>liver</strong> to several toxic metabolites, including <strong>glycolic acid</strong> and <strong>oxalic acid</strong>, which contribute to its harmful effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Initially</strong>, ethylene glycol poisoning can cause symptoms such as <strong>vomiting, lethargy</strong>, and <strong>ataxia</strong>, progressing to severe effects including tachycardia, tachypnea, and <strong>circulatory collapse</strong> within <strong>12-24 hours</strong>. As the condition progresses, typically within one to three days, patients may experience hypocalcemia, <strong>oliguria, tubular necrosis</strong>, and <strong>acute kidney injury (AKI</strong>). A notable feature of ethylene glycol poisoning is the formation of <strong>calcium oxalate crystals</strong> in the<strong> urine</strong>, which can lead to <strong>renal failure</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>postmortem findings</strong> often include <strong>cerebral edema, chemical meningoencephalitis</strong>, and significant damage to the liver and kidneys. <strong>Oxalate crystals</strong> may be observed in the <strong>brain, spinal cord</strong>, and kidneys, further confirming the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>For treatment, immediate measures include <strong>gastric lavage, activated charcoal</strong>, and administration of ethanol or <strong>4-methyl pyrazole (fomepizole)</strong>, which inhibit the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to prevent further metabolism of ethylene glycol into toxic compounds. Additional treatments such as <strong>intravenous sodium bicarbonate</strong> and <strong>calcium gluconate</strong> are used to address metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia, respectively, while <strong>hemodialysis</strong> is indicated in <strong>severe</strong> <strong>cases</strong> with significant renal impairment or high serum ethylene glycol concentrations.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Methyl alcohol (Methanol)</strong> and Ethylene glycol poisoning can present very similarly.
