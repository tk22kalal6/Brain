The abnormal head impulse test result is due to the VOR being impaired on the side of the vestibular lesion leading to <strong>saccades</strong>. Saccades are <strong>rapid, ballistic movements</strong> of the <strong>eyes</strong> that abruptly try to return to the point of fixation/ gaze.  </p>\n<p>The head impulse test is done by asking the patient to focus on a target. Then, the patient's head is quickly rotated to the left or right. If there is a <strong>deficiency in the VOR</strong>, the <strong>head movement</strong> will be followed by a<strong> catch-up saccade</strong> <strong>in the opposite direction. </strong>Thus, in <strong>left vestibular neuritis, </strong>a <strong>rightward saccade is seen</strong> following a<strong> left-side head rotation</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Vestibular neuritis</strong> is distinguished from central causes of vertigo by its characteristic findings: a <strong>positive head impulse test</strong>, <strong>absence </strong>of <strong>skew deviation</strong>, and spontaneous <strong>unidirectional nystagmus</strong>. <strong>Central vertigo</strong>, on the other hand, presents with a <strong>normal head impulse test, vertical skew deviation, bidirectional nystagmus</strong>, and additional neurological signs like diplopia, weakness, or dysarthria. In acute vestibular syndrome, especially in older patients with vascular risk factors, evaluation for a possible stroke is warranted.</p>\n<p>Vestibular neuritis <strong>resolves</strong> <strong>spontaneously</strong>, but <strong>glucocorticoids</strong> can improve outcomes if administered within 3 days of symptom onset. <strong>Antiviral</strong> medications are only suggested for <strong>Herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome)</strong>. <strong>Vestibular suppressant</strong> medications can reduce <strong>acute</strong> symptoms. Patients should be encouraged to resume normal activity as soon as possible. <strong>Vestibular rehabilitation</strong> therapy can also be tried.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/9d7e8eec04d9445fb4d1493a987e329fx1280x912.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

The image is that of septal perforation; <strong>SMR</strong> (Submucosal resection ) has a higher likelihood of causing the same. </p>\n<p><strong>Septal perforation</strong> can occur after nasal surgery. Features depend on the size of the perforation. Smaller perforations can present with whistling while the larger perforations will present with epistaxis and crust formation. Therefore, <strong>septoplasty</strong> has become a more favored treatment of DNS than SMR due to its conservative approach. </p>\n<p><strong>Septoplasty</strong> is a <strong>conservative</strong> technique in the surgical correction of septal deformity. The key advantage is that it can be carried out as a daycare procedure, most of the bone and cartilage are retained, and complications are less. The deformed septum may corrected by various techniques like scoring the concave side, shaving, and wedge excision.

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical vignette of a woman with hearing loss and pulsatile tinnitus and examination suggesting a mass behind the tympanic membrane and CT image showing a mass in the region of jugular foramen makes <strong>Glomus Jugulare</strong> the likely diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Glomus tumors are the<strong> most common benign</strong> <strong>tumors</strong> of the <strong>middle</strong> <strong>ear</strong>. The tumors comprise <strong>paraganglionic cells</strong> and arise from glomus bodies which resemble carotid bodies. Glomus bodies are present in the <strong>dome of the jugular bulb</strong> and on the <strong>promontory along the course of the tympanic branch</strong> of the <strong>IX cranial nerve</strong>. </p>\n<p>They are most commonly seen in females between the ages of 40-50 years. They are very <strong>slow-growing,</strong> thus it may take years before changes in symptoms are appreciated. It follows the <strong>rule of 10s</strong> - 10% are familial, 10% are multicentric, and 10% are functional (secrete catecholamines).</p>\n<p>Depending on the area from which it arises, glomus tumors are classified into two types: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Glomus jugulare,</strong> arising from the dome of the jugular bulb</li>\n<li><strong>Glomus tympanicum,</strong> arising from the promontory of the middle ear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The presentation of glomus tumors is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intratympanic presentation\n<ul>\n<li>Progressive hearing loss</li>\n<li><strong>Pulsatile tinnitus</strong> is synchronous with pulse and can be stopped by carotid pressure</li>\n<li>Otoscopy: red reflex through the intact tympanic membrane</li>\n<li><strong>Rising sign</strong> when a tumor arises from the floor of the middle ear</li>\n<li><strong>Pulsation or Brown sign:</strong> when the ear canal pressure is raised with Siegel's speculum the tumor pulsates and blanches. This reverses when pressure is released.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Polyp presentation\n<ul>\n<li>Profuse <strong>bleeding</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Otorrhea</strong> if there is a secondary infection</li>\n<li>Red vascular polyp filling the meatus that bleeds easily</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cranial nerve palsies\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dysphagia</strong> and <strong>hoarseness</strong> with unilateral <strong>paralysis</strong> of the <strong>soft</strong> <strong>palate,</strong> and <strong>pharynx</strong> due to IX and X</li>\n<li>Vocal cord paralysis due to X</li>\n<li>Weakness of the trapezius and sternomastoid muscles XI</li>\n<li>Atrophy of half of the tongue XII</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Audible bruit over the mastoid</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They can be diagnosed by CT scan, MRI, four-vessel angiography, brain perfusion and flow studies, embolization, and biopsy. It is treated by surgery, radiation, embolization, or a combination of them. <strong>Phlep sign</strong> is seen in a CT scan of the glomus jugulare tumor. It is erosion of the normal crest of bone between the carotid canal and jugular foramen.</p>\n<p>The following image shows the rising sun sign in the case of glomus jugulare.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/13d81baadd69456bb1eb28a2005c592ax1280x1268.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Glomus tympanicum is a close differential to the jugular tumor, however, it commonly arises from the promontory of the middle ear rather than the jugular bulb and does not show the Phlep sign and it is also found in relation to the temporal bone on CT.</p>\n<p>Option B: Giant cell reparative granuloma accounts for 1–7% of all benign lesions of the jaw. It often arises in the maxilla followed by the mandible and affects children and young adults. It is usually a slow-growing lesion. The fast-growing lesions are rare and despite the innocent histological appearance, have an aggressive behavior mimicking a malignant lesion. The following image shows the CT of the reparative granuloma of the maxilla showing the extension of tumor mass over the pterygoid plates and infratemporal fossa.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5b24a2c2a9064fcbbae3c92293d3337ex482x566.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option D: Acoustic neuromas are noncancerous, usually slow-growing tumors that form along the vestibulocochlear nerve. They arise from Schwann cells. Schwannomas can occur on any cranial or peripheral nerve in the body, but in the brain, acoustic neuromas are the most common schwannomas. The following image depicts the classical ice cream cone appearance of acoustic neuroma on MRI.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/8be5dab3ee6f49e8b57b580ef055dacbx748x892.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Signs in Glomus Tumors</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Sign</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Seen on</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>What is seen</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Rising sun</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Otoscopy</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Tumor arising from floor</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Brown sign</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Otoscopy</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>On increasing the ear canal pressure, tumor pulsates and then blanches</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Phelp sign</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>CT</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Loss of carotico-jugular crest</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
