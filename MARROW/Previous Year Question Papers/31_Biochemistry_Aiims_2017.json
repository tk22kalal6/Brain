      "solution": "<p>The conversion of <strong>pyruvate to oxaloacetate</strong> is an <strong>anaplerotic reaction. </strong>It is catalyzed by <strong>pyruvate carboxylase.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anaplerotic</strong> reactions are chemical reactions that form <strong>intermediates</strong> of a <strong>metabolic pathway.</strong> The above reaction is important in maintaining an adequate concentration of oxaloacetate for the condensation reaction with acetyl-CoA. If acetyl-CoA accumulates, it acts as an activator of pyruvate carboxylase and an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, thereby ensuring an adequate supply of oxaloacetate.</p>\n<p>Other anaplerotic reactions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compounds that are <strong>metabolized to yield propionyl CoA,</strong> which can be <strong>then carboxylated and isomerized to succinyl CoA</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Glutamate and glutamine</strong> are important anaplerotic substrates because they yield α-ketoglutarate as a result of the reactions catalyzed by glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase.</li>\n<li><strong>Transamination of aspartate</strong> leads directly to the formation of oxaloacetate.</li>\n</ul>",
