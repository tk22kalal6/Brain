They mostly arise in the supratentorial region, but can also be seen in the infratentorial region.<br><br>Meningomas are more commonly seen in females and are associated with the NF-2 mutation. Many small meningiomas are found incidentally and are entirely asymptomatic. Most common presentations include headache, paresis and change in mental status. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Gliomas are intra-axial tumours.<br><br>Option C: Ependymoma arise from the neoplastic transformation of the ependyma. They are usually intraventricular, but extraventricular rests of ependymal cells may give rise to cerebral hemisphere tumours.<br><br>Option D: Pilocytic astrocytoma is a benign astrocytoma that typi­cally occurs in children and young adults.
