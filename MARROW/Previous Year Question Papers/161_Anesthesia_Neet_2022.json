      "solution": "<p>The mask in the image is a&nbsp;<strong>non-rebreathing mask</strong>&nbsp;(NRBM). It can be&nbsp;used for patients with COVID-19 infection.</p>\n<p>A NRBM has a&nbsp;<strong>reservoir bag</strong> attached to the mask in order to provide additional reservoir volume. In addition, there is a valve attached, which provides a unidirectional flow of gases. Flutter valves on the side ports prevent room air entrainment, while a valve incorporated between the mask and the reservoir bag prevents the entry of the exhaled gases.</p>\n<p>NRBM can provide the <strong>highest FiO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub></strong>of 0.9 to 1.0. without intubation at the fresh gas flow of 12-15 L/min. They are used for preoxygenation before intubation and post-extubation in covid patients.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A:&nbsp;The venturi mask is a <strong>high-flow, fixed-performance device </strong>that<strong>&nbsp;</strong>delivers a <strong>specific oxygen concentration</strong> to the patient.&nbsp;It is a color-coded device that connects to the oxygen tubing distally and has a nozzle connecting to a mask proximally. Oxygen flows through a central constriction inside the device. Room air enters through surrounding apertures which dilutes the oxygen to the required concentration. The venturi mask is based on Bernoulli's principle.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f6278b25111144a8ad4b48ecd8349c0ax1279x1173.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option B: <strong>Hudson mask</strong> is a simple face mask that delivers oxygen without forming a tight seal against the patient's face. There are holes on either side of Hudson's mask. This provides air entrainment, meeting the peak inspiratory flow and venting out the expired gases.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/246a8cf6dbdb4771b9adc3244ac97a8dx1280x1390.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C:&nbsp;A nebulizer is used to deliver drugs to the breathing system. It generates an aerosol, producing droplets of varying sizes.
