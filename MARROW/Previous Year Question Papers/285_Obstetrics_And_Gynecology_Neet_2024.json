The classical karyotype is <strong>45, XO</strong>. Other variants have structural abnormalities of X chromosomes or mosaic patterns. Some patients may present during infancy. They mainly present with <strong>oedema</strong> of the dorsum of the hand and foot due to<strong> lymphatic stasis.</strong> The most important cause of increased mortality in children with Turner's syndrome is <strong>cardiac</strong> <strong>abnormalities</strong>. </p>\n<p>Turner's syndrome is a common cause of <strong>primary amenorrhea</strong>. During embryogenesis, fetal ovaries develop normally and the absence of a second X chromosome leads to accelerated loss of normally formed oocytes. This gets completed by the age of 2. The ovaries are reduced to atrophic fibrous bands without ova and follicles. These are called <strong>s</strong><strong>treak ovaries</strong>.</p>\n<p>At puberty, they fail to develop secondary sexual characteristics.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/f94250f7aff04efa976e3a2f91053f76x1280x1769.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Eunuchoid body habitus</strong> with <strong>abnormally long legs</strong> is usually seen in <strong>Klinefelter</strong> Syndrome (<strong>47, XXY</strong>).

In complete AIS, the individual is born as a<strong> phenotypically normal female</strong> but generally presents with primary amenorrhea.</p>\n<p>The external genitalia appears <strong>normal</strong>, with absent or scant pubic and axillary hair. The vagina is shortened and <strong>blind-ending</strong> with <strong>an absent uterus and ovaries</strong>. These patients may also present with a history of childhood <strong>inguinal hernias</strong>, due to the presence of undescended testis in the abdomen or in the inguinal canal. Due to the constant conversion of testosterone into estrogen, these individuals have <strong>normal breast development.</strong></p>",

The most frequent location is the lungs (50%), although it can also come from lymph nodes (40%), kidneys, joints, the gastrointestinal system, or as part of a broad miliary infection. It mostly spreads via<strong> the haematogenous route or lymphatics sometimes. </strong></p>\n<p>In Genital tuberculosis, the leading presenting complaints include<strong> infertility, abdominal pain, vaginal discharge</strong>, and suspicion of neoplasm. 10-15% of women are found to be asymptomatic as well. </p>\n<p>The <strong>fallopian tubes</strong> are the<strong> most common site</strong> to be affected. The disease subsequently spreads to other genital organs and the peritoneum. </p>\n<p><strong>Investigations</strong>:</p>\n<p>1. Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (<strong>ESR</strong>), enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (<strong>ELISA</strong>) tests - lgG and IgM, and <strong>Mantoux tests</strong> are done to evaluate the case of genital tuberculosis.

However, if the perineal tear is untreated for <strong>more than 6 months</strong>, dense <strong>scar</strong> tissue forms and making the <strong>surgery difficult.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Degrees of perineal laceration</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Degree</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>Description</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>First-degree</strong></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div class=\"bulletIndent1\">Injury to the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the perineum and vaginal epithelium only.

      "solution": "<p>The <strong>most common site</strong> for tubal ligation is the <strong>isthmus</strong> of the fallopian tube due to its <strong>uniform muscle thickness</strong>, which <strong>facilitates effective occlusion</strong>.</p>\n<p>The isthmus, being a <strong>narrow segment</strong> closest to the uterine wall, provides an <strong>ideal location</strong> for surgical intervention. This site ensures a more reliable and efficient ligation, <strong>minimizing</strong> the risk of<strong> complications </strong>and maximizing the <strong>success rate </strong>of the procedure. The uniformity of the muscle layer at this location allows for a <strong>consistent occlusion technique</strong>. Common procedures for tubal ligation at this site include the <strong>Pomeroy method</strong>, where a loop of the tube is tied and excised, and other techniques like the <strong>Falope ring</strong> or the <strong>electrocoagulation</strong> method.</p>\n<p>While the <strong>ampulla</strong>, which has a larger-diameter segment lateral to the isthmus, is also a part of the fallopian tube, it is less frequently chosen for tubal ligation. Additionally, ligation at the isthmus allows for the possibility of <strong>future reversal</strong>, should the patient desire to <strong>conceive again</strong>, making it a favourable choice for women considering sterilization.</p>\n<p>The <strong>fallopian tube</strong> consists of <strong>three layers</strong>: the <strong>mesosalpinx</strong>, an outer mesothelial layer serving as<strong> visceral peritoneum</strong>; the <strong>myosalpinx</strong>, which has an <strong>inner circular smooth muscle</strong> layer for pressure during contractions and an <strong>outer longitudinal layer</strong> for <strong>tube movement</strong>; and the <strong>endosalpinx</strong>, an inner<strong> columnar epithelium </strong>with <strong>ciliated</strong> and secretory cells, featuring longitudinal folds. Together, these layers transport the ovum efficiently toward the uterine cavity.</p>\n<p>Note: The<strong> interstitial portion</strong> of the fallopian tube is the <strong>narrowest segment</strong>, located within the uterine wall, and it forms the <strong>tubal ostia</strong> that <strong>opens</strong> into the <strong>endometrial cavity</strong>.</p>",

It is the <strong>most common type</strong> of endometrial cancer, particularly associated with genetic mutations such as PTEN, KRAS, CTNNB1 (beta-catenin), and MSI (microsatellite instability). These genetic alterations are characteristic of<strong> Type I endometrial cancers</strong>, which have a better prognosis compared to other types.</p>\n<p> The histopathological examination (HPE) shows glandular structures that resemble normal endometrial glands but are more crowded and irregular. The cells show <strong>nuclear atypia </strong>with mitotic activity. </p>\n<p>This cancer is generally <strong>hormone-dependent (Type I endometrial cancer) </strong>and often carries a better prognosis compared to other forms of endometrial cancer.
