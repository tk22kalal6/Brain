There are two primary types of non-union: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Hypertrophic</strong> - where <strong>callus formation is present</strong> but does not bridge the fracture site</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Atrophic</strong> - characterized by <strong>minimal or no</strong> attempt at <strong>callus formation</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>For <strong>hypertrophic non-union</strong><strong> wi</strong><strong>thout</strong><strong> deformity</strong>, conservative treatment using <strong>functional bracing or rigid fixation</strong> alone (internally or externally) can promote union. However, in cases of <strong>atrophic non-union</strong>, fixation alone is insufficient, requiring the <strong>excision</strong> of fibrous tissues in the fracture gap and sclerotic bone ends, followed by the application of <strong>bone grafts</strong> around the fracture.</span></p>",
