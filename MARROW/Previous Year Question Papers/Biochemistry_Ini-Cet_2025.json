The enzyme deficient in this disease is sphingomyelinase.<br><br>Niemann-Pick disease presents in infancy and usually leads to death by 2-3 years of age. The affected infants are normal at birth, but deteriorate rapidly with failure to thrive. The usual clinical presentation includes hepatosplenomegaly and rapid psychomotor retardation.<br><br>Niemann-Pick disease occurs due to the deficient activity of acid sphingomyelinase enzyme. There is an extensive accumulation of sphingomyelin in the monocyte-macrophage system. Lipid-laden foam cells are observed in bone marrow and lymph nodes. The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the sphingomyelinase levels in the peripheral leucocytes. <br><br>This condition is managed with supportive treatment, such as physical therapy and a feeding tube for nutrition. Olipudase alfa has been recently approved for non-CNS manifestations of Niemann-Pick disease. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option B: Hexosaminidase A deficiency is seen in Tay-Sachs disease. While it also presents with progressive neurodegeneration and macular cherry-red spot, there is no organomegaly and lysosomes with onion skin are seen. Startle reflex is exaggerated in Tay-Sachs disease. <br><br>Option C: Glucocerebrosidase deficiency is seen in Gaucher disease. The patients present with hematological abnormalities, organomegaly, and skeletal manifestations in the form of bone pain and pathological fractures. Bone marrow examination shows macrophages with a characteristic crumbled tissue paper appearance.<br><br>Option D: Arylsulfatase A deficiency is seen in Metachromatic leukodystrophy.
