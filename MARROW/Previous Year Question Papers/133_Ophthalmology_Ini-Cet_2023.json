      "solution": "<p><strong>RK (Radial Keratotomy) would not be recommended</strong> to this <strong>boxer</strong> who wants vision correction surgery.<br /><br /><strong>Radial keratotomy (RK)</strong> involves making <strong>deep</strong> <strong>(90% of corneal thickness) radial incisions</strong> in the<strong> peripheral part of cornea</strong> leaving the <strong>central 4 mm optical zone</strong>. These incisions on healing <strong>flatten the central cornea</strong> <strong>reducing its refractive power</strong>. This procedure was done to <strong>correct low to moderate myopia (2 to 6 D)</strong>. However, because of its disadvantages and advent of<strong> safe techniques (LASIK and PRK)</strong>, <strong>RK is now obsolete</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Disadvantages</strong> of RK: <br />- <strong>Cornea is weakened</strong>, increasing chances of <strong>globe rupture following trauma </strong>(RK more than PRK). Hence this procedure should not be done for patients who are at <strong>high risk of blunt trauma</strong>, such as<strong> sports persons</strong> and <strong>military personnel</strong>. <br />- <strong>Irregular astigmatism</strong> from<strong> uneven healing</strong>.<br />- <strong>Glare at night</strong>. <br /><br /><strong>Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)</strong> (Option C) is the <strong>most commonly done surgery </strong>for <strong>myopia</strong>.
