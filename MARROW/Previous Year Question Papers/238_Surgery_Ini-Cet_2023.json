Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) </strong>is <strong>commonly</strong> used because of its improved spatial resolution. Sestamibi combined with CT can be used to detect smaller parathyroid tissues. It can also detect ectopic glands in the mediastinum or in the deeper cervical region.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/99bc0ed00c7445fd83f6c172e98038cbx512x512.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Ultrasonography:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is inexpensive and noninvasive.</li>\n<li><strong>Mediastinal </strong>parathyroid tissue<strong> cannot </strong>be detected because USG cannot penetrate the sternum or clavicle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nuclear medicine scanning with <strong>radiolabeled Sestamibi</strong> (Tc99 sestamibi scan) is also a widely used technique. Sestamibi accumulates in parathyroid adenomas. This radionuclide is concentrated in the thyroid and parathyroid tissue but usually washes out of normal thyroid tissue in under an hour. It persists in abnormal parathyroid tissue. Tc99 sestamibi scan is a 2D study, so <strong>SPECT sestamibi</strong>, which is a <strong>3D study</strong> is preferred over Tc99 sestamibi.  scan. <strong>SPECT sestamibi</strong> has <strong>high specificity</strong> and <strong>sensitivity</strong> as compared to Tc99 sestamibi.</p>\n<p><strong>MRI</strong> is <strong>rarely used</strong> because of its <strong>low sensitivity</strong>. Occasionally, MRI may be indicated in pregnant patients in whom ultrasound is noninformative because MRI avoids radiation exposure.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Radionuclide agents and their uses</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Radionuclide agent</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Use</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Medronate (MDP) (most common)</p>\n<p>Tc-99m Oxidronate (HMDP)</p>\n<p>Tc-99m HEDP</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Bone imaging</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Apcitide</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Peptide imaging of DVT</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Arcitumomab</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Monoclonal antibody for colorectal cancer</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m albumin colloid</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Imaging of RES (liver/spleen)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m bicisate (ECD)</p>\n<p>Tc-99m exametazine (HMPAO</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cerebral perfusion imaging</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Depreotide</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Somatostatin receptor-bearing pulmonary masses</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m disofenin (DISIDA)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hepatobiliary imaging</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Glucepatate</p>\n<p>Tc-99m Meriatide</p>\n<p>Tc-99m Succimer (DMSA)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Renal imaging</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Human Serum Albumin(HAS)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Imaging of cardiac chambers</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Lidofenin (HIDA)</p>\n<p>Tc-99m Mebrofenin</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hepatobiliary imaging</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m nofetumomab Merpentan NR-LU-10</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Monoclonal antibody Fab fragment for imaging small cell lung cancer</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Pentetate (DTPA)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Renal imaging and functional studies; radioaerosol ventilation imaging</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Pyrophosphate (PYP)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Avid infarct imaging</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Red Blood Cells (RBCs)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Imaging of GI bleeds, cardiac chambers</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Sestamibi</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Myocardial perfusion imaging; breast tumor imaging, parathyroid gland</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Sulfur colloid (SC)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Imaging of RES( liver/spleen), gastric emptying, GI bleeds</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Tc-99m Teboroxime</p>\n<p>Tc-99m Tetrofosmin</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Myocardial perfusion imaging</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><sup>68</sup>Gallium</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Binds to somatostatin receptors</p>\n<p>Detection of new neuroendocrine tumors</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
