The audiogram shows <strong>conductive deafness</strong>&nbsp;along with Carhart's notch (<strong>dip </strong>in<strong> bone conduction </strong>at<strong> 2000 Hz</strong>).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>These findings are highly suggestive of&nbsp;<strong>otosclerosis</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ototoxicity, Meniere&rsquo;s disease, and noise-induced hearing loss cause <strong>sensory neural hearing loss (SNHL)</strong> and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>not conductive hearing loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Otosclerosis</strong> is caused by bony overgrowth involving the enchondral layer of the <strong>bony otic capsule</strong>. It presents with <strong>bilateral</strong> progressive <strong>conductive hearing loss</strong> and tinnitus. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance and can&nbsp;<strong>worsen</strong>&nbsp;with stress and hormonal changes like during <strong>pregnancy</strong> and <strong>menopause</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stapedial</strong> otosclerosis is the most common type of otosclerosis. Here the lesion starts just in front of the oval window in an area called <strong>fistula ante fenestrae</strong>.</p>\n<p>The presence of a <strong>reddish hue</strong> on the promontory through the tympanic membrane, known as the <strong>Schwartze sign</strong>, suggests an active focus.&nbsp;<strong>PTA</strong> shows <strong>loss of air conduction with air-bone gap</strong>, more for <strong>lower frequencies</strong> and Carhart's notch may be seen.&nbsp;Tympanometry shows an <strong>As</strong> type of tympanogram in which there is reduced compliance at or near the ambient air pressure.</p>\n<p>Medical management with <strong>sodium fluoride</strong> is used in the active stage.
