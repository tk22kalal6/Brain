      "solution": "<p><strong>NRG-1</strong> (Neuregulin-1) is not a marker for <strong>gastrointestinal stromal tumors</strong> (GISTs).</p>\n<p><strong>GIST</strong> are the most common <strong>mesenchymal</strong> tumor of the <strong>abdomen,</strong> the <strong>stomach</strong> being the most common site. They arise from the <strong>interstitial cells</strong> of <strong>Cajal,</strong> the pacemaker cells of the GIT. GIST is seen in the <strong>5th</strong> to <strong>6th decade</strong> of life and has an <strong>equal preponderance</strong> among males and females. Most patients present with <strong>haematemesis, melena,</strong> or <strong>vague abdominal</strong> pain. The most common indications for surgery include <strong>bleeding</strong> and <strong>obstruction.</strong></p>\n<p>The GIST may occur in a <strong>sporadic</strong> form or as part of <strong>familial syndromes.</strong> In sporadic GIST, the most common mutations seen are gain-of-function mutation in KIT (75-80%) and PDGFRA mutation (8%). Microscopically, GIST has <strong>elongated spindle cells</strong> or plumper epithelioid cells, or a mixed pattern.</p>\n<p>The below image shows the microscopy of GIST composed of bundles, or fascicles, of spindle-shaped tumor cells.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a9bf9b67e36847358296aa149b9b4ea8x1280x1033.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Succinate dehydrogenase</strong> (SDH)-deficient GIST is a subset of wild-type GIST seen with Carney triad or Carney-Stratakis syndrome. </p>\n<p><strong>Imatinib</strong> can be used to treat GIST with mutations in <strong>KIT</strong> or <strong>PDGFRA.</strong> Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) - deficient GIST is imatinib-resistant, so sunitinib, sorafenib, or regorafenib can be used instead. </p>\n<p>During surgical resection of GIST, care must be taken to prevent capsule rupture, which causes <strong>seeding</strong> of <strong>nearby tissues</strong> leading to <strong>relapse</strong> in <strong>100%</strong> of the <strong>cases.</strong> If capsule rupture occurs, adjuvant therapy with imatinib is indicated regardless of tumor extent.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>KIT (CD117):</strong> This is the most well-known marker for GISTs. About 85% of GISTs show mutations in the KIT gene, leading to the expression of the KIT protein on the cell surface. KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and its activation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of GISTs.</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>SDH (Succinate</strong> Dehydrogenase): SDH mutations are associated with a subset of GISTs, particularly those that are KIT and PDGFRA wild-type. Loss of SDH function is characteristic of this subgroup, and SDH deficiency can be demonstrated through immunohistochemistry.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>PDGFRA</strong> (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha): Mutations in the PDGFRA gene account for approximately 5-10% of GISTs. Similar to KIT, PDGFRA is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and mutations in this gene can lead to the development of GISTs.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)</h3><p><strong>M/C mesenchymal tumor</strong> of GIT arising from <strong>interstitial cells of Cajal</strong> (pacemaker cells of GIT). <strong>Stomach is the m/c site.</strong></p>\n<p>GISTs express:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>c-KIT (CD117)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>PDGF receptor A</strong></li>\n<li><strong>CD34</strong></li>\n<li><strong>SDH</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clinical Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peaks at 60 years of age.</li>\n<li>M/C symptom: Upper GI<strong> bleeding</strong></li>\n<li>Other symptoms: Pain, lump, perforation, incidental finding</li>\n<li><strong>Carney's Triad:</strong> Sporadic GIST, Paraganglioma, Pulmonary chondroma</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Management:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IOC for <strong>primary </strong>GIST:<strong> CECT </strong>abdomen</li>\n<li>IOC for <strong>recurrent </strong>GIST:<strong> PET-CT</strong></li>\n<li><strong>IHC </strong>markers: <strong>CD117/C-KIT </strong>(M/C), <strong>DOG 1</strong> (most specific), CD 34</li>\n<li>Route of metastasis: Hematogenous</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following image shows microscopy of GIST composed of spindle-shaped tumor cells:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/303296bfa2ad4afcbbed1a6e4a12a671x1280x1033.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><ul>\n<li><strong>Fletcher's</strong> classification (<strong>Tumor size</strong> &amp; <strong>No. of mitotic figures</strong>) is used to classify the tumors according to their malignancy risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Prognosis</strong> is determined by: Mitotic index, tumor size &amp; location of tumor (Stomach GISTs are less aggressive).</li>\n<li><strong>Complete surgical resection</strong> is the mainstay treatment.

Progressive <strong>dilation</strong> of the <strong>aortic root</strong> and valve ring results from the <strong>loss </strong>of <strong>medial support</strong>, leading to severe aortic incompetence. Additionally, medial weakening increases the <strong>risk</strong> of <strong>intimal tears</strong>, which can initiate <strong>intramural hematomas</strong>. These hematomas may cleave through layers of the aortic media, potentially causing <strong>aortic dissection</strong>.

      "solution": "<p>Anaphylaxis is characterised by all of the above features except for hypertension. It causes hypotension.</p>\n<p>Anaphylaxis is a <strong>severe,</strong> potentially <strong>life-threatening allergic reaction</strong> that occurs rapidly and affects the whole body. It is characterized by a sudden release of <strong>histamines</strong> and other chemicals from the <strong>immune system</strong> in response to an <strong>allergen,</strong> such as certain foods, medications, insect stings, or latex. The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to a few hours after exposure to the allergen.</p>\n<p>Clinically, anaphylaxis can present with a combination of symptoms that typically include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Respiratory</strong> Symptoms: Patients often experience wheezing and respiratory distress due to bronchoconstriction. Other signs may include shortness of breath, coughing, and a feeling of tightness in the chest.</li>\n<li><strong>Skin</strong> Symptoms: Urticaria (hives) and angioedema (swelling of the skin and mucous membranes) are common. These skin reactions usually develop rapidly, often within minutes to two hours of exposure to the allergen.</li>\n<li><strong>Cardiovascular</strong> Symptoms: Hypotension (low blood pressure) is a key indicator of anaphylaxis. Patients may also experience tachycardia (increased heart rate) and, in severe cases, shock.</li>\n<li><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> Symptoms: Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps can occur, particularly if the anaphylaxis is triggered by food allergens.</li>\n<li><strong>Neurological</strong> Symptoms: Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness can occur due to the sudden drop in blood pressure and reduced oxygen supply to the brain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Specific diagnostic <strong>criteria</strong> for anaphylaxis include the presence of <strong>acute</strong> onset <strong>symptoms</strong> involving the <strong>skin, mucosal</strong> tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula), plus <strong>respiratory compromise</strong> (e.g., <strong>dyspnea, wheezing-bronchospasm, stridor,</strong> reduced peak expiratory flow), or <strong>hypotension</strong> or associated symptoms of <strong>end-organ dysfunction</strong> (e.g., hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence). Alternatively, it can be diagnosed if <strong>two or more</strong> of the following occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen: involvement of the <strong>skin-mucosal</strong> tissue, <strong>respiratory</strong> compromise, <strong>hypotension</strong>, or persistent <strong>gastrointestinal</strong> symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Prompt treatment</strong> is critical in <strong>managing anaphylaxis.</strong> The <strong>first-line</strong> treatment is the immediate administration of <strong>intramuscular epinephrine,</strong> which counteracts the effects of histamines and other chemicals released during the reaction. Additional treatments may include <strong>antihistamines, corticosteroids,</strong> and <strong>bronchodilators</strong> to manage symptoms and prevent further complications.</p>\n<p>Patients with a history of <strong>anaphylaxis</strong> are typically advised to carry an <strong>epinephrine auto-injector </strong>at all times and to seek emergency medical care immediately if they experience symptoms of anaphylaxis. Long-term management may involve identifying and avoiding known allergens, as well as potentially undergoing allergen immunotherapy in certain cases.</p>",

M. tuberculosis recruits a host protein <strong>coronin</strong> to block the fusion of phagosome and lysosome. Th1 response to M. tuberculosis is mounted about three weeks following the infection. The antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present mycobacterial antigens to the T-cells in the lymph nodes and release <strong>IL-12</strong> and <strong>IL-18</strong> to cause the differentiation of <strong>T-cells</strong> into <strong>Th1</strong> cells. Th1 cells produce <strong>IFN-γ.</strong> IFN-γ is the critical step in the body's defense against M. tuberculosis.

When anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 are coadministered, the survival becomes four times that of control. From this, it can be inferred that<strong> both CD4 and CD8 cells take part in allograft rejection</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Rejection</strong> is a process in which <strong>T lymphocytes</strong> and <strong>antibodies</strong> produced against graft antigens react against and destroy tissue grafts. The major antigenic differences between a donor and recipient that result in the rejection of transplants are differences in <strong>HLA alleles</strong>. Following transplantation, the recipient’s T cells recognize donor HLA antigens from the graft by two pathways. The graft antigens are either presented directly to recipient T cells by graft antigen-presenting cells (APCs), or the graft antigens are picked up by host APCs, processed, and presented to host T cells. These are called the <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>indirect</strong> pathways of recognition of alloantigens. Both lead to the activation of <strong>CD8+ T cells</strong>, which develop into <strong>cytotoxic T lymphocytes</strong> and <strong>CD4+ T cells</strong>, which become cytokine-producing effector cells, mainly <strong>Th1 cells</strong>. </p>\n<p>Graft rejection is classified into hyperacute, acute, and chronic, based on clinical and pathologic features : </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hyperacute rejection</strong> is mediated by <strong>preformed antibodies</strong> specific for antigens on <strong>graft endothelial</strong> cells. </li>\n<li><strong>Acute rejection</strong> is mediated by <strong>T cells</strong> and antibodies that are activated by alloantigens in the graft. </li>\n<li><strong>Chronic rejection</strong> is an indolent form of graft damage that occurs over months or years, leading to progressive loss of graft function. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Methods of increasing graft survival :</p>\n<p>In<strong> kidney</strong> transplants, there is substantial benefit if all the polymorphic <strong>HLA alleles</strong> are <strong>matched</strong>.

It occurs as a late toxicity of cancer treatment; <strong>radiation </strong>(option D) and the radiomimetic <strong>alkylating agents</strong> such as busulfan, nitrosourea, or procarbazine (with a latent period of 5–7 years); or the <strong>DNA topoisomerase inhibitors</strong> (2-year latency). Acquired <strong>aplastic anemia</strong>, <strong>Fanconi anemia</strong>, and other constitutional marrow failure diseases can evolve into MDS.</p>\n<p><strong>Anemia</strong> dominates the early course. Most symptomatic patients complain of the gradual onset of fatigue and weakness, dyspnea, and pallor. <strong>Platelets</strong> also are <strong>large</strong> and lack granules. In functional studies, they may show marked abnormalities, and patients may have bleeding symptoms despite seemingly adequate numbers. Neutrophils are <strong>hypo-granulated</strong>; have <strong>ringed</strong>, or abnormally segmented nuclei; contain <strong>Döhle bodies</strong>; and may be functionally deficient. Circulating <strong>myeloblasts</strong> usually correlate with marrow blast numbers, and their quantity is important for <strong>classification</strong> and <strong>prognosis</strong>. </p>\n<p>The <strong>bone marrow</strong> is usually <strong>normal</strong> or <strong>hypercellular</strong>, but in about 20% of cases, it is sufficiently hypocellular to lead to confusion with aplastic anemia. The following are commonly observed: dyserythropoietic changes (especially nuclear abnormalities) and <strong>ringed sideroblasts</strong> in the erythroid lineage; hypogranulation and <strong>hyposegmentation </strong>in granulocytic precursors, with an increase in myeloblasts; and megakaryocytes showing reduced numbers of or disorganized nuclei. </p>\n<p>Only <strong>hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</strong> offers a cure for MDS.

It helps maintain tissue homeostasis and prevents the uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to cancer.

Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common cause, followed by prothrombin G20210A mutation.</p>\n<p>The Leiden mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The mutation makes Factor V resistant to cleavage and inactivation by protein C. This leads to the inactivation of an important antithrombotic counterregulatory pathway.</p>\n<p>Protein C, Protein S, and Antithrombin III deficiency are rare causes of primary hypercoagulability.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Protein C deficiency</strong> causes thrombosis in teenagers. It may also be induced by liver dysfunction, vitamin K antagonists, renal failure, DIC, and active thrombosis.</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Antithrombin III</strong> forms a complex with thrombin by binding to heparin on endothelial cells. This complex inhibits coagulation. Its deficiency presents as early-age thrombosis (less than 50 years old) and carries the highest risk for thrombotic events among the inherited thrombophilias.</p>\n<p>Option D: The <strong>prothrombin G20210A mutation</strong> results in increased levels of prothrombin, which demonstrates a higher risk for arterial and venous thrombotic events.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Hypercoagulable states</h3><p>Primary (Genetic Conditions):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mutations in factor V (Most common)</li>\n<li>Antithrombin III deficiency</li>\n<li>Protein C or S deficiency</li>\n<li>Fibrinolysis defects</li>\n<li>Homocysteinemia</li>\n<li>Allelic variations in prothrombin levels</li>\n<li>Mutations in the methyl tetra hydro folate (MTHF) gene</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Secondary (Acquired Conditions):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prolonged bed rest or immobilization</li>\n<li>Homocysteinemia</li>\n<li>Tissue damage (Surgery, fracture, burns)</li>\n<li>Cancer</li>\n<li>Myocardial infarction, Prosthetic cardiac valves</li>\n<li>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)</li>\n<li>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</li>\n<li>Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome</li>\n</ul>",
