      "solution": "The release of insulin after glucose administration is biphasic, in which insulin secretion increases initially and is maintained at that level.<br><br>After a rise in blood glucose to a level that is 2-3 times normal, there is a sudden increase in plasma insulin due to the release of preformed insulin. Since this preformed pool is limited, the peak insulin level is not sustained and gradually declines. With persistent hyperglycemia, insulin levels rise again, this time due to the secretion of newly synthesized insulin. This second phase is slower, more prolonged, and continues until a plateau is reached.<br><br>This can be understood from the following graphical representation of plasma insulin levels:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/67fd7304bac2454fa39222e9877921e0x1280x1231.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",

      "solution": "The symptoms experienced by the patient can be explained by decreased pO₂, causing cerebral vasodilation, leading to fluid leakage from the intravascular space.<br><br>The patient's presentation is characteristic of acute mountain sickness (AMS), which is a neurological condition that appears 6-12 hours after going to a high altitude, resulting from reduced pO2. AMS is likely to be seen after an ascent to more than 2500 metres, but can also be seen at lower altitudes (1500-2500 m). It is mainly diagnosed based on symptoms such as headache, nausea, tiredness (discomfort), and dizziness, since there are usually very few physical signs. <br><br>The low pO₂ leads to hypoxic cerebral vasodilation, which increases cerebral blood flow and raises capillary hydrostatic pressure. This, in turn, increases capillary permeability and causes fluid to leak into the brain tissues, producing symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness, and discomfort. This is known as high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE).<br><br>AMS minaly results from rapid ascent to higher altitudes and is best prevented by gradual ascent with time for acclimatization.<br><br>Mild AMS is managed by halting ascent, acetazolamide, and descent if needed. Moderate AMS requires descent, oxygen, acetazolamide or dexamethasone, and possibly hyperbaric therapy. HACE is treated with urgent descent, oxygen, and dexamethasone, while high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) requires descent, oxygen, warmth, and nifedipine, with hyperbaric therapy if evacuation is delayed.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Following ascent to high altitude, there is hyperventilation leading to the washout of CO2, causing respiratory alkalosis. To compensate, the kidneys reduce the excretion of H+ ions and increase the excretion of HCO3-. So a decrease in HCO3- concentration is seen instead of an increase.<br><br>Option C: Initially, hypoxia-induced hyperventilation lowers pCO₂, producing respiratory alkalosis with reduced H⁺ in blood and CSF. Later, renal compensation increases HCO₃⁻ excretion, bringing CSF pH back toward normal with a relative rise in H⁺ compared to the initial state. However, this change in H⁺ is not the cause of cerebral vasodilation, which is primarily driven by decreased pO₂.<br><br>Option D: Decreased pO₂ (hypoxia) induces cerebral vasodilation and not vasoconstriction. Hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction is seen in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to an increased pulmonary capillary pressure and development of pulmonary edema, also known as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).<br><br>Pearl PM1009: Acclimatization to high altitude<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn1.dailyrounds.org/uploads/07859b7f9cce4e0ab7654ab13244b120x1061x606.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
