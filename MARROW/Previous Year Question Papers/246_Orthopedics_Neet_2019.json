If there is an associated <strong>femoral neck fracture</strong>, a <strong>closed reduction</strong> <strong>should not be attempted</strong> as it can lead to the displacement of the femoral neck and disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head.</p>\n<p>In closed reduction the following steps are done:</p>\n<p>The pelvis is kept in a <strong>steady</strong> position and <strong>traction</strong> is applied <strong>in line</strong> of the <strong>femur</strong> with the knee flexed at <strong>90 degrees</strong>. The <strong>hip</strong> is then <strong>flexed</strong> maintaining the traction along with <strong>internal rotation</strong> and <strong>adduction. </strong>This is called <strong>Allis' maneuver</strong>.

The complications include joint stiffness, <strong>malunion (more common)</strong>, carpal tunnel syndrome, subluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint, Sudeck's dystrophy, and rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon.
