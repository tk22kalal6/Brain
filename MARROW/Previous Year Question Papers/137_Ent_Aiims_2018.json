      "solution": "<p>In caloric testing,<strong> cold</strong> water irrigation produces <strong>h</strong><strong>orizontal nystagmus</strong> towards the<strong> opposite side</strong>&nbsp;of irrigation. The direction of nystagmus can be remembered by the mnemonic,&nbsp;<strong>COWS</strong> (cold&ndash;opposite, warm&ndash;same).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The mechanism for the nystagmus is the creation of a<strong> temperature gradient</strong>&nbsp;by the cold water, which<strong> pulls the cupula away from the utricle,</strong> causing nystagmus towards the oppsite side.&nbsp;As the <strong>horizontal semicircular canal</strong> is closer to the outer ear canal, most of the response comes from it and the nystagmus is horizontal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>Fitzgerald&ndash;Hallpike test</strong>&nbsp;(bithermal caloric test) is done to assess this phenomenon. The patient lies in a <strong>supine</strong> position with&nbsp;<strong>head tilted forward at a 30&deg;</strong> angle, ensuring the horizontal canal becomes vertical. Alternatingly, <strong>water</strong> at temperatures of <strong>30&deg;C</strong> and <strong>44&deg;C</strong> (7&deg; below and above normal body temperature, respectively) is irrigated into the ears for a duration of 40 seconds each. The examiner closely observes the patient's eyes for the emergence of nystagmus until its endpoint is reached. The time taken from the start of irrigation to the endpoint of nystagmus is recorded and plotted on a calorigram.</p>\n<p>If <strong>no nystagmus</strong> is evoked from either ear, the <strong>test is repeated</strong> with water at a temperature of <strong>20&deg;C</strong> for a duration of 4 minutes before labeling the labyrinth dead. A 5-minute interval should be allowed between testing each ear to ensure accurate results.</p>",

Then, the patient's neck is extended 20 degrees below the horizontal.
