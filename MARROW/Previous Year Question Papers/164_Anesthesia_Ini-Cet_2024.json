      "solution": "<p>The depth of compression should be <strong>at least 5cm</strong> to ensure high-quality CPR in an adult cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p>The foundation of CPR is <strong>high-quality chest compressions</strong>. Compressing the chest pumps blood <strong>from the heart to the brain </strong>and then to the rest of the body. Each time the compressions are stopped, the blood flow from the heart decreases significantly. Once resumed, it takes several compressions to bring the blood flow back up to the levels present before the interruption.</p>\n<p>The <strong>components </strong>of high-quality chest compressions in adults are as follows :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Position victim</strong> - Position the victim face up on a <strong>firm, flat surface</strong>. This allows compression of the heart to create adequate blood flow.</li>\n<li><strong>Compression-to-ventilation ratio</strong> - <strong>Single rescuers </strong>should use the compression-to-ventilation ratio of <strong>30 compressions to 2 breaths </strong>when giving CPR to victims of any age.</li>\n<li><strong>Compression rate</strong> - Compress at a rate of <strong>100 to 120/min</strong>. This rate is the same for compression in all cardiac arrest victims.</li>\n<li><strong>Compression depth</strong> - Compress the chest <strong>at least 5cm</strong>. Compressing the chest more than 6 cm in adults may decrease the effectiveness of the compression and cause injuries. Using a CPR-quality feedback device can help reach the optimal depth.</li>\n<li><strong>Chest recoil</strong> - Allow the chest to <strong>recoil completely </strong>after each compression. This allows blood to flow into the heart. To help ensure complete recoil, <strong>avoid leaning</strong> on the chest between compressions. Chest compression and chest reoil times should be about equal.</li>\n<li><strong>Interruptions in chest compressions</strong> - Minimize interruptions in chest compression. the proportion of time that rescuers perform chest compressions during CPR is called chest compression fraction (CCF). A CCF of <strong>80% or highe</strong>r should be the goal.</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: High quality CPR for adults</h3><ul>\n<li>Push hard:&nbsp;<strong>5-6cm </strong>depth</li>\n<li>Push fast:&nbsp;<strong>100-120/min</strong>&nbsp;frequency</li>\n<li>Allow for <strong>complete chest recoil</strong></li>\n<li>Minimize interruptions in compressions <strong>&lt;10 seconds</strong></li>\n<li>Avoid excessive ventilation</li>\n<li>Rotate compressor every<strong>&nbsp;2 min</strong>&nbsp;or earlier if fatigued</li>\n<li>If no advanced airway,&nbsp;<strong>30:2&nbsp;</strong>compression-ventilation ratio</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Attempt to improve CPR quality if :</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quantitative waveform capnography -&nbsp;<strong>PETCO2 &lt;10mmHg</strong>,&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Intra-arterial pressure -&nbsp;If relaxation phase (<strong>diastolic) pressure &lt;20mmHg</strong></li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Adult cardiac arrest algorithm (Updated as per 2020 guidelines)</h3><p>The adult cardiac arrest algorithm is based on the AHA guidelines as shown below.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2bdbdbe380bd43f59ef07a42a15ff9bax1280x3518.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Loss of lumbar sympathetic outflow</strong> will lead to a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (DBP).</p>\n<p>Loss or blockade of the lumbar sympathetic chain (<strong>spinal anaesthesia</strong>) causes dilation of capacitance (venous) vessels. This leads to a decrease in diastolic blood pressure and subsequent orthostatic lightheadedness or syncope. </p>\n<p><strong>Vasodilation</strong> is more marked on the <strong>venous</strong> than on the arterial side of the circulation, resulting in blood pooling in the venous capacitance vessels. This reduction in circulating blood volume is well tolerated at low levels of spinal anaesthesia in healthy patients. With an increasing level of block, this effect becomes more marked, and venous return becomes gravity-dependent. If venous return decreases too much, cardiac output and organ perfusion decline sharply.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Systemic infusion of <strong>alpha-adrenergic blocker</strong> will minimally decrease diastolic BP, not significantly like in loss of lumbar sympathetic outflow.</p>\n<p>Option C: Systemic infusion of<strong> smooth muscle relaxants</strong> like Sildenafil, which is a PDE 5 inhibitor (increases cGMP), does not cause a decrease in DBP.</p>\n<p>Option D: Systemic infusion of <strong>beta-1 adrenergic agonist</strong> increases systolic BP and heart rate.</p>",
