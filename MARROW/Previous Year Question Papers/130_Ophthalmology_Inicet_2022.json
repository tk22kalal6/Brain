      "solution": "<p>The actions carried out by the superior oblique muscle are <strong>intorsion</strong>, <strong>depression</strong>, and <strong>abduction</strong>.</p>\n<p>There are <strong>six</strong> extraocular muscles for each eye. Four rectus muscles namely - superior, inferior, medial, and lateral recti. The oblique muscles are two - superior oblique and inferior oblique. These muscles are responsible for the movements of the eye which can be either unilateral or binocular movements.</p>\n<p>The superior oblique muscle originates from the apex of the orbit, turns around the trochlea, and inserts into the sclera behind the equator. The <strong>oblique</strong> direction of the tendon is responsible for its rotatory effect (intorsion), in addition to depression and abduction.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/191127edb47045fd8bab35cb52a40d79x1280x788.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unilateral movements (<strong>ductions</strong>) are :</p>\n<p>1.<strong>Adduction</strong>: It is the movement towards the nasal side around the vertical axis.</p>\n<p>2.<strong>Abduction</strong>: It is the movement towards the temporal side around the vertical axis.</p>\n<p>3.Supraduction (<strong>elevation</strong>): It is upward movement around the horizontal axis.</p>\n<p>4.Infraduction (<strong>depression</strong>): It is downward movement around the horizontal axis.</p>\n<p>5.<strong>Intorsion</strong> (medial rotation): Rotatory movement along the anteroposterior axis where the superior pole of cornea moves medially.</p>\n<p>6.<strong>Extorsion</strong> (lateral rotation): Rotatory movement along the anteroposterior axis where the superior pole of cornea moves laterally.</p>\n<p>Binocular movements can be of two types - <strong>versions</strong> and <strong>vergences</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>oculomotor</strong> nerve supplies <strong>all</strong> the extraocular muscles <strong>except</strong> the superior oblique and lateral rectus.

It includes <strong>glaukomflecken</strong>, <strong>patches </strong>of<strong> iris atrophy</strong>, and a <strong>slightly dilated nonreactive pupil</strong>. Glaukomflecken is used to describe an anterior subcapsular <strong>lenticular opacity</strong>. The slightly dilated pupil is attributed to <strong>sphincter atrophy</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Glaucoma</strong> is used to describe a group of conditions where there is progressive optic neuropathy with irreversible visual field defects associated with<strong> raised intraocular pressure</strong>. It can be classified into congenital/developmental glaucomas, primary adult glaucomas, and secondary adult glaucomas. Primary adult glaucomas are of three types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)</li>\n<li>Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG)</li>\n<li>Primary mixed mechanism glaucoma.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In <strong>primary angle-closure disease</strong>, there is <strong>apposition</strong> of the <strong>peripheral iris</strong> with the <strong>trabecular</strong> <strong>meshwork</strong>. This interferes with the drainage of aqueous humor. It is seen more commonly in <strong>elderly females</strong>. Anatomical risk factors include<strong> hypermetropic eyes</strong>, anteriorly placed iris-lens diaphragm, and a narrow-angle of the anterior chamber. The international society of geographical and epidemiological opthalmology (<strong>ISGEO</strong>) has classified primary angle-closure disease into three types.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary angle-closure suspect (<strong>PACS</strong>)</li>\n<li>Primary angle-closure (<strong>PAC</strong>)</li>\n<li>Primary angle-closure glaucoma (<strong>PACG</strong>).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PACS and PAC are seen before the development of PACG. Vogt triad is seen after an acute attack of PAC.</p>\n<p>PAC includes irido-trabecular contact on gonioscopy and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and/or peripheral anterior synechiae. The optic disc and visual fields are usually normal. Due to any reason, there can be an acute rise of IOP in patients with PAC. It is a <strong>vision-threatening emergency</strong> and the sequelae of which can be ciliary body shut down, Vogt's triad, and rarely spontaneous angle reopening.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B -<strong> Virchow triad</strong> is used to describe the abnormalities that result in<strong> thrombosis</strong>. These include endothelial injury, abnormal blood flow, and hypercoagulability of the blood.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Hutchinson triad</strong> is used to describe manifestations of congenital syphilis. It includes interstitial keratitis, Hutchinson teeth, and eighth nerve deafness. Hutchinson teeth are screw-driver or peg shaped small incisors.</p>\n<p>Option D - Gaucher's triad is not a named triad.<strong> Hypertonia</strong>, <strong>strabismus</strong>, and <strong>stridor</strong> usually point to a diagnosis of type 2 Gaucher's disease.</p>",
