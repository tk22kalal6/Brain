But in <strong>asymptomatic</strong> infants, <strong>only</strong> about <strong>13.5%</strong> develop long-term <strong>sequelae</strong> which is commonly SNHL (option C).</p>\n<p>The investigation of choice is&nbsp;<strong>PCR</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>viral culture</strong>. It should be done&nbsp;<strong>within the first two to three weeks of life</strong>. After this period, it is difficult to distinguish between a congenital and an acquired infection. Since not all affected infants are viremic at birth,&nbsp;<strong>urine&nbsp;</strong>and/or <strong>saliva</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<strong>more reliable</strong>&nbsp;samples than&nbsp;<strong>blood</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is&nbsp;<strong>no definitive treatment</strong>&nbsp;for congenital CMV infection.

Babies weighing&nbsp;less than 1200 g at birth may require several days to weeks before KMC can begin. For babies weighing between 1200 g and 1800 g, the initiation of KMC may only take a few days.

The presence of <strong>neck stiffness</strong> and CSF showing<strong>&nbsp;elevated lymphocytes</strong> with <strong>normal glucose&nbsp;</strong>and elevated protein levels are suggestive of <strong>viral meningitis. </strong>Coxsackie A viruses can lead to <strong>aseptic meningitis</strong>.</p>\n<p>HFMD is a viral infection commonly caused by <strong>coxsackievirus A16</strong>, which belongs to the subgroup of enteroviruses. In larger outbreaks, other viruses such as enterovirus 71, coxsackie A viruses 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and coxsackie B viruses 2 and 5 can also cause the disease.</p>\n<p>HFMD typically presents as a mild illness with <strong>vesicular lesions</strong> on the <strong>tongue,</strong> posterior pharynx, <strong>buccal mucosa, palate,</strong> and <strong>lips.</strong> Lesions may also appear on the <strong>hands,</strong> fingers, buttocks, and <strong>groin,</strong> with a higher prevalence on the hands. These vesicles usually resolve within a week.</p>\n<p>Infections with <strong>enterovirus 71</strong> can be more <strong>severe</strong> with <strong>neurological</strong> and <strong>cardiopulmonary</strong> manifestations. Coxsackievirus A16 infections occasionally lead to complications such as encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, pericarditis, and shock. Coxsackievirus A6 can cause a severe and atypical form of HFMD.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosing</strong> HFMD typically relies on <strong>clinical</strong> examination of the characteristic lesions. <strong>Confirmatory</strong> testing can involve <strong>viral culture</strong> using samples such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, and mucosal swabs. However, <strong>RT-PCR</strong> testing is more <strong>sensitive</strong> and <strong>specific</strong> for detecting the viral genome even when cultures are negative.</p>\n<p>Treating HFMD involves mainly <strong>supportive</strong> care as there is no specific proven antiviral agent for enteroviruses. In cases of <strong>enterovirus 71</strong>-related cardiopulmonary disease, <strong>milrinone</strong> is suggested as an effective treatment. Immunoglobulins have been utilized to manage severe cases, although outcomes vary.</p>\n<p>Apart from HFMD, coxsackie A viruses can cause <strong>herpangina</strong>&nbsp;characterized by<strong> febrile vesicular pharyngitis</strong> with ulcerating small vesicles on the oral fauces, palate, uvula, and posterior pharyngeal wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>coxsackie B</strong> viruses can cause <strong>pleurodynia</strong> or <strong>Bornholm</strong> disease, myocarditis, and pericarditis in newborns, as well as orchitis and juvenile diabetes.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option C:&nbsp;<strong>Herpes simplex virus</strong> <strong>(HSV)</strong> presents similarly with vesicular lesions but lacks typical herpetic signs. The <strong>absence</strong> of <strong>atypical</strong> symptoms like <strong>mouth pain, drooling</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and characteristic herpetic lesions rule out HSV gingivostomatitis.

      "solution": "<p>In <strong>total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation (TAPVC)</strong>,&nbsp;there is equal saturation in all chambers of the heart.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In TAPVC, the oxygenated blood from the <strong>pulmonary veins&nbsp;</strong>reaches the right atrium (having deoxygenated blood) instead of the left atrium. It occurs due to the draining of the pulmonary veins to the superior vena cava or to the inferior vena cava or to both. This is a <strong>total mixing lesion.&nbsp;</strong>The blood from this right atrium (RA) passes to the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. This blood also reaches the left atrium through the atrial septal defect or the patent foramen ovale, and subsequently, to the left ventricle The left atrium is not receiving any blood because all of the pulmonary veins are draining to the right atrium. Therefore, this shunt will be the only source of blood to it. Since blood from right atrium reaches all the other chambers, the oxygen saturation of the blood in all <strong>four chambers</strong> is the <strong>same.&nbsp;</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/932870621c2e4d3eba75bf3d2553f16ax1280x1267.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>In (<strong>TAPVC</strong>), there are <strong>three</strong> main types: <strong>supra-cardiac</strong>, <strong>cardiac</strong>, and <strong>infra-cardiac</strong>. In supra-cardiac TAPVC, the <strong>pulmonary veins merge</strong> to form a <strong>single vein</strong> that drains into either the superior vena cava or the left innominate vein. In <strong>cardiac</strong> TAPVC, the pulmonary veins <strong>directly drain</strong> into the right atrium or coronary sinus. The most <strong>dangerous</strong> type is<strong> infra-cardiac</strong> TAPVC, which is always <strong>obstructive.</strong> In this type, the pulmonary veins drain into <strong>either</strong> the <strong>portal</strong> vein <strong>or</strong> the <strong>inferior vena cava.</strong></p>\n<p>Diagnosis of TAPVC is the demonstration of <strong>any vein</strong> with doppler<strong> flow away</strong> from the<strong> heart</strong> because the normal venous flow is usually toward the heart.</p>\n<p><strong>Surgical</strong> correction of TAPVR is done in <strong>infancy.</strong> Pulmonary venous confluence is anastomosed directly to the left atrium, the ASD is closed, and any connection to the systemic venous circuit is interrupted.</p>\n<p>Other options&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF</strong>) comprises right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, ventricular septal defect (VSD), overriding of the aorta over the ventricular septum, and right ventricular hypertrophy.&nbsp;<strong>Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction </strong>increases the pressure in the right ventricle. This causes <strong>right to left shunt</strong> through the ventricular septal defect.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle mixes with the oxygenated blood in the left ventricle. Therefore, in this condition, the left atrium has a higher oxygen saturation compared to the left ventricle due to mixing.
