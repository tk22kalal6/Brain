It is an <strong>abnormality</strong> in <strong>chorionic</strong> <strong>villi</strong> making them <strong>partly</strong> <strong>proliferative</strong> and <strong>degenerative</strong>, thereby resulting in the formation of multiple small cysts.

      "solution": "<p class=\"p1\">Among the given options, <strong>ultrasonography</strong> and<strong> MRI</strong> can be used in the diagnosis of&nbsp;placenta accreta.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The term <strong>placenta accreta spectrum</strong> (PAS)/<strong>morbidly adherent placenta</strong> refers to abnormal placental implantation characterized by the abnormally implanted, invasive, or adhered placenta.&nbsp;This is due to the absence of <strong>decidua basalis</strong> and poor development of the fibrinoid or <strong>Nitabuch layer</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Risk factors include <strong>prior cesarian delivery</strong>, prior <strong>uterine surgery</strong>, prior <strong>curettage</strong>, and endometrial ablation, associated placenta previa.</p>\n<p><strong>Types </strong>of the<strong> morbidly adherent placenta:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Placenta<strong>&nbsp;accreta:&nbsp;</strong>Villi&nbsp;are attached to the&nbsp;myometrium.</li>\n<li>Placenta&nbsp;<strong>increta</strong>:&nbsp;Villi invade the&nbsp;myometrium.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Placenta&nbsp;<strong>percreta</strong>:&nbsp;Villi&nbsp;penetrate through the&nbsp;myometrium&nbsp;and to or through the&nbsp;serosa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ultrasound imaging</strong>, <strong>color Doppler,&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>MRI</strong> have all been useful in the diagnosis of&nbsp;morbidly adherent placenta during pregnancy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>USG findings</strong> that suggest PAS are (1) <strong>placental lacunae</strong>, (2) <strong>thinning of the retroplacental myometrium</strong>, (3) disruption of the bladder-uterine serosal interface, (4) bridging vessels from the placenta to the bladder-serosal interface, and (5) a placental bulge that pushes outward and distorts the contour of the uterus.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Color</strong> <strong>flow Doppler</strong> study shows hypervascularity of serosa bladder interface.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>MRI</strong> reveals&nbsp;<strong>uterine bulging</strong> and dark intraplacental bands on T2-weighted imaging.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">Management:</span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Partial placenta accreta:</strong>&nbsp;P</span>lacental tissue is removed as much as possible. Oxytocin helps in uterine contraction and hemostasis. In cases following cesarean delivery, bleeding areas are oversewed.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Total placenta accreta:</strong></span>&nbsp;\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\">Parous women- <strong>hysterectomy</strong> is done&nbsp;</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">If the patient desires to have a child- conservative measures include incising the uterus above the placental attachment, clamping, and cutting the umbilical cord as close to its base as possible. The placenta is left behind, which may get autolyzed eventually. Uterine artery embolization or therapy with methotrexate has also been done for the conservation of the uterus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">If placenta accreta <strong>invades the bladder,</strong><strong>&nbsp;placental removal </strong>alone<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is<strong> avoided</strong>. It requires a hysterectomy and partial cystectomy.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The below image shows the placenta accreta, increta, and percreta.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/84268612f965433bacb61fb002a017edx600x1200.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
