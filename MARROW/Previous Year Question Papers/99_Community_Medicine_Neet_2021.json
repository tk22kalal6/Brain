The occurrence of infections are largely based on the environmental conditions that the child is exposed to.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural influences:</strong> Poor diets as a result of cultural and regional influences also play a role in malnutrition. They are as follows with an example for each:\n<ul>\n<li>Food habits, traditions, customs, beliefs and attitudes: Rice and wheat are largely staple in India. Papaya is avoided as it is thought to cause abortion.</li>\n<li>Food fads: Personal likes and dislikes to a certain group of foods.</li>\n<li>Cooking practices: Prolonged boiling of cereals in open pans which leads to a loss of nutritive value</li>\n<li>Child-rearing practices: Premature curtailment of breastfeeding</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Socio-economic factors:</strong> Poverty plays a huge role in causing malnutrition.

Hence, a <strong>diet history</strong> should be elicited in this patient to confirm the diagnosis. </p>\n<p>Lathyrism is a paralyzing disease of humans and animals. It is due to the consumption of <strong>Khesari dal/Lathyrus sativus. </strong>When the husk is removed, it looks similar to red gram dal or Bengal gram dal. It is more prevalent in parts of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Bihar.</p>\n<p>In<strong> humans</strong>, it is referred to as <strong>neurolathyrism</strong> because it affects the nervous system. It is characterized by gradually developing spastic paralysis of the lower limbs.</p>\n<p>In <strong>animals</strong>, it is referred to as <strong>osteolathyrism/odoratism</strong> because the pathological changes in the bones lead to skeletal deformities. </p>\n<p>It usually affects <strong>young males</strong> aged <strong>15-45 years</strong> and it is manifested in stages: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Latent stage</li>\n<li>No-stick stage</li>\n<li>One-stick stage</li>\n<li>Two-stick stage</li>\n<li>Crawler stage</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>BOAA (Beta oxalyl amino alanine)</strong> is the toxic compound causing <strong>Lathyrism. </strong>The water-soluble property of the toxin is used in removing it from the pulses by <strong>soaking it in hot water</strong> and rejecting the soaked water. </p>\n<p><strong>Parboiling</strong> can be used for detoxifying the crop on large-scale operations. Overnight soaking in lime water followed by boiling is also effective in destroying the toxin.</p>\n<p><strong>Vitamin C</strong> in doses of 500-1000mg can be used for the prevention and treatment of lathyrism. </p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 710\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act in India has banned Lathyrus sativus in all forms (whole/split/flour).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Food adulteration diseases</h3><table dir=\"ltr\"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Food&quot;}\"><strong>Food</strong></td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Adulterant&quot;}\"><strong>Adulterant</strong></td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Toxin&quot;}\"><strong>Toxin</strong></td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Disease&quot;}\"><strong>Disease</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Dhal&quot;}\">Dal</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Khesari dal (Lathyrus sativus)&quot;}\">Khesari dal (<em>Lathyrus sativus</em>)</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;BOAA*&quot;}\">BOAA*</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Lathyrism&quot;}\">Lathyrism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Oil&quot;}\">Oil</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Argemome mexicana (oil) added to mustard oil&quot;}\"><em>Argemone mexicana</em> (oil)</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Sanguinarine&quot;}\">Sanguinarine</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Epidemic dropsy&quot;}\">Epidemic dropsy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Millet&quot;}\">Millet</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Crotalaria seeds (Jhunjhunia)&quot;}\">Crotalaria seeds (Jhunjhunia)</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Pyrrolizidine\\n(Hepatotxic)&quot;}\">Pyrrolizidine alkaloids<br />(Hepatotoxic)</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Endemic ascites&quot;}\">Endemic ascites&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Millet&quot;}\">Bajra, wheat</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Crotalaria seeds (Jhunjhunia)&quot;}\"><em>Claviceps purpurea</em></td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Pyrrolizidine\\n(Hepatotxic)&quot;}\">Clavine alkaloids</td>\n<td data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Endemic ascites&quot;}\">Ergotism</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;* BOAA-Beta Oxalyl Amino Alanine</p>",
