      "solution": "<p>The clinical features of <strong>hematuria</strong> and a <strong>ballotable renal mass</strong> in a <strong>3-year-old child </strong>are suggestive of <strong>Wilms tumor (Nephroblastoma)</strong>. <strong>CECT abdomen </strong>is used to identify the extent of the tumor, integrity of the other kidney, and metastasis. Wilms tumor is metabolically active and can concentrate fluorodeoxyglucose therefore <strong>PET/CT</strong> is also helpful to identify regional spread and metastatic lesions. A <strong>biopsy is discouraged</strong> as it may lead to disease upstaging. <strong>24-hour urinary vanillyl mandelic</strong> <strong>acid </strong>is measured to exclude <strong>neuroblastoma</strong>, which is an important differential diagnosis of Wilms tumor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Wilms tumor</strong>&nbsp;is the <strong>most common primary malignant renal tumor </strong>in children, typically affecting <strong>children less than 5 years</strong>. After neuroblastoma, it is the <strong>second most common</strong> <strong>malignant abdominal tumor</strong> in <strong>childhood</strong>. It most commonly presents as an <strong>asymptomatic abdominal mass.&nbsp;</strong> Other findings include hypertension, abdominal pain, gross<strong> painless hematuria, </strong>and constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight loss.</p>\n<p>Imaging studies done to diagnose Wilms tumor include <strong>plain radiography, USG, and CT of the abdomen</strong> to demonstrate the renal mass.<strong> USG with doppler study</strong> of renal veins is useful in the evaluation of collecting system and to look for tumor thrombi in renal veins and inferior vena cava. A <strong>chest CT</strong> is done preoperatively to screen for pulmonary metastasis. A <strong>positron emission tomography </strong>(PET) scan is useful in identifying regional spread and metastatic lesions.&nbsp;A <strong>biopsy is discouraged</strong> in this condition as it results in disease upstaging, and is considered only in cases of unusual presentation or imaging.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Neuroblastoma</strong> is an important <strong>differential diagnosis</strong> to consider, as it can present similarly to Wilms tumor. It is usually seen in <strong>preschool-aged children</strong> and commonly presents as a <strong>palpable abdominal mass</strong>. The retroperitoneum is the most common site for this tumor. Therefore, it is essential to test for <strong>elevated vanillyl mandelic acid </strong>(VMA) in the urine<strong> </strong>in this patient to rule out neuroblastoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Children's oncology group </strong>(previously known as National Wilms Tumor study group) staging system for Wilms tumor:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage I</td>\n<td>Tumour confined to the kidney and completely resected with negative lymph nodes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage II</td>\n<td>Tumour extends beyond the kidney but is completely resected with negative margins and lymph nodes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage III</td>\n<td>Residual tumour present following surgery confined to the abdomen, including gross or microscopic tumour.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage IV</td>\n<td>Hematogenous metastases (lung, liver, bone, brain, etc.) or lymph node metastases outside the abdominopelvic region.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Stage V</strong></td>\n<td>Metastasis to opposite kidney (<strong>bilateral</strong>&nbsp;renal involvement).</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>Treatment: Surgery and chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, are the mainstays of treatment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Radical nephrectomy</strong> is the standard surgical procedure done.

Then, a small incision is made in the umbilicus, and insufflation is performed using a Veress needle. When introducing the Veress needle, two distinct pops can be felt as the needle pierces the abdominal wall fascia first and then the peritoneum. The umbilicus is the preferred location for introducing a Veress needle because the abdominal wall is thinner at this site.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/d3c2de52d3514c9bb9ea0d35ef266a69x572x362.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Laparoscopic surgeries can be performed under general anesthesia or local anesthesia; although, general anesthesia is preferred. Carbon dioxide gas is usually used for insufflation, and the maximum pressure is typically in the range of 14-15 mm Hg. However, if the procedure is done under local anesthesia, nitrous oxide is used. Insufflation with nitrous oxide is stopped at a pressure of 10 mmHg or when 2L of gas has been insufflated.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct peritoneal access technique</strong> <strong>(Hasson technique)</strong>: The surgeon makes a small umbilical incision and gains access to the peritoneal cavity under direct vision by dissecting through the abdominal fascia and peritoneum. It is preferred in patients who have undergone previous abdominal operations where the small bowel may be adherent to the undersurface of the abdominal wound.</p>",

It should be rotated through the tissue rather than dragged to prevent unnecessary enlargement of the needle hole.

The remaining sutures are inserted in a continuous manner until the far end of the wound is reached. Care should be taken to maintain the tension of the suture to avoid excessive tension or leaving it too slack; hence, the use of an assistant is warranted. An Aberdeen knot is used to secure the end of the suture.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/4b94a68f08d746ba84a6a6797d990e7dx1280x1143.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Mattress sutures</strong> -&nbsp;They can be vertical or horizontal and are used to create either an eversion or inversion of the wound edges. The initial suture is inserted in the same way as an interrupted suture, but then, the needle either moves horizontally or vertically and traverses both edges of the wound once again, as seen in the image below. The main advantage of the mattress suture is that it produces an accurate approximation of wound edges, especially in settings where the edges are not easily approximated.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/c64dc6b67f0448feb8760ebdd82f185ex1280x1238.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><strong>Subcuticular sutures:</strong> It is used for a better cosmetic appearance. It is also employed in situations where the edges of the wound are easily approximated. In this technique, small bites of the subcuticular tissues are taken on alternate sites of the wound, and then, they are gently pulled together. This causes an approximation of the wound edges without the risk of the cross-hatched markings of interrupted sutures.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/431e9713865d480bb365d5044894c535x1200x1196.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
