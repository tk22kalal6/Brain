      "solution": "Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect. <br><br>Alcohol is a CNS depressant at all doses. Although alcohol may appear to cause stimulation at low doses, this effect is due to depression of inhibitory control centres in the brain, not true CNS stimulation. (Statement 1)<br><br>Cannabis does not produce repetitive movements, which are more characteristic of central nervous system stimulants like amphetamines or cocaine (Statement 2). Cannabis, on the contrary, can impair motor skills. <br><br>Opioids like morphine, codeine, and fentanyl are highly effective analgesics (Statement 3). Opioids act as analgesics primarily by activating μ-opioid receptors, which inhibit GABA release and enhance PAG output, modulating pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord. At the spinal level, they block calcium channels presynaptically, reducing neurotransmitter release, and open potassium channels postsynaptically, causing hyperpolarization. This dual action dampens the excitation of second-order neurons, effectively reducing pain transmission.<br><br>Volatile inhalants, such as those in adhesives, butane refills, and aerosol propellants, are highly toxic and can cause sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmias or respiratory depression. Acute abuse leads to rapid intoxication marked by euphoria, hallucinations, and potential cardiac arrest. Chronic use, especially of substances like toluene or n-hexane, can result in lasting damage to the brain, heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs. (Statement 4)",

      "solution": "Neostigmine can be used in the reversal of muscle relaxants like Vecuronium.<br><br>Neostigmine is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor. Its primary mechanism of action is decreased breakdown of acetylcholine at the motor endplate. It increases the concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, which can compete with and displace the non-depolarising muscle relaxants, and thus reverse the paralysis. Acute bolus or prolonged administration of anticholinesterases can have deleterious effects on neuromuscular function in otherwise healthy patients.<br><br>Sugammadex is a novel reversal drug that shows a high affinity for the steroidal neuromuscular blocking drugs rocuronium and vecuronium. It is a cyclodextrin that forms a tight inclusion complex with these steroidal neuromuscular blocking drugs, thereby inactivating their effects and facilitating rapid reversal of neuromuscular block.<br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option A: Baclofen is a central-acting GABA-B agonist used to treat spasticity. It does not affect neuromuscular junctions or reverse non-depolarising muscle relaxants.<br><br>Option B: Dantrolene acts directly on skeletal muscle to reduce calcium release and is used for malignant hyperthermia, not for reversing neuromuscular blockade.<br><br>Option D: Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent used to prevent bradycardia during reversal, but does not reverse neuromuscular blockade by itself.<br><br>Pearl PM0215: Types of muscle relaxants<br><br>There are 2 types of muscle relaxants: depolarizing and non-depolarizing.<br><br>Depolarizing Muscle Relaxant- Succinylcholine<br><br>Non-Depolarizing Muscle Relaxants:<br><br>* Ultra short-acting (<10 minutes) - Gantacurium<br><br>* Short-acting (10-20 minutes) - Mivacurium<br><br>* Intermediate-acting (20-50 minutes)<br><br>* Atracurium<br><br>* Cisatracurium<br><br>* Vecuronium<br><br>* Rocuronium<br><br>* Long-acting (>50 minutes)<br><br>* Pancuronium<br><br>* Doxacurium<br><br>* Pipecuronium",

      "solution": "Both statements 1 and 2 are correct regarding benzodiazepines and barbiturates<br><br>Both benzodiazepines and barbiturates act on the GABA-A chloride channel, but at different sites (Statement 1). Benzodiazepines facilitate the action of GABA by increasing the frequency of opening of the GABA-mediated chloride channel. Examples include alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, etc. On the other hand, barbiturates facilitate the action of GABA by increasing the opening duration of the GABA-mediated chloride channel. Examples include amobarbital, phenobarbital, butabarbital, and pentobarbital. Alcohol can cause superadded CNS depression when combined with either drug, increasing the risk of respiratory depression (Statement 2).<br><br>Flumazenil is a competitive antagonist at the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA-A receptor. Flumazenil reverses the effects of benzodiazepines only, not barbiturates (Statement 3). No specific antidote exists for barbiturates, and overdose treatment includes supportive care and urinary alkalinization.<br><br>Thiopentone has a rapid onset of action because of its lipophilic nature, so it rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters highly perfused organs like the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys. As thiopentone redistributes from the brain to tissues, it perfuses to muscle, fat, and skin. Over time, due to its high lipid solubility, thiopentone accumulates maximally in fat. Fat acts as a storage reservoir since it has low blood flow, and drug release from fat occurs slowly. This redistribution reduces the concentration of thiopentone, terminating its anaesthetic effect. Hence, thiopentone has a short duration of action due to its redistribution, not rapid metabolism (Statement 4).",
