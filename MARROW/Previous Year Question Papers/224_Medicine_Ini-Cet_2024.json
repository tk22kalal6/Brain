Cerebral edema</strong> is not a complication associated with <strong>hypokalemia,</strong> rather it is seen with <strong>hyponatremia.</strong> </p>\n<p>Hypokalemia is defined as a plasma concentration of K+ <strong>&lt;3.5 meq/L.</strong> Common causes include <strong>metabolic alkalosis, insulin</strong> infusions, <strong>diarrhea,</strong> use of <strong>diuretics, starvation,</strong> β2-agonists,magnesium deficiency, and primary hyperaldosteronism. </p>\n<p>Hypokalemia manifests as systemic effects primarily targeting cardiac, skeletal, and intestinal muscles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the <strong>cardiovascular</strong> system, hypokalemia poses a significant risk for arrhythmias, both ventricular and atrial. It can lead to <strong>ventricular tachycardia</strong> which can be fatal. (Option D)</li>\n<li><strong>Electrocardiographic</strong> alterations characteristic of hypokalemia include the presence of broad <strong>flat</strong> <strong>T waves</strong>, <strong>ST</strong> segment <strong>depression,</strong> and <strong>QT interval prolongation,</strong> with pronounced changes observable when serum potassium levels drop below 2.7 mmol/L.</li>\n<li>Skeletal muscle function is also profoundly affected, as hypokalemia induces <strong>hyperpolarization,</strong> compromising the muscle's ability to depolarize and contract effectively. Consequently, individuals may experience <strong>weakness</strong> and <strong>paralysis.</strong> (Option C)</li>\n<li>Intestinal smooth muscle paralysis is another consequence of hypokalemia, potentially leading to <strong>intestinal ileus.</strong></li>\n<li>Prolonged hypokalemia can precipitate <strong>acute kidney injury</strong> and, in chronic cases related to underlying conditions such as eating disorders or laxative abuse, contribute to the progression of end-stage renal disease. <strong>Hypokalemic polyuria</strong> occurs due to a combination of <strong>central polydipsia</strong> and an <strong>AVP-resistant renal concentrating</strong> defect, mimicking <strong>nephrogenic diabetes</strong> insipidus. This condition leads to the production of large volumes of <strong>dilute urine</strong> because the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively in response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH).(Option A).</li>\n</ul>",

This discrepancy, known as a pulse deficit, occurs because <strong>not all heartbeats</strong> result in a <strong>palpable pulse</strong> due to the <strong>irregular</strong> and often <strong>rapid ventricular response.</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: CHA2DS2-VASC scoring for risk of stroke  & need for oral anticoagulation in AF</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Components</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Points</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>C &ndash; Congestive heart failure</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>H - Hypertension</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A &ndash; Age &gt; 75 years</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>D &ndash; Diabetes Mellitus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>S &ndash; Stroke/TIA/TE</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\">VASc-Vascular disease (prior MI, Peripheral Arterial Disease,</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">or aortic plaque)</p>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;A- Age 65&ndash;74 years</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;S- sex category (i.e., female sex)</td>\n<td>&nbsp;1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>CHADS2 score</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Antithrombotics </strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Aspirin or no antithrombotics</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Aspirin or oral anticoagulant</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>&gt;1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Oral anticoagulant</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
