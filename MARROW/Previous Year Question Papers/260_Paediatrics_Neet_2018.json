In about 10% of patients, testicular tissue in an individual with a 46, XX karyotype is present as a result of a translocation of the&nbsp;<strong><em>SRY</em>&nbsp;gene</strong> on the Y chromosome to the X chromosome or another chromosome. There is a defect in<strong> R-spondin1</strong> protein <span class=\"fontstyle0\">encoded by the </span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\">RSPO1 </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>gene</strong>, described in 46, XX ovotesticular DSD</span>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An abnormal <strong>vagina</strong> and an underdeveloped <strong>uterus</strong> are usually present. The testes are usually <strong>undescended,</strong> and the penis may present with <strong>hypospadias</strong>. Upon reaching puberty, breast development, feminization,&nbsp;and menstruation may occur. Most affected individuals are infertile, but ovulation or spermatogenesis is possible. The response of testosterone to hCG is normal or reduced.</p>",
