Among the given options,&nbsp;<strong>Biopsy with histopathologic examination</strong>&nbsp;would be the investigation <strong>for definitive diagnosis</strong> on this patient.</p>\n<p>Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is the most common form of mucormycosis. It commonly occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus.</p>\n<p>The presenting features are <strong>facial pain</strong>, numbness, <strong>loosening of teeth</strong>, conjunctival swelling, congestion, and blurry vision. When the disease spreads to the orbit, proptosis can be present. It can later spread to the frontal lobe of the brain and cavernous sinus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A definitive diagnosis is done with a biopsy and <strong>histopathologic examination</strong>. It is the <strong>most sensitive</strong> and specific method. It reveals aseptate fungi with <strong>thick-walled, ribbon-like</strong>, hyphae branching at <strong>right angles</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Among the imaging techniques used for diagnosis, <strong>MRI</strong> is more sensitive to detecting orbital and nervous involvement than CT. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the imaging technique of choice. 1,3 beta D- glucan assay, which is helpful for the identification of most fungi, cannot be used for the diagnosis of mucormycosis.</p>\n<p>Management is by <strong>amphotericin B</strong> and surgical debridement of the affected tissues. The underlying cause and risk factors should also be addressed.</p>",
