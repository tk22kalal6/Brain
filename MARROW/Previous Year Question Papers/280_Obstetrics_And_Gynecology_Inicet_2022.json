On further examination, she has a BP of 60/40 mmHg and tachycardia, blood sugar is 48 mg/dL. Hematocrit and WBC count was normal. Which of the following drugs would help reverse this state?",

This is known as the <strong>congenital bilateral absence of vas deference (CBAVD).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Cystic fibrosis</strong>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;<strong>autosomal recessive</strong>&nbsp;disorder that affects fluid secretion in the exocrine glands and in the epithelial lining. It is caused primarily due to a mutation in the&nbsp;<strong><em>CFTR</em> gene</strong>, which codes for an anion channel in the apical membranes of epithelial cells. This leads to&nbsp;<strong>abnormally viscous secretions</strong>&nbsp;that obstruct organ passages, resulting in <strong>recurrent infections</strong>, pancreatic insufficiency, steatorrhea, malnutrition, hepatic cirrhosis, intestinal obstruction, and <strong>male infertility</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Infertility</strong> is due to <strong>azoospermia</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>CBAVD</strong>.

AMH is a <strong>glycopeptide</strong> secreted by the <strong>granulosa</strong> cells of the&nbsp;<strong>pre-antral follicles</strong>&nbsp;and small antral follicles of the ovary.</p>\n<p>In males, AMH <strong>inhibits</strong> the development of the <strong>Mullerian</strong> system and its absence can result in hermaphroditism. In the female, it helps in <strong>follicular development</strong> and <strong>oocyte maturation</strong>.&nbsp;In the absence of AMH, growing follicles are more responsive to FSH. This is because AMH<strong> reduces </strong>the <strong>sensitivity </strong>of <strong>pre-antral follicles</strong> to<strong> FSH&nbsp;</strong>(option D) thereby regulating the follicular growth.</p>\n<p>Serum AMH predicts&nbsp;<strong>ovarian reserve</strong> in a woman with infertility or secondary amenorrhea. Also, AMH values <strong>decrease with age&nbsp;</strong>and can indicate menopause,&nbsp;owing to the reduced ovarian reserve. This makes AMH the <strong>best predictor</strong> for measuring <strong>ovarian reserve</strong>.&nbsp;However, recent studies have shown <strong>intercycle</strong> variations of AMH levels, hence it is recommended to measure <strong>AMH</strong> along with <strong>antral follicle count</strong> (on USG) on <strong>days 1-3</strong> of the cycle (option A).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also a useful predictor of <strong>pregnancy rate</strong>&nbsp;in infertile women undergoing<strong> IVF</strong> (In-vitro fertilization) treatment (option C).

PMCS improve maternal survival by decreasing compression of the IVC by the gravid uterus.
