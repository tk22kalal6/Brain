Oculomotor and trochlear nerve palsy occur later as they are related to the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. Other signs are proptosis, severe supraorbital pain, edema in the mastoid region, absence of corneal sensation, and dilated pupil.</p>\n<p>Options A- <strong>Retinoblastoma</strong> occurs in young children and presents with unilateral proptosis with leukocoria, buphthalmos, and squint.</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Orbital pseudotumor</strong> presents with unilateral proptosis with diplopia, conjunctival chemosis. The inflammation is responsive to systemic corticosteroids.</p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>Orbital cellulitis</strong> presents with unilateral proptosis with pain and decreased ocular motility.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/bba873d8854f4f56a2050f911f779d9fx1280x1402.851093860268.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
