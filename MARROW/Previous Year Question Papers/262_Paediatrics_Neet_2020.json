This can result in <strong>abnormal genital development</strong> in affected<strong> female</strong> fetuses during early gestation. </p>\n<p>Females may have masculinized external genitalia. This can include <strong>enlargement of the clitoris</strong>, partial or complete <strong>labial fusion</strong>, and a shared opening of the vagina and urethra (urogenital sinus). </p>\n<p>Untreated individuals develop signs of androgen excess after birth.  These signs include <strong>accelerated skeletal maturation</strong>,<strong> premature epiphyseal closure</strong> leading to stunted adult stature, excessive muscular development, the appearance of pubic and axillary hair, acne, and deepening of the voice.
