It is characterized by rapid progression of pain and swelling in an extremity, commonly precipitated by <strong>traumatic injury</strong>. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the <strong>5 P's</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pain:</strong> Pain is the <strong>first symptom</strong> of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle groups have an increased sensitivity to touch. On <strong>passive stretching</strong> of the muscles, <strong>severe pain</strong> can be elicited. </li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paresthesia: </strong>Paresthesia and hypoesthesia are the <strong>first signs</strong> of ischemia and may be noted due to compression of nerves traversing the affected compartment.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pallor: </strong>Pallor of the skin may not always be seen as ischemia occurs at the capillary level <strong>(late sign).</strong></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Paralysis:</strong> Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment <strong>(late sign</strong>).</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><strong>Pulselessness: </strong>The absence of distal pulses<strong> (extremely late sign).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prompt decompression of the affected compartment is done.</li>\n<li>All the dressings, bandages, and cast on the affected limb are removed and the limb is nursed flat.</li>\n<li><strong>Fasciotomy</strong> is done if the differential pressure is less than 30 mm Hg</li>\n<li>Fasciotomy wounds are left open and after 2 days if there is necrosis debridement is done. If the wounds are healthy it can be sutured without tension or skin grafting can be done.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The diagnosis of compartment syndrome can be confirmed by measuring the <strong>intra-compartmental pressure</strong> using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (ΔP). If the <strong>differential pressure (ΔP)</strong> is <strong>less than 30 mm Hg</strong> (4.00 kilopascals), <strong>immediate compartment decompression </strong>is indicated.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Acute Compartment and Crush Syndromes</h3><p><strong>1.

Common fractures causing compartment syndrome include tibial diaphyseal (most common), distal radius, and forearm fractures. </p>\n<p><strong>Pathology</strong>: Increased pressure in one of the osseofascial compartments due to bleeding, oedema or inflammation. A vicious cycle of ischemia → edema→ ischemia leading to necrosis of the muscles and nerves within the compartment in 6 hours or less. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: Five Ps: Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Paralysis and Pulselessness. </p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Fasciotomy to decompress the threatened compartment if the differential pressure (ΔP) goes less than or equal to 30 mmHg. </p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/b3795f2c59974b46aed885144c3fb36ax975x813.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p> </p>\n<p><strong>2.

When the limb is freed, there is a release of toxic metabolites causing reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen metabolites create further tissue injury. Free myoglobin can get precipitated in the renal glomeruli. </p>\n<p><strong>Clinical features</strong>: The affected limb is pulseless, red, swollen and blistered. Sensation and muscle power may be lost. There can be signs of impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong>: Encouraging high urine output, alkalization of the urine, hemofiltration, radical excision of dead muscles, fasciotomy if there is compartment syndrome. </p>",
