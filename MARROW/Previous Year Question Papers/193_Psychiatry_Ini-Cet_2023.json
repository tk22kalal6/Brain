      "solution": "<p>The type of delusion seen in this patient is a <strong>nihilistic delusion</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Nihilism</strong> refers to the <strong>delusion of the non-existence</strong> <strong>of self</strong> or parts of self. It also includes an attitude of rejection of established values or extreme skepticism regarding moral and value judgments. The patient may believe that they are <strong>going to die soon</strong> or their <strong>organs are rotting</strong>. <strong>Delusion of nihilism</strong> is often seen as a <strong>mood-congruent delusion</strong> in <strong>depression with psychotic symptoms</strong>. This patient has three major symptoms of depression &mdash; <strong>low energy, depressed mood, and lack of interest</strong> in the surroundings. However, these symptoms have to be present for a period of <strong>at least 14 days</strong> to make the diagnosis of major depressive disorder.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Cotard's syndrome</strong> was first described by Jules Cotard. He described a psychotic disorder characterized by <strong>severe depression</strong> and <strong>nihilistic delusions</strong> regarding one's own body or existence. In the DSM or ICD, Cotard's syndrome is <strong>not classified separately</strong>. Nihilistic delusions have been mentioned as examples of <strong>mood-congruent delusions</strong> in a <strong>depressive episode</strong> <strong>with psychotic features.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B: Patients with <strong>hypochondriacal delusions</strong> are <strong>fixated</strong> <strong>on</strong> one or more <strong>somatic symptoms</strong> as evidence of some <strong>severe</strong>, yet undetected <strong>disease</strong>. They undergo <strong>repeated</strong> and <strong>unnecessary</strong> <strong>medical</strong> <strong>examinations</strong> and tests. There are frequent deteriorations of relationships with their doctors when nothing suggesting a disease is ever found, and this leads to doctor shopping.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Delusions</strong> are <strong>false</strong> and <strong>fixed</strong> <strong>ideas</strong> that are not shared by other people. <strong>Bizarre delusions</strong> are the ones whose <strong>content is out of the realm of possibility</strong>, for example, a patient believing that aliens abduct him and take him to Mars every night. Typically, patients with <strong>schizophrenia</strong> tend to have bizarre delusions.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types of delusions</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>THE TYPES OF DELUSIONS</strong></span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Delusion&nbsp;of control</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>False belief that a person&rsquo;s will, thoughts, or feelings are being controlled by external forces.</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Delusion&nbsp;of grandeur </strong>or<strong> Megalomania</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Exaggerated conception of one&rsquo;s importance, power, or identity.</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Delusion&nbsp;of infidelity </strong>or morbid jealousy or <strong>Othello syndrome</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>False&nbsp;belief that one&rsquo;s lover is unfaithful.&nbsp;Sometimes called pathological jealousy.</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span><strong>Delusion of love </strong>or<strong> erotomania</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>False belief that another person is in love with them.

      "solution": "<p>In this scenario of a <strong>pregnant woman in her third trimester </strong>with <strong>bipolar disorder</strong> with<strong> multiple past episodes</strong> and <strong>currently stable on lithium</strong>, the <strong>best next step in management</strong> is to <strong>decrease lithium dosage within therapeutic levels</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Lithium</strong> is a <strong>mood stabilizer </strong>with a <strong>very narrow therapeutic index</strong> and is the <strong>first line</strong> of management in<strong> bipolar disorder</strong>. Lithium therapy should be <strong>continued throughout the pregnancy</strong> in women who have <strong>severe, frequent episodes</strong>, and these patients should be counseled about the <strong>reproductive risks</strong> associated with therapy. Ideally, the next best step in this scenario would be to<strong> monitor lithium blood levels monthly until 34 weeks</strong>, and <strong>weekly monitoring thereafter until delivery</strong>. However, <strong>dose reduction can be considered closer to delivery</strong> as there may be an increased risk of <strong>lithium toxicity in the fetus</strong>. According to <strong>NICE guidelines</strong>, it is recommended to <strong>stop lithium during active labour</strong>, measure <strong>lithium levels 12 hours after the last dose</strong> and reestablish prophylactic levels after delivery.<br /><br /><strong>First and second trimester</strong> are characterised by a significant<strong> decrease of lithium blood levels</strong> with a risk of subtherapeutic levels. In<strong> third trimester</strong> and the <strong>postpartum</strong>,<strong> lithium levels gradually return</strong> to their preconception level which implicates that in this period clinicians need to be aware of the<strong> risk of lithium intoxication (Option B)</strong>. <br /><br /><strong>Bipolar disorder </strong>has been associated with <strong>adverse perinatal outcomes</strong> such as<strong> preterm birth</strong>. <strong>Medication discontinuation in pregnancy (Option A)</strong> can pose an increased risk for <strong>relapse</strong>. Moreover, <strong>symptomatic women during pregnancy</strong> more likely have <strong>postpartum relapses</strong> that can be severe.<br /><br /><strong>Typical therapy</strong> for bipolar disorder includes mood stabilizers such as <strong>lithium, valproic acid, </strong>and<strong> carbamazepine </strong>and<strong> antipsychotic</strong> medications. Bipolar disorder during pregnancy is a complicated condition that is best treated in tandem with psychiatric care. Risks and advantages of mood stabilizers, some of which are <strong>teratogenic</strong>, must be considered while making decisions.</p>\n<p>For example, <strong>lithium use </strong>during the <strong>first trimester</strong> has been linked to<strong> Ebstein anomaly</strong>, although very rarely. <strong>Fetal echocardiography</strong> is recommended for <strong>lithium-exposed fetuses</strong>. Fetal lithium exposure is also associated with <strong>neonatal goiter, CNS depression, hypotonia </strong>(floppy baby syndrome), and cardiac murmur.</p>\n<p><strong>Maternal adverse effects</strong> of lithium can be <strong>acute</strong> such as <strong>tremors, ataxia, weakness, polyuria, polydipsia</strong> or <strong>chronic</strong> such as <strong>nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction</strong>, and <strong>hyperparathyroidism</strong>.</p>\n<p>Due to all these adverse effects, patients on lithium therapy should have <strong>routine monitoring</strong> of serum electrolytes, serum calcium, thyroid profile, renal function tests, ECG, and serum lithium levels.</p>\n<p>Other options : <br /><br />Option D : It is not necessary to switch to valproate in the third trimester as the patient is already stable on lithium. Use of valproate in the first trimester is associated with significant teratogenicity.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Lithium in bipolar disorder</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Guidelines for Lithium therapy</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Indications</strong>:</div>\n<div>Mania, hypomania, bipolar disorder, etc.</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Blood levels of lithium</strong>:</p>\n<p>For <strong>therapeutic</strong> purpose (treatment of acute mania) :&nbsp;<strong>0.8-1.2 mEq/L</strong></p>\n<p>For <strong>prophylaxis</strong> (to prevent relapse of bipolar disorder):&nbsp;<strong>0.5-0.8 mEq/L</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Toxic</strong> levels of lithium:&nbsp;<strong>&gt;/= 1.5 mEq/L</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Contraindications</strong>:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>CKD</li>\n<li>Heart disease</li>\n<li>Hyponatremia or diuretic use</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Baseline studies:</strong></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen), Creatinine, Calcium, Urine analysis</li>\n<li>Thyroid function test</li>\n<li>ECG in patients with coronary risk factors</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Acute a</strong><strong>dverse effects</strong>:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Tremor, ataxia, weakness</li>\n<li>Polyuria, polydipsia</li>\n<li>Vomiting, diarrhea</li>\n<li>Cognitive impairment</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><strong>Chronic a</strong><strong>dverse effects</strong>:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus</li>\n<li>Thyroid dysfunction</li>\n<li>Hyperparathyroidism</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
