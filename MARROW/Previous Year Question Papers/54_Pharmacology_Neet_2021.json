This is carried out by reducing the bone resorption effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Keeping in line with these effects, osteoporosis prevention in postmenopausal women has been attributed to the use of SERMs such as&nbsp;<strong>raloxifene. </strong>It acts as an estrogen agonist on the bone and liver.</p>\n<p><strong>Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation:&nbsp;</strong>Calcium supplementation in the elderly suppresses bone turnover and improves bone mineral density. <strong>1200mg of calcium</strong> is daily required in adults of more than 50 years of age. <strong>Vitamin D</strong> supplementation with <strong>400-800IU/day</strong> improves intestinal calcium absorption, suppresses bone remodeling, and improves bone mineral density.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It binds to the soluble, membrane-bound IL-6 receptors and <strong>inhibits IL-6 mediated signaling</strong>. IL-6 can cause T-cell activation, acute-phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of inflammatory processes in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n<p>Uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> - It is a biological DMARD and is indicated in adult patients having moderate to severe disease with inadequate response to one or more DMARDs.</li>\n<li><strong>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis</strong> - It can be given for active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis(SJIA) or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis(PJIA) in patients of 2 years of age or more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adverse effects:</p>\n<p>Common adverse effects include upper respiratory infections, hypertension, headache, and elevation of hepatic enzymes. It is also associated with serious infections including TB and opportunistic infections. Neutropenia and reduction in platelet count can also occur.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>IL-2 receptor</strong> inhibitors are <strong>daclizumab, basiliximab.</strong> They are used as immunosuppressive agents following <strong>renal </strong>and <strong>heart transplants.</strong></p>\n<p>Option C- <strong>IL-4 receptor</strong> inhibitor is <strong>dupilumab</strong>. They have been shown to reduce exacerbations in <strong>asthma.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Option D- <strong>IL-5</strong> inhibitors are <strong>mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab</strong>.&nbsp;They have been shown to reduce exacerbations in <strong>asthma.&nbsp;</strong></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Important drugs for rheumatoid arthritis</h3><p><strong>1) NSAIDs - </strong>analgesic and anti-inflammatory, used as <strong>adjunctive</strong> for management of uncontrollable <strong>symptoms</strong> and in acute <strong>flares.</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2) Glucocorticoids - </strong>used in acute <strong>flare</strong> for rapid control and as <strong>initial therapy</strong> before the onset of action of DMARDs. Chronic administration of low doses is needed in patients with inadequate response to DMARDs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p>Prednisolone - oral</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p>Triamcinolone - intraarticular<br /> </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span>3) DMARDs - </span></strong><span>disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid drugs:</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>- Conventional DMARDs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Methotrexate (MTX)- is an antifolate drug. The DMARD of <strong>choice</strong> and the anchor drug for combination therapy. Regular <strong>LFT</strong> monitoring is required.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Hydroxychloroquine- is used as <strong>monotherapy</strong> for <strong>early</strong> and <strong>mild</strong> disease and in combination with other DMARDs for severe cases.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Sulfasalazine- is a salicylate. It <strong>reduces</strong> the radiographic <strong>progression</strong> of the disease.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Leflunomide- is a pyrimidine synthase inhibitor used as an <strong>alternative</strong> to MTX.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>- Biologicals:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>TNF-α antagonists- used in combination with MTX. Has a risk of serious bacterial infections, opportunistic fungal infection &amp; reactivation of latent TB. The TNF-α inhibitors are <strong>adalimumab,</strong> golimumab, etanercept, infliximab, and certolizumab.</li>\n<li>Abatacept- a T-cell costimulation inhibitor, used in combination with MTX, leflunomide, etc.</li>\n<li>Rituximab- an <strong>anti-CD20</strong> antibody. Used in refractory disease in combination with MTX.</li>\n<li>Anakinra- an<strong> IL-1</strong> receptor <strong>antagonist</strong>. It should not be combined with anti-TNF alpha.</li>\n<li><strong>IL-6</strong> receptor <strong>antagonists</strong>- tocilizumab and sarilumab are used as monotherapy or combination therapy in moderate to severe disease.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><strong>- Small molecules: </strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Janus kinase inhibitors: <strong>Tofacitinib</strong>, baricitinib, and upadacitinib are used as monotherapy or combination therapy.</li>\n</ul>",
