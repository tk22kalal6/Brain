Frequent contractions and persistent hypertonus are the other findings. When the placenta is completely detached from the uterine wall, except at the margin, blood may collect behind the placenta. This kind of presentation is known as<strong> concealed type</strong>. In another type, blood can escape via the cervix by dissecting downward between the membranes and the uterine wall. It is called the <strong>revealed type</strong>, which is the most common type.</p>\n<p>Option B - Hydrocephalus of the fetus: Hydrocephalus is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain, leading to increased head circumference in the fetus. Although it may lead to an increased symphysis fundal height, the clinical presentation of breathlessness and excessive abdominal distension in the mother is not typical of this condition.</p>\n<p>Option D - Fetal-maternal ascites can present as <strong>Mirror syndrome. </strong>There is a connection between fetal hydrops and the onset of maternal edema, in which the mother exhibits the same symptoms as the fetus. Because the mother, the placenta, and the fetus all develop edema, the condition is also called <strong>triple edema</strong>. At least 20% of cases of hydrops have been observed to be complicated by mirror syndrome. Women most commonly present with <strong>edema</strong>. Other symptoms may include proteinuria, hypertension, the elevation of liver enzymes, and headache.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Causes of oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Oligohydramnios</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Polyhydramnios</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Maternal</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ul>\n<li>Undiagnosed rupture of membrane (most common)</li>\n<li>Spontaneous rupture of membranes</li>\n<li>Post-dated pregnancy</li>\n<li>Preeclampsia</li>\n<li>NSAIDs</li>\n<li>ACE inhibitors</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ul>\n<li>Overt diabetes</li>\n<li>Gestational diabetes</li>\n<li>Cardiac disease</li>\n<li>Renal disease</li>\n<li>Liver failure</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Fetal</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ul>\n<li>Fetal anomalies</li>\n<li>Renal agenesis</li>\n<li>Urethral defects\n<ul>\n<li>Posterior valve</li>\n<li>Obstructive uropathy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple gestation</li>\n<li>Neural tube defects</li>\n<li>Abdominal wall defects</li>\n<li>Cleft palate</li>\n<li>Neck masses</li>\n<li>Esophageal atresia</li>\n<li>Aneuploidy</li>\n<li>Hydrops fetalis</li>\n<li>TTTS</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Placental</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>Failure of secretion:- e.g. Amnion nodosum</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>Chorangioma of placenta</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Of the following procedures given in the OT list, <strong>Asherman syndrome</strong> is the condition for which hysteroscopy would be most preferable. <strong>Hysteroscopy</strong> is used for the <strong>definitive</strong> <strong>diagnosis</strong> of Asherman syndrome.</p>\n<p>Asherman syndrome refers to the presence o<strong>f adhesion within </strong>the <strong>endometrial cavity</strong>. It is also called <strong>uterine synechiae</strong> and can be asymptomatic tiny bands or can completely or almost completely obliterate the endometrial cavity. It can occur as a result of trauma to the endometrium following <strong>vigorous</strong> uterine <strong>curettage</strong><strong>,</strong> tuberculous endometritis, pelvic radiation, or endometrial ablation.</p>\n<p>Depending on the degree of scarring, patients may have <strong>amenorrhea</strong>, <strong>hypomenorrhea,</strong> or <strong>recurrent</strong> <strong>pregnancy</strong> <strong>loss</strong> because of inadequate placentation. <strong>Hysterosalpingography</strong> is performed to assess the uterine cavity and tubal patency. Intrauterine adhesions are characteristically seen as <strong>irregular</strong> <strong>angulated</strong> filling defects in the uterine cavity with a classic<strong> 'moth-eaten' appearance</strong>. <strong>Definitive diagnosis </strong>(gold standard)<strong> </strong>and <strong>management</strong> are done by <strong>hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopic</strong><strong> transection</strong> is the surgical <strong>treatment </strong>of<strong> choice</strong>.</p>\n<p>Hysteroscopy has the advantage of being a minimally invasive procedure with lower risks and faster recovery times than traditional open surgery. It is often performed as an outpatient procedure, and patients can usually return to their normal activities within a day or two.</p>\n<p>Other options-</p>\n<p>Option A - <strong>Tubal ligation</strong> is done to attain <strong>permanent contraception</strong> in females, which is usually accomplished by occlusion or division of the fallopian tubes. It prevents ovum passage and fertilization. Procedures done at the time of delivery are termed puerperal sterilization. For puerperal sterilization, <strong>suture ligation with tubal segment removal</strong> is more frequently employed. A tubal sterilization procedure done at a time unrelated to recent pregnancy is called non-puerperal tubal sterilization or interval sterilization. Currently, non-puerperal tubal sterilization is mainly accomplished via <strong>laparoscopy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Option C - <strong>Endocercival polyps</strong> are mucinous columnar epithelium-covered benign endocervical stroma overgrowths. They often present as a single, elongated mass that is red, smooth, and projecting from the endocervical canal.<strong> Ring forceps</strong> are used to grab endocervical polyps for excision if the stalk is thin. The stalk base of the polyp is repeatedly twisted. Surgical ligation and excision of a thick pedicle may be necessary if further severe bleeding is expected. Although hysteroscopy can help visualize and assess these polyps, their removal is typically performed using forceps, either during a pelvic examination or during a colposcopy. Hysteroscopy is not the primary method for managing endocervical polyps.</p>\n<p>Option D -<strong> Subserosal fibroids</strong> carry higher risks for incomplete resection, difficult visualization, or uterine perforation with hysteroscopic myomectomy. Hence, a number of parameters are taken into consideration while choosing a surgical strategy for subserosa or intramural myomas. Successful results and low recurrence rates are seen after<strong> laparoscopic leiomyoma excision.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>",

It has not spread to the pelvic sidewall or the lower third of the vagina. The primary management for stage IIB cervical cancer is concurrent chemoradiation therapy. This involves the combination of external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and chemotherapy (usually with cisplatin). This approach has been shown to improve overall survival and reduce the risk of local and distant recurrence compared to radiation therapy alone.</p>\n<p>Following chemoradiation, patients should be closely monitored for treatment response and potential side effects or complications. This includes regular physical examinations, Pap tests, and imaging studies as needed. The prognosis for stage IIB cervical cancer depends on various factors, such as the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and the patient's overall health. With appropriate treatment, the 5-year survival rate for stage IIB cervical cancer is around 58-63%.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Chemotherapy alone: Chemotherapy alone is not the primary treatment for stage IIB cervical cancer.
