      "solution": "The most probable diagnosis for a patient with vomiting and complaints of rotational vertigo upon turning his head on the bed in the morning is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).<br><br>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is characterised by vertigo when the head is placed in a certain critical position. It is not associated with hearing loss or neurological symptoms. It is caused due to the disorder of the posterior semicircular canal.<br><br>The attacks are always provoked by changes in head position and caused by free-floating calcium carbonate crystals, usually dislodged from the posterior canal. A positive Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre confirms the diagnosis of BPPV. It is due to otoconial debris getting into the posterior semicircular canal from the utricle. The patient complains of vertigo on moving or tilting the head to the affected side. <br><br>Steps of the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre:<br><br>* The manoeuvre starts with the patient in a sitting position.<br><br>* Their head is turned 45 degrees towards the ear to be tested.<br><br>* The examiner quickly brings the patient to a supine position with their head 30 degrees below the horizontal.<br><br>* The 45-degree head rotation is maintained during the procedure.<br><br>* Now the examiner observes the patient's eye for nystagmus.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e9b59c963d134f6da384e456e01ee71fx1280x2095.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>In most of the patients, it can be relieved by administering a therapeutic Epley manoeuvre on the affected side. Epley's manoeuvre is performed to reposition the crystals into the macula from the semicircular canals.<br><br>Epley's manoeuvre is given in the image below.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/ca4bf62965a54b8982ad68a9a4c0900ax1280x2359.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Meniere's disease is characterised by vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus and a sense of pressure in the involved ear. Vertigo is of sudden onset, lasts for a few minutes to hours.<br><br>Option C: Vestibular neuritis is characterised by severe vertigo of sudden onset and lasts from a few days to weeks. There are no cochlear symptoms. <br><br>Option D: Labyrinthitis causes symptoms of hearing loss along with unilateral vestibular symptoms like sudden onset of persistent vertigo and associated nausea and vomiting.",

It releases tetanus toxin (tetanospasmin), an exotoxin that enters the nervous system and causes disease.<br><br>The most common initial symptoms are trismus (lockjaw), muscle pain and stiffness, back pain, and difficulty swallowing. As the disease progresses, muscle spasm develops, and the laryngeal muscles are involved in early stages, leading to airway obstruction.<br><br>Generalised muscle spasms involve muscles of the entire body and are painful. Towards the second week of tetanus, autonomic disturbances are maximal as evidenced by gastrointestinal stasis, sweating, increased tracheal secretions and cardiovascular events like blood pressure fluctuations and heart block can occur. The diagnosis of tetanus is based on clinical findings. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Bezold abscess can occur due to mastoiditis following CSOM and leads to pain, fever, a tender swelling in the neck, and torticollis.<br><br>Option C: Meningitis is the most common intracranial complication of otitis media. There is fever with chills and rigours, headache, neck rigidity, photophobia, nausea and vomiting. It can also lead to cranial nerve palsies and hemiplegia. <br><br>Option D: Sigmoid Sinus Thrombosis is characterised by Hectic Picket-Fence type of fever with rigours and headache.",

It arises from the posterior part of the nasal cavity that is close to the superior margin of the sphenopalatine foramen. These patients have a hamartomatous nidus of vascular tissue in the nasopharynx that forms an angiofibroma when testosterone appears. Therefore, it is thought to be testosterone-dependent.<br><br>Angiofibroma can extend from its origin into the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pterygomaxillary fossa, infratemporal fossa, cheek, orbits, and intracranial cavity, resulting in clinical features such as proptosis and frog-face deformity. The clinical features include:<br><br>* Profuse, recurrent, spontaneous epistaxis- most common<br><br>* Progressive nasal obstruction and denasal speech- due to a mass in the postnasal space<br><br>* Conductive hearing loss and otitis media with effusion- due to obstruction of the Eustachian tube<br><br>* Sessile, lobulated, or smooth mass in the nasopharynx<br><br>* Other clinical features include the broadening of the nasal bridge, proptosis, cheek swelling, involvement of II, III, IV, and VI cranial nerves<br><br>Diagnosis is mostly based on clinical and imaging studies.
