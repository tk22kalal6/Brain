Choledocholithiasis is mostly clinically silent but may present with biliary colic and even obstructive jaundice.&nbsp;<strong>Management of choledocholithiasis </strong>includes&nbsp;<strong>ERCP +/- sphincterotomy</strong> followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>MRCP</strong>&nbsp;<strong>uses the fluid</strong>&nbsp;which is present&nbsp;<strong>in the biliary and pancreatic ducts</strong> as a contrast agent and does not require external contrast material administered into the ductal system. It is a&nbsp;<strong>non-invasive</strong>&nbsp;investigation for evaluating extrahepatic, intrahepatic bile duct, and pancreatic duct.&nbsp;<strong>No interventions</strong> are performed under MRCP.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MRCP uses&nbsp;<strong>T2 weighted&nbsp; MRI&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>it recognizes slow-flowing or stationary fluid within ducts, which appear brighter relative to adjacent solid tissues. MRCP can be used to evaluate various conditions of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system, examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Congenital anomalies of the cystic and hepatic ducts</li>\n<li>Post-surgical biliary anatomy</li>\n<li>Pancreas divisum</li>\n<li>Anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction</li>\n<li><strong>Choledocholithiasis</strong></li>\n<li>Biliary structures</li>\n<li>Chronic pancreatitis</li>\n<li>Pancreatic cystic lesions</li>\n<li>Trauma to the biliary system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>MRCP</strong> in <strong>benign strictures</strong> would typically show <strong>smooth elongated tapering of the bile duct</strong>, while <strong>malignancy-associated strictures</strong> typically show<strong> abrupt shouldering</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Types of Gallstones</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Cholesterol gallstones</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Black pigment</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Brown pigment</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Demography</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Western countries</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Non-western countries</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Non-western countries</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Location</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Gallbladder, ducts</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Gallbladder, ducts</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ducts</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Risk factors</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Advancing age</li>\n<li>Female</li>\n<li>Oral contraceptives and pregnancy</li>\n<li>Obesity and insulin resistance</li>\n<li>Rapid weight reduction</li>\n<li>Gallbladder stasis</li>\n<li>Dyslipidemia syndromes</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;\n<ul>\n<li>Chronic hemolysis&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Ileal&nbsp;resection</li>\n<li>Cystic fibrosis with pancreatic insufficiency</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Chronic biliary infection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Appearance</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Pale yellow, round to ovoid, finely granular, hard external surface</p>\n<p>Transection: glistening radiating crystalline palisade</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&gt; 1.5 cm in diameter,&nbsp;friable speculated and molded</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Large, brown, laminated and soft</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Constituents</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cholesterol, phospholipids, bile salts</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Calcium bilirubinate</p>\n<p>Calcium bicarbonate</p>\n<p>Calcium phosphate</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Calcium bilirubinate</p>\n<p>Palmitate</p>\n<p>Cholesterol</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Consistency</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Crystalline with nucleus</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hard</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Soft, friable</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>% of radio-opaque stones</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>15%</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>60%</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>0%</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
