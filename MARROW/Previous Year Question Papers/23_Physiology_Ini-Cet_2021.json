However, the contribution by the smallest airways is very little to the overall total resistance. This is because, the airway branches in each generation exist in <strong>parallel</strong> rather than in series. As the parallel branching increases, the resistance decreases. (<strong>Total</strong> cross-sectional diameter of small airways put together is high). Thus the overall resistance of the small airways is very small. Also,&nbsp;airflow velocity decreases substantially as the effective cross-sectional area increases (i.e., the flow becomes laminar).</p>\n<p>Other factors affecting airway resistance :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lung volume</strong>, as lung volume increases the resistance decreases and vice versa. Lung volume increases the transairway pressure thus increasing the caliber of the airway.</li>\n<li><strong>Airway mucus, edema</strong>, and <strong>contraction</strong> of bronchial smooth muscle increase the airway resistance. Its clinical application is seen in asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema</li>\n<li>The <strong>density </strong>and <strong>viscosity</strong> of inspired gas also contribute to airway resistance. A gas with more density imparts more resistance.</li>\n</ul>",

Point A is at the end of systole when the ventricular volume is about <strong>50 mL</strong>. This volume is called <strong>end-systolic volume.</strong> The pressure at this point is about 2 to 3 mm Hg. These volume and pressure go on increasing as the blood from the atrium flows to the ventricle during diastole. At the <strong>end </strong>of<strong> diastole</strong>, marked by point <strong>B</strong>, the ventricle will have a volume of <strong>around 120 mL</strong>. This volume is called <strong>end-diastolic volume.</strong> The pressure is slightly raised to 5-7mm Hg.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase II</strong>- It is the phase of <strong>isovolumetric contraction</strong>, and extends between <strong>points B</strong> and<strong>&nbsp;C</strong>. At the end of diastole (point B), a slight increase in the ventricular pressure <strong>closes</strong> the <strong>mitral valve</strong>, and contraction starts. The ventricle contracts while both mitral and aortic valves are closed. Therefore, the pressure within the ventricle slowly rises without any changes in the volume.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase III</strong>- It is the phase of <strong>ejection</strong> and extends between <strong>point C</strong> and <strong>point D</strong>. Point <strong>C</strong> is the place where the <strong>aortic </strong>valve <strong>opens</strong>. The pressure within the left ventricle rises slowly during isovolumetric contraction until it is sufficient to open the aortic valve. Once the aortic valve opens, blood within the left ventricle is ejected into the aorta. This decreases the volume of the left ventricle, while increasing the pressure within the ventricle.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase IV</strong>- It is the period of <strong>isovolumetric relaxation</strong>. It extends between <strong>points D</strong> and <strong>A</strong>. At the end of the ejection (Point D), the aortic valve closes. However, the ventricular relaxation continues despite closed aortic and mitral valves. Therefore, the ventricular pressure continues to fall while the volume remains the same. The ventricle returns to its starting point, with about 50 ml of blood left in the ventricle and pressure of about 2 to 3 mm Hg</p>\n<p><strong>End-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ESPVR</strong> is the <strong>maximum pressure</strong> that can be developed by the ventricle at the <strong>end-systolic volume</strong>.
