      "solution": "<p>The correct statement is that the CT score of water is 0. </p>\n<p>On CT, each image consists of a matrix of data points (pixels) that are assigned a number that represents the X-ray attenuation(μ) at that point in the body. CT number is a scaled version of μ that is <strong>normalised</strong> to the <strong>X-ray attenuation of water </strong>(μW).</p>\n<p>CT = 1000 × (μ/μW − 1)</p>\n<p>The resulting numbers are called <strong>‘Hounsfield units’(HU)</strong>. Due to this normalisation, water is assigned 0 HU, and air is assigned a CT number of −1000 HU.</p>\n<p>CT numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Water = 0 HU</strong></li>\n<li>Solid soft tissues are centred around 0 HU</li>\n<li>Lungs = -1000 HU</li>\n<li>Air = −1000 HU</li>\n<li>Dense cortical bone = +1000 HU</li>\n<li>Acute Blood Clot = 60-90 HU</li>\n<li>Fat = -100 HU</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: Computed tomography (CT) imaging involves the use of a narrow beam of X-rays that are emitted from a rotating X-ray tube.CT scanners typically use a combination of X-ray beams at different energies and filters to reduce scatter and improve image quality. Therefore, the X-ray beams used in CT imaging <strong>are often filtered</strong> to <strong>enhance image contras</strong>t and <strong>reduce radiation</strong> dose to the patient.</p>\n<p>Option C: The investigation of choice for gallstones is an <strong>Abdominal ultrasound</strong> and not a CT Abdomen. An ultrasound can <strong>assess for complications</strong> of gallstones, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) or obstruction of the bile ducts. In cases where ultrasound findings are inconclusive or further characterisation is needed, other imaging modalities such as CT scan or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be used. </p>\n<p>Option D: The mSv (millisievert) value for a non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan of the head typically ranges from around<strong> 1 to 2 mSv</strong>. This radiation dose can vary depending on factors such as the specific CT scanner used, the scanning protocol, and the individual patient characteristics. However, in general, NCCT head scans are associated with relatively<strong> low radiation </strong>doses compared to other medical imaging procedures.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Ultrasound contrast agents</strong> are gas-filled microbubbles that are administered intravenously to the systemic circulation. Hence, considered as low risk in patients with renal impairment.</p>\n<p>Ultrasound contrast agents are used to enhance the visibility of blood vessels, organs, and tissues during ultrasound imaging. These agents typically consist of tiny <strong>gas-filled microbubbles</strong> encapsulated within a shell. When injected intravenously, they flow through the bloodstream and resonate in response to ultrasound waves, producing strong echoes that enhance the ultrasound image.</p>\n<p><strong>Perflutren/Optison </strong>is an ultrasound contrast agent. <strong>Levovist </strong>(consisting of galactose microparticles, air bubbles, and palmitic acid) is another example of an ultrasound contrast agent. Sulfur hexafluoride with a phospholipid shell is also used as an ultrasound contrast agent.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Gadolinium contrast</strong> used in MRI is predominantly excreted through the kidney. In renal failure, it gets accumulated in the body and releases gadolinium ions. Since the ion is toxic, the body tries to contain it by fibrosis resulting in multisystem painful fibrosis called <strong>nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.</strong></p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Iodinated ionic contrast agents</strong> increase the risk of <strong>Contrast-induced nephropathy(CIN)</strong>. Hence alternative imaging methods, without iodinated contrast media, should be chosen in patients with considerably impaired renal function (CKD 4 or 5).</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Non-ionic contrast agents</strong> have a lower risk of causing adverse reactions compared to ionic contrast agents. They are generally <strong>better tolerated</strong> by patients, with fewer incidences of allergic reactions and nephrotoxicity.
