Rabies virus is a bullet-shaped rhabdovirus containing ssRNA. It spreads to humans by bites or contact with the saliva of rabid animals (bats, dogs, cats). Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually <strong>100</strong>% <strong>fatal. </strong>The disease can be divided into 3 phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prodromal </strong>phase: It lasts 2-10 days. Patients present with malaise, headache, photophobia, vomiting, and fever.  They may also have parasthesias, pain or pruritus near the site of exposure. </li>\n<li><strong>Acute neurologic </strong>phase: It lasts 2-7 days. In the more common <strong>encephalitic</strong> rabies, <strong>Hydrophobia </strong>(fear of water) or aerophobia (fear of breeze) can be seen. Swallowing liquids precipitates<strong> painful spasms </strong>of the <strong>throat muscles</strong>. Patients may also have nervousness, hallucinations, excessive lacrimation, salivation, perspiration and pupillary dilation. Convulsive seizures may occur</li>\n<li><strong>Coma </strong>and <strong>death </strong>(due to cardiorespiratory arrest)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In about 20% of patients, <strong>paralytic rabies</strong> is seen. Flaccid muscle weakness is seen, which progresses to quadriparesis and facial palsy.  </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In rabid animals, the virus depicts two modes of spread:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Centripetal</strong> spread: The virus enters the <strong>peripheral</strong> neurons. It moves via <strong>retrograde fast axonal transport</strong> towards the spinal cord or brainstem a.k.a the central nervous system <strong>(CNS) </strong>at a speed of up to 250 mm/day. Once<strong> </strong>within the CNS, it spreads quickly to other regions in the CNS through <strong>fast axonal transport</strong>. It infects neurons primarily, but may rarely infect astrocytes.</li>\n<li><strong>Centrifugal</strong> spread: After <strong>CNS</strong><span> infection is established, it spreads along the </span><strong>sensory</strong><span> and </span><strong>autonomic nerves</strong><span> to salivary glands, adrenal glands, skin </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rabies virus <strong>replicates</strong> in <strong>acinar cells</strong> of the <strong>salivary glands</strong> and is secreted in the saliva of rabid animals that serve as <strong>vectors.</strong></p>",
