It is characterized by gradually developing <strong>spastic paralysis</strong> of the <strong>lower limbs</strong>. In <strong>animals</strong>, it is referred to as <strong>osteolathyrism</strong> as it leads to skeletal deformities. It usually affects <strong>young males</strong> aged <strong>15-45 years</strong> and it is manifested in stages: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Latent stage</li>\n<li>No-stick stage</li>\n<li>One-stick stage</li>\n<li>Two-stick stage</li>\n<li>Crawler stage</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Beta-oxalyl-amino-alanine (BOAA)</strong> is the toxic compound causing <strong>lathyrism. </strong>The water-soluble property of the toxin is used in removing it from the pulses by <strong>soaking it in hot water</strong> and <strong>rejecting</strong> the soaked <strong>water</strong>. <strong>Vitamin C</strong> in doses of 500-1000 mg can be used for the <strong>prevention</strong> and <strong>treatment</strong> of lathyrism.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option A: <strong>Aflatoxins</strong> are produced by certain fungi, such as <em><strong>Aspergillus flavus</strong></em> and <em><strong>Aspergillus parasiticus</strong>,<strong> </strong></em>are the most potent <strong>hepatotoxins</strong>. These fungi can contaminate food grains such as groundnut, maize, parboiled rice, sorghum, wheat, and tapioca.
