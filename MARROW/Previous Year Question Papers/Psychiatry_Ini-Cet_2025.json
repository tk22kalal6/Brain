      "solution": "Severe cases of alcohol withdrawal can be treated with I.V Flumazenil is the false statement. <br><br>Alcohol withdrawal symptoms include autonomic hyperactivity, such as anxiety, arousal, sweating, facial flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, and mild hypertension. The classic sign of alcohol withdrawal is tremulousness, commonly called the \"shakes\" or the \"jitters\". It also causes psychotic and perceptual symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations), seizures, and delirium tremens. <br><br>These are commonly treated with benzodiazepines such as oxazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and lorazepam. Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist and is not used to treat alcohol withdrawal. It is used to reverse benzodiazepine-induced sedation and in emergency care of benzodiazepine overdosage<br><br>Other options: <br><br>Option B: Opioid withdrawal can cause symptoms like drug craving, feeling of temperature change, musculoskeletal pain, and GI distress. Signs of opioid withdrawal include confusion, drowsiness, vomiting, and diarrhea. It is not typically life-threatening, especially compared to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, which can lead to seizures or delirium tremens. Hence, opioid withdrawal is rarely fatal. <br><br>Option C: Chronic opioid withdrawal can be effectively managed using long-acting opioids like buprenorphine or methadone. These medications help reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings and are a cornerstone of opioid substitution therapy.<br><br>Option D: Cannabis withdrawal is associated with minimal physical symptoms. The most common features include irritability, cannabis cravings, nervousness, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, disturbed or vivid dreaming, decreased appetite, weight loss, depressed mood, and tremors.<br><br>Pearl PM0416: Substances of abuse<br><br><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Substance</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Withdrawal symptoms</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Intoxication features</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Alcohol</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Tremors, delirium, seizures</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Blackouts, nystagmus and slurring of speech</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>BZD</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Tremors, insomnia, anxiety</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Lethargy and drowsiness.</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Opioid/ Heroin</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Diarrhea, yawning, mydriasis, lacrimation, piloerection, cold turkey phenomenon</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Euphoria, depressed mental status, miosis, respiratory depression, constipation.</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Nicotine/ Tobacco</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Increased appetite</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Shows a biphasic pattern. </span></div>\n<div><span>Early stimulatory symptoms of vomiting, hypertension and tachycardia. </span><span>Later depressive symptoms of hypotension and bradycardia.</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Cannabis</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Irritability, sweating, tremors, decreased appetite</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Increased appetite, euphoria, conjunctival injection, dry mouth, </span><span>panic, </span><span>synesthesia, impaired time perception, amotivational syndrome, run amok and </span><span>flashbacks.</span></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<div><span><strong>Amphetamine</strong></span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div><span>Depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, unpleasant dreams</span></div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div><span>Acute: </span><span>Sympathetic </span><span>overactivity, paranoid hallucinatory syndrome, violent behavior, psychosis and diaphoresis.</span></div>\n</div>\n<div><span>Chronic: Runs &amp; crashes, choreiform movements, tooth decay.

It is well tolerated and associated with a rapid onset of response. <br><br>* Carbamazepine and Oxcarbazepine: They are one of the first-line treatment for acute mania.<br><br>* Clonazepam and Lorazepam.
