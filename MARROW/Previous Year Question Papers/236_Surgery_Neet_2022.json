It is usually congenital.</p>\n<p>VUR can cause urinary stasis and lead to urinary tract infection (UTI).&nbsp;It also predisposes to <strong>pyelonephritis</strong>, which can lead to <strong>renal scarring</strong> due to parenchymal inflammation. This is known as<strong> reflux nephropathy.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Micturating cystogram</strong> is used to <strong>confirm</strong> the VUR.&nbsp;VUR can be<strong> graded</strong>&nbsp;based on the appearance of the urinary tract on the micturating cystogram. It is as follows:</p>\n<p>Grade 1- reflux into the ureter</p>\n<p>Grade 2- reflux into the ureter and renal pelvis</p>\n<p>Grade 3- mild to moderate dilatation on IVU along with reflux and mild blunting of calices</p>\n<p>Grade 4- blunting of fornices</p>\n<p>Grade 5- absent papillary impressions</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/a269011a879f4dca9dbd2eec15a9e77cx1064x2464.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Grades 1-3 resolve spontaneously.&nbsp;Surgical management is done&nbsp;when&nbsp;acute pyelonephritis recurs in spite of antibiotic therapy or if&nbsp;severe reflux is associated with a defect that can be corrected surgically.</p>\n<p>Other options:</p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Urinary bladder diverticula</strong> occurs due to pressure changes in the bladder leading to the formation of saccules that may protrude through the bladder wall. It is more common in <strong>elderly males &gt;50 years</strong> and is usually asymptomatic or not infected. Symptoms may occur due to associated urinary obstruction, recurrent infection, or pyelonephritis. They are <strong>diagnosed incidentally</strong> on cystoscopy or ultrasonography.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option C: <strong>Urinary bladder hernia&nbsp;</strong>is an uncommon condition characterized by herniation of the&nbsp;urinary bladder or ureter into the&nbsp;inguinal canal, scrotum, or femoral canal. Urinary symptoms such as&nbsp;dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia, and hematuria can be seen. Retrograde cystography is th<span>e best technique to image a bladder hernia.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Option D:<strong> Vesicocolic fistula </strong>is an abnormal communication between the bladder and the colon. As a result of this, the fecal matter may enter the bladder. <strong>Diverticulitis</strong> is the most common cause. Bubbles in the urine, pain, hematuria, and recurrent UTI can occur. Cystoscopy reveals <strong>edema </strong>and<strong> gas bubbles</strong>. The fistula can be seen in a cystogram.&nbsp;</p>",
