It involves the whole thickness of the actual skin. It is permanent and persists even after death. If the entire body is burnt, a line of redness will be absent.</p>\n<p>The<strong> antemortem blister</strong> appears as a raised dome. It contains <strong>serous fluid</strong> with proteins and chlorides. The base shows&nbsp;<strong>reddening</strong> with swollen papillae. In antemortem burns, the skin adjacent to the burnt area shows an <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>enzyme reaction.</strong>&nbsp;The reaction is increased for sulfhydryl groups in all layers. There is also an increase in ATP, esterases, aminopeptidases, and acid and alkaline phosphatase. Marked <strong>cellular exudation</strong> and reactive tissue changes are called vital reactions.

It is caused by the vigorous agitation of the tracheal and bronchial mucous secretions, edema fluid, and alveolar surfactant during respiratory efforts. </li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Cutis anserina - The contraction of the erector pilorum muscles causes puckering and grainy appearance of the skin. This resembles <strong>goose skin</strong>; hence, it is called cutis anserina.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Washerwoman’s hand </strong>- Maceration of the skin on the palms and soles gives a wrinkled, sodden, and bleached appearance due to submersion.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Cadaveric spasm<strong> </strong>- Gravel, weed, soil, grass, etc. is firmly held in the clenched hands due to cadaveric spasm. This is a vital sign of antemortem drowning. The material also indicates the place of submersion.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Rigor mortis - This appears early in cases of a violent antemortem struggle.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Face - It is bloated and discolored, with cyanosis.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Eyes - Conjunctiva are suffused and pupils dilated.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Tongue - It may be swollen and protruded.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Antemortem injuries - These may be sustained by striking objects, such as rocks, during the fall into the water body. Examination for such injuries must be performed only after the body is dry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Internal findings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Lungs - They appear voluminous and distended and show ballooning. The cut section will exude copious amounts of frothy, bloodstained fluid.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Larynx, trachea, and bronchioles - The presence of sand, silt, and aquatic vegetation in the trachea and lower respiratory tract are characteristic findings of antemortem drowning.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Heart and blood vessels- <strong>Gettler test</strong> can be done to estimate the chloride content in the right and left sides of the heart to differentiate between freshwater and saltwater drowning. </li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Diatom test</strong>- Diatoms are microscopic algae. Their presence in the organs, particularly in the bone marrow, is suggestive of antemortem drowning.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Stomach</strong> and small intestines- These organs may contain <strong>water</strong> in some cases. Water present in the small intestine is positive evidence of death by drowning.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Middle ear - The presence of water in the middle ear is highly suggestive of antemortem drowning.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Brain - It is congested, and edematous, with loss of gray-white junction.</li>\n</ul><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Differentiating features between Antemortem amd Postmortem drowning</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Feature</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Antemortem drowning </strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Postmortem drowning</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Froth/ foam at nostrils or mouth</td>\n<td>Present</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cadaveric spasm</td>\n<td>Present</td>\n<td>Absent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lungs</td>\n<td>\n<p>Emphysema aquosum</p>\n<p>Edema aquosum(seen in unconscious)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lungs are voluminous, bulky, water-logged and over-inflated</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Passive collection of water in the lungs</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Presence of foreign bodies (fluid, debris, weeds, vegetation, etc)</td>\n<td>Present in bronchi and bronchioles</td>\n<td>Passively collected only in upper respiratory passage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Demonstration of diatoms&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Present in the lungs, liver, brain, bone marrow, etc.</td>\n<td>\n<p>Present only in the lungs</p>\n<p>Not spread to distant organs because of absence of circulation</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stomach contents&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<p>Water</p>\n<p>Foreign material like sand, weed, dirt etc&nbsp; (swallowed while struggling for life)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Water (lesser quantity)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Difference between freshwater and seawater drowning.</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Freshwater drowning</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Seawater drowning</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mechanism of death</strong></td>\n<td>Disruption of surfactant - causes surfactant denaturation</td>\n<td>Disruption of surfactant - causes dilution of surfactant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fluid and electrolyte changes</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypervolemia</p>\n<p>Hyponatremia</p>\n<p>Hyperkalemia</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Hypovolemia</p>\n<p>Hypernatremia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Time to death</strong></td>\n<td>\n<p>Lesser (4-5 minutes)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>More (8-12 minutes)</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The <strong>British</strong> <strong>East</strong> <strong>India</strong> <strong>Company</strong> smuggled <strong>opium</strong> into China in <strong>exchange</strong> for <strong>tea</strong>, <strong>silk</strong> and <strong>porcelain</strong> pots.</p>\n<p><strong>Opium</strong> derived from the immature seedpods of the opium poppy (<strong><em>Papaver</em> <em>somniferum</em></strong>), was originally indigenous to the present-day territory of Turkey. The introduction of opium to China occurred during the late 6th or early 7th century CE, facilitated by Turkish and Arab traders. </p>\n<p>During this time, tobacco smoking moved from North America to China, resulting in widespread opium smoking. Opium addiction and imports increased in the first century of the Qing era (1644–1911/12). To address the issue, the Yongzheng emperor (1722–35) banned opium trafficking and consumption in 1729. Despite hurdles, the trade continued, and in 1796, the Jiaqing emperor banned opium imports and cultivation. Opium sales survived despite these laws.</p>\n<p>In the early 18th century, the Portuguese made a lot of money importing opium from India and selling it in China. British traders became China's main suppliers in 1773. The British East India Company monopolized <strong>Bengali</strong> opium farming. The company developed an inexpensive and productive opium poppies cultivation method in this location. The US and other Western nations traded Turkish and Indian opium.</p>\n<p>The opium trade was pursued by Britain and other European nations as a means to address their persistent trade deficit with China. In Europe, there existed a substantial and notable demand for <strong>Chinese commodities such as tea, silks, and porcelain pots</strong>. Conversely, in China, there was a very limited market for Europe's manufactured goods and other trade items. As a result, Europeans were required to utilize gold or silver as payment for Chinese goods. The opium trade, which resulted in a consistent demand for opium among Chinese individuals addicted to the substance, effectively addressed the persistent trade imbalance by facilitating the importation of opium from Western countries.</p>\n<p>Opium was not carried by the East India Company. Due to the Chinese restriction, the corporation outsourced it to “<strong>country</strong> <strong>traders</strong>”—private traders entitled to transport commodities from India to China. Smugglers on the Chinese shore bought opium from country traders. The traders gave the East India Company their sales of gold and silver. The corporation spent its gold and silver in China on profitable things to sell in England.</p>\n<p>Opium imports into China rose from 200 chests in 1729 to 1,000 in 1767 and 10,000 between 1820 and 1830. Although chest weight varied by origin, it averaged 140 pounds (63.5 kg). By 1838, China imported 40,000 chests annually. China lost the balance of payments to Britain for the first time. Opium distribution networks had evolved across China, frequently with corrupt officials' help. High opium addiction levels affected imperial troops and officials.</p>",

Vehicle deceleration is rapid in this impact. Rarely, the car is hit from behind, causing ‘acceleration’. The least common impacts are side and 'roll-overs'.<br />In a typical unrestrained deceleration condition, front-seat occupants surge forward and hit car structures in front of them.</p>\n<p>An <strong>unrestrained</strong> <strong>impact</strong> may cause the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The face and head following a collision with the windscreen glass, frame, or side pillars, cause skull and cervical spine fractures along with brain injury.</li>\n<li>Contact with the fascia or <strong>steering</strong> <strong>wheel</strong> can cause rib, sternal, heart, and liver damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyperflexion</strong> may cause <strong>aorta</strong> <strong>tears</strong> at the <strong>descending</strong> <strong>part</strong> of the <strong>arch</strong>, where the vessel attaches to the vertebral column.</li>\n<li>The passenger's <strong>knees</strong> may hit the <strong>parcel</strong> <strong>shelf</strong>, causing <strong>fractures</strong>.</li>\n<li>The driver's <strong>legs</strong>, supported by stop and clutch pedals, may transfer impact force to the <strong>pelvis</strong> via the tibia and femur. </li>\n<li>The rebounding force from the contact may cause the head to violently swing backwards, damaging the cervical or thoracic spine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Unrestrained</strong> <strong>rear</strong> <strong>occupants</strong> are projected forwards and impact the <strong>back</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>front</strong> <strong>seats</strong>, including headrests if equipped, during severe deceleration. They may be hurled over the seats, striking and injuring the front-seat occupants, or they may be <strong>expelled</strong> <strong>through</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>windscreen</strong>, which has been damaged by them or the persons in front.</p><p>Injuries inflicted on <strong>motorcyclists</strong> following collision with other vehicles include patterned abrasions and various head, chest and spine injuries. A distinct injury can arise from the practice of \"tail-gating\" in which a motorcycle manoeuvres beneath the rear of a vehicle, resulting in significant cranial trauma or, in extreme cases, <strong>decapitation</strong>. The implementation of protective bars positioned at the sides and rear of trucks has effectively mitigated the occurrence of injuries resulting from bikes and vehicles passing beneath the vehicle.</p>",

This syndrome manifests due to the <strong>abrupt</strong> or <strong>intense</strong> compression of the <strong>thorax</strong> or <strong>upper</strong> <strong>abdomen</strong>, or both.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Pralidoxime</strong> is used in <strong>organophosphate poisoning</strong> and <strong>not as a chelator</strong> in <strong>heavy metal poisoning</strong>.<br /><br />In <strong>organophosphate poisoning</strong>, <strong>oximes</strong> like <strong>pralidoxime (2-PAM)</strong> <strong>regenerates active acetylcholinesterase</strong> restoring neuromuscular transmission and relieves skeletal muscle end-plate block. It is usually used as an<strong> adjuvant to atropine</strong> which act as <strong>competitive inhibitors</strong> to counter the <strong>nicotinic and muscarinic</strong> effects of organophosphates.&nbsp;<br /><br />Pralidoxime <strong>should not be administered without concurrent atropine</strong>, in order to prevent worsening of symptoms due to <strong>transient oxime-induced acetylcholinesterase inhibition</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Pralidoxime</strong> attaches to the <strong>anionic site</strong> of the <strong>cholinesterase</strong> enzyme, which remains unoccupied in the presence of organophosphates. It binds and forms <strong>oxime-phosphonate</strong> which <strong>diffuses away</strong>, leaving the <strong>reactivated cholinesterase</strong>.&nbsp;Pralidoxime is <strong>not an effective anti&shy;dote</strong> to <strong>carbamates</strong> like <strong>carbaryl</strong> and may <strong>potentiate its toxicity</strong>, as the&nbsp;<strong>anionic</strong>&nbsp;<strong>site</strong>&nbsp;required for attachment of oximes is<strong>&nbsp;occupied.<br /><br /></strong>Other options :&nbsp;<strong><br /><br />Option A : British anti-Lewisite (BAL) </strong>also known as<strong> Dimercaprol&nbsp;</strong>is used as an antidote for <strong>gold,&nbsp;arsenic&nbsp;(except arsine), </strong>or<strong> acute&nbsp;mercury&nbsp;poisoning (except non-alkyl mercury).</strong>&nbsp;It is also an<strong> adjunct to edetate calcium disodium </strong>in<strong> acute&nbsp;lead&nbsp;poisoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Option B :&nbsp;Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is used for acute lead poisoning.&nbsp;</strong>It is&nbsp;<strong>not suitable</strong>&nbsp;for the management of&nbsp;<strong>chronic lead poisoning.&nbsp;</strong>The calcium salt of EDTA can be used in the management of heavy metal poisonings where the metal in question has a higher affinity for EDTA than calcium in vivo. Because of their&nbsp;<strong>lower affinity to EDTA, mercury and arsenic</strong>&nbsp;cannot be effectively chelated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Option D : Penicillamine&nbsp;</strong>is used as a <strong>chelator</strong> in the treatment of <strong>mild cases</strong> of <strong>lead poisoning</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>D-penicillamine</strong>&nbsp;(Cuprimine) can also be used to treat <strong>scleroderma</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Wilson's disease</strong>, and <strong>rheumatoid</strong> <strong>arthritis</strong>. Side effects include <strong>nephrotoxicity</strong>, <strong>hematologic</strong> <strong>derangements</strong>, and a characteristic <strong>rash</strong> that involves the neck and axillae&mdash;<strong>elastosis perforans serpiginosa</strong>.&nbsp;It is associated with <strong>membranous glomerulonephritis</strong>, <strong>drug-induced lupus</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>myasthenia gravis</strong>.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Specific antidotes for poisoning</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ANTIDOTE</strong></td>\n<td><strong>POISONING</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4-methyl pyrazole</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>100% oxygen </strong></td>\n<td>Carbon monoxide, cyanide, methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ammonium chloride </strong></td>\n<td>Phencyclidine, amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Amyl nitrate </strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide, hydrogen sulphide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Atropine</strong></td>\n<td>Carbamate and organophosphorus poisoning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bupropion</strong></td>\n<td>Nicotine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium disodium edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, magnesium, nickel, uranium, zinc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Calcium gluconate </strong></td>\n<td>Precipitates fluorides, magnesium and oxalates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Chlorpromazine</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Deferoxamine</strong></td>\n<td>Iron, aluminium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diazepam</strong></td>\n<td>Amphetamine, chloroquine, alcohol withdrawal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dicobalt edetate</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dimercaprol (BAL)</strong></td>\n<td>Antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and gold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Diphenhydramine</strong></td>\n<td>Phenothiazines and related drugs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Disodium calcium edetate</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMPS *, (Unithiol)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Mercury</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>DMSA ** </strong></td>\n<td><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>D-Penicillamine (Cuprimine) </strong></td>\n<td>Copper, lead, mercury, chromate, nickel, zinc, arsenic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ethanol</strong></td>\n<td>Methanol and ethylene glycol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Fab fragment</strong></td>\n<td>Digoxin, digitoxin, oleander tea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Flumazenil</strong></td>\n<td>Benzodiazepine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Glucagon</strong></td>\n<td>Propranolol and other beta-blockers toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hydroxocobalamin</strong></td>\n<td>Cyanide</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Labetalol hydrochloride</strong></td>\n<td>Hypertensive crisis due to cocaine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methionine</strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Methylene blue</strong></td>\n<td>Methemoglobinemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>N-acetylcysteine </strong></td>\n<td>Paracetamol, acetaminophen toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nalorphine</strong></td>\n<td>Morphine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Naloxone (Naltrexone)</strong></td>\n<td>Narcotic, opiates, CNS depressants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Nicotinamide</strong></td>\n<td>Vacor poisoning, phenylurea pesticide toxicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pancuronium bromide</strong></td>\n<td>Neuromuscular blocking agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Penicillamine</strong></td>\n<td>Copper</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Physostigmine salicylate </strong></td>\n<td>Coma, convulsions from anticholinergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pralidoxime (2-PAM) </strong></td>\n<td>Organophosphorus insecticides, nerve agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Propranolol</strong></td>\n<td>Cocaine intoxication, beta adrenergics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Protamine sulphate </strong></td>\n<td>Heparin overdose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Prussian blue</strong></td>\n<td>Thallium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pyridoxine (Vit.
