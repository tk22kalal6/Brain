      "solution": "<p><strong>Nucleus of Meynert</strong> is affected in Alzheimer's disease.</p>\n<p>Biochemically, there is a reduction of acetylcholine and <strong>degeneration</strong> of <strong>cholinergic neurons</strong> in the <strong>nucleus basalis of Meynert</strong> that project throughout the cortex. There is also noradrenergic and serotonergic depletion due to degeneration of brain stem nuclei such as the locus ceruleus and the dorsal raphe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Microscopically, there are neuritic plaques containing amyloid-&beta;, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid-&beta; accumulation in the blood vessel walls of the cortex and leptomeninges.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The FDA recently approved<strong> Flortaucipir F18</strong> for <strong>intravenous injection</strong>, the <strong>first radioactive diagnostic agent</strong> for adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. It is indicated for <strong>PET imaging of the brain</strong> to estimate the density and distribution of aggregated <strong>tau</strong> neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a primary marker of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</span></p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Alzheimer’s disease</h3><p><strong>Alzheimer’s disease:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age of onset &gt; 60 years</li>\n<li>Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) &lt; 24</li>\n<li>Diagnosis: Clinical\n<ul>\n<li>2 or more areas of cognitive deficits</li>\n<li>Progressive worsening of memory and other cognitive function</li>\n<li>No disturbance in consciousness</li>\n<li>Other systemic causes must be ruled out </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Risk Factors:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most important risk factor: Old age</li>\n<li>Other risk factors – Family history, presenilin-1, presenilin-2, Apolipoprotein E4 <strong><strong>(ApoE ε4 allele)</strong></strong>, Ubiquitin, Down syndrome and smoking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Protective factors:</strong> NSAIDs and Apolipoprotein <strong>E2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Causes: </strong>Decrease in <strong>acetylcholine</strong> causing depletion of the cholinergic neurons in the <strong>nucleus basalis of Meynert</strong> resulting in short-term memory defects. </p>\n<p><strong>Early findings:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anterograde</strong> memory loss (immediate recall affected, distant memories preserved)</li>\n<li><strong>Visuospatial deficits</strong> (lost in own neighborhood)</li>\n<li><strong>Language difficulties</strong> (difficulty finding words)</li>\n<li><strong>Cognitive impairment</strong> with a progressive decline</li>\n<li>Anosognosia </li>\n<li>Visual processing dysfunction (posterior cortical atrophy syndrome)</li>\n<li>Difficulties with naming and repetition (logopenic aphasia)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Late findings:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychotic symptoms: <strong>delusions</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Apraxia</strong>: Difficulty to perform learned motor tasks</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of insight</strong> regarding deficits</li>\n<li>Non-cognitive neurologic deficits: Pyramidal and extrapyramidal, myoclonus and seizures</li>\n<li>disrupted sleep - wake pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Urinary incontinence.</strong></li>\n<li>Loss of procedural memory</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Histopathology:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Senile plaques</strong> (amyloid deposits), <strong>neurofibrillary tangles</strong> (composed of <strong>tau</strong> proteins), neuronal loss, synaptic loss, and granulovacuolar degeneration of neurons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The image below shows neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/e5db3b220b5c4a6fb0a82d0c724c68c5x640x784.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\"><p><strong>CT/MRI:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Later stages: Cortical and subcortical atrophy prominent in parietal and temporal lobes, particularly <strong>hippocampus</strong>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>NMDA antagonist: <strong>memantine</strong></li>\n<li>Cholinesterase inhibitors: <strong>donepezil</strong>, <strong>galantamine</strong>, <strong>rivastigmine</strong>.</li>\n<li>Monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminus of the Aβ peptide - <strong>l</strong><strong>ecanemab, donanemab</strong></li>\n</ul>",
