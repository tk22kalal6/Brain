However, improved <strong>susceptibility</strong> is seen with newer generation azoles such as <strong>voriconazole</strong>.</p>\n<p>Life-threatening systemic infections caused by <strong>Candida</strong> and <strong>Aspergillus</strong> species are usually seen in <strong>severely ill</strong> and <strong>immunocompromised</strong> patients such as HIV, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, and transplant recipients on immunosuppressants. C. albicans and C. dubliniensis are most susceptible to currently available azoles, C. glabrata is less susceptible, whereas <strong>C. krusei is intrinsically resistant to fluconazole.&nbsp;</strong>Resistance occurs due to overexpression or point mutation in the gene encoding the target enzyme&nbsp;<strong>lanosterol 14&alpha;-demethylase. Voriconazole&nbsp;</strong>is the preferred therapy for multi-drug resistant infection with C. krusei.</p>\n<p><strong>C. albicans</strong>&nbsp;showing <strong>resistance</strong> to <strong>Amphotericin B</strong> has been increasingly reported over the past several years.

This results in a <strong>decrease in both PAO2 and PaO2</strong> and <strong>A-a gradient</strong> remains <strong>normal</strong>. Hypoventilation can be seen in<strong> CNS depression,</strong> neuromuscular diseases such as <strong>myasthenia gravis,</strong> <strong>kyphoscoliosis</strong>, vertebral fractures, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Other options:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Option A- In a <strong>right-to-left shunt</strong>, a portion of the pulmonary blood flow gets shunted away from the alveoli. This results in ventilation without perfusion which causes a higher V/Q ratio. Here, diffusion between capillaries and alveoli is unaffected,&nbsp; but the <strong>arterial PaO<sub>2</sub></strong> is <strong>decreased</strong> due to the lack of oxygenation of the shunted blood. This results in hypoxemia and an <strong>increased A-a gradient. </strong>In the cases of the shunt, oxygenation does not improve hypoxemia.</p>\n<p>Option B- <strong>Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) mismatch</strong> is the most common cause of hypoxemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Low V/Q mismatch</strong> occurs in <strong>chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder</strong> (COPD), <strong>asthma, interstitial lung disease,</strong> etc. In these cases, the <strong>A-a oxygen gradient</strong> is <strong>increased</strong> due to a defect in diffusion resulting in hypoxemia. </p>\n<p>A <strong>high V/Q</strong> ratio is seen in<strong> pulmonary embolism</strong> (PE) where there is wasted ventilation. The alveolar oxygen is normal but there is decreased perfusion resulting in <strong>increased A-a gradient.</strong> </p>\n<p>Inspiratory hypoxia, seen at h<strong>igh altitudes,</strong> can cause a <strong>V/Q mismatch.</strong> The decreased atmospheric pressure causes a decreased PAO2. There is normal diffusion which suggests a <strong>normal A-a gradient</strong> while the arterial PaO2 decreases, leading to <strong>hypoxemia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Hypoventilation is the better answer as the cause of the V/Q mismatch is not specified.</p>\n<p>Option D: <strong>Alveolar membrane damage</strong> affects diffusion between the alveoli and capillaries. The oxygen levels in the arterial blood decrease even though alveoli are being ventilated.

      "solution": "<p>The given clinical scenario of a patient with dyspnea, bilateral pitting pedal edema, abdominal distension, elevated jugular venous pulse (JVP) and a palpable liver are suggestive of <strong>right ventricular (RV) failure.</strong> The history of<strong> chronic smoking</strong> points towards <strong>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</strong> (COPD) as the etiology for RV failure <strong>(cor pulmonale).</strong> The label 2 points to the right ventricle (RV), which is affected in this patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Cor pulmonale</strong> is defined as altered RV structure/function secondary to pulmonary hypertension in the context of chronic lung diseases.</p>\n<p>The main pathophysiology behind cor pulmonale is <strong>pulmonary hypertension</strong> and <strong>increased right ventricular (RV) afterload</strong> which is sufficient to cause <strong>RV dilation</strong> with or without <strong>hypertrophy</strong>. Sustained pressure overload leads to RV <strong>dysfunction and failure.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dyspnea</strong> is the <strong>most common</strong> symptom. Signs include elevated JVP with prominent v waves, hepatomegaly, pulsatile liver, ascites, pedal edema, S3 gallop and murmur of tricuspid regurgitation.</p>\n<p>The ECG in severe pulmonary hypertension shows <strong>p-pulmonale, right axis deviation,</strong> and <strong>RV hypertrophy.</strong> Echo can be used to measure RV wall thickness and chamber dimensions, while doppler can be used to assess pulmonary artery pressures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A specimen of the heart with the various parts labeled is given below:</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/20f8fcfb42a241858420a39210256d38x1280x1083.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\">",
