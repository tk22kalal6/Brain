      "solution": "<p>The condition shown in the image is a <strong>rectal prolapse</strong> and <strong>Ripstein's procedure</strong> is done using the <strong>abdominal</strong> approach.</p>\n<p><strong>Rectal prolapse</strong> occurs when a mucosal or full-thickness layer of rectal tissue protrudes through the anal orifice.&nbsp;Rectal prolapse is of two types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Partial </strong>rectal prolapse<strong>:</strong> Only the mucosal layer of the rectum is prolapsed. It is seen in children.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Complete </strong>rectal prolapse:<strong> </strong>&nbsp;All the layers of the rectum are prolapsed. It is seen in adults due to the weakening of the pelvic floor.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Management:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first episode of a partial rectal prolapse is managed by digital repositioning. On recurrence, Theirsch's wiring or sclerotherapy are considered.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Complete rectal prolapse is managed surgically, either by perineal or abdominal approaches:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>1. Perineal approach:</strong>&nbsp;Often preferred in&nbsp;patients with<strong>&nbsp;high operative risk</strong>&nbsp;and limited life expectancy, i.e. in the&nbsp;<strong>elderly.</strong>&nbsp;It is&nbsp;associated with less morbidity but has a&nbsp;<strong>higher recurrence rate</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Thiersch's wiring</strong>- A steel wire/nylon tape is placed around the anal canal. Largely obsolete now due to problems with chronic perineal sepsis, anal stenosis, and obstructed defecation.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Delorme's mucosectomy</strong>- The rectal mucosa is stripped circumferentially from the rectum over the length of the prolapse. The underlying muscle is plicated with a series of sutures. The excess rectal mucosa is excised and a mucosal anastomosis is performed.</li>\n<li><strong>Altemeier's rectosigmoidectomy</strong>- The rectum is prolapsed through the anal canal and a full-thickness resection is performed, incorporating any associated colonic prolapse. Restoration of colorectal continuity can be performed by hand-sewn/stapled anastomosis. This is the procedure of choice in patients presenting with incarcerated and strangulated prolapse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Abdominal approach:</strong> Difficult to perform, more complications but a lower recurrence rate.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ripstein's procedure</strong>- involves the placement of a prosthetic mesh around the mobilized rectum, with the attachment of the mesh to the presacral fascia (anterior) below the sacral promontory.</li>\n<li><strong>Well's procedure</strong>- involves posterior rectopexy.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Suture rectopexy</li>\n</ul>",
