      "solution": "<p><strong>Low apparent volume of distribution</strong> of a drug indicates that it is <strong>not extensively distributed in the tissues.</strong></p>\n<p>Apparent Volume of distribution (Vd) = dose administered I.V/ plasma concentration E.g: If a 500 mg of drug A is given i.v (100% bioavailability) and the plasma concentration reached is 10 mg/ liter then the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) is 500/10= 50 liters.</p>\n<p>But the normal blood volume is about 5 liters. A high Vd is due to accumulation of drug A in extravascular tissues resulting in low plasma concentration. Therefore, the apparent volume of distribution is an imaginary volume throughout which the drug is distributed if the plasma concentration remains the same throughout.</p>\n<p>Option A: t1/2 relationship with volume of distribution (Vd) and clearance (Cl) is given by the formula t 1/2 = 0.693 x Vd /Cl. t1/2 is directly proportional to Vd but it is also inversely proportional to clearance. If a drug has a low volume of distribution but clearance is very low, t1/2 can still be high. So low Vd doesn't always imply low t1/2. So the best answer among the given options is D.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Option B and C: Low Vd does not indicate low bioavailability or low efficacy.&nbsp;</p>",
