It can cause erosive esophagitis on ingestion. It has a fatal dose of 350mg. It could've also been classified as a corrosive, but since potassium carbonate is an alkali with stronger corrosive action, it is better classified as an irritant for this question</p>\n<p><strong>Chloral hydrate</strong> is a <strong>CNS depressant</strong>. It is also known as <strong>knockout drops</strong> because of its rapid action and used in robbery or rape to quickly render the victim helpless.</p>\n<p><strong>Quinine</strong> is a <strong>cardiotoxic drug</strong> with the additional action of being an <strong>abortifacient</strong>. It's overdose may lead to an echolic action (contract the pregnant uterus)</p>\n<p><strong>Potassium carbonate</strong> is a <strong>caustic alkali</strong> with a predominant action of <strong>corrosive</strong> due to its high pH.</p><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Classification of Poisons</h3><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Corrosives</strong></td>\n<td>Examples</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inorganic acids</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sulphuric acid</p>\n<p>Nitric acid</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Organic acids</td>\n<td>\n<p>Carbolic acid</p>\n<p>Oxalic acid</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alkalies</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sodium hydroxide</p>\n<p>Potassium carbonate</p>\n<p>Ammonia</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metallic salts</td>\n<td>\n<p>Zinc chloride</p>\n<p>Copper sulphate</p>\n<p>Silver nitrate</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Irritants</strong></td>\n<td>Examples</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inorganic - Metallic</td>\n<td>\n<p>Lead</p>\n<p>Copper</p>\n<p>Arsenic</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inorganic - Non-metallic</td>\n<td>\n<p>Phosphorus</p>\n<p>Halogens</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Organic - Vegetable</td>\n<td>\n<p>Abrus</p>\n<p>Croton</p>\n<p>Castor</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Organic - Animal</td>\n<td>\n<p>Snake venom</p>\n<p>Insect bites</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mechanical</td>\n<td>\n<p>Diamond dust</p>\n<p>Glass powder</p>\n<p>Pins</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Systemic Poisons</strong></td>\n<td>Examples</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CNS- Somniferous</td>\n<td>Opiates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CNS- Inebriants</td>\n<td>\n<p>Alcohol</p>\n<p>Sedatives, Hypnotics</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CNS- Deliriants</td>\n<td>\n<p>Datura</p>\n<p>Cannabis</p>\n<p>Cocaine</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CNS - Spinal</td>\n<td>\n<p>Strychnine</p>\n<p>Gelsemium</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Peripheral</td>\n<td>\n<p>Curare</p>\n<p>Conium maculatum</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cardiovascular</td>\n<td>\n<p>Oleander</p>\n<p>Aconite</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Asphyxiants</td>\n<td>\n<p>Carbon monoxide</p>\n<p>Cyanogen gas</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div>",
