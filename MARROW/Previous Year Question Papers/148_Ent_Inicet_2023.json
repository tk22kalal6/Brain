These fungi are&nbsp;<strong>ubiquitous thermotolerant saprobes</strong>. The leading pathogens among this group are species of the genera&nbsp;<strong>Rhizopus</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Mucor,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Absidia</strong>. Their spores are present in air and dust.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mucormycosis can <strong>occur as isolated cutaneous or subcutaneous</strong> infection in immunologically normal individuals after <strong>traumatic implantation of soil or vegetation.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Angio-invasiveness</strong>&nbsp;is one of the characteristics of zygomycosis which makes it fatal. Lungs are usually the primary site of infection. Almost all patients are immunocompromised. Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis occurs commonly in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. It is the most common form; starts as eye and facial pain may progress to cause orbital cellulitis, proptosis, and vision loss. The typical&nbsp;finding is the presence of a black necrotic mass filling the nasal cavity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exudate</strong>: wet preparation is made in 10% potassium hydroxide. Broad, ribbon-like hyphae are seen.</li>\n<li><strong>Tissue</strong>: Hematoxylin &amp; eosin stain shows non-septate, broad hyphae, often invading into blood vessels.&nbsp;Special stains help to identify the fungus in tissue sections.</li>\n<li>Biopsy confirms this diagnosis by revealing&nbsp;<strong>non-septate hyphae branching at right-angles,</strong>&nbsp;which are characteristic of Mucorales such as Rhizopus delemar. The&nbsp;hyphae are broad (10&ndash;15 &mu;m) with uneven thickness, irregular branching, and sparse septations.</li>\n<li>Isolation is by culture on&nbsp;<strong>Sabouraud agar with an antibacterial agent but without cycloheximide</strong>. The colonies are&nbsp;<strong>grey-white with a thick cotton, fluffy surface.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Treatment is primarily with liposomal amphotericin B. Surgical debridement of the affected tissues and control of underlying predisposing cause is equally important.</p>\n</div>\n</div><p><strong>Other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option D: IgG4-related disease</strong> (IgG4-RD) is characterized by tissue infiltrates dominated by IgG4 antibodies (the hallmark of the disease). The pathogenesis of this condition is not understood. This condition leads to fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. The patients may present as Riedel's thyroiditis, autoimmune pancreatitis, or idiopathic orbital inflammation. But not with <strong>ptosis as shown in the image.&nbsp;</strong>Diagnosis is established by <strong>positive fibrosis and the presence of plasma cells&nbsp;</strong>on biopsy.&nbsp;Rituximab is known to be beneficial. Sometimes, as a rare presentation, this can mimic Wegener's granulomatosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Midline lethal granuloma&nbsp;</strong>is a rare disease. It is characterized by necrotizing destruction and mutilation of the nose and other structures of respiratory passages. Generally, it is a diagnosis of exclusion. CT may be helpful in picking up the lesions. Negative c-ANCA and fungal stains also aid in the diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Option C: NK/T cell lymphoma&nbsp;</strong>is a <strong>destructive lesion</strong> usually starting on one side of nose involving the upper lip, oral cavity, maxilla and sometimes even extending to orbit.Histologically polymorphic lymphoid tissue with angiocentric and angioinvasive features is seen. Immunochemical staining of biopsy material should be done for<strong> CD56+</strong> marker for diagnosis. Nearly all cases of T/NK cel lymphomas are associated with<strong> EB virus. Localized</strong> T/NK-cell lymphoma is treated by<strong> radiation</strong> while a <strong>disseminated</strong> disease requires <strong>chemotherapy</strong>.</p>",

There are also homogenous eosinophilic inclusion bodies consisting of the immunoglobulins in the plasma cells called the <strong>Russell bodies.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/5af7361582884ff9aa548a5b7867d604x512x341.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p>Option C: <strong>Inverted papilloma</strong> (transitional cell papilloma) is a tumour originating from the <strong>nonolfactory mucosa</strong> of the nose (Schneiderian membrane) and paranasal sinuses. The <strong>unilateral</strong> growth of hyperplastic papillomatous tissue into the stroma characterizes this condition. It primarily affects <strong>men</strong> aged <strong>40-70</strong> and presents <strong>unilaterally</strong> with symptoms such as <strong>nasal obstruction</strong>, nasal discharge, and <strong>epistaxis</strong>. Invasive growth into the sinuses or orbit can lead to <strong>proptosis</strong>, diplopia, and lacrimation.  A <strong>biopsy</strong> <span class=\"word\">is</span> <span class=\"word\">essential </span><span class=\"word\">for</span> <span class=\"word\">diagnosis. Histology shows a thin respiratory epithelium overlying the surface and an</span> underlying stroma containing <strong>multiple nodules</strong> of thick neoplastic epithelium<strong> growing inward. </strong></p>\n<p>Option D: <span class=\"word\"><strong>Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma</strong> is seen almost exclusively in males in the age group of 10–20 years and is very rarely seen in older people and females. </span>Profuse, recurrent, and spontaneous epistaxis is the most common presentation. Diagnosis is mostly clinical. <strong>Contrast-enhanced CT</strong> scan of the head is the<strong> investigation of choice</strong> that reveals <strong>anterior bowing</strong> of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus (<strong>Antral sign/Holman Miller sign</strong>) which is pathognomonic of angiofibroma.</p>",

During forceful expiration, when pressure builds up, the <strong>glottis opens</strong> and then the air comes out. The <strong>cough reflex</strong> is a <strong>protective mechanism</strong> of the larynx to <strong>expel irritants</strong> and keep the airway clear.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Coughing begins with a <strong>deep</strong> inspiration followed by a <strong>forced expiration against a closed glottis</strong>. This increases the intrapleural pressure to 100 mm Hg or more.
