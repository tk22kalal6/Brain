      "solution": "The given clinical scenario of a child complaining of painful vesicular lesions around the mouth, with histopathology showing multinucleated giant cells, suggests the most probable diagnosis to be oral herpes caused by Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV).<br><br>Herpes infection can be caused by the HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses. HSV-1 causes orofacial lesions, i.e. herpes labialis, while HSV-2 mainly causes genital herpes which is characterised by vesiculoulcerative lesions of the penis of the male or the cervix, vulva, vagina, and perineum of the female. Genital herpes is often accompanied by symptoms like fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia, pain, itching, dysuria, vaginal and urethral discharge, and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy.<br><br>Diagnosis of herpes simplex virus:<br><br>* Most sensitive test- HSV DNA- PCR (can differentiate between HSV 1 and 2)<br><br>* Virus isolation <br><br>* Histopathology showing multinucleated giant cells<br><br>* Microscopy - Tzanck smear, which is a rapid, diagnostic method, shows Tzanck cells.

      "solution": "Based on the given clinical scenario, the most likely diagnosis is nevus depigmentosus. <br><br>This condition presents as a stable, congenital or early childhood hypopigmented macule. On Wood’s lamp examination, the lesion shows white accentuation. The lesion remains non-progressive and asymptomatic throughout life, which fits the case scenario. <br><br>Nevus depigmentosus is a stable, well-circumscribed hypopigmented patch that is present at birth and may become more noticeable during the first year as the surrounding skin pigmentation develops. There is usually a single oval or rectangular lesion, but the presence of three or more nevus depigmentosus or hypomelanotic patches in a newborn should raise suspicion for possible tuberous sclerosis complex. It is a congenital nonprogressive hypopigmented macule or patch that is stable in its relative size and distribution throughout life. <br><br>Nevus depigmentosus can be diagnosed using the following criteria:<br><br>* Leukoderma present at birth or of early onset<br><br>* No alteration in the distribution of leukoderma throughout life<br><br>* No alteration in texture or change in sensation in the affected area<br><br>* Absence of hyperpigmented border.<br><br>Diascopy test is negative in nevus depigmentosus but positive in nevus anemicus. Wood's lamp examination demonstrates an off-white color. Histopathologic examination shows normal to decreased number of melanocytes with S-100 stain. Mostly it does not require any treatment as it is non-progressive and adequate counseling is sufficient.<br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option A: Nevus anemicus are pale macules or patches most often on the trunk. They can be distinguished from other differentials because of their response to firm stroking. Stroking evokes an erythematous line and flare in normal surrounding skin, but the skin of a nevus anemicus does not redden.<br><br>They can also be diagnosed by diascopy, in which pressure of the skin with a glass slide will obscure the borders of a nevus anemicus. In this case, diascopy was inconclusive, making nevus anemicus less likely. The image below shows nevus anemicus:<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/eb886509b2ad4798ab69ffc2285b3edbx250x447.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option B: Vitiligo is an acquired condition resulting from the progressive loss of melanocytes.It is characterised by milky‐white, sharply demarcated macules. Under Wood’s lamp, vitiligo lesions appear chalky white due to the complete absence of melanin. Since the lesion here has been stable since childhood and not progressive, vitiligo is ruled out.<br><br><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7e0024a07c3749db97eb98b2f70b13ecx1280x1432.JPEG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><br><br>Option D: Indeterminate leprosy presents as hypopigmented macules with reduced sensation and poorly defined margins.

The findings are characteristic of oral lichen planus, and among drugs that can trigger this condition, the most commonly associated drug is a beta blocker.<br><br>Lichenoid drug eruption is a type of adverse reaction to certain medications that causes skin or oral lesions resembling lichen planus. The drugs most commonly implicated in lichenoid drug eruptions include antimalarials, gold, NSAIDs, penicillamine, thiazide diuretics, mercury amalgam, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, lithium, methyldopa, and other sulfonylureas. Out of the given options, beta blockers are considered one of the most potent generators for the drug-induced forms of lichen planus, compared to lithium (Option B). <br><br>Lichen planus-like drug reactions usually develop months or even years after starting the medication. They manifest as shiny purple papules or plaques, sometimes with the characteristic Wickham’s striae (thin white lines on their surface), and can involve mucous membranes. Diagnosis relies on skin biopsy, which typically shows hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis, saw-tooth acanthosis, and a band-like infiltrate in the upper dermis. Features that suggest a drug-related cause include necrotic keratinocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils.<br><br>Treatment centers on discontinuing the offending drug, which is crucial for resolution. Most cases improve with topical corticosteroids, while oral corticosteroids may be necessary for extensive or severe eruptions. Symptoms generally resolve within weeks to months after stopping the drug. <br><br>Other options:<br><br>Option C: Fluconazole is an antifungal, used to treat oral candidiasis and other fungal infections. It does not typically cause lichenoid drug eruption<br><br>Option D: Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone and can cause tendon ruptures, joint pain, gastrointestinal upset, and neurological side effects. Oral lichenoid lesions are not a well-known adverse effect.",
