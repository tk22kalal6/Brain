      "solution": "<p>The maneuver performed in the given image is that of a <strong>head-tilt chin-lift. </strong>It is an<strong> </strong>important technique in emergency airway management to open up the airway.</p>\n<p>Basic life support (BLS) involves early recognition and management of emergencies such as heart attack, stroke, and foreign body airway obstruction. The sequence of BLS is <strong>circulation</strong> (chest compression), <strong>airway</strong>, and <strong>breathing.</strong></p>\n<p>The airway is usually obstructed by posterior displacement of the tongue or epiglottis. One hand (palm) is placed on the patient’s forehead, applying pressure to tilt the head back. Simultaneously, the chin is lifted with the forefinger and index finger of the opposite hand. This causes cervical flexion with an atlantooccipital extension (sniffing position). This lifts the tongue from the back of the throat.</p>\n<p>Head-tilt chin-lift<strong> </strong>should<strong> not be performed in a patient with suspected cervical injury.</strong></p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/16fa5f5720a2492fa3f8e3f7f936dbd4x720x709.GIF\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />Other options: </p>\n<p>Option B: <strong>Jaw thrust </strong>- Both hands of the clinician are placed on either side of the patient’s head, and the angles of the jaw are grasped and lifted. It can be <strong>performed in a patient with cervical injury, </strong>but caution must be exercised to not hyperextend the neck.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/7339e1fa13354a7aafc600098c9b06afx1024x768.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><p><br />Option D: <strong>Manual inline stabilization</strong> is a maneuver that limits external head and neck movement in patients with cervical spine injuries. Fingers and palms of both hands are used to stabilize the patient's occiput and mastoid processes to ensure successful airway intervention.</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/963db6de4cbd4f008d43ebef55c153e9x972x734.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation Image\"><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Adult cardiac arrest algorithm (Updated as per 2020 guidelines)</h3><p>The adult cardiac arrest algorithm is based on the AHA guidelines as shown below.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"https://dhmbxeygs57ff.cloudfront.net/uploads/2bdbdbe380bd43f59ef07a42a15ff9bax1280x3518.JPEG\" alt=\"Pearl Image\">",

      "solution": "<p><strong>First- and second-generation cephalosporins</strong> (cefazolin) are the drugs of choice for preoperative prophylaxis for cardiac surgery. <strong>Clindamycin</strong> is reserved for cases of <strong>allergy to beta-lactams</strong> and <strong>vancomycin</strong> is recommended for <strong>methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis</strong> is essential in <strong>reducing the risk of surgical site infections</strong>, particularly in cardiac surgery, where the consequences of infection can be severe. The choice of antibiotic depends on the patient's medical history, allergies, and the most common pathogens involved in surgical site infections for the specific surgery. In addition to cefazolin, other cephalosporins, such as cefuroxime, can also be used for prophylaxis in cardiac surgery. The <strong>timing of antibiotic administration is crucial</strong>, with the <strong>first dose</strong> typically given <strong>within 60 minutes before the incision.</strong></p>\n<p>Other Options:</p>\n<p>Option A: Penicillin G is not the drug of choice for preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in cardiac surgery. It is mainly used to treat infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, such as <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, and some strains of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</p>\n<p>Option B: Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic and is not the drug of choice for preoperative prophylaxis in cardiac surgery. It is typically used to treat respiratory tract infections, skin infections, and other infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria.</p>\n<p>Option C: Azithromycin, another macrolide antibiotic, is also not the drug of choice for preoperative prophylaxis in cardiac surgery. It is commonly used to treat respiratory tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, and other infections caused by susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.</p>",

CPR involves chest compressions and rescue breaths to support circulation and respiration.</p>\n<p>Option B: Unconsciousness with pulse present and breathing absent - In this case, the patient is experiencing respiratory arrest. Rescue breathing or bag-valve-mask ventilation should be initiated to support the patient's breathing. The recovery position is not indicated in this scenario.</p>\n<p>Option D: Unconsciousness with pulse absent and breathing present - This option is not physiologically plausible, as the absence of a pulse implies a lack of circulation, and breathing cannot be present without circulation.</p>\n</div><hr><h3>Related Pearl: Neurocutaneous syndomes</h3><p><strong>Von Hippel Lindau Syndrome:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autosomal dominant</li>\n<li><span>Gene defect: VHL gene, tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3<br /></span></li>\n<li><span>Conditions associated with it include: </span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Renal cell carcinoma</span></li>\n<li><span>Hemangioblastomas</span></li>\n<li><span>Pheochromocytomas</span></li>\n<li><span>Angiomatosis</span></li>\n<li><span>Cysts in the pancreas, liver, and kidneys</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Neurofibromatosis type 1: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Also known as Von Recklinghausen Disease</li>\n<li>Autosomal dominant</li>\n<li>Gene defect: NF1 gene on chromosome 17, codes for the Neurofibromin protein</li>\n<li>Features of NF 1:  “CAFE SPOTS”\n<ul>\n<li><strong>C</strong>afé-au-lait spots (multiple, &gt;6, &gt;5 mm in children or &gt;15 mm in adults)</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>xillary or inguinal freckling</li>\n<li><strong>F</strong>amily history (autosomal dominant inheritance)</li>\n<li><strong>E</strong>ye findings (Lisch nodules on the iris)</li>\n<li><strong>S</strong>kin neurofibromas (benign tumors)</li>\n<li><strong>P</strong>lexiform neurofibromas (larger, deeper tumors)</li>\n<li><strong>O</strong>ptic pathway gliomas (tumors of the optic nerve)</li>\n<li><strong>T</strong>ibial dysplasia (bone abnormalities, e.g., bowing of the tibia)</li>\n<li><strong>S</strong>keletal abnormalities (e.g., scoliosis)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Neurofibromatosis type 2:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autosomal dominant</li>\n<li>Gene defect: NF2 gene on chromosome 22 that codes for the Merlin protein</li>\n<li>Features: \"MISME\"\n<ul>\n<li><strong>M</strong>ultiple schwannomas (bilateral vestibular schwannomas are hallmark)</li>\n<li><strong>I</strong>ntracranial meningiomas</li>\n<li><strong>S</strong>pinal tumors (ependymomas, schwannomas)</li>\n<li><strong>M</strong>eningiomas (intracranial or spinal)</li>\n<li><strong>E</strong>pendymomas (spinal cord tumors)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tuberous sclerosis: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autosomal dominant</li>\n<li>Mutation in the TSC 1 gene on chromosome 9 and TSC 2 on chromosome 16</li>\n<li>Features: “HAMARTOMAS”\n<ul>\n<li><strong>H</strong>amartomas in skin and CNS</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>sh-leaf spots (Hypopigmented macules)</li>\n<li><strong>M</strong>itral regurgitation</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>ngiofibromas (adenoma sebaceum)</li>\n<li><strong>R</strong>habdomyomas of the heart</li>\n<li><strong>T</strong>uberous sclerosis</li>\n<li>Autosomal d<strong>OM</strong>inant</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>ngiomyolipomas</li>\n<li><strong>S</strong>eizures and shagreen patches</li>\n<li>Also associated with intellectual disability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sturge Weber Syndrome</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Also known as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis</li>\n<li>Somatic mosaicism due to mutation in GNAQ gene</li>\n<li>Features: “STURGE - I”\n<ul>\n<li>Portwine <strong>S</strong>tain (Nevus flammeus)</li>\n<li><strong>T</strong>ram track calcifications (leptomeningeal angioma)</li>\n<li><strong>U</strong>nilateral weakness</li>\n<li><strong>R</strong>etinal detachment and atrophy</li>\n<li><strong>G</strong>laucoma</li>\n<li><strong>E</strong>pilepsy</li>\n<li><strong>I</strong>ntellectual disability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
