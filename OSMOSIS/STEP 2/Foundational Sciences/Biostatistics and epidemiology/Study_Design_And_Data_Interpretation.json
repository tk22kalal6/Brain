      "text": "A study examined the relationship between asbestos exposure and the incidence of lung cancer. It was found that greater than 4 hours of exposure to industrial asbestos per day is associated with a 10-fold increased risk of developing lung cancer when compared to the general population. The relative risk (RR) is 10.2 and p-value is 0.03. Since most studies suggest that smoking increases the risk of lung cancer by up to 20-folds, it was decided to divide the participants into two arms: smokers and non-smokers. Stratified analysis showed that in smokers, the RR is 64 and p-value is 0.02, as compared to non-smokers wherein the RR is 3 and p-value is 0.45. The results of this study can be explained by which of the following? &#160;",

      "solution": "<strong>Effect modification</strong> (also termed statistical interaction) occurs when an <strong>external variable</strong> positively or negatively <strong>impacts</strong> the observed <strong>effect </strong>of a <strong>risk factor</strong> on <strong>disease </strong>factor (e.g., incidence, progression). When stratified analysis is performed based upon this external variable, there will be a <strong>significant difference</strong> in risk between the stratified groups. Unlike confounding, effect modification is a biological phenomenon in which the exposure has a different impact in different circumstances.<br><br>In this vignette, the risk of <strong>lung cancer</strong> is found to be 10-folds higher in individuals with <strong>chronic asbestos exposure</strong>. However, when the participants were <strong>stratified </strong>into two groups based on their <strong>smoking </strong>status (<strong>third variable</strong>), the results were modified. The arm with non-smokers showed an increase in the risk of lung cancer by only <strong>3-folds</strong>. Most studies suggest that smoking increases the risk of lung cancer by about <strong>20-folds</strong>. However, smokers with chronic asbestos exposure had about a <strong>64-folds</strong> increased risk of lung cancer. In other words, the effects of smoking and asbestos exposure were more than multiplicative (3*20=60). This suggests synergism or <strong>interaction</strong>, meaning that the effect of smoking is somehow magnified in individuals who have also been exposed to asbestos. Multivariable methods can also be used to assess for effect modification. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Measurement bias:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Measurement bias occurs when information collected for use as a study variable (e.g., exposure, disease outcome) is inaccurate.

      "solution": "A clinical trial examines the effects of therapeutic agents when compared to placebo in human subjects. One of the hallmarks that enhances the internal validity (degree to which the relationship between variables being studied is trustworthy and not influenced by other factors) of a clinical trial is randomization of trial participants. <br><br>In the study described above, only the sickest patients (e.g. those requiring mechanical ventilation) are provided with the therapeutic agent, resulting in selection bias. This limitation ultimately decreases the internal validity of the study, as lack of randomization prevents a fair assessment of the therapeutic agent. Additional factors that enhance the internal validity of clinical trials include blinding (the patients, researchers, and data analyzers are unaware of who received the treatment), adherence to study protocol, and performing an intention to treat analysis. <br><br>External validity refers to the extent to which a study can be applied in other settings. Factors that improve external validity include how well the initial study was conducted (internal validity), replicability of the initial study, and population matching.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/UiR9QNCjS-ysZhfsAb99xmZeRd_spGd9/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Randomization of trial participants &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Replication of trial in a similar population &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Replicating this study in a similar population affects the external validity of this study, but does not address the inherent problem of lack of randomization in this controlled trial. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increasing the number of trial participants &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This change will not increase the internal validity of this study since the trial participants are still not randomized. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreasing the number of trial participants &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This change will not increase the internal validity of this study since the trial participants are still not randomized. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Segmentation of patient population according to comorbidities:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Breaking down the patient population according to comorbidities (e.g. underlying pulmonary disease) can potentially eliminate confounding variables.
