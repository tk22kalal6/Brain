      "solution": "The patient's presentation of fever, lumbar back pain with radiation down the legs, associated numbness and weakness, spinal tenderness on exam, and systemic signs of infection suggests a<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>spinal epidural abscess</strong> (SEA). <strong>Injection drug use</strong> is a known risk factor for spinal epidural abscess since it can introduce bacteria directly into the bloodstream, leading to hematogenous spread and abscess formation, particularly in the spine due to its rich blood supply. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Physical examination in a patient with SEA will demonstrate signs and symptoms of local inflammation at the site of the abscess as well as systemic signs of infection. <strong>Back pain</strong> is the most common presenting symptom and is present in 70 percent to 100 percent of cases. <strong>Fever&#160;</strong>is an important diagnostic clue but can be absent on presentation. <strong>Spinal tenderness</strong> to palpation can be seen.<strong>&#160;Neurologic deficits</strong> are found in up to half of the cases of spinal epidural abscess and may include motor <strong>weakness, radiculopathy,&#160;</strong>and <strong>bowel and bladder dysfunction.&#160;</strong>Once paralysis develops, it may quickly become irreversible. Thus, urgent intervention is required if progression of weakness or other neurologic findings are detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without gadolinium contrast is the preferred imaging test because it is often positive early in the course of the infection, and it provides the best visualization of the location and extent of inflammatory changes. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/6TRUqoZ-TpW9e47t4kzbdTKWQxqWScRu/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tobacco use:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong> This patient with low back pain, lower extremity weakness, fever,&#160;and spinal tenderness&#160;most likely has&#160;a spinal epidural abscess.
