The parent tells the physician that he often stares and becomes unresponsive for several seconds at a time. Afterward, the child does not recall the event. The physician gives the patient a paper bag and asks him to blow in it quickly while having an EEG performed. After a few minutes of hyperventilation, the child stares at the wall appearing unresponsive for several seconds. During the episode, the EEG shows 3-hertz spike-and-wave discharges. The physician decides to start the patient on ethosuximide. Which of the following is the primary target of the medication most likely used to treat this patient&#8217;s condition?",

Specifically, ethosuximide inhibits<strong>&#160;T-type calcium channels in the thalamus,</strong> which are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of absence seizures directly.

Based on her otherwise typical development and unremarkable physical examination, <strong>childhood absence epilepsy</strong> is the most likely diagnosis.

The age of the child at the time of seizure presentation can help distinguish between epilepsy syndromes. Absence epilepsy is a common childhood-onset disease that can be mistaken for &#8220;daydreaming&#8221; or inattention. The behavioral arrests typically last only seconds and may be accompanied by automatisms, like eyelid fluttering or lip-smacking, after which the child immediately returns to baseline.<br><br>For children with generalized epilepsy, neuroimaging is not typically indicated. However, behavioral arrests may occur as the result of focal seizures, for which neuroimaging is appropriate.

Depending on the age of the patient, and the patient&#8217;s presentation,&#160;<strong>radiographs&#160;</strong>should be performed to assess for&#160;potential fractures.

When evaluating a child presenting with a first-time seizure (after initial stabilization), it is important to inquire about the <strong>presence of fever</strong> within 24 hours, as <strong>febrile seizures</strong> are more common than epilepsy, and the work-up and treatment differ between the two conditions. Febrile seizures commonly <strong>occur during acute illness in healthy children</strong> between 6 months and 5 years of age. By definition, febrile seizures are <strong>provoked by fever</strong>, and affected children have no previous history of unprovoked seizures.

He has experienced global developmental delays, and his parents are concerned he may be regressing in gross motor skills. Yesterday, he had an episode while seated in his highchair, where he dropped his head forward, bent and then extended both of his arms and legs repeatedly for a few seconds. He then cried out before becoming completely relaxed for a few seconds, and then he returned to his baseline mental status and activity level. He has no other significant medical history and has not had any recent infections. He has been in his usual state of health. Growth parameters are at the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile. Temperature is 37&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 35/min, and blood pressure is 90/50 mmHg. On exam, he can sit but does not crawl. There is no meningismus. The neck is supple. Skin exam is normal. Reflexes are normal. Which of the following is most likely to be seen with further testing?",

The&#160;most&#160;appropriate initial&#160;response is to&#160;perform&#160;an&#160;ABCDE assessment&#160;(airway, breathing, and circulation,&#160;exposure). Given that this patient is&#160;maintaining&#160;his airway and has normal oxygenation,&#160;the best next step is to&#160;establish&#160;intravenous (IV) access&#160;and&#160;administer&#160;an<strong><span>&#160;</span><span>IV benzodiazepine</span></strong>&#160;such as lorazepam, midazolam, or diazepam&#160;to stop the seizures.&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Acute management of an unstable adult with&#160;convulsive activity&#160;begins with an&#160;<strong>ABCDE assessment</strong>, with continuous vital signs monitoring.&#160;Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary&#160;when patients are unable to protect their airway.&#160;Patients in&#160;<strong>convulsive status epilepticus</strong>, defined as either a tonic-clonic&#160;seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or multiple seizures without recovery to baseline&#160;between attacks, should be&#160;immediately&#160;treated with&#160;an&#160;<strong>IV benzodiazepine</strong>.&#160;Intravenous&#160;anti-seizure&#160;medications&#160;including&#160;f<strong>osphenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid, or levetiracetam</strong>&#160;may&#160;then&#160;be administered. Electroencephalography can be used to&#160;monitor&#160;the&#160;clinical response&#160;to therapy.&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Once&#160;the patient is&#160;stabilized, a focused history and physical can&#160;rule out secondary&#160;causes&#160;of seizure activity, such as toxic-metabolic derangement. For patients with&#160;a&#160;known epilepsy diagnosis, missed doses of anti-seizure medication or subtherapeutic drug levels may be the trigger&#160;for status epilepticus.&#160;&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Intravenous (IV) benzodiazepine&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong>&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Endotracheal intubation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Some p</span><span>atients presenting in convulsive status epilepticus</span><span>&#160;</span><span>may not be able to&#160;</span><span>maintain</span><span>&#160;their airway and may require endotracheal intubation; however, t</span><span>his patient is breathing spontaneously with an intact airway and normal oxygen saturation.&#160;</span><span>Therefore,</span><span>&#160;the best&#160;</span><span>initial</span><span>&#160;treatment is to&#160;</span><span>establish</span><span>&#160;IV access and start</span><span>&#160;an</span><span>&#160;intravenous&#160;</span><span>benzodiazepine</span><span>.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Electroencephalography (EEG):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>EEG monitoring can be&#160;</span><span>u</span><span>tilized</span><span>&#160;to evaluate for non-convulsive status epilepticus or to guide&#160;</span><span>the&#160;</span><span>use of a continuous infusion for the treatment of seizure</span><span>s</span><span>.
