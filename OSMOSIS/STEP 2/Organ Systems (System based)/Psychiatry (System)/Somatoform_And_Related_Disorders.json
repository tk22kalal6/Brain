      "solution": "This patient is presenting with fever, headaches, and new onset of a focal seizure; he likely has encephalitis. Since the patient had a recent seizure, a CT scan should be performed first to exclude contraindications for lumbar puncture. The CT revealed abnormality of the<strong>&#160;temporal lobe</strong>, a highly suggestive finding for<strong>&#160;Herpes simplex virus</strong> (HSV) <strong>encephalitis.&#160;</strong><br><br>HSV encephalitis is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis. Most cases are caused by type HSV-1, but type 2 is also seen. Patients often present with rapid onset of fever and at least one of the following: altered mentation, focal cranial nerve deficits, hemiparesis, dysphasia, aphasia, ataxia, focal seizures, headache, and focal neurologic signs. HSV encephalitis is a devastating disease with significant morbidity and mortality, even with antiviral therapy. Therefore, intravenous acyclovir should be administered empirically in any patient that is suspected of having HSV encephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis typically shows a<strong>&#160;lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased number of erythrocytes&#160;</strong>(due to hemorrhage), and<strong>&#160;elevated protein</strong>. However, the CSF profile can be normal early in the course of the disease and therefore is not diagnostic. <strong>CSF polymerase chain reaction</strong> (PCR) is used to identify HSV-1, HSV-2, and enteroviruses. Identification of HSV-1 in the CSF is an efficient, rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic test for HSV-1 encephalitis and therefore is the test of choice. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cerebrospinal fluid cultures:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>CSF cultures for herpes simplex virus have a sensitivity of less than 10% and, therefore, are not reliable.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Brain biopsy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Brain biopsy is the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of herpes virus encephalitis.

      "solution": "This patient is presenting with fever, headaches, seizure and a <strong>focal neurologic deficit</strong>, a presentation consistent with <strong>brain abscess</strong>. The MRI confirms the diagnosis by showing a solitary ring-enhancing lesion within the frontal lobe, most likely due to direct spread of bacteria from the patient&#8217;s preceding <strong>sinus infection.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>A brain abscess is a <strong>focal collection of pus within the brain tissue</strong> that occurs as a complication of infection, trauma or surgery. Bacteria gain access to the brain either by direct spread from a contiguous location or through hematogenous seeding. A direct spread of infection from a contiguous site usually causes a single abscess, while the spread through bacteremia usually causes multiple lesions. Primary infections that can directly spread to the brain include: &#160;<br><br><ul><li>&#160;otitis media and mastoiditis, resulting in abscess formation in the temporal lobe and/or cerebellum&#160;</li><li>&#160;sinusitis in the frontal or ethmoid sinuses, resulting in abscess formation in the frontal lobes&#160;</li><li>&#160;dental infections, resulting in abscess formation in the frontal lobes &#160;</li></ul>The pathogens involved differ depending upon the primary infection location, patient age, and the immune status of the host. However, <strong>viridans streptococci</strong> and <strong><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></strong> are the most common pathogens. Patients may present with a classic triad of headache, fever, and focal neurologic deficits; however, this triad is not always present. Other signs may include seizure and altered mental status. Imaging may show <strong>ring-enhancing lesions&#160;</strong>(MRI most sensitive). Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in the presence of intracranial pressure signs due to the risk of herniation. <strong>Stereotactic CT-guided aspiration i</strong>s required to direct treatment.

Reactivation of latent infection is often seen in immunocompromised patients and presents with multiple central nervous system ring-enhancing lesions.

Humans acquire the larvae encysted in undercooked pork (intestinal larvae) and later pass the eggs in food contaminated with human feces (cysticercosis).

      "solution": "This patient is presenting with fever, headaches, and altered mental status, which raises concern for bacterial meningitis. The patient&#8217;s physical exam demonstrates <strong>papilledema&#160;</strong>bilaterally, which is a sign of elevated intracranial pressure and is therefore an indication for <strong>CT to exclude contraindications for lumbar puncture (LP).&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br><strong>Bacterial meningitis&#160;</strong>is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent sequelae. Even with optimal therapy, bacterial meningitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Essentially, every patient with suspected meningitis should undergo lumbar puncture (LP) unless there is a clear contraindication. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis helps to narrow the differential diagnosis and direct the antibiotic regimen. <strong>Increased intracranial pressure</strong> carries a risk for cerebral herniation if large amounts of CSF are collected. Therefore, if any of the abnormalities depicted in the table below is present, a CT scan should be obtained first to exclude a mass lesion or increased intracranial pressure. If none of the above is present, LP can be performed safely. &#160; <br><br>The first step in management of patients with suspected bacterial meningitis is to obtain blood cultures and LP. Next, empiric antibiotics should be administered immediately after CSF collection. Corticosteroids should be added for patients in whom the causative organism is not yet known to prevent neurologic sequelae from S. pneumonia infections (e.g. sensorineural hearing loss). After the CSF analysis results are available, the antibiotic regimen can be tailored. If lumbar puncture is delayed more than 20-30 minutes for any reason (e.g. to obtain CT), the best initial step is to give antibiotics immediately. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/niLUdaGbQJSPW7SM-UtOaZqzRu_4gRTO/_.png\"></div><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/XmsdbWy9SGyyc3REpma3XK6pSRyf2StJ/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intubation of the patient:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Intubation is required if there is a failure to protect the airway, oxygenation failure, or if the clinical course requires it.
