      "solution": "<strong>Volume of distribution&#160;</strong>refers to a theoretical volume that denotes how much space a medication (&#8220;drug&#8221;) occupies in the body. Small volumes of distribution (e.g., 3 liters) signify a medication that is mostly or exclusively found in plasma. Large volumes of distribution (e.g., 60 liters) signify a medication that is found throughout the body. Although each medication has a set volume of distribution, altered physiology can change this value. Diseases such as<strong>&#160;cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome can increase the volume of distribution of medication, requiring a higher dose to achieve the same effect.&#160;</strong>In contrast, pathologic states such as severe dehydration can reduce the volume of distribution. &#160; <br><br>Maintenance doses are affected by the underlying renal or hepatic function. With renal or hepatic impairment, &#160;medications are not cleared as quickly, so lower doses are administered to achieve the same results.

Her CT scan confirms the presence of a <strong>hemorrhagic stroke</strong>, which likely occurred since the patient was concurrently taking warfarin and fluconazole without dose adjustments. &#160; <br><br>Fluconazole, and other <strong>azoles</strong>, treat mycotic infections by inhibiting fungal <strong>14-alpha-demethylase</strong> (a cytochrome p450 enzyme). Inhibition of this enzyme blocks ergosterol synthesis, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. &#160; &#160;&#160;<br><br>Unfortunately, azoles can also inhibit <strong>human cytochrome p450&#160;</strong>found in the liver. As a result, azoles can inhibit the breakdown and cause the overaccumulation of medications (e.g., warfarin, phenytoin, simvastatin) metabolized by hepatic cytochrome p450. Elevated plasma warfarin levels would manifest with an elevated INR, as in this patient's case, as well as increased risk for bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke.&#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Accelerated formation of atherosclerotic lesions:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus can lead to the accelerated formation of atherosclerotic plaques within blood vessels, predisposing patients to ischemic stroke.
