      "solution": "This immunocompromised patient with headache, fever, and associated nuchal rigidity and photophobia most likely has meningitis. The most appropriate test to diagnose this condition is a <strong>lumbar punctur</strong>e performed at the <strong>L4/L5 intervertebral space,</strong> denoted by choice D in the diagram above. &#160; <br><br>Indications for the performance of a<strong>&#160;lumbar puncture (LP)</strong> are many, namely the evaluation of infection in the central nervous system, subarachnoid hemorrhage, central nervous system malignancies, and demyelinating disorders such as Guillain Barre syndrome. LP is generally safe; however, it is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure, bleeding diathesis, or suspected spinal epidural abscess. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Performance of the procedure requires sterile technique and positioning the patient in either a lateral decubitus position or sitting upright. In an average adult, the spinal cord tapers and ends at the level between the L1 and L2 vertebrae. In neonates, it ends at L3, so the procedure is safely performed via needle insertion at the L4/L5 interspace in both populations. This space is most easily identified via <strong>direct palpation of the superior iliac crests</strong> and tracing an imaginary line from this point to the lumbar spine. Palpation of the lumbar spine at this location will reveal the L4/L5 spinous processes, and the area for needle insertion is between the two. &#160; <br><br>The insertion sequence includes skin, subcutaneous tissue, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, epidural space, and finally, the <strong>subarachnoid</strong>&#160;<strong>space</strong>. Once in this space, removal of the stylet will reveal the flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the proximal end of the needle. &#160; <br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ZO-sBwg7TO_Uzz0-bD_ikA-ASAespZRn/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ A:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Choice A represents the thoracic spinal vertebral interspace, which is too high to perform this procedure safely.

It is acquired through the inhalation of spores with subsequent hematogenous dissemination to the brain meninges. Immunocompromised individuals (e.g., organ transplant, HIV) are specifically at risk for infection with cryptococcus. Treatment consists of induction therapy with <strong>amphotericin B</strong> and <strong>flucytosine&#160;</strong>followed by fluconazole for the maintenance period. &#160; <br><br>Amphotericin B is a medication used to treat systemic mycosis conditions including Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, Mucor, and Candida. It works by binding ergosterol (unique to fungi) and forming membrane pores that lead to leakage of electrolytes. Side effects include fever, chills, hypotension, nephrotoxicity, <strong>arrhythmias&#160;</strong>and anemia. <strong>Hydration&#160;</strong><strong>prior to treatment&#160;</strong>is recommended as it reduces the nephrotoxic effect. Liposomal (lipid formulations) amphotericin is better tolerated.
