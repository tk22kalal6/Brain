      "solution": "This 2-week-old patient presents with fever, irritability, decreased feeding, high-pitched crying, and increased head circumference in the context of <strong>maternal soft cheese consumption during pregnancy.&#160;</strong>This patient most likely has<strong>&#160;acute meningitis with increased intracranial pressure&#160;</strong>due to <strong><em>Listeria monocytogenes.</em></strong> In neonates with acute meningitis, increased head circumference is most likely from a <strong>full anterior fontanelle</strong> due to <strong>increased intracranial pressure. &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>The clinical presentation of meningitis in neonates and children differs due to varying physiological responses based on developmental stages. In infants<strong>&#160;60 days of age or younger</strong>, the presentation is often <strong>subtle and nonspecific</strong>, making early diagnosis challenging. Common signs include <strong>poor feeding, irritability,</strong> decreased activity, and <strong>high-pitched crying</strong>. Fever is not always present, and in some cases, neonates may develop hypothermia. An <strong>increase in head circumference</strong> and a <strong>bulging anterior fontanelle</strong> can be seen due to <strong>increased intracranial pressure.</strong> Other symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea can mimic gastrointestinal illnesses. Due to physiologic differences between neonates and older children, classic signs of meningitis such as nuchal rigidity and Brudzinski and Kernig signs are often absent. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In older children, the presentation is more pronounced and can include fever, photophobia, headache, vomiting, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. <strong>Nuchal rigidity or neck stiffness</strong> is a more reliable sign of acute meningitis in older children. Additionally, older children may demonstrate a positive <strong>Brudzinski sign</strong> (neck flexion causes involuntary knee and hip flexion) and <strong>Kernig sign</strong> (resistance or pain with passive leg extension when hips and knees are flexed). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Signs of increased intracranial pressure can include papilledema, diplopia, cranial nerve paralysis, as well as the Cushing triad, which includes hypertension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression. In severe cases, children may present with altered mental status, seizures, or focal neurological deficits. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Full anterior fontanelle:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Petechial rash on the trunk and extremities:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A petechial rash is commonly associated with meningococcal meningitis.

Early signs may include <strong>irritability, poor feeding, lethargy, vesicular rash, fever, temperature instability,&#160;</strong>and <strong>seizures</strong>. The manifestations of neonatal herpes can be classified based on the primary involvement: <br><ul><li>&#160; Primarily skin, eyes, and mucosal involvement (<strong>SEM disease</strong>)</li><li>&#160; <strong>Primarily CNS disease</strong></li><li>&#160; <strong>Disseminated disease</strong> with multiple organ involvement including the liver, lungs, and encephalitis.&#160;</li></ul><br>In infants with suspected congenital infections, an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong> should be performed. If the patient is unstable, the first step is to stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation. Once the patient is stabilized, continuous vital sign monitoring and oxygen as needed are the next steps in management. In patients with <strong>signs of congenital HSV infection</strong>, as in this patient, the diagnosis can be confirmed by ordering <strong>HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</strong> on the <strong>blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)</strong>. Swab specimens should be collected from the conjunctivae, mouth, nasopharynx, rectum, and skin lesions. <strong>Brain MRI</strong> may demonstrate <strong>edema&#160;</strong>and <strong>parenchymal changes</strong> consistent with <strong>encephalitis</strong>. <br><br>Treatment with <strong>intravenous acyclovir</strong> can be started if congenital HSV is suspected while results are pending as it improves mortality for all infants with neonatal herpes and neurologic development in those who have SEM and disseminated disease.<br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/qlmNjy77SMC2wdM94blyGbF6Qpi63gEN/_.png\"></div><sup><span>Edema in the frontal lobe white matter due to acute HSV-2 by Moore et al.
