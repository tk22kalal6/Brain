An <strong>echocardiogram </strong>should be performed to help confirm the diagnosis. <br><br><strong>Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</strong> is a critical congenital heart disease that presents with findings secondary to&#160;<strong>decreased pulmonary blood flow</strong>. Patients typically&#160;develop cyanosis and shortness of breath shortly after birth or in the first few months of life, depending on the severity. TOF has 4 components:&#160;<strong>overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect</strong> (VSD), <strong>pulmonary stenosis</strong>, and <strong>right ventricular hypertrophy</strong> (RVH). History may reveal cardiac defects on&#160;<strong>prenatal ultrasound</strong>. Physical exam&#160;may show&#160;<strong>central cyanosis</strong>, a <strong>harsh systolic ejection murmur on left sternal border</strong>,&#160;and&#160;<strong>low oxygen saturation</strong> as&#160;are seen in this patient. &#160;<br><br>Newborns with&#160;<strong>central cyanosis</strong>&#160;should be evaluated for <strong>cardiac </strong>and <strong>non-cardiac causes</strong>.&#160;To help differentiate the etiology of central cyanosis,&#160;<strong>pulse oximetry</strong>&#160;for pre- and post-ductal saturations should be checked to determine if congenital heart disease is likely. Pulse oximetry measurements on the <strong>right-hand measure pre-ductal saturation</strong>, and pulse oximetry measurements on <strong>either foot measure post-ductal saturation</strong>.&#160;&#160;<br><br>Criteria for echocardiogram to rule out cyanotic congenital heart disease&#160;includes&#160;<strong>SpO<sub>2</sub> less than 90% in the right hand and foot, SpO<sub>2</sub> less than 95% in right hand and foot</strong>&#160;on three separate occasions,&#160;or&#160;a <strong>difference of 3% or higher between the pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturations</strong> on three separate occasions.

Patients with <strong>refractory arrhythmias</strong> should be considered for <strong>catheter ablation</strong>. Notably, patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) are often difficult to rate control, and treatment directed at treating the underlying disease along with magnesium sulfate is typically used. With sinus tachycardia, patients should be assessed for physiologic causes like anxiety, pain, and exercise or pathologic causes, like infection, hypovolemia, and anemia. Treatment should be aimed at correcting the pathologic etiology if present (e.g., fluid administration or blood product administration for dehydration).<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Vagal maneuvers:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Defibrillation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: Defibrillation is performed for pulseless ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointe, or ventricular fibrillation</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>This patient presents with stable&#160;</span><span>supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)</span><span>, requiring vagal maneuvers or adenosine</span><span>.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Adenosine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: Adenosine is&#160;</span><span>indicated</span><span>&#160;in the management of patients with stable&#160;</span><span>supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)&#160;</span><span>if</span><span>&#160;vagal maneuvers&#160;</span><span>do not</span><span>&#160;improve symptoms and convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm</span><span>.

A comprehensive review of the patient's medical and medication history is also essential as conditions, like inferior wall MI, or medications, such as beta-blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, can contribute to bradycardia. A family history of heart disease or arrhythmias may indicate a hereditary predisposition. <br><br>During the physical examination, evaluate vital signs; general appearance; and look for signs of distress, cyanosis, or pallor. The cardiovascular exam should include inspection for jugular venous distention; palpation of the carotid pulse; auscultation of the carotid arteries for bruits; and assessment of the precordium for murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The respiratory examination should focus on the patient's breathing pattern and auscultation for abnormal breath sounds. A focused neurological examination helps rule out central causes of bradycardia or syncope by assessing mental status, cranial nerves, motor and sensory function, coordination, and reflexes.

He is given a medication that<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>decreases the slope of phase 0 of depolarization</strong><strong>,</strong> which leads to termination of the arrhythmia. This mechanism of action is consistent with that of <strong>class I antiarrhythmics</strong>. These medications work primarily via <strong>selective blockade of fast sodium channels. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br></strong><br>Class I antiarrhythmics are divided into three major classes: A, B, and C. However, all of them work via the same mechanism of action. Sodium channel blockade <strong>slows the upstroke of the sodium-dependent action potential&#160;</strong>(phase 0) and prolongs the QRS duration. However, each group has a different affinity for the fast sodium channel, resulting in group 1A prolonging the action potential duration, 1B shortening the actional potential duration, and 1C having no effect on the action potential duration. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>These medications have a predilection to slow conduction in ischemic and depolarized cells. For this reason, class I antiarrhythmics are said to exhibit <strong>&#8220;state-dependent&#8221;</strong> action, meaning that they bind to sodium channels when they are open or inactivated and much less readily when they are fully repolarized and resting. This phenomenon means these medications will selectively depress tissue that is frequently depolarized, making them useful in treating reentrant tachycardias and ventricular tachycardias. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/5nYgx2-mTY6B8T7XerjKR1pNSKGYG2kd/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Selective blockade of fast sodium channels&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct: </strong></span><span>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decrease in SA and AV nodal activity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>&#42933;</span><span>-blockers work via selective &#42933;-blockade, decreasing intracellular cAMP, and&#160;</span><span>subsequently</span><span>&#160;decreasing Ca</span><span>2+</span><span>&#160;current.
