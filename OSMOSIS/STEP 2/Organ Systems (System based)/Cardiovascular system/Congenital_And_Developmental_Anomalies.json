Other risk factors include congenital rubella syndrome and chromosomal abnormalities. &#160; <br><br>The condition presents with a <strong>continuous machine-like murmur</strong> most prominent at the left infraclavicular area. In addition, patients can develop <strong>differential cyanosis</strong>, wherein the lower extremities are cyanotic, but the upper extremities are acyanotic. <strong>Echocardiogram</strong> is performed to confirm the presence of clinically significant PDA. &#160; <br><br><strong>Indomethacin</strong>, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, blocks the synthesis of <strong>prostaglandin</strong>&#160;<strong>E</strong> and is used to close the PDA. If this fails, surgical intervention is needed.

Physical examination findings can include signs and symptoms of shock. Other types of acyanotic congenital heart defects present with <strong>murmurs </strong>and possibly heart failure symptoms (e.g., tachypnea and hepatomegaly). The description of the murmur can help diagnose the type of congenital heart defect. There are also many genetic syndromes with characteristic phenotypic features associated with congenital heart defects. For example, in Williams syndrome, patients can have a full face, a broad forehead, rounded cheeks, and a depressed nasal bridge with anteversion of the nares and associated supravalvular aortic stenosis. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Vital signs play a key role in the initial evaluation. A <strong>pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturation</strong> provides information about the oxygenation of the systemic circulation before and after the ductus arteriosus inserts into the aorta. Patients with a critical left ventricular outflow obstruction can have a pre-ductal oxygen saturation that is higher than the post-ductal oxygen saturation. <strong>Four extremity blood pressures</strong> can help diagnose coarctation as a blood pressure gradient of 20 mmHg or more between the upper and lower extremities is consistent with coarctation of the aorta. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Holosystolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong>&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Systolic murmur with a widely fixed and split S2 heard best at the left upper sternal border:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>An atrial septal defect presents as a systolic murmur with a widely fixed and split S2 heard best at&#160;</span><span>the&#160;</span><span>left upper sternal border.&#160;</span><span>However, t</span><span>his patient</span><span>&#160;</span><span>has a&#160;</span><span>diagnosed&#160;</span><span>ventricular septal defect which&#160;</span><span>presents with</span><span>&#160;a h</span><span>olosystolic murmur heard best at&#160;</span><span>the&#160;</span><span>left lower sternal border.</span>&#160; &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Systolic murmur radiating to the back:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>P</span><span>ulmonary stenosis</span><span>&#160;presents as a systolic murmur radiating to the back.</span><span>&#160;This patient&#160;</span><span>has a&#160;</span><span>diagnosed&#160;</span><span>ventricular septal defect which&#160;</span><span>presents&#160;</span><span>with</span><span>&#160;a h</span><span>olosystolic murmur heard best at</span><span>&#160;the</span><span>&#160;left lower sternal border.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Continuous machine-like murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border with radiation to the back:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>P</span><span>atent ductus arteriosus (PDA) presents&#160;</span><span>with</span><span>&#160;a continuous&#160;</span><span>machine</span><span>-like murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border with radiation to the back</span><span>.

The findings in this patient are consistent with <strong>truncus arteriosus,</strong> which&#160;can be&#160;confirmed with&#160;an <strong>echocardiogram showing</strong> a&#160;<strong>single arterial trunk</strong>&#160;supplying the systemic and pulmonary circulations and truncal artery overlying a ventricular septal defect (VSD).&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>When evaluating patients with suspected CHD,&#160;it is important to obtain maternal, prenatal, and family history. Physical exam should focus on the presence and characteristics of heart sounds and murmurs. All neonates with suspected CHD should have peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) measured in both preductal (right hand) and postductal (either foot) locations to assess for cyanosis and differential cyanosis. Universal screening&#160;of newborns with pulse oximetry is offered in most hospitals.&#160;ECG should be performed, although it may be normal during the neonatal period,&#160;and it may show only nonspecific abnormalities. However, some CHDs&#160;are associated with specific ECG patterns.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Chest x-ray should be performed and can give indications of the underlying CHD. In right-sided obstructive lesions (e.g., TOF), pulmonary vascular markings are usually decreased. Increased pulmonary vascular markings can be seen in the truncus arteriosus as pulmonary vascular resistance falls after delivery.&#160;Increased vascular marking from Pulmonary venous congestion and edema due to heart failure may be seen with obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) and in patients with heart failure due to left-sided obstructive lesions (e.g.,&#160;HLHS).&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Echocardiograms&#160;</strong>can confirm the diagnosis of CHD and determine the type of lesions present. Additionally, when patients present with&#160;<strong>cyanosis&#160;</strong>and <strong>likely congenital heart disease,&#160;</strong>it is important to determine if the<strong>&#160;CHD is ductal dependent</strong> because, without administration of prostaglandins, the ductus arteriosus will close and lead to potentially life-threatening consequences within the first few days of life. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cardiac catheterization&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>Cardiac catheterization examine</span><span>s</span><span>&#160;structures not visualized by echocardiography or for procedures like balloon septostomy.&#160;</span><span>This patient has&#160;</span><span>features of&#160;</span><span>truncus&#160;</span><span>arteriosus,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>and&#160;</span><span>an&#160;</span><span>echocardiogram</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;not c</span><span>ardiac&#160;</span><span>catheterization</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>is used to confirm the diagnosis.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Echocardiogram&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Correct:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Electrocardiogram&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong> Electrocardiogram (ECG) can&#160;show indications of&#160;right, left, or biventricular hypertrophy in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD).&#160;However,&#160;it is&#160;not used to make a diagnosis of CHD.&#160;This patient&#160;likely has&#160;truncus&#160;arteriosus,&#160;and an electrocardiogram should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hyperoxia test&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong>&#160;A hyperoxia test&#160;was historically used to&#160;distinguish cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) from pulmonary disease.&#160;Patients&#160;with cyanotic CHD are unable to increase their arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) during administration of 100% oxygen.&#160;For this patient with&#160;likely&#160;truncus&#160;arteriosus,&#160;an echocardiogram&#160;is used to confirm&#160;the diagnosis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Microsomal analysis&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;Microsomal analysis&#160;</span><span>can</span><span>&#160;</span><span>confirm</span><span>&#160;the diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome which can be associated with truncus&#160;</span><span>arteriosus</span><span>.

A <strong>systolic&#160;</strong><strong>murmu</strong>r that is best heard at the <strong>left upper sternal border with radiation to the back</strong> is consistent with <strong>pulmonary stenosis</strong> which can be seen in patients with <strong>Noonan syndrome</strong>. Diagnosis of pulmonary stenosis is best made via <strong>echocardiogram</strong>. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Echocardiograms&#160;</strong>can be used to diagnose acyanotic congenital heart disease. An echocardiogram is used to assess pulmonary blood flow and identify specific cardiac abnormalities. If the <strong>pulmonary blood flow</strong> is <strong>normal</strong>, congenital heart disease is considered <strong>obstructive</strong>. This includes <strong>non-critical coarctation, aortic stenosis,</strong> and <strong>pulmonary stenosis. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>If there is an <strong>increase&#160;</strong>in <strong>pulmonary blood flow</strong>, congenital heart diseases with l<strong>eft-to-right shunting</strong> should be considered.
