Risk stratification enables healthcare providers to tailor preventive interventions effectively. In patients like this one with an elevated LDL-C that is less than 190 mg/dL and a <strong>10-year risk for ASCVD &lt; 5%, diet and exercise counseling</strong> without statin therapy is recommended.<br><br>Patients with elevated LDL-C and a <strong>low 10-year cardiovascular event risk (&lt; 5%)</strong> are advised to adopt <strong>lifestyle modifications</strong>. This includes a <strong>nutritious diet</strong> that emphasizes the consumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and lean proteins, including fish; and limits trans fats, processed meats, refined carbohydrates, and sugary drinks. Patients who are overweight should be advised about <strong>calorie reduction</strong> and strategies for sustained weight loss.

Patients with a high 10-year cardiovascular risk (&#8805; 20% 10-year risk) generally require more aggressive management.

Understanding the anatomic locations of chambers in the heart can help predict the area of injury. Most penetrating trauma to the heart is to the <strong>right ventricle (43%)&#160;</strong>compared to the left ventricle (34%), owing to its anterior anatomic location. The atria are also less commonly injured, given their more posterior anatomic location and shielding via the sternum. Following injury, patients may exsanguinate into the pleural space if the cardiac lesion communicates freely with the pleural cavity, or they may suffer cardiac tamponade if the hemorrhage is contained within the pericardium. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/77xJsS5oTeGt1sxLD9o79IsfRMmJy0TW/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Right ventricle:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Right atrium:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>While the right atrium also lies anteriorly in the thorax, it is relatively protected by the sternum.
