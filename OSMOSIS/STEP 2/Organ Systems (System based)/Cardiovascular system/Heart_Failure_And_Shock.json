Laboratory testing reveals hyperkalemia. To avoid exacerbating the electrolyte abnormality or triggering an arrhythmia, patients with hyperkalemia should avoid taking potassium-sparing diuretics.<br><br>Potassium-sparing diuretics are used in the treatment of <strong>hypertension&#160;</strong>and edematous states, such as <strong>pulmonary edema&#160;</strong>and <strong>abdominal ascites</strong>. This is because potassium-sparing diuretics increase sodium and water loss via urine, which helps decrease plasma volume, cardiac output, and extracellular fluid volume. In addition, potassium-sparing diuretics that act as aldosterone receptor antagonists (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone) are useful in treating conditions associated with <strong>hyperaldosteronism&#160;</strong>(e.g., adrenal adenoma, adrenal hyperplasia).<br><br>Finally, spironolactone and amiloride can bind to androgen receptors and prevent testosterone from binding. These medications help blunt the effects of testosterone in the body and can be used to manage conditions such as <strong>polycystic ovarian syndrome</strong> (PCOS). Of note, spironolactone has stronger antiandrogenic properties and is used more commonly than amiloride to treat PCOS.<br><br>Side effects on these medications include <strong>hyperkalemia&#160;</strong>(due to reduced potassium excretion) and <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong> (due to reduced potassium excretion).

The kidneys respond by secreting renin into the bloodstream. Renin is a proteolytic enzyme that breaks down a protein made in the liver called angiotensinogen, and this gives rise to angiotensin I. When angiotensin I reaches the lungs, angiotensin I is converted into <strong>angiotensin II</strong> by an enzyme called <strong>angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)&#160;</strong>in the pulmonary vessels. Angiotensin II binds to receptors in vascular smooth muscle and causes them to constrict, which increases the blood pressure. Finally, angiotensin II also stimulates the release of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys, which also increases water reabsorption.

Together these findings are concerning for a <strong>ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm</strong> which is best diagnosed via <strong>abdominal ultrasound</strong>. <br><br><strong>Hypovolemic shock</strong> refers to a life-threatening condition defined by organ hypoperfusion secondary to decreased intravascular volume. Hypovolemic shock can be defined as <strong>hemorrhagic </strong>or <strong>non-hemorrhagic</strong>. Hemorrhagic shock is associated with blood loss which can be seen in traumatic conditions &#8211; such as a ruptured spleen &#8211; or non-traumatic conditions like variceal bleeding or abdominal aortic rupture, as is likely in this case. Non-hemorrhagic shock is associated with fluid loss, most commonly from volume depletion as occurs after prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, as well as with severe widespread burns.<br><br>Initial diagnostic workup for patients with suspected hypovolemic shock includes obtaining blood work including <strong>CBC, lactate, CMP, PT, PTT, INR</strong>. When the presentation is unclear (e.g. no evidence of trauma on examination) several biomarkers can assist with differentiating between hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock. In general, <strong>patients with hemorrhagic shock will have new or worsening anemia</strong> and will have derangements in coagulation studies if coagulopathy is present.

With digoxin, potassium cannot enter the cell, and sodium can&#8217;t leave it, leading to a <strong>slight increase in intracellular sodium</strong>. The increased sodium alters the driving force for <strong>sodium-calcium exchange</strong> by the exchanger, NCX, so less calcium is removed from the cell. The <strong>increased intracellular calcium</strong> is stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This releases even more calcium into the cell via <strong>calcium-induced calcium release</strong> and <strong>increases contractile force (positive inotropy)</strong>.

When an electrical current propagates down the heart and reaches a myocyte, the nearby fast sodium channels typically open and allow a large rush of sodium ions into the cell, quickly raising the charge of the inner cellular membrane from negative to positive.

This side effect usually occurs with high doses, rapid intravenous administration, coexisting renal dysfunction, or co-administration with other ototoxic drugs (as in the case of this patient).

History&#160;will often reveal the cause of volume depletion in&#160;<strong>non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock. </strong>For example, the most common cause of pediatric hypovolemic shock is <strong>diarrheal illness;</strong>&#160;patients with a gastrointestinal infection typically present with prolonged vomiting, diarrhea, and poor fluid intake.&#160;Other significant&#160;causes&#160;of<strong> non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock in children</strong> include <strong>burns </strong>and <strong>diabetic ketoacidosis. </strong>Signs of hypovolemic shock include<strong> tachycardia; tachypnea;</strong> and evidence of&#160;poor perfusion, including cool extremities,<strong> delayed capillary refill, weak peripheral pulses, skin tenting</strong>, and <strong>dry mucous membranes. &#160; &#160;</strong> &#160; &#160; <br><br>Infants presenting with <strong>signs of shock, </strong>regardless of the etiology, should have an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong> performed.&#160;Management should start with&#160;<strong>stabilization of the airway, breathing,</strong> and <strong>circulation</strong>. Unstable patients <strong>with hypovolemic shock </strong>and <strong>signs of poor perfusion</strong>&#160;require intravenous or intraosseous access and&#160;emergent administration of&#160;<strong>intravenous fluids. </strong>Intubation and mechanical ventilation are required in patients with respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation.

He has <strong>septic shock</strong> most likely secondary to <strong>bacterial infection. &#160;</strong>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>There are four main categories of shock: <strong>distributive, hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and obstructive. Distributive shock</strong> includes septic, anaphylactic, and neurogenic shock and results from <strong>peripheral vasodilation</strong> and <strong>increased but inadequate cardiac output.</strong> Distributive shock is typically considered a <strong>warm shock. &#160; &#160;</strong>&#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Sepsis&#160;</strong>results from a suspected or proven<strong>&#160;infectious etiology,</strong> and clinical deterioration leads to <strong>septic shock</strong>, which may result in <strong>multi-organ dysfunction&#160;</strong>and <strong>mortality</strong>. Clinical signs of septic shock include <strong>unstable temperatures</strong> (hyperthermia or hypothermia), <strong>tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension</strong>, and <strong>signs of infection</strong> (e.g. abnormal lung findings consistent with pneumonia in this patient). When septic shock is suspected, <strong>complete blood count (CBC), lactate,&#160;</strong>and inflammatory markers (i.e., <strong>C-reactive protein (CRP),</strong>&#160;<strong>erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),</strong> and <strong>procalcitonin&#160;</strong>level) should be ordered. Blood and urine <strong>cultures&#160;</strong>should be drawn, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures should possibly be obtained via lumbar puncture. Lab results typically reveal<strong>&#160;elevated white blood cell</strong>&#160;<strong>count&#160;</strong>and <strong>low platelets&#160;</strong>in combination with an <strong>elevated lactate</strong> and increased inflammatory markers. Cultures might reveal a causative pathogen. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>The other types of distributive shock are <strong>anaphylactic shock</strong> and neurogenic shock. Patients with anaphylactic shock present after exposure to an <strong>allergen </strong>with <strong>itching, rash,</strong> and <strong>shortness of breath, </strong>and physical examination may reveal <strong>urticaria, angioedema, wheezing,</strong> or <strong>stridor</strong>. With <strong>neurogenic shock</strong>, patients often have a history of <strong>trauma </strong>with a brain or spinal cord injury or recent administration of spinal or epidural anesthesia.

Patients with&#160;</span><span><strong>severe dehydration</strong></span><span>&#160;are typically&#160;</span><span><strong>unstable </strong></span><span>and present with</span><span>&#160;<strong>signs of shock,</strong></span><span>&#160;including weak pulses and poor perfusion. Other common signs include<strong>&#160;</strong></span><span><strong>skin tenting, very dry mucous membranes,</strong></span><span>&#160;and&#160;</span><span><strong>severely reduced or absent urine output.</strong></span><span><strong>&#160;</strong>In children, late findings may include&#160;</span><span><strong>drowsiness or lethargy,</strong></span><span>&#160;and vital signs often reveal&#160;</span><span><strong>tachycardia</strong></span><span><strong>&#160;</strong>and&#160;</span><span><strong>hypotension</strong></span><span><strong>&#160;</strong>in more severe cases.</span>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br><span>The acute management of pediatric dehydration begins with an&#160;</span><span><strong>ABCDE assessment</strong>&#160;</span><span>to ensure airway, breathing, and circulatory stability.
