Therefore, it is commonly used for patients who don&#8217;t respond to other antihypertensives, or it can be given in combination with other <strong>antihypertensives</strong>.

As a result, blood flows down through the vertebral artery from the basilar vascular supply. &#160; <br><br>Most patients are asymptomatic; however, when symptoms arise, they are typically exercise-induced. Patients can present with symptoms of ischemia to the affected upper extremity, including<strong>&#160;pain, paresthesias, pallor,</strong> and <strong>coolness to the touch.</strong> In some instances, associated neurologic symptoms may manifest, including dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, tinnitus, or disequilibrium due to vertebrobasilar ischemia. &#160;<br><br>Physical examination findings typically include <strong>a delayed or decreased pulse amplitude </strong>of the affected extremity and a differential brachial systolic blood pressure between the upper extremities. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Reversal of blood flow in the left vertebral artery:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Dissection flap of the proximal aorta&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Aortic dissection typically presents with acute, sharp, &#8220;tearing&#8221; chest pain radiating to the back.

Typically, this value is 3 cm, with large aneurysms defined as those greater than 5 cm. Known risk factors include male sex, older age, significant smoking history, uncontrolled hypertension, family history, and atherosclerotic disease. These aneurysms are due to chronic arterial wall inflammation, extracellular matrix degradation, and subsequent balloon dilation.<br><br>Clinically, most abdominal aortic aneurysms are <strong>silent</strong> and present with symptoms only at the time of rupture or impending rupture. With partial or immediate rupture, most patients present with symptoms that <strong>mimic renal colic</strong>, including back or flank pain radiating to the groin. Other findings include hypotension, abdominal pain, or a pulsatile abdominal mass (however, this finding is not always present).<br><br>In symptomatic patients, diagnosis is best achieved with CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. However, ultrasound can also quickly detect large aneurysms.

The leg pain that worsens with walking and resolves with rest is consistent with claudication, which is pain caused by ischemia when the working extremity fails to get adequate blood supply.

In individuals with intermittent claudication (mild to moderate disease), the ABI usually lies between 0.4 and 0.9, since blood pressure in the ankle is decreased.

      "solution": "This patient presents with an episode of sudden and severe low back and groin pain followed by syncope. He is hypotensive and ill-appearing. Together these clinical findings are concerning for a <strong>ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm</strong>. One of the hallmark clinical findings is the presence of a <strong>pulsatile abdominal mass</strong>.<br><br>An abdominal aortic aneurysm, or AAA, is defined as aortic dilatation greater than 3 cm in diameter. Most AAAs are fusiform, which means they&#8217;re spindle-shaped and involve the entire circumference of the aortic wall. AAA can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. While most AAAs are asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging studies, all AAAs are at risk for expansion and rupture.<br><br>Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are silent, meaning, they are discovered incidentally on imaging without any associated symptoms or clinical findings. Symptomatic patients typically present in the <strong>setting of rupture&#160;</strong>or peri-rupture and present with <strong>sudden onset abdominal, back, or flank pain with or without groin pain and with associated syncope</strong>. Risk factors associated with AAA include those associated with atherosclerotic disease, including hypertension, diabetes, and smoking history. Patients may also have a history of connective tissue disease or a familial history of aneurysm. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Pulsatile abdominal mass:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Migratory thrombophlebitis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Migratory thrombophlebitis is also known as Courvasiers&#8217; sign, and it is associated with abdominal malignancies&#8212;most notably pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
