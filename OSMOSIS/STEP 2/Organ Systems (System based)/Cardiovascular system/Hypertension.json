      "solution": "<strong>Desensitization and tolerance</strong> are important concepts in pharmacodynamics and refers to a decreased effect of a drug (e.g. alcohol, heroin) or medication over time following subsequent doses. Over time, as an agonist binds to its cellular receptor, it may lose its ability to produce a robust response within cells via secondary messengers. Desensitization (also called tachyphylaxis) generally occurs rapidly and can occur after the first dose of a medication. On the other hand, tolerance occurs always after repeated doses and may take weeks or months. In this patient, he is likely experiencing desensitization (tachyphylaxis) to epinephrine, so repeated doses exert a weaker effect than the original dose.<br><br>Desensitization and tolerance can occur via many mechanisms, with several of the most common mechanisms outlined below:<br><br><ol><li><strong>Downregulation of receptor expression</strong>. For example, chronic opioid use results in downregulating the number of receptors available to bind the opioid or may increase the degradation or sequestration of receptors. This results in stronger doses of opioids needed to produce the same effect.</li><li><strong>Uncoupling of receptors to secondary messengers</strong>. This is often mediated by proteins called <strong>arrestins</strong>, which bind to G-protein-coupled receptors to prevent interaction with secondary messengers. They can also tag these receptors for endocytosis. <strong>This is common in desensitization (tachyphylaxis)</strong>.</li><li><strong>Exhaustion of intracellular intermediary molecules</strong>. This can occur with drugs such as amphetamines, which eventually leads to the depletion of secondary messengers within cells.</li><li><strong>Increased breakdown of agonists</strong>. For example, this can occur with chronic alcohol use, as &#8220;tolerance&#8221; increases with repeated chronic use due to more rapid degradation of ethanol.</li><li><strong>Physiologic adaptation in the body</strong>. For example, this can occur with thiazide diuretics due to increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. &#160;</li></ol><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Increased activity of intracellular arrestin proteins:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased number of extracellular receptors:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: If more extracellular receptors were available, there would be more binding to the agonist (medication), making it more likely to maintain or increase a cellular response (i.e. drug effect). &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased production of secondary messenger molecules:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Since medications/drugs work by binding to a cellular receptor and causing effects via secondary messengers, an increase in secondary messengers is more likely to maintain or increase a cellular response (i.e. drug effect). &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased breakdown of the medication:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Since more medication would be available, this is unlikely to lead to decreased effect. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased sequestration of extracellular receptors:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Decreased sequestration of receptors to bind the medication would result in more receptors available for drug binding, and thus more intracellular changes (i.e. effect) from the medication. &#160;</span></div>",

However, this patient has <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong> in addition to high blood pressure, which is an <strong>indication for the addition of an ACEI&#160;</strong>or an <strong>ARB&#160;</strong>due to their <strong>protective effect against diabetic nephropathy</strong>. ACE inhibitors and ARBs<strong>&#160;lower intraglomerular pressure by decreasing efferent arteriolar pressure</strong>. Other indications for specific therapy are described in the table below. &#160; &#160;<br><br>One important mechanism that regulates blood pressure is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system, which is a cascade of events that leads to an increase in blood pressure. When blood pressure is low, blood flow to the kidneys decreases. The kidneys respond by secreting renin into the bloodstream. Renin is a proteolytic enzyme that breaks down a protein made in the liver called angiotensinogen, which gives rise to angiotensin I. When it reaches the lungs, angiotensin I is converted into angiotensin II by an enzyme called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II binds to receptors in vascular smooth muscle and causes them to constrict, which increases the blood pressure. Finally, angiotensin II also stimulates the release of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. Aldosterone increases reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys, which also increases water reabsorption, resulting in increased blood volume, which increases blood pressure. ACE inhibitors main effect is attributed to <strong>lowering the levels of angiotensin II</strong>, a potent vasoconstrictor. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/fEjcQVH8QdSazo3KaLhX8ROjRJ20t6TX/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Block calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle cells&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This answer is the mechanism of action of calcium channel blockers (CCB), which can be used as monotherapy for initial management of hypertension, but there are no absolute indications for CCBs in patients with hypertension.

RAS activates the <strong>renin-angiotensinogen-aldosterone system (RAAS)</strong> which helps increase renal blood flow (RBF) to the stenotic kidneys and improves the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This can lead to volume expansion, sodium retention, and subsequent hypertension. &#160; <br><br>Patients with <strong>bilateral RAS</strong> are<strong>&#160;dependent upon angiotensin II&#160;</strong>for maintaining adequate GFR. <strong>The use of angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs),&#160;</strong>such as lisinopril, blocks the angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction, which can reduce systemic blood pressure and reduce RBF. In addition, it also causes renal efferent arteriole dilation and a reduction in GFR and renal filtration fraction. Therefore, ACEIs can precipitate renal failure and are <strong>relatively contraindicated in patients with bilateral RAS.</strong>&#160; The medication, however, can be continued if the rise in serum creatinine remains acceptable (i.e. &lt;30 %).

This also makes them useful as a second-line therapy to treat <strong>edematous states</strong> caused by conditions like heart failure or cirrhosis. <strong>Chronic renal calcium stone</strong> formation can sometimes be controlled with thiazides because they reduce urine calcium concentration by increasing calcium reabsorption. Thiazides are also used in the treatment of <strong>nephrogenic diabetes insipidus</strong>.<br><br>Relative contraindications include diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and gout, as they can result in hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia (worsening or precipitating attacks of gout).

The first step in this process involves <strong>tyrosine</strong>, a precursor of norepinephrine, being transported into the noradrenergic nerve terminal by a Na+-dependent carrier. Tyrosine is converted to DOPA by tyrosine hydroxylase. DOPA is then converted to dopamine. Afterward, dopamine is transported into synaptic vesicles with assistance from <strong>vesicular monoamine oxidase transporters</strong> (VMAT). Within the vesicles, dopamine is converted by dopamine &#946;-hydroxylase into norepinephrine.

In SSc, vasculopathy leads to luminal narrowing and ischemia of the kidneys.

First-line treatment is with <strong>angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,</strong> particularly captopril, which has a quick onset of action.
