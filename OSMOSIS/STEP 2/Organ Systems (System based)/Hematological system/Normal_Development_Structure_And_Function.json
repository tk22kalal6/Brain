      "text": "A 67-year-old man was brought to the emergency department by EMS for evaluation of altered mental status. His spouse reports that he has been confused for the last two days. He began experiencing abdominal pain and malaise two weeks ago after returning from a vacation in Mexico. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 92/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and blood pressure is 138/84 mmHg. On exams the patient is awake and alert but oriented only to the person. Scleral icterus is noted for jaundice of the skin. There is no papilledema. There is abdominal tenderness in the right upper quadrant. His hands display a flapping motion when he extends his arms and cocks his hands back at the wrists. Head CT is normal, and toxicology screen is negative. Lab results are shown below. Which of the following is the best next step in management? &#160;<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Laboratory value</strong> &#160; <br></td><td><strong>Result</strong><br></td></tr><tr><td>AST<br></td><td>1,702 units/L &#160; <br></td></tr><tr><td>ALT<br></td><td>2,112 units/L &#160; <br></td></tr><tr><td>Total bilirubin &#160; <br></td><td>14.3 mg/dL &#160; <br></td></tr><tr><td>INR<br></td><td>2.2 &#160; <br></td></tr><tr><td>Anti-HAV IgM &#160; <br></td><td>positive<br></td></tr><tr><td>Anti-HEV IgM &#160; <br></td><td>positive<br></td></tr><tr><td>HSV PCR &#160; <br></td><td>negative<br></td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br>",

      "solution": "<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/LWZ3UDdhQSW5ciGgNUghaVlUQiGu2A1-/_.png\"></div><br>This patient presents with <strong>altered mental status</strong>, abdominal pain, jaundice and asterixis. Additionally, multiple hepatic lab abnormalities and the presence of <strong>anti-HAV IgM</strong> and <strong>anti-HEV IgM</strong>, suggest <strong>fulminant hepatic failure</strong> with <strong>encephalopathy</strong> from <strong>acute coinfection</strong> with <strong>Hepatitis A</strong> and <strong>Hepatitis E viruses</strong>. There is no specific treatment for this viral coinfection and patients should be <strong>transferred to liver transplant centers</strong> while being given <strong>supportive care</strong>. This patient likely acquired the coinfection from contaminated food or water during his trip to Mexico. <br><br>Hepatitis A virus and Hepatitis E virus are common causes of acute viral hepatitis in resource-limited areas of the world. They typically lead to a self-limited or even asymptomatic illness that resolves spontaneously; however, either virus or coinfection with both can lead to <strong>fulminant hepatic failure</strong>. When toxin accumulation from liver failure leads to neuropsychiatric symptoms, it is referred to as <strong>hepatic encephalopathy</strong>. Symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include cognitive changes, mood changes, asterixis, coordination or balance problems, muscle twitching and problems with executive functioning. &#160;Laboratory results in severe disease typically include extreme elevations of liver transaminases (typically in the thousands), coagulopathy with an INR &#8805; 1.5, and elevated bilirubin. <br><br>There is no specific treatment for Hepatitis A or Hepatitis E. Management of patients with hepatic failure from either virus or from coinfection with both consists of <strong>aggressive supportive care</strong> and <strong>coordination with a liver transplant team</strong> as quickly as possible. Even patients who do not meet criteria for transplant at the time of presentation should be transferred to a liver transplant center, as patients can deteriorate rapidly.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Transfer to a liver transplant center &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administer mannitol:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Mannitol is used to manage increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which is a potential complication of acute liver failure. This patient does not have evidence of increased ICP and instead has hepatic encephalopathy and fulminant liver failure from Hepatitis A and E coinfection requiring transfer to a liver transplant center. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administer N-acetylcysteine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: N-acetylcysteine is used in the management of hepatic encephalopathy secondary to acetaminophen overdose. This patient does not report a history of acetaminophen ingestion. He has hepatic encephalopathy and fulminant liver failure from Hepatitis A and E coinfection, which requires transfer to a liver transplant center. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administer acyclovir:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Acyclovir is used in the management of hepatic failure caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). This patient&#8217;s HSV PCR is negative. He has hepatic encephalopathy and fulminant liver failure from Hepatitis A and E coinfection, which requires transfer to a liver transplant center. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Chelation therapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Chelation therapy is used when acute liver failure is secondary to the accumulation of heavy metals such as with copper build up in Wilson disease. This patient&#8217;s liver failure is caused by acute coinfection with Hepatitis A and E and chelation would not help. He requires transfer to a liver transplant center. &#160;</span></div>",
