He experienced sudden-onset sharp pain in the abdomen and left shoulder. He subsequently lost consciousness. Before the incident, the patient had been experiencing fatigue and sore throat for two weeks. He has no significant past medical history and was screened with an ECG prior to playing football. At arrival, temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), blood pressure is 90/60, and pulse is 110/min. Physical examination reveals diffuse abdominal guarding and rigidity. Elevation of the legs leads to the patient grimacing in pain and grabbing his left shoulder. Palpation of the left upper abdominal quadrant also causes the patient to grimace in pain. The bilateral tonsils are swollen and erythematous, and there is bilateral posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Which of the following best explains this patient&#8217;s shoulder pain? &#160;",

      "solution": "This patient presents with acute-onset abdominal pain and hypotension after being tackled during a football match. In addition, he likely has concurrent infectious mononucleosis given his symptoms of fatigue, sore throat, and findings of swollen, erythematous tonsils bilaterally with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. In combination, these findings are concerning for a <strong>splenic rupture</strong> and associated <strong>internal bleeding. &#160; &#160; <br></strong><br>The patient experienced <strong>left shoulder pain&#160;</strong>after the tackle and grimaces from left shoulder pain when the legs are elevated. This finding of left shoulder pain from irritation of the left diaphragm is known as the <strong>Kehr Sign</strong>. It is a classic example of<strong>&#160;referred pain.&#160;</strong>The pathophysiology of Kehr Sign is the same as that of other types of referred pain: visceral pain in one location of the body is interpreted as somatic pain in another due to effects of temporal and spatial summation of nerves arising from the same spinal level. &#160; &#160; <br>In this case, splenic rupture and filling of the abdominal cavity with blood irritates the<strong>&#160;inferior surface of the left diaphragm</strong>. Irritation of the underside of the diaphragm is signaled by the <strong>phrenic nerve</strong> which carries pain signals up to spinal nerve levels C3 and C4. The <strong>supraclavicular nerve</strong>, which innervates the skin over the shoulder, also inserts at cervical levels C3 and C4. As a result, there is referred pain to the left shoulder from splenic rupture. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Shoulder dislocation due to excessive force:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Shoulder dislocation does not explain this patient&#8217;s abdominal symptoms, head and neck findings, and hypotension.

Imaging reveals asymmetrical enlargement of the left rectus abdominis muscle indicated by the yellow arrow below. These findings are concerning for a <strong>rectus sheath hematoma. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>A rectus sheath hematoma is an accumulation of blood within the <strong>sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle</strong>. It typically occurs due to an injury to the <strong>epigastric artery</strong> or one of its branches, either due to <strong>abdominal trauma</strong> or <strong>forceful contractions</strong> of the abdominal wall. &#160; <br><br>A focused history may reveal important risk factors such as <strong>anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, recent abdominal surgery or trauma, pregnancy, female biological sex,&#160;</strong>and <strong>chronic conditions</strong> (e.g., renal disease, cirrhosis, hypertension). Additionally, patients with a history of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be at an increased risk due to repeated and forceful contractions of the rectus abdominis muscle during coughing spells. &#160; <br><br>Physical examination typically reveals abdominal wall <strong>ecchymosis&#160;</strong>and a <strong>tender, palpable,&#160;</strong>and <strong>non-pulsating abdominal mass</strong>. A positive <strong>Fothergill sign</strong> (the abdominal mass remains fixed in position when the patient contracts abdominal muscles), and a positive <strong>Carnett sign</strong> can indicate a rectus sheath hematoma. The Carnett sign helps determine if the abdominal pain originates from the abdominal wall muscles or intra-abdominally. The patient is asked to relax and the abdomen is palpated to localize the pain. Then the patient is asked to contract their abdominal muscles and the same spot is palpated. If the pain worsens, it is from the abdominal wall. &#160; <br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/CAm1Aq2ISpKcfwCKApvrgodRQ0CaUPG-/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pneumoperitoneum:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Pneumoperitoneum describes the presence of free air within the abdominal cavity.

Physical examination reveals bruising in the anterior chest and abdominal wall. There is a painful non-pulsatile mass in the right mid-abdomen. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast reveals a type II rectus sheath hematoma. The patient is treated initially with conservative therapy, but on follow up exam, he continues to have severe abdominal pain, and the mass is felt to be enlarging. Follow up bloodwork shows decreasing hemoglobin. Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast show a right rectus sheath hematoma with a circular hyperdense focus in the center of the hematoma.

Despite conservative therapy, a repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast reveals a <strong>rectus sheath hematoma&#160;</strong>with <strong>active contrast extravasation</strong> (blush) &#160;indicating <strong>ongoing bleeding. Angioembolization</strong> should be performed to stop the bleeding. &#160; <br><br>A rectus sheath hematoma is the accumulation of blood within the sheath of the <strong>rectus abdominis muscle. Type I</strong> rectus sheath hematomas are characterized by bleeding confined to the unilateral muscle. They typically can be managed in the outpatient setting with conservative therapy including <strong>bedrest, ice, and compression</strong> to the affected area. If the patient is on anticoagulation therapy, it may need to be <strong>adjusted or discontinued. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Type II&#160;</strong>rectus sheath hematomas are characterized by blood extending along the transversalis fascial plane or crossing the midline.<strong>&#160;Type III</strong> hematomas are characterized by the extension of blood into the peritoneum or perivesical space. Patients with either type II or type III hematomas should be treated as inpatients with initial conservative therapy, IV hydration, anticoagulant reversal if necessary, and they should be followed with serial hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to determine if blood products need to be transfused. If these patients don&#8217;t respond to conservative treatment, become unstable, or if &#160;CT scans show extravasation indicating continuous bleeding, then <strong>angioembolization&#160;</strong>should be performed. If this is ineffective or patients show signs of shock or compressive symptoms (e.g., neuropathy, hydronephrosis), then surgery is indicated. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Angioembolization:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Serial serum lipase levels &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Serum lipase and amylase levels are typically followed in patients with acute pancreatitis which can present with severe abdominal pain.
