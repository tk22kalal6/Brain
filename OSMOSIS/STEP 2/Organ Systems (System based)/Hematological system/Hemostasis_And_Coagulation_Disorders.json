On physical examination, she has tenderness to palpation and there is a <strong>tear in the posterior anal midline</strong>, suggesting an <strong>anal fissure</strong>. Anal fissures are one of the most common causes of anal pain and bleeding. Anal fissures are <strong>superficial tears in the anoderm</strong> distal to the dentate line and are usually located in the <strong>posterior midline</strong>. The majority of anal fissures are caused by local trauma such as constipation or diarrhea, vaginal delivery, or anal sex. On physical examination, they appear as <strong>superficial lacerations</strong> with or without bleeding. At times perianal skin tags may also be present which indicate prior episodes of inflammation or hemorrhoids.<br><br>When examining a patient with an anal fissure, the patient should be in the most comfortable position. Anal fissures are very tender to palpation and can be excruciatingly painful for the patient. Therefore, physical manipulation of the anus or rectum should be kept to a minimum, and instrumentation with anoscopy should be avoided if possible.<br><br>A thorough history and physical examination is important for developing the differential diagnoses for a patient presenting with hematochezia. One <strong>key historical element</strong> is the <strong>absence or presence of rectal pain</strong>. Causes of painless hematochezia include diverticular bleeding, Dieulafoy lesions, angiodysplasia, and colorectal cancer. Causes of painful hematochezia can include anorectal disorders (such as anal fissures, external hemorrhoids, thrombosed internal hemorrhoids, anorectal abscesses, and anal cancer), inflammatory colitis (IBD), and radiation telangiectasia or proctitis.

Blood tests may also help differentiate an active lower GI bleed from an active brisk ongoing upper GI bleed. <strong>Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-to-creatinine ratio</strong> can help differentiate between the two. Blood gets absorbed as it travels through the small bowel leading to an increased BUN, and patients may have decreased renal perfusion with an ongoing bleed. This will lead to an <strong>elevated creatinine BUN-to-creatinine ratio</strong> in patients with an <strong>upper GI bleed</strong>. In a lower GI bleed, the BUN-to-creatinine ratio would be normal.<br><br>An upper GI endoscopy should be performed when an upper GI bleed is suspected. Endoscopy may not be possible if a patient is having active bleeding. However, other diagnostic studies should be obtained to identify the site of bleeding.

      "solution": "This patient sustained significant blunt force trauma to the abdomen and developed an <strong>acquired diaphragmatic hernia&#160;</strong>(ADH). ADH usually arises due to a sudden increase in pleuroperitoneal pressure resulting from blunt or penetrating trauma. Acquired diaphragmatic hernias occur at sites of weakness in the diaphragm that arise from <strong>embryonic fusion sites</strong>. They almost always occur in the <strong>left hemidiaphragm</strong>. This phenomenon occurs because the right hemidiaphragm is <strong>protected by the large size of the liver. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Hiatal hernias</strong> also occur when gastrointestinal contents protrude into the chest cavity through an opening in the diaphragm. They protrude through the opening in the diaphragm called the hiatus. Hiatal hernias occur when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity. There are two types of hiatal hernias: sliding hernias and paraesophageal hernias. <strong>Sliding hernias</strong> occur when the fundus of the stomach bulges directly into the thoracic cavity. In contrast, <strong>paraesophageal hernias</strong> occur when the gastric fundus bulges into the thoracic cavity adjacent to the esophagus. Sliding hernias are generally asymptomatic and more common than paraesophageal hernias. Paraesophageal hernias have the possibility of strangulation and, as a result, more often warrant surgical repair. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-ILBHZVPQA67VD0VK7RcwU4YSw2X_16g/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased bone mineral density:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient&#8217;s imaging reveals a left-sided diaphragmatic hernia without any evidence of fracture that could have been caused by low bone mineral density in conjunction with trauma.

This part of the exam includes performing <strong>adjunctive tests</strong> like trauma labs, including type and screen, pregnancy testing, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic profile (CMP), lactate, urinalysis, urine tox screen and alcohol levels. Additionally, diagnostic tests such as <strong>eFAST and abdominal x-ray, should be performed</strong> and a <strong>CT of the abdomen and pelvis should be ordered in select cases</strong>. <br><br>The <strong>eFAST</strong> examination is an ultrasound examination (<strong>Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma</strong>) used in patients who have experienced trauma to assess for the presence of <strong>fluid within abdominal and chest cavities</strong> which would indicate hemothorax/pneumothorax). The examination is performed in several different anatomical areas, including the <strong>right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, suprapubic area, subxiphoid,&#160;</strong>and <strong>lung windows</strong>.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Free fluid in Morrison&#8217;s pouch:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pericardial effusion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>A pericardial effusion is more likely to present&#160;</span><span>in patients with</span><span>&#160;direct blunt trauma to the chest rather than to the&#160;</span><span>abdomen.</span><span>&#160;Moreover, physical examination&#160;</span><span>in patients&#160;</span><span>with an acute pericardial effusion&#160;</span><span>would be expe</span><span>cted to</span><span>&#160;reveal findings consistent with Beck&#8217;s triad (hypotension, muffled heart sounds,&#160;</span><span>jugular venous distension)</span><span>, which are absent in this patient</span><span>.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Absence of lung sliding:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: absence of lung sliding suggests a pneumothorax, this patient has normal breath sounds bilaterally, whereas absent or diminished breath sounds on the affected side would be expected with pneumothorax following blunt chest trauma.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Free fluid in the pelvis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Free fluid in the pelvis is suggestive of a pelvic fracture.

A key component of treatment of patients with penetrating trauma is to assess the <strong>size and depth of the wound</strong> via <strong>local wound exploration</strong> prior to proceeding to further diagnostic studies or emergent exploratory laparotomy in the case of a deep penetrating injury. <br><br>Adjunctive workup for adult trauma patients with a blunt or penetrating abdominal injury is often dependent on the findings on initial workup or examination. For patients with penetrating trauma, the wound should first be explored before obtaining additional imaging or proceeding to surgery. If the base of the wound can clearly be seen, and the wound does not appear to violate the abdominal fascia, then, CT imaging should be performed to confirm the existence of a <strong>superficial abdominal injury</strong>. If there is any doubt in the depth of the wound or if the injury <strong>violates the abdominal wall fascia</strong>, this can indicate a <strong>deep penetrating injury</strong>, and the patient should be taken directly for exploratory laparotomy, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. <br><br>For patients with <strong>blunt abdominal trauma</strong>, and findings on efast or CT consistent with solid organ injury, mesenteric injury, or blunt aortic injury, the next step is to order a CTA to determine if there is a vascular injury within a solid organ.<br>&#160; &#160; <node/><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/2i2G9JaqQhqSYeTzkcDSRJzdRvSXyUWX/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Local wound exploration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Repeat eFAST:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>Repeating an&#160;</span><span>eFAST</span><span>&#160;would be&#160;</span><span>indicated</span><span>&#160;</span><span>if</span><span>&#160;</span><span>there</span><span>&#160;</span><span>was</span><span>&#160;a</span><span>&#160;change in</span><span>&#160;the</span><span>&#160;</span><span>status of the patient</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;and he became hemodynamically unstable</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;There is no&#160;</span><span>indication</span><span>&#160;</span><span>for repeating this test in this&#160;</span><span>patient.</span><span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ CTA abdomen and pelvis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>CTA abdomen and pelvis</span><span>&#160;can be performed to confirm that the injury&#160;</span><span>is&#160;</span><span>superficial</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Abdominal injury of&#160;</span><span>l</span><span>ocal wound exploration&#160;</span><span>shows no involvement of the abdominal wall fascia.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Emergent laparotomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>This patient is hemodynamically stable with negative&#160;</span><span>eFAST</span><span>.

Special examinations, such as assessing for CVA tenderness, Murphy's sign, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, and obturator sign, may be helpful in determining the underlying pathology.
