Examples from this medication class include <strong>acetazolamide&#160;</strong>and brinzolamide.

It works by inhibiting CA, which is found in the ciliary body epithelium. Inhibition of CA <strong>reduces the formation of bicarbonate ions</strong>, which <strong>reduces fluid transport</strong> and thus reduces IOP. Side effects include paraesthesia, drowsiness, metallic taste, abdominal cramps, polyuria, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hyponatremia). Topical CA inhibitors can be used in the management of open-angle glaucoma.<br><br>Intravenous mannitol (diuretic) is also sometimes used to treat acute glaucoma.

A thorough history can then help identify the underlying cause. Etiologies to consider include prematurity, metabolic disorders, genetic conditions, and congenital infections.

The infant required intubation at birth, received two doses of surfactant, and remained on mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen concentrations for three weeks. Temperature is 37&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 166/min, respirations are 37/min, blood pressure is 82/47 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is 95% on a nasal cannula delivering 60% FiO<sub>2</sub>. On physical examination, the infant appears active. The head is normocephalic with an open, soft anterior fontanelle. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds without murmurs and clear breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and non-distended with normal bowel sounds. Extremities are symmetric with normal tone and movement. Ophthalmologic examination reveals a white pupillary reflex without lens opacity.

In the absence of a lens opacity, the patient likely has a refractive error, such as hyperopia, myopia, or astigmatism. <br><br>If a patient with monocular diplopia does not report improved vision with the pinhole exam, the likely cause is <strong>macular disease</strong>, such as macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or uveitis.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Advanced age:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypertension:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hypertension is not a common risk factor for cataracts, and her blood pressure is not significantly elevated.

Demyelinating diseases, such as <strong>multiple sclerosis (MS)</strong>, are the most common cause in this patient&#8217;s age group. <br><br>For patients with binocular diplopia, the first step is to determine the orientation of the diplopia. <strong>Vertical diplopia</strong> suggests a <strong>cranial nerve (CN) IV (trochlear nerve) palsy</strong>, which can be either congenital or acquired. <strong>Horizontal diplopia</strong> can be caused by a <strong>CN IIl (oculomotor nerve) palsy</strong> or by a <strong>CN VI (abducens nerve) palsy</strong>. Unilateral abducens nerve palsy may result from ischemia, whereas bilateral abducens nerve palsy can occur from increased intracranial pressure. <br><br><strong>Internuclear ophthalmoplegia</strong> is defined by <strong>impaired adduction</strong> of one eye with associated <strong>nystagmus in the contralateral abducting eye</strong>. This occurs due to a lesion in the <strong>medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF)</strong> in the dorsomedial brainstem, which disrupts the coordinated function of CNs VI and III. In <strong>older patients</strong> or those with other stroke risk factors, such a lesion is more commonly <strong>ischemic</strong>, whereas in <strong>younger patients, demyelinating disease</strong> such as MS is a more likely cause.

If the patient has a headache with nausea or vomiting and symptoms that worsen upon entering a dark room and halos around lights, then acute angle closure glaucoma is the likely diagnosis.

Of the options above, only <strong>meclizine</strong>, an <strong>antihistamine</strong>, is used to prevent the nausea, vomiting, and dizziness caused by peripheral vertigo. &#160;<br><br>Labyrinthitis is inflammation of the inner ear that results in vertigo, hearing loss and ringing in the ears. It typically occurs as an acute attack that lasts for days. It may be associated with nausea, vomiting, and nystagmus. It is thought to be a viral or post-viral inflammatory disorder affecting the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve. Although symptoms are disabling, it is a benign disorder, is self-limited, and recovery is complete in most patients. In pure vestibular neuritis, auditory function is preserved, but when combined with unilateral hearing loss, the condition is called labyrinthitis. Treatment for labyrinthitis includes <strong>steroids</strong>, as well as <strong>symptomatic treatment&#160;</strong>to reduce vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These include<strong>&#160;antihistamines, antiemetics, anticholinergics,</strong> and <strong>benzodiazepines</strong>.

The <strong>Weber test</strong> is performed by placing a struck tuning fork on the bridge of the forehead. In an individual with normal hearing, there is no lateralization of sound. With unilateral <strong>conductive hearing loss, sound lateralizes to the affected ear</strong>. Whereas, with unilateral <strong>sensorineural hearing loss, sound lateralizes to the normal ear</strong>.<br><br>The <strong>Rinne test</strong> is performed by placing the base of a struck tuning fork on the mastoid bone until the patient no longer hears sound. Next, the fork is moved beside the ear and the patient is asked if they can still hear sound. In a normal test, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. However, in patients with <strong>conductive hearing loss, bone conduction is greater than air conduction</strong>. Unfortunately, the Rinne test cannot differentiate between normal hearing individuals and those with sensorineural hearing loss, as both present with air conduction greater than bone conduction.<br><br>Hearing loss is broadly categorized into <strong>conductive, sensorineural, and mixed hearing loss</strong>. <strong>Conductive hearing loss</strong> reflects any disease process that affects the transmission of sound from the outside world to the inner ear. Anatomic structures affected in conductive hearing loss include the <strong>auricle, external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, </strong>and<strong> ossicles</strong>. Common etiologies include cerumen impaction, tympanic membrane perforation, otosclerosis, otitis media/externa, and cholesteatomas.<br><br>In contrast, sensorineural hearing loss reflects any disease process that affects the transmission of neuronal input to the central nervous system via damage to the <strong>cochlea </strong>or<strong> auditory nerve</strong>. Common etiologies include presbycusis, noise-induced hearing loss, schwannomas, and Meniere disease. Other etiologies include <strong>ototoxic medications</strong> (e.g. aminoglycosides), <strong>congenital viral infections, congenital long QT syndrome, </strong>and<strong> Alport syndrome</strong>.
