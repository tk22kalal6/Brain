      "text": "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the clinic for evaluation of a painless swelling on the right side of the neck that has recently become more noticeable. A parent reports that the mass has been present intermittently for several years and enlarges during colds or upper respiratory infections. There is no fever, weight loss, night sweats, or recent trauma, and the child is otherwise healthy and up to date on immunizations. The family has a pet cat at home. On examination, the child is afebrile and in no distress. A 3 cm soft, non-tender, fluctuant mass is noted anterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. The overlying skin appears normal without erythema or warmth. The mass does not move with swallowing or tongue protrusion. Oropharyngeal and lymphatic examinations are unremarkable. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck reveals a well-defined, low-attenuation cystic structure lateral to the carotid sheath and anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this condition?",

The first group of neurons migrate down from the olfactory placode, embed in the cribriform plate, and assist with sensing smell. The second group of neurons migrate through the cribriform plate to settle in the hypothalamus, where they release gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH further stimulates luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion from the pituitary gland, inducing the gonads to produce sex specific hormones (i.e., estrogen and progesterone in women and testosterone in men). &#160; <br><br>Kallmann syndrome results from a<strong>&#160;defect in the migration of the neurons from the olfactory placode including the olfactory neurons (CN I)&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;GnRH neurons which results in a &#8595; in GnRH, FSH, LH and testosterone/estrogen, and progesterone.&#160;</strong>As a result, patients present with <strong>under-developed primary and secondary sex characteristics,</strong> delayed onset puberty, anosmia/hyposmia, and midline defects (e.g., cleft lip or palate). &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/B4NYX1FpSdiKk-_fVacCybNKSKK_WyOJ/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sex chromosome trisomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Klinefelter syndrome is a sex chromosome trisomy (XXY) that presents with delayed puberty in a male patient.

He likely has myopia, which can be treated with the application of concave lenses.<br><br>Normally, as light enters the eye, the lens bends the light such that the optical image is clearly focused on the retina. When the cornea and lens fail to optimize this focus, a distortion, or blurring of the image, can occur. With <strong>hyperopia&#160;</strong>(far-sightedeness), the axial length of the eye is too short for the refractive power of the cornea and lens. Thus, the image is focused behind the retina. This refractive error can be corrected with a <strong>convex</strong> (converging) <strong>lens</strong>. In contrast, <strong>myopia</strong> (near-sightedeness) occurs when the axial length of the eye is too long for the refractive power of the cornea and lens. These abnormalities cause the image to be focused in front of the retina. Treatment for myopia involves application of a <strong>concave</strong> (diverging) <strong>lens</strong>.<br><br>Lastly, <strong>astigmatism</strong> refers to an abnormal curvature of the cornea, which causes light rays entering the eye along different planes to be focused unevenly, resulting in distortion of vision at all distances.

      "solution": "This patient presents for evaluation of an<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>eyelid lesion</strong> without concerning features for a more insidious process (e.g. vision changes, fevers). Given the description of <strong>gradual onset&#160;</strong>and the finding of a <strong>firm nontender nodule felt in the inner eyelid</strong>, the most likely diagnosis is a <strong>chalazion</strong>. These lesions result from obstruction of a meibomian gland, leading to the formation of a sterile lipogranuloma. They typically occur in the middle of the upper eyelid and are nontender; they may be erythematous. Chalazia typically resolve with conservative management, like warm compresses, over several months. &#160; &#160;<br><br>When evaluating patients with eyelid lesions, it is important to assess for <strong>erythema, edema, and tenderness to palpation of the eyelid.&#160;</strong>If these are present, serious conditions, such as <strong>orbital cellulitis,&#160;</strong>should be ruled out. Findings consistent with orbital cellulitis include fever, vision changes, pain with extraocular eye movements, violaceous discoloration, significant erythema and tenderness, and possibly proptosis. &#160; &#160; <br><br>If orbital cellulitis or other serious ophthalmological conditions are ruled out clinically, benign eyelid diseases can be considered, such as <strong>chalazion or hordeolum (stye).

The finding of inflamed scleral vessels on slit lamp examination supports the diagnosis. At least half of cases of scleritis are linked to an underlying <strong>autoimmune condition</strong> like <strong>rheumatoid&#160;</strong><strong><span>arthritis</span><span>.</span>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>The history and physical examination of a patient with a red eye are aimed at determining whether <strong>red flag features</strong> are present and narrowing down the diagnosis. Red flag features indicate an immediate threat to vision. Red flag findings include<strong>&#160;severe pain, decreased visual acuity, photophobia, pupillary changes, increased intraocular pressure, anterior chamber inflammation, and corneal epithelial defects. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br><strong><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/rloAxMWnTS_kcjmgSuBYq-EbSZmt-pul/_.png\"></div></strong><br><br>Key features from the history can help narrow down the most probable cause. For example, scleritis commonly occurs in patients with an underlying autoimmune condition, while hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis is usually seen in patients who are sexually active or immunocompromised, or in neonates exposed during vaginal delivery. Patients with keratitis often have underlying autoimmune conditions or infections (i.e., herpes simplex virus). Keratoconjunctivitis sicca often occurs in patients with a history of Sjogren syndrome or in patients taking medications with a drying effect on the eyes (e.g., antihistamines, diuretics). Certain forms of angle-closure glaucoma are hereditary; therefore, a positive family history can signal an increased risk of this condition. Patients with conjunctivitis may have a history of recent exposure to chemical irritants, recent bacterial or upper respiratory infections, or seasonal allergies. Benign causes of a red eye can often be diagnosed clinically after a thorough history and physical examination. In cases where red flags are present, the history and physical will determine which additional tests are necessary in consultation with an ophthalmologist. <br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Rheumatoid arthritis&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recent head trauma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Head trauma</span><span>&#160;</span><span>can cause a&#160;</span><span>variety of eye disorders</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;including globe rupture, subconjunctival hemorrhage, corneal abrasion</span><span>s</span><span>,&#160;</span><span>and glaucoma.&#160;</span><span>However,&#160;</span><span>t</span><span>his&#160;</span><span>patient</span><span>&#160;</span><span>has&#160;</span><span>scleritis</span><span>, which is commonly associated with autoimmune&#160;</span><span>conditions</span><span>&#160;</span><span>like rheumatoid arthritis.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Multiple sexual partners:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Although&#160;</span><span>bacterial infection</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>such as from a sexually transmitted infection</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;can lead to scleritis, this</span><span>&#160;etiology</span><span>&#160;</span><span>represents</span><span>&#160;only a small percentage of cases of scleritis and&#160;</span><span>is</span><span>&#160;typically</span><span>&#160;associated with copious purulent discharge</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;which is&#160;</span><span>absent</span><span>&#160;in this case.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sickle cell anemia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>S</span><span>ickle cell anemia&#160;</span><span>increases the&#160;</span><span>risk of developing glaucoma.&#160;</span><span>However, t</span><span>his patien</span><span>t</span><span>&#160;</span><span>has</span><span>&#160;scleritis, which is</span><span>&#160;</span><span>frequently</span><span>&#160;associated with au</span><span>toimmune c</span><span>onditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recent vomiting:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Increased intrathoracic pressure&#160;</span><span>from actions like</span><span>&#160;coughing,&#160;</span><span>sneezing,&#160;</span><span>vomiting, heavy&#160;</span><span>lifting</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;or</span><span>&#160;performing a</span><span>&#160;Valsalva maneuver</span><span>&#160;can lead to a subconjunctival hemorrhage</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>However, t</span><span>his&#160;</span><span>has</span><span>&#160;scleritis</span><span>, which is&#160;</span><span>often associated with autoimmune conditions</span><span>&#160;like rheumatoid&#160;</span><span>arthritis</span><span>.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "The patient's presentation of sudden severe pain, copious purulent discharge, eyelid edema, and a history of recent unprotected sexual intercourse strongly suggests <strong>hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis,</strong> commonly caused by <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em><em>.&#160;</em>This condition is a <strong>medical emergency</strong> due to its potential to rapidly progress to corneal involvement and vision loss. <strong>Nucleic acid amplification testing</strong> (NAAT) of the eyelid discharge is essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate <strong>systemic</strong> <strong>antibiotic therapy.</strong>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Emergent, vision-threatening conjunctival disorders include chemical injury and hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis. Non-vision-threatening conjunctival disorders include acute bacterial conjunctivitis, viral conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Assessing for red flags can help determine whether a condition is likely to be vision-threatening and emergent or non-emergent. Red flags include severe pain, decreased visual acuity, photophobia, anterior chamber inflammation, and corneal epithelial defects. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Various diagnostic tests are used to differentiate conjunctival disorders. Bacterial conjunctivitis can be diagnosed clinically, or with gram stain and culture of the discharge, which is rarely needed. Viral conjunctivitis is also diagnosed clinically, but polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used for confirmation in atypical cases. Allergic conjunctivitis is diagnosed based on history and clinical presentation of recent exposure to environmental allergies, such as pollen or pet dander, and lack of features or findings of other conditions. Chemical conjunctivitis is diagnosed based on history of exposure and clinical findings, while keratoconjunctivitis sicca is confirmed with a Schirmer test, which measures tear production. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Topical antibiotics and follow-up in one week:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>&#160;<span>Incorrect</span><span>:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>This would be&#160;</span><span>appropriate</span><span>&#160;treatment</span><span>&#160;for&#160;</span><span>simple&#160;</span><span>bacterial conjunctivitis.</span>&#160;<span>This&#160;</span><span>patient has findings&#160;</span><span>consistent</span><span>&#160;with</span><span>&#160;hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis&#160;</span><span>which&#160;</span><span>requires immediate systemic antibiotic therapy and close monitoring, not just topical&#160;</span><span>antibiotics</span><span>&#160;</span><span>with</span><span>&#160;delayed follow-up.&#160;</span>&#160; &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Oral antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilizers:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect</span><span>:</span></strong><span>&#160;This treatment is&#160;</span><span>appropriate for</span><span>&#160;allergic conjunctivitis</span><span>.
