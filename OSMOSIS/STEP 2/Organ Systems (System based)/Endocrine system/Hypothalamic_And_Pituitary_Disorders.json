The pathognomonic finding on blood smear is the <strong>presence of intraerythrocytic ring-form structures</strong>. These are young trophozoites of the <em>Plasmodium </em>parasite, often referred to as \"ring forms\" due to their appearance.<br><br>Malaria, caused by the <em>Plasmodium </em>species, is an infectious disease transmitted via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito. This leads to <strong>RBC lysis and subsequent hemolysis</strong>. Patients with malaria typically have episodes of fever with chills, with a pattern that can vary based on the Plasmodium species but often involves cycles where the individual will feel well for a period, followed by sudden and intense shaking, fevers, and diaphoresis. Other symptoms include fatigue, pallor, dizziness, headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Presence of intraerythrocytic ring-form structures:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Presence of intraerythrocytic \"Maltese cross\" structures:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This finding is indicative of Babesiosis, a parasitic infection transmitted by ticks typically seen in temperate zones including the Northeast and upper Midwest regions of the United States. The \"Maltese cross\" formation represents the tetrads of Babesia parasites within the red cells. The clinical presentation can be similar to malaria with fevers and hemolysis, but this patient's travel history and cyclical fevers align more closely with malaria. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Predominance of spherocytes:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A blood smear with a predominance of spherocytes is characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis and also can be seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The presence of cyclical fevers, headaches, and travel history to a malaria-endemic region, makes malaria more likely. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Presence of sickled RBCs:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Sickled red blood cells are a defining trait of sickle cell disease (SCD). This genetic disorder prompts red cells to assume a sickle shape under conditions of low oxygen, leading to occlusion of small vessels and painful crises. SCD does not exhibit the cyclical fever pattern associated with malaria, making it an unlikely diagnosis in this patient. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Presence of bite cells:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Bit cells can be seen during hemolytic episodes in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Oxidative stress induces hemoglobin to denature and form Heinz bodies, and the spleen's macrophages \"bite\" these inclusions out, leading to the characteristic \"bite\" cell appearance. While this patient does exhibit symptoms of hemolysis, the cyclical fever pattern and travel history make malaria more likely. &#160;</span></div>",

Her history of <strong>worsening fatigue and heavy periods&#160;</strong>as well as the findings of <strong>pallor</strong>, and <strong>tachycardia&#160;</strong>on examination support the diagnosis. Worldwide, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. <strong>Iron deficiency anemia</strong> is most often from <strong>blood loss</strong> such as from menorrhagia or gastrointestinal bleeding. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Iron deficiency anemia occurs when the body does not have sufficient iron to produce enough healthy red blood cells. Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and occasionally Pica (craving for non-nutritive substances). Pagophagia is a type of pica where patients have a craving to chew on ice is specific for iron deficiency anemia. Restless leg syndrome, headaches, exertional dyspnea, and weakness are other symptoms that can be seen with iron deficiency anemia. &#160; <br><br>Medical history may reveal conditions that affect the <strong>absorption of iron</strong> such as inflammatory bowel disease, H. Pylori infection, celiac disease or a history of bariatric surgery. History may reveal conditions that lead to loss of blood including menorrhagia, metromenorrhagia, or blood per rectum. <strong>Nutritional history</strong> helps to determine if a patient has an adequate intake of iron. Medications such as <strong>NSAIDS and PPIs</strong> can increase the risk of iron deficiency anemia. NSAIDS can do so by causing peptic ulcer disease and PPIs by reducing the absorption of iron. &#160; &#160;<br><br>On physical examination, patients may present with <strong>pallor&#160;</strong>(of the conjunctiva, lips, and nail beds). <strong>Tachycardia&#160;</strong>and <strong>tachypnea&#160;</strong>may be present due to the compensatory response to reduced tissue oxygen delivery. <strong>Brittle nails</strong> or <strong>koilonychia&#160;</strong>(concave or spoon-shaped nails) may be seen in some patients. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;Iron deficiency anemia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Vitamin B12 deficiency&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Vitamin B12 deficiency presents with symptoms of anemia but is less likely in this patient who reports eating a well-balanced diet.

Some patients may have symptoms of thrombocytopenia, such as bruising or bleeding, or findings from neutropenia, such as recurrent infections. Without treatment, most patients with MDS will eventually require <strong>red blood cell (RBC) transfusions</strong>. Whenever possible, use of <strong>erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)</strong> should be utilized to prevent repeated transfusions. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Packed red blood cell transfusion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Peripheral blood smear:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A peripheral smear will help to differentiate between megaloblastic and non-megaloblastic anemias; however, administration of packed red blood cells takes precedence as this patient remains symptomatic. MDS causes a non-megaloblastic macrocytic anemia. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Liver function tests:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Liver function tests can be performed if chronic alcohol use or liver disease is suspected. This patient does not drink alcohol nor does he have signs and symptoms consistent with liver dysfunction, including jaundice or abdominal pain. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Iron studies:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Iron studies are done to determine the cause of microcytic anemia. It is not necessary to evaluate macrocytic anemia as seen in this patient. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Bone marrow aspirate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Bone marrow aspiration can help determine the cause of decreased hematopoiesis, including aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. This is an invasive procedure that can be performed later to confirm the diagnosis. &#160;</span></div>",
