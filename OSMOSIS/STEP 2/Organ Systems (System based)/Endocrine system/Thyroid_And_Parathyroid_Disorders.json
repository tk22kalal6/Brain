The first line treatment for patients with allergic rhinitis is a<strong><span>&#160;</span><span>glucocorticoid nasal&#160;</span><span>spray, such</span><span>&#160;</span><span>as</span><span>&#160;fluticasone</span><span>&#160;propionate</span><span>.&#160;</span>&#160; &#160;</strong>&#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients with allergic rhinitis should be encouraged to avoid known triggers&#160;when possible and to use&#160;saline nasal irrigation to&#160;clear debris and allergens. Beyond supportive care,&#160;several pharmacological therapies can be helpful. The most effective pharmacologic treatment for allergic rhinitis&#160;is <strong>intranasal steroids</strong><strong>.&#160;</strong>When these cannot be tolerated or are ineffective,&#160;<strong>intranasal antihistamines&#160;</strong>serve as a helpful adjunct and can be used alone or in combination with a nasal steroid. The addition of an oral antihistamine to a nasal steroid has not been shown to provide clear benefits over steroids alone. An <strong>oral decongestant</strong> may be needed when allergic rhinitis is severe, meaning that it significantly impacts the patient&#8217;s quality of life. The leukotriene receptor antagonist, montelukast, can be prescribed in patients who also have asthma. If environmental control measures have been maximized and the patient is experiencing significant symptoms despite an optimal medication regimen, <strong>immunotherapy </strong>can be considered. Allergen-specific testing is not necessary in the routine workup of allergic rhinitis unless immunotherapy is being considered, or when the causative agent cannot be readily identified. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Fluticasone propionate nasal spray:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct:</strong></span><span>&#160;See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Azelastine nasal spray&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Azelastine is an antihistamine nasal spray which can provide&#160;</span><span>additional</span><span>&#160;symptom relief when&#160;</span><span>glucocorticoid</span><span>&#160;nasal sprays are not tolerated or&#160;</span><span>ineffective</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>G</span><span>lucocorticoid nasal sprays are&#160;</span><span>a first</span><span>&#160;line treatment for allergic rhinitis.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Oxymetazoline nasal spray:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Oxymetazoline nasal spray is a topical decongestant&#160;</span><span>which can cause a form of rebound nasal congestion called rhinitis medicamentosa</span><span>&#160;</span><span>when&#160;</span><span>used for more than&#160;</span><span>72 hours</span><span>&#160;at a time</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;Oxymetazoline has limited usefulness in the temporary relief of nasal congestion&#160;</span><span>and</span><span>&#160;should not be recommended for ongoing therapy in allergic rhinitis.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Montelukast:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist,&#160;</span><span>can be helpful in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, especially in patients with a history of asthma</span><span>.

      "solution": "The nasal cavity has numerous connections to its surrounding spaces. It is important to remember the relationship between the nasal cavity and its surrounding structures because nasal congestion can cause inflammation and swelling of the mucosa close to the openings of these spaces. When the surrounding spaces are unable to drain properly, infection can develop and spread.<br><br>In particular, the <strong>maxillary sinuses</strong> are the most common site to which an infection in the nasal cavity might spread. The openings (or ostia) to the maxillary sinuses are small and can be easily obstructed when the surrounding nasal mucosa becomes congested. Also, because of the orientation of the maxillary sinuses in the skull, it is difficult for them to drain properly when the head is <strong>upright or lying on one side</strong>; the ostia are directed towards one another, so when lying on the side, only the top sinus can actually drain. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/LlhMEToFRfOcjFRA9xplo7cXRZuL_Uz6/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Frontal sinus &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The frontal sinus is located in the frontal bone and opens into the anterior part of the middle meatus via the frontonasal duct.

PK deficiency is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder characterized by decreased levels of an enzyme called pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, and therefore, PK deficiency leads to decreased levels of ATP in erythrocytes. Without ATP, the sodium potassium ATPase pumps in erythrocytes stop functioning. Since the cell membrane is more permeable to potassium than sodium, potassium leaks out of the cell, and the intracellular fluid becomes hypotonic. This change causes water to move out of the cell, and the cell shrinks. These dehydrated erythrocytes can form tiny, uniform projections and turn into <strong>echinocytes</strong>, also known as <strong>burr cells</strong>.

Hemolysis in PNH is directly mediated by the complement system and is due to a mutation in the PIGA gene that results in the absence of GPI anchor expression erythrocytes.

The primary mechanism of<span>&#160;</span><strong>stroke in SCD&#160;</strong>is<span>&#160;</span><strong>vaso-occlusion of cerebral vessels&#160;</strong>caused by<span>&#160;</span><strong>sickled erythrocytes.&#160;</strong>This process is particularly dangerous because once the sickling process begins, it can propagate quickly, leading to extensive ischemia and infarction.<span>&#160;</span><strong>Immediate exchange transfusion</strong><span>&#160;</span>is the most effective management to<span>&#160;</span><strong>rapidly reduce the proportion of sickled cells,&#160;</strong>restore blood flow to ischemic areas, and limit extension of the stroke. This method is preferred over simple transfusions alone to avoid increasing the blood viscosity which could exacerbate the vaso-occlusion. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients with SCD and an ischemic stroke should also be treated with isotonic fluids, and simple transfusions can be used as a temporizing measure for patients with low hemoglobin levels. Oxygen should be provided to maintain oxygen saturation &gt; 95% and supportive care should be provided. Empiric antibiotics should be given if there is a fever or evidence of infection. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Perform exchange transfusion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Initiate intravenous hydration with hypotonic saline:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>IV hydration with isotonic fluids (ie normal saline) should be given to patients with SCD and acute stroke.

      "solution": "This patient presents with <strong>acute hemolytic anemia</strong>, evident from his fatigue and pallor. The recent upper respiratory illness combined with use of an unknown antibiotic likely triggered <strong>oxidative stress-induced hemolysis</strong> in this patient with underlying <strong>glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency</strong>.<br><br>G6PD deficiency, which is an <strong>X-linked recessive disorder</strong>, is the most common enzymatic disorder of red blood cells. G6PD plays a pivotal role in the pentose phosphate pathway, which protects red blood cells from oxidative damage by producing reduced glutathione. A deficiency in G6PD makes red blood cells <strong>more susceptible to oxidative stress</strong>. Consequently, certain triggers, like infections, certain medications (eg sulfa drugs, antimalarials), certain foods like fava beans, and alcohol can precipitate <strong>acute hemolysis</strong> in affected individuals. Patients with G6PD deficiency may remain asymptomatic until exposed to these triggers. When hemolysis occurs, symptoms can be rapid in onset and may include fatigue, pallor, jaundice (due to the breakdown of hemoglobin), abdominal pain, and hemoglobinuria, leading to dark urine. The physical exam may show pallor, jaundice, and splenomegaly due to increased RBC turnover. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-jP7hJTKRGuIel1SAGEcPPnIQOCefqG6/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in red blood cells:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intrinsic defect in red blood cell membrane proteins:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by an intrinsic defect in RBC membrane proteins.
