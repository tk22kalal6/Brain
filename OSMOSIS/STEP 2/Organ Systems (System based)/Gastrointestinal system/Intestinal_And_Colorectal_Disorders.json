These findings suggest a diagnosis of <strong>primary hypothyroidism</strong>. She does not have antithyroid antibodies, therefore Hashimoto thyroiditis, which is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient parts of the world, can be ruled out. Other causes of hypothyroidism should be investigated. Patients presenting with primary hypothyroidism should have their medication lists reviewed for a cause of primary hypothyroidism. <strong>Lithium </strong>which is used to treat bipolar syndrome can cause hypothyroidism by <strong>inhibiting the uptake of iodine</strong> by the thyroid gland and interfering with <strong>secretion of thyroid hormones</strong>. Regular thyroid monitoring is recommended for patients taking lithium. <br><br>Typically, patients with hypothyroidism present nonspecific manifestations due to slowing of the metabolism like fatigue, constipation, weight gain, and depression. Other signs and symptoms include <strong>cold intolerance</strong>, skin dryness, brittle hair, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of DTRs. &#160;A <strong>goiter</strong>, or enlargement of the thyroid tissue may occur which can present as a palpable swelling over the anterior neck. Goiters can lead to compressive symptoms like difficulty swallowing, cough, or voice changes.<br><br><strong>Medications </strong>that can cause hypothyroidism include lithium, amiodarone, immunotherapies, and antithyroid medicines. High TSH and a low serum-free T<sub>4</sub> would be seen in laboratory studies in most cases of medication-induced hypothyroidism.

This patient has Stage 4 <strong>severe chronic kidney disease&#160;</strong>based on her glomerular filtration rate, causing chronic hypocalcemia leading to excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. Chronic kidney disease is the most likely direct cause of <strong>secondary hyperparathyroidism</strong> in this patient.<br><br>Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by the <strong>excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH)</strong> by the parathyroid glands in <strong>response to chronic hypocalcemia</strong>. This is in contrast to primary hyperparathyroidism, where the excess PTH secretion is due to intrinsic abnormalities of the parathyroid glands themselves, such as adenomas or hyperplasia. The patient&#8217;s history and laboratory studies can help differentiate between these two conditions. Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevated PTH level accompanied by high serum calcium and often normal or low phosphate levels. <strong>Secondary hyperparathyroidism</strong> typically presents with an <strong>elevated PTH</strong> level, <strong>low or normal serum calcium</strong>, and <strong>high phosphate</strong> levels.<br><br>The most common cause of <strong>secondary hyperparathyroidism</strong> is <strong>chronic kidney disease</strong>, where impaired renal function leads to phosphate retention, reduced synthesis of active vitamin D, and subsequent <strong>decrease in calcium absorption</strong> from the GI tract. <strong>Malabsorption&#160;</strong>syndromes, like celiac disease or gastric bypass surgery, can also impair the <strong>absorption of calcium</strong> and vitamin D. Additionally, severe <strong>dietary deficiencies</strong>, or the use of certain medications (e.g., <strong>bisphosphonates, anticonvulsants, loop diuretics</strong>) that affect calcium and vitamin D homeostasis, can also lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/5tRCtrK-TfGDR960s7U71re3QOK3HlRh/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Chronic kidney disease:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diabetes mellitus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: While diabetes can lead to kidney disease, which in turn may cause secondary hyperparathyroidism, it is not a direct causative factor for the condition. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ High calcium diet:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: In patients without underlying disorders, a diet high in calcium would typically reduce the risk of hyperparathyroidism by providing adequate calcium, which can suppress parathyroid hormone secretion.

Then, during the second and third trimesters, once organogenesis is complete, methimazole is preferred due to its lower risk of hepatotoxicity.<br><br>Patients taking thionamides require close monitoring of thyroid and liver function and should be educated on symptoms and signs that should prompt medical review. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Methimazole:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Methimazole is an oral anti-thyroid drug commonly used to treat hyperthyroidism in the general population.

The condition is categorized into three types: primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary hyperparathyroidism is typically caused by parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia, leading to unregulated overproduction of PTH and often resulting in elevated serum calcium. <strong>Secondary hyperparathyroidism</strong> is a response to <strong>chronic hypocalcemia</strong>, commonly due to chronic kidney disease or <strong>dietary deficiencies</strong>, where the parathyroid glands are compensating for the low calcium by <strong>producing more PTH</strong>. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism where the parathyroid glands become hyperactive and autonomous, continuing to produce high levels of PTH even after the initial cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism has been treated or resolved.<br><br>The management of hyperparathyroidism is based on the type of hyperparathyroidism. In <strong>primary hyperparathyroidism</strong>, <strong>surgery</strong> is often the preferred treatment, especially in <strong>symptomatic cases</strong>.

Moreover, this patient has evidence of <strong>trisomy 21 facies</strong> and an abdominal radiograph demonstrating <strong>dilated proximal bowel loops</strong> with <strong>decreased air in the distal segment</strong> of the intestines, consistent with <strong>Hirschsprung disease</strong>. Patients with suspicion for this disease should undergo further confirmatory testing with <strong>contrast enema with rectal suction biopsy</strong>. Biopsy results will show evidence of the <strong>aganglionic colonic segment</strong>.<br><br>Newborn patients with constipation should be assessed regarding the <strong>timing of meconium passage</strong>. Newborns with <strong>delayed passage of meconium (&gt; 48 hours from delivery)</strong> are more likely to suffer from an obstruction. These patients should be assessed for the presence of an <strong>imperforate anus or intestinal obstruction</strong>. Patients with an obstruction will demonstrate evidence of <strong>dilated loops of bowel on radiographs</strong>. Patients with <strong>Hirschsprung disease</strong> will often have evidence of decreased or absent air in the distal segment of the intestines. In contrast, patients with <strong>meconium ileus</strong> will have evidence of a <strong>&#8220;bubbly appearance.&#8221;</strong> Confirmatory testing is achieved with a <strong>contrast enema</strong>, and if there is concern for Hirschsprung disease, <strong>rectal suction biopsy</strong> should be performed.<br><br>Newborns that have difficulty stooling after delivery (though not necessarily in the first 48 hours after delivery<span>)</span> should be assessed for possible <strong>spinal cord disorder</strong>. This may present as a deep sacral dimple, sacral tuft of hair, absent anal wink, or decreased lower extremity reflexes. If there is concern for a spinal cord abnormality, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine should be obtained to assess for the presence of meningomyelocele, spinal cord tumor, or tethered cord.<br><br>Infants and children with <strong>constipation&#160;</strong>should be <strong>evaluated for medication or toxin exposure</strong>, and if absent, patients should be assessed for an organic etiology of constipation. Further workup and confirmatory testing is dependent upon clinical findings. For example, patients with fatigue, hair loss, or cold intolerance should be evaluated for endocrinopathies, such as <strong>hypothyroidism</strong>, by evaluating the <strong>thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4)</strong>. <strong>Celiac&#160;</strong>disease should be considered when appropriate risk factors are present (e.g. history of autoimmune disease) or typical findings are present (e.g. dermatitis herpetiformis). Confirmatory testing for this condition can be achieved via measurement of <strong>tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (tTG IgA)&#160;</strong>and <strong>total IgA levels</strong>. Once organic etiologies have been considered and excluded, patients with constipation should be evaluated for <strong>irritable bowel syndrome&#160;</strong>and <strong>functional constipation</strong>.

Laboratory studies demonstrating <strong>hypokalemia, hypochloremia, elevated bicarbonate</strong>, and <strong>indirect hyperbilirubinemia</strong> support the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, and the finding of a thickened pylorus (target sign) confirms it. Pyloric stenosis is caused by <strong>hypertrophy of the circular and longitudinal muscle fibers of the pylorus</strong>.<br><br>The circular and longitudinal muscle fibers of the pylorus act as a muscular valve between the stomach and the duodenum. Hypertrophy of these muscles can result in pyloric stenosis. This most commonly presents <strong>between 2 and 6 weeks of age</strong>. Pyloric stenosis often leads to complete or near-complete gastric outlet obstruction, which can present as <strong>forceful postprandial vomiting that is non-bilious</strong>, as the stomach fills with ingested liquid that is unable to pass into the duodenum. Excessive vomiting in turn causes <strong>dehydration&#160;</strong>and metabolic abnormalities like <strong>hypokalemic and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis</strong>.

The risk of peptic ulcer disease is magnified in patients also taking glucocorticoids, those with a history of peptic ulcer disease, and patients over age 60. Additional therapeutic interventions include the use of proton pump inhibitors, H-2 blockers, and evaluation for concurrent H. pylori infection. &#160;<br><br>NSAIDs, including naproxen, aspirin, ketorolac, and diclofenac, inhibit cyclooxygenase, with all of them being reversible agents aside from aspirin. Cyclooxygenase, or COX, mediates production of prostaglandins, which help to maintain the barrier function of gastric mucosa by <strong>enhancing bicarbonate secretion, mucous production, epithelial hyperplasia, as well as mucosal blood flow via vasodilation</strong>. Specifically, this process is mediated by PGE2. Most of these gastric interactions are mediated by COX-1, as opposed to COX-2 which is expressed constitutively throughout the body. As the barrier function breaks down due to NSAID-induced COX inhibition, gastric acid erodes the mucosa, eventually leading to gastritis or ulcer formation.
