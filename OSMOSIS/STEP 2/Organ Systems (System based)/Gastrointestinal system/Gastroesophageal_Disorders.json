      "solution": "This patient with multiple signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism has late-night salivary and 24-hour urinary free cortisol measurements that confirm the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. The <strong>elevated serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)</strong> indicates <strong>ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome</strong>. The patient is found to have a pituitary microadenoma (&lt;10 mm), but inferior petrosal sinus sampling does not indicate that the pituitary gland is the source of ACTH. Therefore, <strong>CT imaging of the chest</strong> should be done to look for <strong>small cell lung cancer</strong>, which is the most likely <strong>ectopic source of ACTH</strong> in this patient with a significant smoking history.<br><br>Once Cushing syndrome is confirmed, plasma ACTH levels should be measured. If ACTH is low, then this indicates <strong>ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome</strong> and abdominal imaging should be performed to look for an adrenal mass. If ACTH is high then the patient has <strong>ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome</strong>, and a brain MRI should be performed to look for a pituitary source of ACTH. If a <strong>pituitary macroadenoma</strong><strong>(&#8805;10 mm)</strong> is found, this is likely the source and the condition is referred to as <strong>Cushing disease</strong>. If a <strong>microadenoma (&lt;10 mm)</strong> is found, then <strong>inferior petrosal sinus sampling</strong> should be performed. The ACTH levels in the blood from the petrosal sinus (central) are compared to the levels in the peripheral vein. A significant central-to-peripheral ACTH pituitary gradient (often a ratio greater than 2 or 3 at baseline, and greater than 3 after CRH stimulation) indicates a central source of ACTH (i.e. the pituitary gland). If there is <strong>no significant gradient</strong>, it suggests that ACTH production is coming from somewhere other than the pituitary, indicating an <strong>ectopic source</strong>. The next step given the low central-to-peripheral ACTH pituitary gradient is to perform chest imaging to look for a lung malignancy. <strong>Ectopic ACTH production from small cell lung cancer</strong> is typically treated with <strong>tumor resection</strong>.<br><br>Management of Cushing syndrome depends on the underlying cause of the condition. Management of <strong>Cushing disease</strong> from a <strong>pituitary adenoma</strong> should include <strong>surgical consultation</strong> to determine if <strong>tumor resection</strong> with transsphenoidal adenomectomy is appropriate. This is usually followed by hormone replacement therapy with growth hormone and glucocorticoids. Alternatively, if surgery is not appropriate, radiotherapy can be considered. Other treatment options include medical therapy with adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, like ketoconazole and metyrapone, or somatostatin receptor ligands, like pasireotide.<br><br>Bilateral adrenalectomy can be used to definitively treat adrenal hyperplasia, and unilateral adrenalectomy can definitively treat adrenal adenomas. The adrenal enzyme inhibitors (metyrapone or ketoconazole) can be given to reduce cortisol secretion in order to improve patients&#8217; physical condition before surgery.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/eumHAl7hSq_YYXKbE1rT_t9vRn6GaD2D/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ CT imaging of the chest:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Transsphenoidal adenomectomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This is a treatment option for patients with Cushing disease (glucocorticoid excess due to a pituitary mass).

The immediate goal of treatment is to control blood pressure and reduce the risk of serious complications, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and aortic dissection. An <strong>alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker</strong> such as <strong>phentolamine&#160;</strong>can be used to lower blood pressure quickly in a hypertensive emergency caused by a pheochromocytoma. <strong>Alpha-blockade</strong> must be initiated <strong>before beta-blockade</strong> to prevent a paradoxical hypertensive crisis from unopposed alpha stimulation.

Glucocorticoids are pharmacologically similar to endogenous <strong>cortisol</strong>. They are used for their <strong>anti-inflammatory</strong> and <strong>immunosuppressive&#160;</strong>effects. They can be administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or via inhalation. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The secretion of cortisol is regulated by the<strong>&#160;hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal</strong> (HPA) <strong>axis</strong>. The hypothalamus secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (<strong>CRH</strong>), which acts on the pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (<strong>ACTH</strong>). ACTH travels to the adrenal glands, which bind to ACTH on adrenocortical cells. Glucocorticoids are then released from the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland. Glucocorticoids exert a <strong>negative feedback effect on the HPA axis</strong> and decrease the release of CRH and ACTH.

      "solution": "This patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of pyelonephritis in the setting of well-controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus with evidence of chronic peripheral neuropathy (extremity numbness). Pyelonephritis, or an infection of the kidney, is more common in diabetic patients and causes nausea, vomiting, fever, leukocytosis, and flank pain with costovertebral tenderness on physical examination. Although this patient&#8217;s diabetes has stably been controlled on her insulin pump, infections increase the body&#8217;s insulin requirement and are thus a common trigger for <strong>diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</strong>. Without any insulin, lipolysis occurs and the liver starts to turn fatty acids into ketone bodies, such as <strong>aceto-acetic acid</strong> and <strong>beta hydroxybutyric acid</strong>, thereby increasing the acidity of the blood, causing an<strong>&#160;anion-gap metabolic acidosis. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Clinically, individuals with DKA are dehydrated from hyperglycemic polyuria. The acidosis causes <strong>Kussmaul respiration</strong>, which is deep and rapid breathing as the body tries to move carbon dioxide out of the blood to reduce its acidity. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and mental status changes like delirium and psychosis can occur. Laboratory results show hyperglycemia with low serum pH and low bicarbonate. The anion gap is high, which reflects a large difference in the unmeasured negative and positive ions in the serum, largely due to this build up of ketoacids. &#160;<br><br>Potassium is critically important to replete in DKA. Recall that cells have a transporter that exchanges hydrogen ions for potassium. When the blood gets acidic, there are many positively charged hydrogen ions present in the blood. Cells will exchange these extracellular protons with intracellular potassium, so initially there will be hyperkalemia. In addition to helping glucose enter cells, insulin also stimulates the sodium-potassium ATPases that help potassium get into cells; without insulin, more potassium stays in the extracellular fluid. Since this extracellular potassium is quickly excreted, even though the blood potassium levels remain high, <strong>total body potassium is depleted</strong>. Therefore, treatment of DKA relies on IV fluids to correct dehydration, IV insulin to reverse lipolysis, and aggressive potassium repletion as soon as serum potassium levels are in the normal range. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/pnqK4mA0Q8eTafBdQafLiPq_SGKsExmU/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sodium:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>An increase in extracellular glucose concentration moves water out of cells, causing dilution of extracellular sodium and a falsely low serum sodium level on lab values.

Patients with<strong>&#160;diabetic ketoacidosis</strong> are uniquely at high risk of acquiring <strong>mucormycosis</strong>, while patients with normal immune function are almost never infected. &#160;<br><br>Under the order of Mucorales, the most common genuses that cause human infection are Rhizopus and Mucor.

The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is confirmed by his hemoglobin A1c greater than 6.4%. He also has hypertension and obesity, reflective of metabolic syndrome. His laboratory studies show an elevated creatinine with a relatively normal blood urea nitrogen (ratio of BUN/Cr less than 20:1), suggesting intrinsic diabetic kidney disease. &#160;<br><br>Diabetic kidney disease (also known as<strong>&#160;diabetic nephropathy</strong>) occurs in the setting of non-enzymatic glycosylation, in which glucose covalently attaches to cell proteins and lipids. These sugar coated molecules are pro-inflammatory and can cause damage to the cell. In the kidneys, the afferent and efferent arterioles, as well as the glomerulus itself, can be damaged, which can lead to nodular glomerulosclerosis. &#160;On histology, there are characteristic <strong>Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules</strong>, which are clumps of hyaline material found in glomerular capillaries. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In the early stages of diabetic nephropathy, small amounts of albumin leak through the glomerular barrier and into the urine. Once the leak grows larger, to 300 mg/g of albumin excretion on urinalysis, studies show that taking an <strong>angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor</strong> significantly reduces the risk of death and progression to end-stage kidney disease (dialysis). ACE-inhibitors work by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Because angiotensin II causes efferent glomerular arteriole vasoconstriction, decreasing it results in efferent vasodilation. This vasodilation reduces upstream afferent arteriole pressure, which, if left unchecked, compounds the damage from hyperglycemia and leads to kidney disease progression. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/0DNzdnHKR8epKZQRxWZnRJ-1TW2Bxao5/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Afferent arteriole vasodilation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The afferent glomerular arteriole is dilated by prostacyclins and prostaglandins like PGI2 and PGE2.

The ketones in the system are then cleared through the kidneys. <strong>IV fluid is important in the correction of volume depletion</strong>, which is caused by osmotic diuresis in DKA.

In this circumstance, <strong>dextrose is added to the IV fluid</strong> while the patient remains on the insulin infusion in order to prevent hypoglycemia.<br><br>Additionally, electrolyte monitoring and management of abnormalities is an essential part of the management of DKA. In DKA, potassium shifts out of cells due to metabolic acidosis, and some potassium then leaves the body through the kidneys. In laboratory studies, the <strong>serum potassium may appear high or normal despite the overall deficiency</strong>. As insulin is infused and the acidosis is corrected, potassium shifts back into the cells and can lead to hypokalemia. Thus, it is important to monitor and provide <strong>potassium supplementation</strong> to prevent dangerous complications resulting from hypokalemia.<br><br>Laboratory studies, including electrolytes, are typically <strong>monitored every 2&#8211;4 hours</strong> during the treatment period for DKA. If the potassium level is above the reference range, no replacement is required (but monitoring should still continue). In cases where the <strong>potassium level drops below the reference range, insulin should be temporarily held</strong> until adequate replacement is achieved. <strong>Even levels within the normal range require supplementation</strong>. However, this can easily be achieved by adding potassium to the patient&#8217;s IV fluid without disrupting the continuous insulin infusion.<br><br>Once the patient&#8217;s glucose is stabilized and the high anion gap acidosis has resolved, the patient can be transitioned to subcutaneous insulin.

This clinical presentation, history, and laboratory findings of high-anion gap metabolic acidosis, positive urine ketones, and elevated glucose levels are consistent with the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis triggered by an upper respiratory tract infection. IV fluids, IV insulin, and <strong>IV potassium replacement</strong> therapy should be initiated promptly.<br><br><strong>Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)</strong> is an acute syndrome characterized by a constellation of symptoms secondary to uncontrolled hyperglycemia, high-anion gap metabolic acidosis, and increased total body ketone concentration. It presents with signs of hyperglycemia such as polyuria and polydipsia in addition to fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and potentially altered mental status. Physical examination may show signs of severe dehydration such as dry mucous membrane and decreased skin turgor, Kussmaul breathing (deep rapid labored breathing pattern), and fruity odor of the breath.<br><br>The acute management of an adult with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) begins with stabilizing the patient and promptly <strong>starting intravenous fluid resuscitation</strong>, typically with 0.9% normal saline, to correct the dehydration caused by osmotic diuresis. Then <strong>regular IV insulin administration</strong> is initiated to rectify hyperglycemia and cease ketone production, thereby reversing the metabolic acidosis. Concurrently, even with normal or high serum potassium levels, <strong>potassium replacement</strong> is mandatory if potassium levels are below 5.3 given the <strong>total body potassium deficit</strong> due to osmotic diuresis. <strong>Bicarbonate therapy</strong> is generally reserved for severe cases with pH &#8804; 6.9.

All patients should first be assessed for stability. If unstable, the airway, breathing and circulation should be stabilized. This patient has an altered mental status and is in <strong>respiratory distress</strong>, he should have immediate stabilization of his airway and breathing with <strong>endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation</strong>. In patients with HHS, intubation is recommended when the Glasgow coma score is less than 8. <br><br>Once the airway has been secured, the next step would be to obtain IV access, start IV fluid hydration and continuous vital sign monitoring. HHS and DKA may present similarly, so after stabilization of the patient, additional history should be obtained as well as laboratory testing. Both conditions occur in the setting of <strong>precipitating events</strong> which can include new-onset diabetes, infections or other acute illnesses, medication side effects, or inadequate treatment of already-diagnosed diabetes mellitus. HHS is more commonly seen in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Testing includes random blood glucose, serum osmolarity, BMP, urinalysis, hemoglobin A1C and arterial blood gas or venous blood gas.<br><br>Both conditions will have <strong>elevated blood glucose</strong>, though it is significantly more elevated in HHS (&gt;600 mg/dL), <strong>electrolyte abnormalities</strong> (hyponatremia, hypokalemia) and <strong>elevated hemoglobin A1C</strong>. In HHS, the <strong>serum osmolarity</strong> is usually elevated <strong>(&gt;320 mOsm/L)</strong> while it will likely be normal in DKA. The anion gap will be elevated in DKA and venous gas will confirm acidosis with low serum pH.<br><br>Key aspects of management for HHS or DKA include <strong>IV fluid resuscitation to correct dehydration and hyperosmolarity, electrolyte repletion and insulin for hyperglycemia</strong>. Patients should be aggressively rehydrated with isotonic fluid with electrolyte replacement. <strong>Potassium repletion</strong> should be started once the serum potassium is &lt;5.3 mEq/L. <strong>Insulin drip</strong> should not be started until serum potassium is &gt;3.3 mEq/L to avoid worsening the hypokalemia by driving potassium into the cells.

Half of this dose is usually given as a longer-acting, basal form of insulin such as glargine, or detemir which provides a steady level of insulin over a 24-hour period. The other half is divided into bolus doses of rapid-acting insulin analogs such as aspart, lispro, or glulisine given prior to meals, providing coverage for the carbohydrate content of meals (insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio) and allowing for corrections based on the premeal blood glucose level (insulin sensitivity factor). <br><br><strong>Diabetes self-management education and support</strong> is very important in the treatment of T1DM.

      "solution": "This patient has <strong>Turner syndrome</strong> and presents with an elevated hemoglobin A1C. This laboratory finding is due to elevated blood glucose levels, likely arising as a complication of growth hormone therapy used to treat short stature in patients with Turner syndrome.<br><br><strong>Growth hormone</strong> (GH) is an anabolic hormone that exerts its physiological effects via two mechanisms. First, GH binds and activates GH receptors found in various tissues (e.g., bones, muscles, adipocytes). Second, GH stimulates hepatocytes to produce <strong>insulin like growth factor-1</strong> (IGF-1), which also promotes growth and development. <br><br>Both GH and IGF-1 affect almost every tissue in the body and enhance their growth. Their most notable growth promoting effects are in the bones and cartilage. In patients whose growth plates are not yet fused, GH therapy leads to <strong>enhanced growth velocity and final height</strong>.<br><br>In addition to promoting growth, GH plays a major role in affecting peripheral tissue metabolism. These effects are mainly mediated by IGF-1 and include increased protein synthesis, increased amino acid uptake, decreased protein catabolism, and increased fat metabolism. GH also <strong>decreases insulin sensitivity</strong> in peripheral tissues and <strong>promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis</strong>, thereby resulting in hyperglycemia.<br><br>Recombinant human GH (HGH) is indicated in the treatment of short stature in Turner syndrome. Moreover, it is used in patients with growth hormone deficiency, Prader-Willi syndrome, idiopathic short stature, and children with chronic kidney failure.<br><br>Adverse effects are mainly due to the increased metabolism and growth.

Symptoms of persistent hyperglycemia include <strong>polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia,&#160;</strong>and <strong>weight loss.</strong> Clinical signs may progress rapidly to DKA, and patients may have vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, weakness, and lethargy. Associated dehydration can cause tachycardia, delayed capillary refill time, poor skin turgor, and dry mucus membranes. <strong>Kussmaul respirations,</strong> as seen in this patient, refers to a deep, rapid pattern of breathing. In addition, ketoacidosis may result in a <strong>fruity odor&#160;</strong>to the breath. &#160; &#160; <br><br>The most serious complication of DKA is <strong>severe neurologic injury</strong> and development of cerebral edema. Warning signs include&#160;headache, bradycardia, irritability,&#160;altered mental status, unresponsiveness, and coma. Laboratory values necessary for diagnosing DKA are <strong>hyperglycemia&#160;</strong>with a blood glucose level &gt;200 mg/dL, <strong>venous pH &lt; 7.3</strong> or <strong>serum bicarbonate level &lt; 15 mEq/L, ketonemia</strong> (blood b-hydroxybutyrate concentration &#8805;3 mmol/L), and ketonuria.&#160; &#160; <br><br>In the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis, an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong>&#160;should be performed. If the patient is unstable, the first step is to stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation. In patients with&#160;<strong>signs of dehydration,</strong> as seen in this patient,<strong>&#160;intravenous fluid</strong> administration is the first step to correct dehydration, acidosis, and reverse ketosis. Fluid replacement should begin before starting intravenous insulin therapy. Electrolyte repletion and monitoring <strong>sodium </strong>and <strong>potassium </strong>levels, along with monitoring urine output and neurological status is essential. Once the patient is stabilized, continuous vital sign monitoring and oxygen as needed can be provided. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Intravenous&#160;isotonic saline&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See&#160;Main&#160;Explanation.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intravenous&#160;sodium bicarbonate&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Sodium bicarbonate administration is not recommended in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis&#160;</span><span>(DKA)&#160;</span><span>and&#160;</span><span>has not shown benefit in the resolution of DKA</span><span>.

Bilateral adrenalectomy can be performed to treat Cushing syndrome in patients who have failed more conservative treatment options. &#160;<br><br>&#160;The pathophysiology of Nelson syndrome is not fully understood. However, one proposed mechanism is that after the bilateral adrenal glands are excised, there is <strong>removal of negative-feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary</strong>, since endogenous cortisol is no longer being synthesized. This results in increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus. The elevated CRH subsequently increases ACTH production by the pituitary gland. Overtime, the result is pituitary enlargement. In addition, since ACTH and melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) are derived from the same precursor molecule, increased ACTH production would also lead to increased MSH production. &#160;<br><br>The enlarged pituitary can compress nearby nerves and cause <strong>headaches</strong>. Moreover, the enlarged pituitary can compress the optic chiasm and cause <strong>bitemporal hemianopsia</strong>. Patients can also have<strong>&#160;skin hyperpigmentation</strong> secondary to the increased MSH production. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Surgical resection&#160;</strong>of the pituitary is the first-line treatment of Nelson syndrome.

During the first trimester, when organogenesis is taking place, and the fetus is susceptible to drug-induced damage, PTU is preferred. The rationale is that PTU is less likely to cross the placenta due to its extensive plasma protein binding. On the other hand, methimazole is contraindicated during the first trimester because it is associated with <strong>aplasia cutis</strong>, a condition characterized by the absence of portions of skin.

It typically occurs in patients with <strong>longstanding untreated </strong>or <strong>under-treated hypothyroidism</strong>. It can also occur after a <strong>precipitating event</strong> (such as infection, extreme cold, certain medications, or another major stressor such as trauma or surgery) that occurs in a patient with poorly controlled hypothyroidism. &#160;Prompt treatment is critical as the condition has a high mortality rate. Empiric coverage with antibiotics is often indicated as well until infection can be fully ruled out. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Administration of glucocorticoids:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administration of methimazole:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient has severe hypothyroidism.
