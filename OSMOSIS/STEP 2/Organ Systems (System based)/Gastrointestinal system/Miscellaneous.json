      "solution": "This young adult, who presents with complaints of postprandial right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and laboratory results showing anemia and elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), likely has <strong>black pigment gallstone formation&#160;</strong>secondary to <strong>hereditary spherocytosis&#160;</strong>(HS). &#160; <br><br><strong>Black pigment gallstones&#160;</strong>form when the bile contains a high concentration of unconjugated bilirubin in the bilirubin tree, such as in patients with <strong>chronic extravascular red cell hemolysis.&#160;</strong>This can be seen in patients with sickle cell disease or hereditary spherocytosis. Brown pigment stones, on the other hand, can precipitate when the biliary tract is infected by certain microbes (e.g., E. coli, Clonorchis sinensis) that produce &#946;-glucuronidase, an enzyme that unconjugates previously conjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin is water insoluble and combines with calcium to form brown pigment stones. &#160;<br><br>However, the most common gallstones are cholesterol stones. Bile formation is the only significant pathway for the body to eliminate excess cholesterol, either as free cholesterol or as bile salts. Cholesterol becomes water-soluble when combined with bile salts; therefore, when cholesterol concentrations exceed the solubility capacity of bile salts (supersaturation), cholesterol stones can form. Conditions that<strong>&#160;increase cholesterol synthesis&#160;</strong>(e.g. obesity) or <strong>decrease bile salt formation</strong> (e.g., malabsorptive conditions, medications such as fibrates) predispose individuals to forming gallstones. Additionally, <strong>hypomotility&#160;</strong>of the gallbladder results in bile stasis, which also promotes gallstone formation (e.g., pregnant women, patients on total parenteral nutrition). This patient did not have risk factors for cholesterol stones. Instead, his physical exam and laboratory values suggested a risk for pigment stones. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/c5N79V-YSg6dcJ9D0E3jFg8kQZGfS8G_/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Acalculous cholecystitis is an acute inflammatory disorder of the gallbladder that is most commonly seen in conditions that cause biliary stasis, such as in critically ill patients (e.g., multiorgan failure, post-surgery, trauma) or those on prolonged total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

In patients with chronic hemolytic anemias (e.g., sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis), the excess unconjugated bilirubin from the lysed red blood cells results in increased liver uptake and conjugation of bilirubin, ultimately leading to the precipitation of bilirubin into <strong>black pigment gallstones.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Acute cholecystitis is an acute inflammation of the gallbladder caused by obstruction of the cystic duct. When the <strong>cystic duct becomes obstructed</strong> by a stone, there is distension and inflammation of the gallbladder, triggering an inflammatory response within the gallbladder. Clinical features typically <strong>include intense RUQ pain, fever,&#160;</strong>and <strong>nausea.</strong> Additionally, this patient demonstrated a<strong>&#160;positive Murphy sign</strong> (sudden inspiratory pause upon palpation of the RUQ).

Cholesterol gallstones form when there is an increase in cholesterol concentration or decrease in bile salt concentration of the bile; this ultimately leads to precipitation of cholesterol in the form of gallstones, also known as cholelithiasis. &#160; <br><br>Most gallstones are asymptomatic and are often found incidentally on abdominal imaging (e.g. ultrasound for other purposes). When symptomatic, the main presenting symptom is biliary colic, which occurs when the <strong>stone blocks the cystic duct.</strong> This causes pressure in the gallbladder to increase as it tries to contract, leading to pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium that radiates to the right shoulder (due to referred pain from diaphragmatic irritation). The pain often occurs after eating a large or fatty meal and lasts for 1-5 hours before subsiding as the gallbladder relaxes. &#160;<br><br>If gallstones are suspected based on the symptoms and history of the patient, confirmation of the diagnosis can be done with a <strong>right upper quadrant ultrasound</strong>. Ultrasounds are the gold standard study for diagnosing gallstones since they are quick, noninvasive, inexpensive and sensitive enough to detect even tiny stones, and they can additionally detect the dilation of the gallbladder and bile duct.

      "solution": "This patient has epigastric pain radiating to the back, an elevated lipase level, and likely history of gallstones. These findings are suggestive of <strong>gallstone pancreatitis</strong>. Gallstone disease is the most common cause of acute pancreatitis in the Western world. The condition arises when a gallstone enters the common bile duct and <strong>obstructs outflow</strong> from the pancreatic duct. As a result, pancreatic enzymes cannot be excreted, and they instead begin to autodigest the organ&#8217;s parenchyma, resulting in inflammation and, if severe, necrosis. Patients can present with epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea/vomiting, and skin findings such as Cullen sign (periumbilical ecchymosis) or Grey Turner sign (flank ecchymosis). &#160;<br><br>The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis can be made if the patient has: 1) acute<strong>&#160;upper abdominal pain&#160;</strong>radiating to the back; 2) amylase or lipase levels <strong>three-times the upper limit of normal</strong>; and 3) the presence of <strong>gallstones on imaging</strong>. In addition, patients may have elevated liver transaminase and bilirubin levels secondary to biliary tract obstruction and bile backflow. &#160;<br><br>In regards to imaging, the first step is to visualize the gallstones using a<strong>&#160;right upper quadrant</strong> (RUQ) <strong>ultrasound</strong>, which is inexpensive, sensitive, and widely available.

Additionally, the abdominal CT imaging revealed a <strong>perforated gallbladder</strong>, making this a<strong>&#160;surgical emergency. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Acute cholecystitis is an acute inflammation of the gallbladder caused by obstruction of the cystic duct.

In patients with uncomplicated and mild cases of acute cholecystitis, treatment consists of intravenous fluid therapy and <strong>empiric intravenous antibiotics</strong> (e.g., ceftriaxone with metronidazole, piperacillin-tazobactam).

The cause is <strong>gallbladder hypomotility</strong> and <strong>bile stasis</strong> which concentrates the bile, making it toxic to the gallbladder walls, eventually leading to inflammation and necrosis. This patient has been on prolonged therapy with TPN, causing bile stasis, which is the likely cause of her acalculous cholecystitis. &#160; <br><br>Clinical features typically include <strong>intense RUQ pain, fever, and nausea.&#160;</strong>Additionally, this patient demonstrated a <strong>positive sonographic Murphy sign</strong> (sudden inspiratory pause upon placing the ultrasound probe on the gallbladder).

Mild elevations in the serum total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and liver enzymes can also be seen in patients with acalculous cholecystitis. &#160;<br><br>The best initial step for diagnosing acute acalculous cholecystitis is an <strong>ultrasound of the right upper quadrant.&#160;</strong>If there are no stones visualized on an ultrasound, or if the diagnosis is uncertain, a <strong>CT scan</strong> or <strong>HIDA scan</strong> would be the next appropriate step. Since HIDA scans take longer, it should only be considered in hemodynamically stable patients. For a HIDA scan, a radioactive tracer is injected into a vein, which then enters the bile-producing cells in the liver that will secrete the tracer into bile. The bile carries the tracer through the entire hepatobiliary system and allows visualization; therefore, in acute cholecystitis, the tracer will not fill the gallbladder, indicating a positive test. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ascending infection of the biliary tract:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This describes acute cholangitis, which is characterized by inflammation of the biliary ducts.

Pain from biliary colic is often associated with fatty food intake, nausea, and vomiting. Biliary colic is typically caused by the gallbladder contracting and forcing a <strong>gallstone or sludge</strong> against the gallbladder outlet or cystic duct opening. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Complications of gallstones</strong> include <strong>cholecystitis</strong> which is right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis from gallbladder inflammation secondary to gallstones. Another complication of gallstones is <strong>choledocholithiasis</strong> which is the presence of a <strong>gallstone in the common bile duct</strong>. This can be further complicated by <strong>acute cholangitis</strong> which presents with fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice caused by infection from biliary obstruction. This patient has evidence of right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, fever, leukocytosis, and hyperbilirubinemia suggesting <strong>acute cholangitis</strong>. The combination of <strong>fever</strong>, <strong>abdominal pain</strong>, and <strong>jaundice</strong> is known as <strong>Charcot&#8217;s triad</strong>, which is highly suggestive of acute cholangitis. &#160; <br><br>Patients with biliary colic should have lab work including a CBC to assess for leukocytosis and a CMP, and liver function tests. The initial imaging for <strong>biliary colic</strong> is typically <strong>abdominal ultrasound</strong> to look for gallstones. For patients with obesity or other anatomic considerations endoscopic ultrasound can be used. &#160;<br><br><strong>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</strong>, with or without an initial ultrasound, should be performed in patients with suspected <strong>acute cholangitis</strong> since it can be used to both <strong>diagnose and treat</strong> the underlying obstruction via <strong>biliary duct decompression and removal of stones</strong>.

Currently, only two types of interferons are available for clinical use: IFN&#945;2A and IFN&#945;2B.<br><br>The selective antiviral action of IFN-&#945; is primarily due to its ability to <strong>activate host cell ribonucleases</strong> that preferentially <strong>degrade viral mRNA</strong>. IFN-&#945; also promotes the formation of natural killer cells that destroy liver cells infected by HCV. It is usually given either as an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Sometimes INFs can be provided in pegylated IFN (i.e. IFN plus polyethylene glycol).<br><br>IFNs are used in the treatment of both <strong>chronic HBV and HCV infections</strong>. When treating HCV infection, IFNs are used either as monotherapy or in combination with other antiviral medications such as ribavirin.
