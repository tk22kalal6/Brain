      "text": "A 76-year-old man with a history of stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer presents to the emergency department for evaluation of pain and swelling of his right leg for the past two days. The patient decided to come in today when he became short of breath and lightheaded with exertion. Temperature is 37 &#176;C (98.6 &#176;F), blood pressure is 115/85 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, respiratory rate is 24/min, and oxygen saturation is 84% on room air. Pitting edema and erythema are noted from just below the right knee to the right foot. There is localized tenderness overlying the posterior tibial vein. Examination of the left leg is unremarkable. Lung sounds are clear on auscultation. Which of the following is the best next step in management? &#160;",

      "solution": "The patient&#8217;s right leg swelling, erythema, pitting edema, and tenderness over the posterior tibial vein are concerning for a <strong>deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</strong>. The patient is experiencing shortness of breath and hypoxia, which should raise concern for a <strong>pulmonary embolism (PE)</strong>.<br><br>Evaluating and managing the patient&#8217;s <strong>airway</strong>, <strong>breathing</strong>, and <strong>circulation should be done first</strong>. This patient&#8217;s tachypnea and hypoxia indicate respiratory distress, and he should receive <strong>supplemental oxygen to raise his oxygen saturation to above 92%</strong>. Additional stabilizing measures include <strong>obtaining IV access and continuous monitoring</strong> of his heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.<br><br>Once the patient is stabilized, a work-up should be initiated including an ECG, basic labs (such as a CBC, chemistries, and coagulation studies), and an evaluation of his <strong>pretest probability for DVT and PE using Wells criteria</strong>. This will help assess the patient&#8217;s risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), with a modified (or simplified) score classifying VTE as &#8220;likely&#8221; or &#8220;unlikely.&#8221; <br><br>For those in the &#8220;unlikely&#8221; category, d-dimer testing is the next step, where a negative test (&lt; 500 ng/mL) rules out VTE. A positive test means that VTE cannot be ruled out, and patients should receive an ultrasonography of the affected limb to assess for DVT or CT pulmonary angiography for PE. In contrast, patients in the &#8220;likely&#8221; category should proceed directly to imaging for confirmation of the diagnosis. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Order ECG:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s history and examination are concerning for a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
