Patients with brisk gastrointestinal bleeding can decompensate quickly and should be closely monitored for signs of <strong>hemorrhagic shock</strong>, such as tachycardia, hypotension, delayed capillary refill, and cool extremities. Placing a <strong>nasogastric tube</strong> with or without nasogastric lavage as needed should be considered.

This patient is <strong>hemodynamically stable</strong>, though dehydrated with dry mucous membranes. The use of <strong>macrolide antibiotics</strong> is associated with <strong>increased risk of developing pyloric stenosis</strong>, particularly when these antibiotics are administered to infants younger than two weeks of age.<br><br><strong>Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS)&#160;</strong>refers to a disorder of young infants caused by hypertrophy of the pylorus, which can progress to near-complete obstruction of the gastric outlet and forceful vomiting. IHPS usually develops in patients between three and five weeks of age and rarely occurs after 12 weeks. It is more common among boys than girls. The <strong>vomiting&#160;</strong>is nonbilious and <strong>forceful (\"projectile\")</strong> (or may become more forceful over time), with associated weight loss if symptoms progress. While an \"olive-like\" mass may be palpated in the epigastric region or right upper quadrant, more often patients do not have this finding, especially if the diagnosis is made early. <br><br>Several risk factors are associated with IHPS including <strong>maternal smoking</strong> during pregnancy and <strong>bottle feeding</strong>. There is also a <strong>genetic component</strong> to IHPS, as approximately 6% of siblings of an affected patient develop IHPS. Patients who are firstborn have a higher risk of IHPS than those born later in the birth order. IHPS can also be associated with several other conditions, including hyperbilirubinemia, esophageal atresia, malrotation, and hypoplastic frenulum, so careful history should be obtained to rule out associated diagnoses. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Rotavirus vaccination:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: &#160;Rotavirus vaccination is typically associated with an expansion of Peyer&#8217;s patches within the terminal ileum</span><span>, which&#160;</span><span>can&#160;</span><span>create</span><span>&#160;a lead point for intussusception</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>Patients with i</span><span>ntussusception typically&#160;</span><span>exhibit</span><span>&#160;periods of intense abdominal pain&#160;</span><span>followed</span><span>&#160;by</span><span>&#160;&#8220;red currant jelly&#8221; stools</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Exclusively breastfeeding:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: This patient&#8217;s presentation is consistent with pyloric&#160;</span><span>stenosis</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Bottle feeding, unlike breastfeeding, is associated with an increased risk for pyloric stenosis.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>One study showed that</span><span>&#160;bottle feeding during the first four months of life was associated with a more than fourfold increase in&#160;</span><span>the&#160;</span><span>risk&#160;</span><span>of</span><span>&#160;</span><span>developing</span><span>&#160;pyloric stenosis.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Macrolide antibiotic use:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Second born child in the family birth order:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: Being firstborn, not&#160;</span><span>second born</span><span>, has been associated with&#160;</span><span>an increased risk of&#160;</span><span>developing&#160;</span><span>pyloric stenosis.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Full-term at birth:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>Preterm birth increases the risk of pyloric stenosis.&#160;</span><span>Full-term birth&#160;</span><span>generally confers</span><span>&#160;an&#160;</span><span>advantage due</span><span>&#160;to the ability to fully develop organ systems&#160;</span><span>before</span><span>&#160;birth.</span>&#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "This patient is presenting with symptoms of <strong>constipation</strong>, including difficulty <strong>passing stools</strong> and <strong>infrequent passing of stool</strong>. When evaluating a patient with new onset constipation, it is important to ask about the <strong>ability to pass gas</strong> since <strong>obstipation&#160;</strong>(inability to pass stool and gas) can be a sign of <strong>bowel obstruction</strong>, which may require supportive care and surgery. <br><br>Constipation occurs when stool is <strong>unable to move through the bowel</strong> properly and/or the <strong>pelvic muscles</strong> or <strong>anal sphincter</strong> are unable to facilitate adequate emptying. This may lead to <strong>straining with defecation, infrequent bowel movements</strong>, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and needing to use manual maneuvers to defecate. <strong>Hard stools</strong> are a common feature of constipation and the <strong>Bristol stool chart</strong> can be used to help patients describe their stool objectively based on shape and texture. Abdominal discomfort and bloating may be present. Having <strong>less than three bowel movements per week</strong> is also suggestive of constipation, although not required for diagnosis.<br><br>Physical examination in patients presenting with constipation should include visual inspection of the anal area and a <strong>digital rectal exam</strong> (DRE). Common findings on DRE are a <strong>palpable stool ball&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;fecal impaction</strong>. Patients should be asked to &#8220;bear down&#8221; or strain as if trying to have a bowel movement during the exam to allow for assessment of <strong>sphincter tone</strong> and the <strong>strength of surrounding musculature</strong>. Abnormalities of the sphincter or musculature may suggest an underlying neurologic etiology. Finally, patients should be assessed for <strong>anal fissures</strong>, <strong>hemorrhoids</strong>, <strong>masses</strong>, <strong>tenderness</strong>, or <strong>strictures&#160;</strong>during the DRE and visual exam. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/E_mirXmpRD2XtEwfuo3CsP-ATRKNUpOf/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hard stools:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hard stools are common in constipation and would not indicate bowel obstruction. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Use of manual maneuvers to help move stool out of the rectum:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Needing to use manual maneuvers for stool evacuation is common in constipation; however, it would not be suggestive of a bowel obstruction. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Ability to pass gas:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Feeling of incomplete evacuation after bowel movements:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A feeling of incomplete emptying is common in constipation and would not indicate a large bowel obstruction. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Date of last colonoscopy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Colonoscopy history may help in making the differential diagnosis and evaluating constipation, but it would not help determine if a bowel obstruction is present. &#160;</span></div>",

IBS is defined as a chronic bowel condition that requires at least three-months of symptoms and is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or both). Initial management of patients with mild to moderate IBS is with lifestyle and dietary <strong>modifications</strong>, which include <strong>increasing soluble fiber intake, eating a low carbohydrate diet</strong>, and increasing physical activity.<br><br>Certain high carbohydrate foods, such as potatoes, brown rice, oats, and almonds, should be avoided. Additionally <strong>FODMAPs</strong> (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) can be limited or avoided. <br><br>If initial management of IBS with dietary modifications is unsuccessful or in patients with severe symptoms, pharmacologic agents can be prescribed based on the <strong>subtype&#160;</strong>and the <strong>predominant symptoms</strong> as detailed in the table below. The treatment goal for IBS-D is to <strong>increase stool firmness&#160;</strong>and <strong>decrease bowel movement frequency</strong>.

      "solution": "Laxatives are substances that ease the passage of fecal matter from the rectum, while cathartics have a much stronger effect and cause the evacuation of stool from the entire colon. Cathartics such as sorbitol, magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, sodium phosphate, or sodium sulfate cause an osmotic imbalance which draws water into the large bowel lumen. Cathartics are often used as bowel prep agents for colonoscopy or surgical prep. Others, like polyethylene glycol (not to be confused with ethylene glycol, in antifreeze), can be used for daily maintenance or to help facilitate the disimpaction of bowel contents in severely constipated patients. Overuse of some cathartics can cause severe dehydration and acute kidney injury (as some magnesium is reabsorbed). In the case of this frail 75-year-old patient on hospice care, a cathartic would be inappropriate due to the increased risk of dehydration. In addition, a stimulating agent would be more appropriate since his stools are not hard or difficult to pass. <br><br>Senna is a stimulant laxative which is often prescribed with docusate, an emollient laxative. Stimulant laxatives act by directly stimulating the intestinal mucosa and producing peristalsis. Emollient laxatives act as a surfactant by decreasing the surface tension of water, allowing water to soften stool. Senna/docusate is typically prescribed as a combination when initiating opioid therapy in order to prevent opioid-induced constipation. However, the effectiveness of docusate is being called into question more and more, and senna alone may be equally effective. First-line therapy for most causes of constipation includes patient education, exercise, dietary modification, and a bulking laxative such as psyllium (see table below).<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/pjcuPn79RlWTy3KULitb4vrqTQ_i_EVD/_.png\"></div><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/rPO9HkyZQvCsgXLKWbpzSVvQQtqycHSQ/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Magnesium citrate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Laxatives are substances that ease the passage of fecal matter from the rectum, while cathartics have a much stronger effect and cause the evacuation of stool from the entire colon.

Approximately 40-60% of non-cancer patients who use opioids develop opioid-induced constipation (OIC). While reducing opioids will eventually reduce constipation, it is not appropriate to withhold pain medication for patients with proper indications (such as hospice care). A faster and more appropriate therapy typically involves starting the use of a stimulant laxative (such as senna) with or without a stool softener (such as docusate) when opioids are first administered to prevent OIC (1,2). &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Senna:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Glycerin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Glycerin is an emollient laxative.

Both iron supplements and pregnancy itself can be associated with constipation. Because there is an underlying cause of the constipation, it would be considered <strong>secondary constipation</strong>.<br><br>The first step in evaluating a patient with constipation is to assess for red flag features. <strong>Red flags</strong> in constipation are features that raise concern for a <strong>serious underlying condition</strong> (such as <strong>malignancy</strong>, <strong>obstruction</strong>, <strong>inflammatory bowel disease</strong>, or other acute processes) and should lead to further workup rather than an initial trial of empiric therapy. Some important red flags to consider are <strong>hematochezia</strong>, <strong>unintentional weight loss</strong>, a family history of colon cancer, acute onset of constipation in an older adult, a <strong>change in stool caliber</strong>, or identification of a rectal mass. Signs suggesting malignancy should lead to a prompt endoscopic exam with <strong>colonoscopy&#160;</strong>or flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy of any suspicious lesions. <br><br><strong>Secondary constipation</strong> can be diagnosed whenever there is an <strong>identifiable secondary cause</strong> for the condition. <strong>Certain medications</strong>, including <strong>iron supplements</strong>, <strong>opiates</strong>, and <strong>antihypertensives</strong>, are known causes of constipation. Endocrine and metabolic disorders can also predispose patients to constipation, including diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and <strong>pregnancy</strong>. Pregnancy leads to physiologic and anatomic changes in the gastrointestinal tract that increase the likelihood of constipation. Neurological conditions, such as spinal cord injury, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and multiple sclerosis, are additional causes of secondary constipation. Finally, diseases of the colon, including <strong>malignancy </strong>and <strong>inflammatory bowel disease</strong>, as well as diseases of the anorectal area, such as <strong>anal fissures</strong>, <strong>proctitis</strong>, and <strong>strictures</strong>, can lead to constipation.<br><br>When there are no identifiable secondary causes, it is considered <strong>primary constipation</strong>, which can be due to an identified <strong>intrinsic problem</strong> of the stool evacuation process (like <strong>slow transit</strong>) or no <strong>specific underlying cause</strong> may be found. When red flags are not present and no underlying secondary cause is identified, it is reasonable to initiate a trial of <strong>empiric treatment</strong>. Recommended interventions are <strong>lifestyle modifications</strong>, including <strong>increasing physical activity</strong>, <strong>water intake</strong>, and dietary sources of <strong>fiber</strong>. The addition of over-the-counter <strong>fiber supplements</strong> and <strong>laxatives </strong>is also a reasonable first step in treatment. When the constipation resolves with empiric treatment and no specific underlying cause or red flag is found, typically no further workup is needed. However, specific diagnostic testing should be done to further characterize the constipation as <strong>normal transit constipation</strong>, <strong>slow transit constipation</strong>, or <strong>dyssynergic defecation/outlet constipation</strong> when there is inadequate response to initial interventions. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Primary constipation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Primary constipation is considered when there is no secondary cause of constipation like a medical condition or medication.

If no alarm features are present, then the diagnosis can be made using the <strong>Rome IV Criteria for IBS</strong>. Patients meet criteria if they have experienced <strong>recurrent abdominal pain</strong> at least one day per week in the last three months with two or more of the following: abdominal pain that is related to defecation, a change in the frequency of stool, or a change in the appearance of the stool.<br><br>The cause of IBS is unknown but could be related to changes in the normal <strong>gut microbiota, autonomic dysfunction, altered motility</strong> of the gastrointestinal tract, or <strong>psychological factors</strong>. IBS can be categorized as diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), constipation-predominant (IBS-C), or mixed (IBS-M). <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-V3cJsERTbSKSgBGrFq83eqeTZmtPc7k/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Irritable bowel syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ulcerative colitis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Ulcerative colitis typically presents with chronic diarrhea (+/- blood), colicky abdominal pain, urgency, tenesmus, and incontinence.

Crohn disease can affect any part of the GI tract (from the <strong>mouth to the anus</strong>) and is characterized by<strong> transmural skip lesions</strong> which can lead to abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever. It can be categorized as mild to moderate, moderate to severe, or severe. Management is based on the severity of disease. When evaluating a patient with suspected Crohn disease, physicians should first perform an ABCrohn diseaseE assessment (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) to determine if the patient is <strong>stable or unstable.</strong> &#160; <br><br>Patients with severe Crohn disease might present with signs of <strong>shock </strong>like tachycardia and refractory hypotension. Because of the high mortality risk in these individuals, it is essential to hospitalize them, obtain intravenous access, and start them on <strong>IV fluids</strong>. Once they are stable, look for the cause of their instability, such as small bowel obstruction or sepsis from an abscess. &#160; <br><br>Patients with Crohn disease who develop an acute <strong>small bowel obstruction</strong> (SBO) typically have symptoms of nausea, vomiting, cramping, abdominal pain, and inability to pass flatus or stool (this is called obstipation).

As the metabolic breakdown products of these laxatives pass through the colon, they become active and cause cell death and apoptosis in the lining of the colon, causing lipofuscin deposition (not melanin as the name might imply) and eventually dark pigmentation of the colon. Melanosis coli is not associated with an increased risk of colon cancer and resolves with the discontinuation of laxatives.<br><br>Stimulant laxatives act by causing direct inflammation of the colon, which in turn causes the colon to reflexively undergo peristalsis.

      "solution": "A significant percentage of women experience constipation during pregnancy. Docusate is an emollient stool softener. The molecular structure of stool softeners includes a hydrophilic polar end and a hydrophobic non-polar end. This allows docusate to facilitate dishesion of fatty stool and allow for water penetration, making the stool softer. Other examples of emollient stool softeners include glycerin and mineral oil. Docusate does not have adverse effects in pregnancy and is therefore generally considered to be safe. While very safe and well-tolerated, it is important to note, however, that in recent years the effectiveness of docusate has been called into question more and more. A side effect of all long-term emollient stool softener use is intermittent diarrhea. Docusate is often used in combination formulations with senna to treat opioid-induced constipation.

      "solution": "This patient has a chief complaint of infrequent bowel movements. While there are defined criteria for defining constipation, such as the Rome III criteria and the Bristol stool scale, they are more often used in medical research than in clinical diagnosis. Typically, clinical constipation is defined as having fewer than 3 bowel movements per week. <br><br>This patient experiences pain while defecating and notices blood while wiping. These symptoms are characteristic of anal fissures. With prolonged constipation and subsequent hardening of stool, anal fissures can develop with forceful straining and anal distention. These fissures cause pain while defecating and deter efforts to have a bowel movement. Voluntary withholding then worsens constipation, and a cyclical pattern develops. Voluntary withholding (due to pain or other biopsychosocial causes) is a major cause of constipation in children. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Recently starting primary school:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Functional constipation (constipation arising from an unknown etiology) is common in children and has been associated with several biopsychosocial risk factors.

Rather than developing constipation, overweight and obese adolescents may be more likely to have fecal incontinence. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lack of exercise:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: There is a long-held belief that bowel frequency increases in proportion to increased exercise; however, these findings are not evidence-based. Physical exercise has been shown to dramatically increase physical fitness; however, no consistent effect on large bowel function has been found. Therefore, while this patient should partake in more daily exercise, it should not have an impact on his recent symptoms of constipation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diabetes mellitus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Constipation is reported in nearly 60% of adults with diabetes mellitus. The cause of constipation remains poorly understood and likely involves long-term autonomic and enteric neuropathy. Patients with diabetes frequently suffer from enteropathic diarrhea and bloating due to the same pathophysiology. The child in this vignette has neither been diagnosed with diabetes nor does he present with any classical symptoms of diabetes such as polyuria, polydipsia, polyphasia or fatigue.

Functional constipation in children is best <strong>managed&#160;</strong>with <strong>oral laxative therapy, behavioral modification, dietary changes,&#160;</strong>and <strong>disimpaction</strong> with rectal medications when necessary. Behavioral modification should be started after the oral laxative treatment has begun.

      "solution": "In this patient who presents to the emergency department with <strong>fever, feeding intolerance, recent bloody bowel movements, </strong>and <strong>dilated loops of bowel</strong> on abdominal x-ray, the most likely diagnosis is <strong>necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)</strong>. Medical management is appropriate initial management for patients without signs of peritonitis or perforation who appear to be clinically stable. However, if patients <strong>clinically deteriorate despite medical management</strong>, then <strong>surgery </strong>is indicated.<br><br>For patients with NEC, <strong>surgical intervention</strong> is necessary if there is <strong>evidence of perforation</strong> (i.e., pneumoperitoneum on abdominal imaging) or if the patient continues to <strong>deteriorate clinically despite optimal medical management</strong>. The goals of surgical intervention are to <strong>remove the unviable necrotic intestine</strong> and <strong>control enteric spillage</strong> while maximizing the length of the viable intestine. Surgical procedures for treatment of NEC include <strong>exploratory laparotomy with resection</strong> of the affected intestinal region or <strong>primary peritoneal drainage (PPD)</strong>.<br><br><strong>Laparotomy </strong>involves resection of the affected bowel segment, and placement of a proximal enterostomy (usually an ileostomy) and distal mucous fistula. It usually requires transport to the <strong>operating room and general anesthesia</strong>. <strong>PPD</strong> is performed at the <strong>bedside </strong>in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The primary purpose of this procedure is to provide <strong>pressure relief</strong> with evacuation of air, stool, and contaminated ascites, as well as allowing viable bowel to recover before resection of nonviable bowel.<br><br>Overall, the decision and timing of surgical intervention in neonates with NEC requires <strong>considerable judgment</strong>. Consultation with a pediatric surgeon should be requested at the time the diagnosis of NEC is suspected or confirmed. The decision for surgical intervention is made collaboratively by a multidisciplinary team, including the neonatology team, surgeon, and other care providers. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Persistent thrombocytopenia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Persistent thrombocytopenia is a surrogate for ongoing inflammation and should be managed with platelet transfusions as necessary.

      "solution": "Patients with <strong>upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding</strong> may present with hematemesis and melena, or bright red blood per rectum with brisk upper GI bleeds. Melenic (not &#8220;melanotic&#8221;) stools are black tar-like stools that do not resemble regular bowel movements and indicate a significant upper GI bleed. In patients with a suspected upper GI bleed who are stable, history and physical examination will guide further testing and treatment. In most cases, <strong>upper endoscopy (EGD)</strong> must be performed for <strong>diagnostic and therapeutic purposes</strong>. Thus, it is important to know the EGD findings associated with the various causes of upper GI bleeding and the recent and past history and associated signs and symptoms with each cause of upper GI bleed.<br><br>Patients with <strong>gastritis, duodenitis, or peptic ulcer disease</strong> often present with abdominal pain (frequently related temporally to eating) and dyspepsia (discomfort along with belching, bloating, or other symptoms), and anemia. In the case of gastritis or duodenitis, EGD may show <strong>erythematous mucosa with nodularity and diffuse oozing</strong>. Patients with retrosternal pain and reflux symptoms, especially if there is a history of food impaction, may have <strong>esophagitis </strong>which can appear on EGD as <strong>erythema, stenosis, ulceration, and &#160;mucosal erosions</strong>. <strong>Mallory-Weiss tears</strong> occur after prolonged retching and vomiting and will be evidenced by a <strong>gastroesophageal junction tear</strong> on EGD. <strong>Arteriovenous malformations</strong> appear on EGD as <strong>small ectatic vessels and cherry red nodules</strong>.<br><br>Based on the physical exam findings and elevated INR, this patient &#160;likely has cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis can have GI bleeding from any of the above sources, but they can also develop <strong>esophageal </strong>and <strong>gastric varices</strong>. These can be visualized on EGD. A varix is a <strong>dilated submucosal vein</strong> caused by <strong>increased portal system pressures</strong>. They most frequently appear on EGD as <strong>serpiginous or oval structures covered by normal mucosa</strong>.

      "solution": "This patient&#8217;s history and examination demonstrating abdominal pain and distention, nausea, vomiting, obstipation, tympany to percussion, and high-pitched bowel sounds are concerning for a <strong>small bowel obstruction (SBO)</strong>. SBO occurs when a blockage in the small bowel prevents the passage of intraluminal contents (e.g., gas, chyme), which results in distention of the bowel proximal to the obstruction. This condition manifests as pain, abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting. SBO is often mechanical (physical), and secondary to adhesions or tumors.<br><br>Imaging can aid in the diagnosis and identify the underlying etiology of mechanical obstruction. An abdominal X-ray is typically the first step, which may demonstrate <strong>distended small bowel loops and air-fluid levels</strong>. It can also evaluate for signs of <strong>perforation</strong>, such as <strong>pneumoperitoneum</strong>. An abdominal CT can provide additional information, such as the identification of a <strong>transition point (where the bowel is distended to the point of obstruction but collapsed beyond it)</strong>. Conservative management is often appropriate for these cases of SBO.<br><br><strong>Two or more transition points</strong>, as seen on this patient&#8217;s CT, indicate a <strong>closed-loop obstruction</strong>, which may be due to <strong>adhesions, hernias, or volvulus</strong>. Closed-loop obstructions are unlikely to resolve with supportive care and are at risk for progression to bowel ischemia and perforation. These patients <strong>require surgical intervention</strong>.<br><br>Other CT findings that indicate the need for surgical intervention include evidence of <strong>bowel ischemia (e.g., pneumatosis, portal venous gas), small bowel tumors, gallstone ileus, an ingested foreign body, and intussusception</strong>. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Volvulus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Gallstone ileus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s history and examination are concerning for a small bowel obstruction.
