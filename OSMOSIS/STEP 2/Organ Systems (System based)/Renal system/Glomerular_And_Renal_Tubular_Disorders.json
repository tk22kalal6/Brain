It is approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence and has been shown to be effective at helping patients reduce drinking to safer levels or achieving abstinence altogether. For patients like the one described, who have struggled to reduce their alcohol intake through non-pharmacological means alone, naltrexone offers pharmacological support that can make the process of cutting back more manageable. The effects of naltrexone on treating moderate AUD are enhanced when&#160;<strong>combined with counseling or behavioral interventions</strong>, such as motivational interviewing or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). These therapies can provide patients with strategies to cope with situations that may trigger alcohol use, thereby addressing both the physiological and psychological aspects of alcohol dependence.<br><br>In patients who have an inadequate response to first-line treatment with naltrexone, or in patients who have a contraindication to naltrexone (eg, actively using opioids or prescribed opioids for pain management, acute hepatitis, hepatic failure), <strong>acamprosate </strong>can be used.&#160;Acamprosate, a neuromodulator, helps balance the dysregulated neuronal activity during alcohol withdrawal, in addition to reducing cravings.
