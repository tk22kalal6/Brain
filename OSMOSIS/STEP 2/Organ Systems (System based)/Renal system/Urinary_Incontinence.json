This is a potential medical emergency due to the risk of respiratory compromise and medical complications, such as <strong>rhabdomyolysis</strong>. <strong>Rapid assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation</strong> is critical in all cases of ingestion and intoxication. <br><br>After the ABCDE assessment, patients should undergo <strong>cardiac monitoring</strong>, receive <strong>supplemental oxygen</strong> if needed, and have <strong>intravenous access</strong> established. <strong>Benzodiazepines </strong>are the preferred chemical sedative for managing phencyclidine-induced agitation. If benzodiazepines are ineffective, <strong>antipsychotics </strong>(e.g., droperidol, haloperidol) can be used. <strong>External cooling measures</strong> may be necessary in a minority of cases where sedation does not alleviate hyperthermia. In severe cases, <strong>physical restraints</strong> may be required to ensure the safety of both the patient and the staff.

The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology advises against its routine use due to the potential for complications, such as aspiration.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Nasogastric suction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Nasogastric suction is not routinely used in the management of phencyclidine intoxication.

The mainstay of treatment is <strong>supportive care</strong>, focusing on <strong>airway, breathing, and circulation</strong>.

In this case, lack of response to naloxone supports benzodiazepine overdose. Finally, when managing an acute overdose, empiric interventions should not be delayed by diagnostic testing when clinical suspicion is high. <strong>Early supportive measures</strong>, such as respiratory support <strong>(e.g., supplemental oxygen, intubation) </strong>and <strong>intravenous fluids</strong> remain the cornerstone of care. <br><br>P.S.

In addition, the patient seeks relapse prevention, which can be achieved by administering <strong>buprenorphine</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Although rarely life-threatening, the symptoms of acute opiate withdrawal are uncomfortable to the patient and should be treated accordingly. Symptoms include <strong>mydriasis, piloerection, diaphoresis, rhinorrhea, yawning,&#160;</strong><strong>sneezing</strong>, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients may also experience sympathetic hyperactivity (e.g., hypertension, tachycardia). &#160; <br><br>Several medications can be used to treat the symptoms of acute opiate withdrawal, including antiemetics, intravenous fluids, and benzodiazepines. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In addition, <strong>clonidine&#160;</strong>has been shown to improve the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. The medication is a sympathoplegic that interacts with &#593;2-receptors to decrease sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system.
