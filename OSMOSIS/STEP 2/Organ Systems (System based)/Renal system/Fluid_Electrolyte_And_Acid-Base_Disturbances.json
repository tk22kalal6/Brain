      "solution": "<strong>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI)&#160;</strong>can be used to treat multiple psychiatric disorders, including treatment-resistant depression. There are both non-selective (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine) and selective (e.g. selegiline, rasagiline) MAO inhibitors. Given multiple drug and food interactions, higher risk of adverse effects, and overall safety concerns, MAOIs have fallen out of favor. However, they are still used to augment therapy in patients with underlying Parkinson disease. MAOIs inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase; both the A and B subtypes are inhibited by non-selective MAOI, while the selective MAOI only inhibits the B subtype. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>When discontinuing an SSRI or SNRI, it is important to wait at least 2 weeks before starting an MAOI so that neurotransmitter levels can normalize.&#160;</strong>The same applies to switching from an MAOI to an SSRI or SNRI. If there is insufficient time between stopping an SNRI or SSRI and starting an MAOI, dangerous levels of serotonin can accumulate, resulting in <strong>serotonin syndrome.&#160;</strong>This condition manifests with agitation, clonus, dry mucous membranes, hyperreflexia, and hyperthermia. Treatment involves stopping offending medication(s) and providing supportive care. Patients switching to an MAOI can also develop<strong>&#160;hypertensive crisis due to tyramine overload,&#160;</strong>but this is much less common when first starting MAOI (primarily occurs in patients currently taking a MAOI). &#160;<br><br>P.S.

Examples of MAOI include tranylcypromine, phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and selegiline. Other serotonergic antidepressants must be discontinued for 2 weeks prior to initiating an MAOI to prevent adverse effects such as hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. Dietary restrictions limit the use of MAOI particularly tyramine-containing foods such as cured meat, cheese, and wines should be avoided to prevent a hypertensive crisis. Adverse effects include hypotension, dry mouth, gastrointestinal disturbances, urinary hesitancy, and myoclonic jerks. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/e1hCGP4IT7aWweCAPkRMx7-_QxKztaZS/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Presynaptic serotonin reuptake inhibitor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>SSRIs like fluoxetine are presynaptic serotonin inhibitors that inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. &#160;This patient has been administered fluoxetine in the past with a poor response to treatment</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Monoamine oxidase inhibitor&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine.

None of the patient&#8217;s other medications are associated with nephrogenic DI.<br><br>DI is defined as the passage of large volumes (&gt;3 L/24 hr) of dilute urine (&lt; 300 mOsm/kg). There are 2 main forms of diabetes insipidus, central, and nephrogenic. Central DI is caused by a decrease in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, whereas nephrogenic DI results from resistance of the kidneys to ADH. Both can present with polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia.<br><br><strong>Central DI</strong> may be distinguished from <strong>nephrogenic DI&#160;</strong>with a water deprivation test, which involves withholding all water intake and measuring urine osmolality. Afterward, ADH is administered to delineate whether the DI is central or nephrogenic. In both central and nephrogenic DI, urine osmolality will initially be less than 300 mOsm/kg after water deprivation. With ADH administration, the osmolality will be <strong>&gt; 750 mOsm/kg in central DI</strong>. In contrast, there will be <strong>no change in nephrogenic DI</strong> given the kidneys are unable to respond to ADH.<br><br>Treatment for central and nephrogenic DI involves <strong>adequate fluid replacement</strong>, which can be accomplished through oral intake, and <strong>discontinuation of offending agents</strong> (e.g. lithium).

Physical examination reveals diffuse muscle rigidity and dark brown urine suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Together, these findings are consistent with <strong>neuroleptic malignant syndrome</strong>, which is treated with <strong>dantrolene</strong>.<br><br><strong>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</strong> (NMS) is a neuro-psychiatric emergency associated with the use of antipsychotic agents. The underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood, but is thought to be due to a combination of genetic predisposition and dopaminergic receptor blockade secondary to antipsychotic agent use. Clinical manifestations typically appear 1-3 days after initiation of an antipsychotic agent. Symptoms begin with <strong>altered mental status&#160;</strong>and progress to <strong>autonomic instability</strong>,<strong>&#160;diaphoresis</strong>, <strong>encephalopathy</strong>, and <strong>hyperthermia</strong> (temperatures typically exceed 104&#176;F or 40.5&#176;C). Additionally, patients typically demonstrate diffuse muscle rigidity, which is termed <strong>&#8220;lead-pipe&#8221;&#160;</strong><strong>rigidity</strong>, and <strong>rhabdomyolysis</strong>, which results in elevated creatinine kinase levels and myoglobinuria.<br><br>NMS can be differentiated from serotonin syndrome via several findings. First, the fever in NMS is often much higher. Second, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are commonly seen in serotonin syndrome but rarely in NMS. Finally, serotonin syndrome tends to cause hyperreflexia/myoclonus whereas NMS causes muscle rigidity.<br><br>Treatment of NMS includes supportive care, muscle relaxants (e.g. <strong>dantrolene</strong>), and dopaminergic agonists (e.g. <strong>bromocriptine</strong>).<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ltn7QDOoQqu-JoMfwuane3CeQSuUq9Dv/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Dantrolene:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cyproheptadine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Cyproheptadine was historically used for the treatment of serotonin syndrome, not neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

They are associated with several side effects, including hyperprolactinemia, metabolic syndrome, QT prolongation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and <strong>extrapyramidal symptoms</strong> (e.g., acute dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia). Typical antipsychotics often end in the suffix &#8220;-azine&#8221;.<br><br>Second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, work via <strong>inhibition of dopamine D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway </strong>and <strong>inhibition of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the mesocortical pathway</strong>. Standard atypical antipsychotics include clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, paliperidone, risperidone, lurasidone, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. Per naming convention, atypical antipsychotics usually <strong>end in the suffixes &#8220;-apine&#8221; or &#8220;-idone&#8221;</strong>. Notably, atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms than the typical antipsychotics.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Risperidone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic with a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia when compared to first-generation antipsychotics.

This side effect occurs since the <strong>atypical antipsychotics</strong> block dopamine receptors in the tuberoinfundibular pathway. Amongst the atypical antipsychotics, <strong>risperidone </strong>is most likely to cause hyperprolactinemia.<br><br>The tuberoinfundibular pathway refers to a population of dopamine neurons in the arcuate nucleus (also known as the \"infundibular nucleus\") in the tuberal region of the hypothalamus that projects to the pituitary median eminence (the \"infundibular region\"). It is one of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain. Dopamine released at this site regulates prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland.<br><br>Blockade of dopamine receptors leads to an <strong>increase in prolactin</strong>, which <strong>inhibits the release of GnRH, LH, and FSH</strong>. Patients will subsequently develop <strong>hypogonadism</strong>. Women may present with <strong>hirsutism, acne, oligomenorrhea, </strong>or <strong>amenorrhea</strong>. Men can develop <strong>gynecomastia</strong>. Both men and women can experience <strong>infertility, sexual dysfunction, galactorrhea, </strong>and <strong>decreased bone mineral density</strong>. <br><br>Ideally, if a patient develops hyperprolactinemia, the atypical antipsychotic should be discontinued. However, if this is not possible, then either 1) the dose may be decreased, 2) the patient can be switched to an alternative atypical antipsychotic, or 3) a full or partial dopamine agonist may be added to the regimen. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Increased prolactin levels:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased GnRH levels:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient has gynecomastia, likely secondary to risperidone use.

TD tends to develop after several months to years of antipsychotic drug therapy.

The patient&#8217;s&#160;<strong>significant body fat loss</strong>&#160;over a&#160;brief&#160;period&#160;should raise suspicion for&#160;an&#160;<strong>eating disorder</strong>.&#160;In patients suspected&#160;of&#160;having&#160;an eating disorder, it is prudent to&#160;urgently&#160;obtain a&#160;complete blood count,&#160;complete&#160;metabolic&#160;panel,&#160;serum magnesium level,&#160;serum phosphorous level,&#160;urinalysis,&#160;and a&#160;<strong>12-lead ECG</strong>.&#160;Obtaining an ECG is the next best step&#160;for this patient&#160;as&#160;<strong>cardiovascular complications</strong>&#160;are the&#160;<strong>most common cause of death</strong>&#160;in patients experiencing eating disorders,&#160;and he has electrolyte abnormalities.&#160;<br><br>Performing these diagnostic measures allows&#160;clinicians to&#160;identify&#160;high-acuity&#160;complications linked to eating disorders. For example,&#160;<strong>ECG </strong>may show&#160;<strong>QT prolongation, arrhythmias</strong>, or cardiac abnormalities due to&#160;<strong>electrolyte deficiencies</strong>.&#160;Electrolyte&#160;levels may show deficiencies that need to be&#160;corrected.&#160;<br><br>Supportive evidence that this patient is&#160;experiencing&#160;an&#160;eating disorder&#160;includes&#160;exam findings of increased&#160;muscle tone&#160;and&#160;vascularity&#160;which&#160;suggest this patient had&#160;a&#160;<strong>significant decrease</strong>&#160;in his&#160;<strong>body fat percentage</strong>&#160;over&#160;a brief&#160;period.&#160;Moreover,&#160;his BMI is in the low range.&#160;The&#160;patient&#8217;s symptoms&#160;of weakness,&#160;muscle cramps,&#160;and fatigue&#160;developed over&#160;the same duration of time as his weight loss, suggesting that aggressive dieting&#160;played&#160;a role in these&#160;nutritional&#160;deficiencies.&#160;<br><br>P.S. If you or someone you know&#160;is&#160;experiencing&#160;an eating disorder, you can call the ANAD National Eating Disorder Helpline at 800.375.7767 or visit https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/get-help/ to learn more about resources available in your area.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ 12-Lead&#160;electrocardiogram (ECG)&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reassurance:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Reassurance is&#160;a&#160;helpful clinical tool that provides patients comfort and improves therapeutic rapport.
