      "solution": "This patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of <strong>opioid withdrawal</strong> after receiving <strong>naloxone</strong>. <strong>Establishing intravenous (IV) access</strong> for administration of fluids and medications to treat withdrawal symptoms is the most appropriate next step in management.<br><br>Opioid withdrawal occurs when a person who has developed <strong>physical dependence</strong> on opioids suddenly <strong>reduces or stops</strong> using the drug. The severity of withdrawal symptoms can vary depending on the duration and intensity of opioid use and the type of opioid involved. Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include <strong>agitation, anxiety, muscle aches, watery eyes, runny nose (rhinorrhea), excessive sweating (diaphoresis)</strong>, insomnia, and frequent yawing. Additional findings can include abdominal cramping, diarrhea, dilated pupils (mydriasis), goose bumps, and nausea. <br><br>Management of opioid withdrawal in the emergency department focuses on alleviating symptoms and ensuring patient safety. An initial evaluation should include an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong>, along with the <strong>establishment of IV access</strong> for fluid and medication administration, and vital sign monitoring. In patients who present with naloxone-induced withdrawal symptoms after an intoxication event, it is particularly important to monitor their mental and respiratory status for potential <strong>reemergence of opioid intoxication effects</strong> due to the short duration of action for naloxone. <strong>Non-opioid medications</strong> (e.g., alpha-2 agonists, antiemetics, antidiarrheals) or <strong>buprenorphine&#160;</strong>(a partial mu agonist) are appropriate options for symptom management. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Intravenous access:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Oral metoprolol&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Beta blockers, such as metoprolol, are used to control heart rate in certain situations (e.g., atrial fibrillation). However, this patient has sinus tachycardia (based on ECG findings) which is likely due to opioid withdrawal and should be managed by treating the underlying cause.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Oral methadone&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: While methadone is often an option for managing acute opioid withdrawal symptoms, it is not recommended for management of withdrawal symptoms triggered by naloxone.

Intubation and mechanical ventilation are reserved for patients who exhibit signs of respiratory failure or who have severely altered mental status and cannot protect their airway.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intramuscular naloxone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Naloxone was already administered by emergency medical services, which effectively reversed the opioid overdose, as evidenced by the patient regaining consciousness and the onset of withdrawal symptoms.&#160;</span></div>",
