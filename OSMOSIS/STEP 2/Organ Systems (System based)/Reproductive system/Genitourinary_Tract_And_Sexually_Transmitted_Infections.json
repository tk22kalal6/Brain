      "solution": "This patient with acute pyelonephritis is not improving on appropriate antibiotics. <strong>Lack of improvement within 48 to 72 hours</strong> of initiation of treatment suggests that the <strong>antibiotic choice is incorrect</strong> (empiric antibiotic does not cover the pathogen that grows out or there is bacterial resistance to an appropriate antibiotic) or that the <strong>source of the infection must be controlled</strong> (calculus or obstruction, renal or perinephric abscess that needs intervention). This patient&#8217;s infection is sensitive to the antibiotic being used. The issue is likely a lack of source control, which raises concern for <strong>complicated pyelonephritis</strong> (e.g., abscess) requiring further imaging and possible intervention. <strong>CT of the abdomen and pelvis</strong> is generally used to diagnose physiologic or anatomical features leading to complicated pyelonephritis. If CT is not available or the patient cannot undergo radiation (e.g. a pregnant woman), ultrasound can often be used. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/iccN1z4MTBeMt9_IUx3aCWvhT1mEj1LY/_.png\"></div><br>Patients with mild to moderate <strong>acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis</strong> can be treated as <strong>outpatients </strong>if they can tolerate oral antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin) and oral hydration.

These findings are suggestive of Schistosoma <strong><em>haematobium&#160;</em></strong>infection, which can be treated with <strong>praziquantel</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Praziquantel is the first-line therapy against most infections caused by flukes (e.g. schistosoma species) and tapeworms. It is also a second-like agent in the treatment of neurocysticercosis. &#160; <br><br>Praziquantel works by<strong>&#160;increasing the permeability of parasitic cellular membranes to calcium ions;</strong> thereby, leading to muscle paralysis and death. The drug is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome p450 enzymes, so inducers of this enzyme can decrease praziquantel&#8217;s effectiveness. Side effects of praziquantel are usually mild and may include <strong>headaches&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;fatigue.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/jzSKnQBRR7aT_eTGUAeOhAogTpa2NEHz/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Melarsoprol:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Melarsoprol is an antiprotozoal agent that is used as a first-line treatment for sleeping sickness caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei.</em> In contrast, this patient's history and urine microscopy findings are more suggestive of<em> Schistosoma haematobium</em> infection. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Metronidazole:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Metronidazole is used for the treatment of giardiasis, amebiasis, <em>Helicobacter pylori&#160;</em>infection, and trichomoniasis.

His parent reports that he has had foul-smelling, dark urine. The patient has not had a cough, congestion, sore throat, or ear ache. He is otherwise healthy and does not take any medication. He was born at 35 weeks gestation. Family history is notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by chronic kidney disease and hypertension in the patient's mother. Temperature is 38.3&#176;C (101&#176;F), pulse is 140/min, respiratory rate is 30/min, blood pressure is 95/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

      "solution": "This patient presents with a recent history of significant weight loss presents with intermittent gross hematuria and lumbar pain. The abdominal CT scan demonstrates left renal vein compression at its distal segment between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery with mild proximal dilatation. In combination, this presentation is consistent with nutcracker syndrome (NCS). &#160; <br><br>NCS occurs when the <strong>left renal vein,</strong> which drains blood from the left kidney, becomes <strong>squeezed between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)&#160;</strong>and <strong>abdominal aorta</strong>. Normally, the aortomesenteric angle (between SMA and aorta) is around 45 degrees, with the renal vein cushioned by a bit of fat in the mesentery. If there is significant weight loss which shrinks the mesenteric fat, this angle is reduced, and the arteries begin to pinch the left renal vein, causing renal hypertension. Over time, the high pressures cause small breaks in the renal blood vessels. Patients typically present with<strong>&#160;gross hematuria</strong> and <strong>left flank pain</strong> that may improve or worsen depending on positioning. &#160; <br><br>Since the left gonadal vein drains via the left renal vein, nutcracker syndrome can also result in<strong>&#160;left testicular pain</strong> in males or <strong>left lower quadrant pain</strong> in females, especially during intercourse and during menstruation.

MHT includes <strong>unopposed estrogen in women who have had a hysterectomy </strong>and <strong>combined estrogen-progestin</strong> therapy for women with an intact uterus and the need for progestin to <strong>prevent estrogen-associated endometrial hyperplasia</strong>. Oral progesterone prevents endometrial growth, which mitigates the risk of hyperplasia and progression to cancer.

They can be used in women who cannot tolerate or have contradictions to or do not want to use hormone therapy. They can also be used in combination with MHT.
