Iron deficiency anemia</strong> is the most common <strong>cause of anemia in pregnancy.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>A mild degree of dilutional anemia is physiologic during pregnancy. However, specific trimester-related cutoffs should be used to define anemia in pregnancy. For patients in the first or third trimester of pregnancy, a hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL is diagnostic of anemia. For patients in the second trimester, a hemoglobin of less than 10.5 g/dL is diagnostic of anemia. Pregnant patients should be screened for<strong>&#160;anemia of pregnancy in the first and second trimesters,</strong> and if present, patients should be treated before birth where blood loss can worsen anemia and lead to maternal and fetal complications. All pregnant patients should also be screened for hemoglobinopathies using hemoglobin electrophoresis at the start of their pregnancy. &#160;<br><br>Causes of anemia of pregnancy include<strong>&#160;nutritional deficiencies</strong>, resulting in <strong>impaired red blood cell production.</strong> In addition, inherited mutations of hemoglobin structure, known as hemoglobinopathies, or conditions resulting in increased destruction of red blood cells can also cause anemia during pregnancy. Patients with malabsorption syndromes (e.g. celiac disease, prior gastric bypass) may develop folate or B12 deficiency. Patients with multiple medical comorbidities may develop anemia of chronic disease/inflammation. Physical examination should assess for scleral icterus (e.g. hemolysis) and neurologic signs, such as ataxia (e.g. B12 deficiency). &#160;<br><br>Pregnant patients with anemia may present with<strong>&#160;fatigue, shortness of breath,</strong> or restless legs (especially in iron deficiency). When evaluating a patient with anemia of pregnancy, history should focus on determining the underlying cause by assessing dietary intake, use of prenatal vitamins, family history of hemoglobinopathies, history of nausea and vomiting, and signs of blood loss. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common pathologic cause of anemia in pregnancy due to multiple factors. Iron requirements increase significantly in pregnancy and inadequate iron intake (often in resource-limited places), blood loss from prior deliveries, and conditions that prevent intake or impair absorption (like nausea and vomiting) in pregnancy can lead to iron deficiency. &#160;<br>&#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/4iZTfrbsRZylyFkbQbmX0xbDS-etL4fP/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;Iron deficiency:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Family history of pernicious anemia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Pernicious anemia can lead to inadequate absorption of B12 with subsequent macrocytic anemia.

In most cases of severe hypertension in pregnancy, the patient will not have catastrophic hemorrhage or stroke and will be able to maintain their airway, breathing, and circulation.

Additionally, nifedipine is used to inhibit contractions for a limited duration of time, typically 48 to 72 hours, in patients with preterm labor.

If <strong>vaginal&#160;</strong><strong>delivery</strong>, then <strong>intrapartum IV antibiotics</strong> (targeting GBS) are required as the newborn will be exposed to the colonized mother&#8217;s vaginal microbiome.

She most likely has a ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Ectopic pregnancy</strong> is an extrauterine pregnancy and commonly occurs in the uterine tubes. It should be suspected in women of reproductive age with risk factors for a tubal pregnancy, including the previous history of tubal pregnancy, IUD use, sterilization, and history of tubal disease. Laboratory investigations would reveal a rising beta hCG level, and imaging could reveal an extra ovarian adnexal mass/ extrauterine gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The fallopian tubes are situated in the upper margin of the broad ligament of the uterus and are divided anatomically into 4 divisions; the infundibulum, the ampulla, the isthmus, and the intramural or interstitial part of the tube. The isthmus forms the medial one-third of the tube. The ampulla forms the lateral two-thirds and is the site of fertilization. The infundibulum forms the lateral end of the uterine tube and is attached to the tubal pole of the ovary. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Due to its close proximity to the ovary, ovarian torsion or rupture are often considered in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen in a woman of reproductive age. However, these differentials are unlikely to cause abnormal vaginal bleeding or amenorrhea. A transvaginal ultrasound can further aid in distinguishing ovarian pathologies from a tubal pregnancy. Ovarian torsion on a pelvic ultrasound would reveal an adnexal mass with the absent flow on a doppler USG. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/mWG2qVr8Tu24-pepta_1kv2jQTuhTJPm/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Simple ciliated columnar epithelium:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Simple cuboidal epithelium&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Simple cuboidal epithelium covers the epithelial surface of the ovary.

Even if the initial screening at this visit (10 weeks of gestation) is negative, it is still important to rescreen at 24-28 weeks because the physiologic changes in pregnancy that can lead to GDM, such as increased insulin resistance, become more pronounced as the pregnancy progresses.

Delaying surgical intervention can lead to increased morbidity and even possible mortality. &#160; &#160;<br><br>During most first trimester losses, loss of the fetus or embryo occurs before the expulsion of the products of conception.

Bleeding is<strong>&#160;followed by crampy abdominal pain</strong>. By definition, an incomplete miscarriage means that some pregnancy tissue has not been completely expelled.

Shoulder dystocia refers to the impaction of the fetal shoulder on the bony pelvis, and it is an obstetric emergency. Initial management steps include <strong>calling for help</strong>, having the patient <strong>stop pushing</strong>, performing the <strong>McRoberts maneuver (Hyperflex and abducting the maternal hips)</strong>, <strong>and&#160;</strong>applying <strong>suprapubic pressure. &#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>The<strong>&#160;McRoberts maneuver</strong> involves <strong>hyperflexing&#160;</strong>and abducting the maternal hips, which can be thought of as bringing the maternal <strong>knees&#160;</strong>towards the <strong>armpits</strong>. This maneuver <strong>rotates&#160;</strong>the <strong>symphysis&#160;</strong>pubis towards the maternal head, <strong>flattens&#160;</strong>the <strong>lumbosacral&#160;</strong>curve, and can free the impacted shoulder. Simultaneously, applying <strong>suprapubic pressure</strong> internally rotates the anterior shoulder, creating a shorter bisacromial diameter, and can manually dislodge the impacted shoulder. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Management&#160;</strong>of shoulder dystocia should begin with the least invasive, lowest-risk <strong>external&#160;</strong>maneuvers. Pushing should stop. The <strong>McRoberts</strong> maneuver with <strong>suprapubic&#160;</strong>pressure will be the first choice and is often effective. If dystocia persists, internal maneuvers, including delivery of the posterior arm, Rubin and Woods rotational maneuvers, posterior axillary sling, and Gaskin would be second-line choices. An episiotomy may improve access to these internal maneuvers. If these initial steps are unsuccessful, methods of last resort would include the Zavanelli maneuver, abdominal rescue, fetal clavicle fracture, and symphysiotomy. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>A description of first, second, and third-line maneuvers for shoulder dystocia are provided in the table below. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/h-8FAeLkSQi2nkMrOWzTHlBpRwaZF0in/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Hyperflex and abduct the maternal hips&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Perform episiotomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Shoulder dystocia is not caused by the soft tissue of the perineum; it is due to bone-on-bone impaction.

Findings such as&#160;risk factors,&#160;characteristic fetal monitoring patterns, and lab and ultrasound findings&#160;can support the diagnosis. One of the most significant&#160;<strong>risk factors</strong>&#160;for placental abruption is&#160;<strong>hypertensive disorders of pregnancy</strong>,&#160;which the patient in the vignette meets criteria for based on her&#160;severely elevated blood pressure.&#160;Other risk factors for abruption include&#160;<strong>abdominal trauma, advanced maternal age, leiomyomas,&#160;</strong><strong><span>prelabor</span><span>&#160;rupture of membranes, and tobacco or cocaine use</span></strong>.&#160;<br><br>Placental abruption&#160;refers to the&#160;<strong>premature separation of the placenta</strong>&#160;from the uterine wall due to rupture of the maternal vessels within the basal layer of the uterus.&#160;This can lead to bleeding from the placental attachment site,&#160;typically&#160;causing&#160;abdominal&#160;pain&#160;and vaginal bleeding.&#160;Uterine irritability or hypertonicity,&#160;<strong>high frequency-low amplitude contractions</strong>, and&#160;<strong>non-reassuring fetal heart rate</strong>&#160;patterns are also common.&#160;However, it is possible for an abruption to occur&#160;in the center of the placenta, where the blood loss is fully&#160;<strong>concealed </strong>behind the placenta and the patient does&#160;not&#160;experience vaginal bleeding.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Elevated blood pressure:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Gestational diabetes mellitus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;GDM is a risk factor for macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, polyhydramnios, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and stillbirth. However,&#160;GDM&#160;is not a significant risk factor for placental abruption, which is the&#160;most likely diagnosis&#160;in this vignette.&#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Past cesarean births:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A history of prior cesarean birth(s) is the most significant risk factor for uterine rupture, which can also present with painful uterine bleeding. However, placental abruption is more likely in this patient given that the symptoms started spontaneously at 32 weeks in the setting of severely elevated blood pressures (a major risk factor for abruption) rather than during labor, which is when uterine rupture is most likely to occur.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Multiparity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;On its own, multiparity is not significantly associated with placental abruption. However, abruption is more likely in patients with advanced maternal age, who are often multiparous.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Velamentous umbilical cord insertion:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Velamentous umbilical cord insertion refers to umbilical vessels that insert into the placenta without the protection of Wharton&#8217;s jelly. These vessels are directly attached to the&#160;chorion and can rupture when the membranes rupture, leading to rapid fetal exsanguination&#160;and painless, rather than painful, bleeding.&#160;</span></div>",
