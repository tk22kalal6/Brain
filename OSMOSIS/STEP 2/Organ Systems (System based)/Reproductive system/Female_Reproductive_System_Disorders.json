Her parents report progressive periorbital swelling and abdominal and ankle swelling for the past 10 days. The patient had a sore throat two months ago, but no other illnesses or medications. There is no known family history of kidney disease. Temperature is 37&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg. Weight is 23 kg, but it was 18 kg two weeks ago. On examination, she is oriented to person only. She has puffy lower eyelids and pitting edema in bilateral lower limbs. Capillary refill is 3 seconds with moist mucous membranes. Heart rate is regular with no murmurs or gallops. The patient has difficulty breathing when lying flat but has clear lungs bilaterally.

The patient&#8217;s history of <strong>sore throat</strong> followed by <strong>periorbital edema</strong>, weight gain, and lower extremity edema is consistent with <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong> secondary to <strong>poststreptococcal glomerular nephritis (PSGN)</strong>. The patient&#8217;s laboratory analysis showing <strong>hyponatremia, low plasma osmolality, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria</strong>, and low urine sodium is consistent with a diagnosis of <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong>. <br><br><strong>Hypervolemic hyponatremia</strong> is seen in cases of edema such as <strong>nephrotic syndrome, acute liver failure, </strong>and <strong>heart failure</strong>. While there is excess fluid in the body, the <strong>intravascular volume is low</strong>. In response to low intravascular volume, the body increases <strong>antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release</strong> from the pituitary gland, which causes <strong>renal water retention </strong>and <strong>sodium retention</strong>. The <strong>serum sodium concentration decreases</strong> because <strong>water intake exceeds sodium intake</strong>, and ADH prevents the loss of excess water.<br><br>When assessing patients with hyponatremia, it is essential to assess volume status and perform a neurological exam to determine the etiology, severity, and management. Patients with hyponatremia can be hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Signs indicating <strong>hypervolemic hyponatremia</strong> include <strong>weight gain, hypertension, edema, orthopnea, </strong>and <strong>increased jugular venous pressure</strong>. This patient does not have crackles or gallops, which are typically seen with heart failure. The absence of ascites and spider angiomas makes acute liver failure a less likely diagnosis in this case, and blood and urine studies are consistent with nephrotic syndrome. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Excessive water intake:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Excessive water intake causes euvolemic hyponatremia, and patients will have normal heart rate and blood pressure without signs of dehydration or hypervolemia.

Severe manifestations include laryngospasms and seizures. Two key signs that may be seen on physical examination are the <strong>Chvostek sign</strong> and the <strong>Trousseau sign.&#160;</strong><strong>Chvostek sign</strong> is elicited by <strong>tapping the facial nerve in front of the ear</strong>, causing <strong>contraction of the facial muscles.</strong> A trousseau sign occurs when a carpopedal spasm is induced by occlusion of the brachial artery with a blood pressure cuff. QT prolongation can be seen on ECG. &#160; <br><br>Multiple blood transfusions can lead to a rapid drop in calcium levels, a condition known as <strong>citrate-induced hypocalcemia.</strong> Citrate, an anticoagulant in stored blood products, binds to ionized calcium in the blood, resulting in a transient reduction in the ionized (biologically active) form of calcium. Citrate is rapidly metabolized in patients with normal liver function, and the effects are usually transient. However, in massive transfusions or in patients with liver disease, the rate of citrate administration can exceed the liver&#8217;s metabolic demand, leading to citrate accumulation and symptomatic hypocalcemia. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/wzVICy9mRMuCddVgoyTsqLlJQI6FIQ1q/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Contraction of the facial muscles elicited by tapping the upper cheek in front of the ear:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Bilateral ankle edema:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Bilateral ankle edema can occur in the setting of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO).

CKD is graded as G3, G4, or G5 based on the <strong>estimated glomerular filtration rate</strong> (30-59 mL/min, 15-29 mL/min, and &lt;15 mL/min, respectively). It is also graded as A1, A2, and A3 based on the <strong>degree of albuminuria</strong>. A urine albumin-creatinine ratio &lt; 30, 30-299, and &gt;300 indicate stages A1, A2, and A3 respectively. These grading systems help guide management. &#160;<br><br>Evaluation for the cause of CKD depends on the presence of additional signs, symptoms, and comorbidities. Symptoms of vasculitis or presence of urinary erythrocyte casts should prompt <strong>ANCA&#160;</strong>and <strong>anti-GBM antibody studies.

However, this patient's congestive heart failure is a contraindication to hemodialysis. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Instead, this patient needs to receive <strong>peritoneal dialysis</strong> (PD). PD involves inserting a <strong>large indwelling catheter</strong> into the <strong>peritoneal space</strong>.

Dialysis solution can be injected into the peritoneum via the catheter, which draws (via microfluidic forces driven by solute concentration gradients) toxic solutes into the peritoneal space. The dialysis solution is then voided, and the cycle can be repeated if needed.

The most important causes of nephrotic/nephritic proteinuria include<strong>&#160;minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,</strong> and <strong>membranous nephropathy;&#160;</strong>while the most important causes of non-nephrotic persistent proteinuria include<strong>&#160;Fanconi syndrome, acute interstitial nephritis,</strong> and <strong>acute tubular necrosis. &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong>&#160; &#160;<br><br>The most common cause of <strong>nephrotic (glomerular) proteinuria&#160;</strong>seen in children is <strong>MCD</strong>. Physical exams often reveal <strong>periorbital edema</strong> and <strong>edema in the lower extremities,</strong> as noted in this patient. <strong>Proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia,</strong> and <strong>hyperlipidemia&#160;</strong>with <strong>normal renal functions&#160;</strong>and complement levels, and the absence of hypertension and gross hematuria confirms the diagnosis of MCD, especially in patients with no indications for renal biopsy. Indications for a renal biopsy include age of onset less than 1 year or greater than 12 years, markedly elevated serum creatinine, gross hematuria, marked hypertension, and low levels of C3 and C4. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acute tubular necrosis&#160;(ATN)&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Patients with A</span><span>T</span><span>N typically have</span><span>&#160;a</span><span>&#160;</span><span>history</span><span>&#160;</span><span>of&#160;</span><span>volume depletion</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;receiving nephrotoxic</span><span>&#160;medications such as NSAIDs or&#160;</span><span>aminoglycosides or exposure to radiocontrast&#160;</span><span>material</span><span>&#160;and urinalysis showing proteinuria with&#160;</span><span>muddy brown casts</span><span>&#160;which are not seen in this patient.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Fanconi syndrome&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Patients with Fanconi syndrome may present with&#160;</span><span>growth failure,&#160;</span><span>generalized weakness</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;and laboratory findings of metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and proteinuria.&#160;</span><span>This patient</span><span>&#8217;s&#160;</span><span>presentation with edema, proteinuria,&#160;</span><span>hypoalbuminemia,</span><span>&#160;and hyperlipi</span><span>demia&#160;</span><span>is</span><span>&#160;more consistent with minimal change disease.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Minimal change disease&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>C</span><span>orrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Orthostatic proteinuria&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Patients with orthostatic proteinuria are&#160;</span><span>asymptomatic</span><span>&#160;and are</span><span>&#160;diagnosed incidentally</span><span>&#160;with proteinuria&#160;</span><span>found&#160;</span><span>on</span><span>&#160;random void spot urine&#160;</span><span>and normal protein on</span><span>&#160;first-morning void urine</span><span>.

Stones are formed when risk factors lead to supersaturation of the urine, formation of crystals, and aggregation into clinically detectable and symptomatic stones. <strong>Calcium oxalate</strong> stones are the <strong>most common type</strong>, accounting for 80% of all stones. They present as <strong>dumbbell-shaped</strong> or <strong>envelope-shaped</strong> crystals on urinalysis. &#160; <br><br><strong>High sodium intake</strong> is thought to enhance calcium excretion and <strong>increase the risk for kidney stones</strong>. In the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), calcium handling is mainly dependent on sodium. High dietary sodium induces relative hypervolemia. This in turn diminishes the efficacy of sodium and water reabsorption in the PCT. Concurrently, calcium reabsorption, which occurs in the PCT and is passively coupled with sodium and water, is also reduced.

Patients can be sent home on pain medication and instructed to increase fluid intake and strain their urine to collect any stones that pass. They can be prescribed <strong>alpha-blockers</strong>, like <strong>tamsulosin</strong>, which can help relax the ureteral smooth muscle and facilitate stone passage. Stones that are <strong>&#8805; 6 mm in size</strong> require <strong>urologic consultation</strong> for <strong>endoscopic removal or extracorporeal lithotripsy</strong>.<br><br>Regardless of the management strategy, the stone type should be assessed, either from the stone fragments obtained during a urologic procedure or from stones collected in a calculi strainer. 24-hour urine collection should be sent for urinary pH, calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid, and phosphorus levels. The information from these studies is used to determine which measures should be taken to prevent future stones. Regardless of the type of stone, all patients with stones should be encouraged to drink enough fluid to dilute urine and maintain a urine output of at least 2.5 liters in 24 hours. In general, a low-sodium diet that is high in fruits and vegetables is recommended to prevent stones.

A bedside <strong>post-void residual (PVR) bladder scan</strong> rapidly confirms whether urine is being retained in the bladder, signifying a lower-tract process. <br><br>Acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to a sudden decline in kidney function that results in electrolyte imbalances, extracellular dysregulation, and accumulation of nitrogenous wastes such as ammonia and uric acid. It is diagnosed by a rise in <strong>serum creatinine</strong>, and <strong>urinalysis&#160;</strong>is typically used to screen for intrinsic renal disease, infection, or hematuria.
