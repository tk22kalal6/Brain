Although not always seen, especially with smaller abruptions, the presence of a <strong>fluid collection</strong> or <strong>blood clot between the placenta and the uterine wall&#160;</strong>supports the diagnosis. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Placental abruption occurs when the <strong>placenta prematurely separates from the uterine wall</strong>. Depending on the size and location of the abruption, <strong>vaginal bleeding may be significant, light, or absent&#160;</strong>(if the bleeding is concealed). The pain, like bleeding, often has an abrupt onset and can range in severity, though it is almost always present to some degree. Uterine tenderness and/or increased uterine tone may be detected. Fetal distress typically develops as blood loss increases. The irritated uterus will often demonstrate low-amplitude, high-frequency contractions. Risk factors for placental abruption include a history of recent <strong>trauma, hypertensive disorders</strong> as seen in this patient, substance use (e.g., cocaine, tobacco), and<strong>&#160;pre-labor rupture of membranes&#160;</strong>(PROM). &#160; &#160;<br><br>The evaluation of <strong>vaginal bleeding in the third trimester</strong> typically involves history, physical exam, and ultrasound.
