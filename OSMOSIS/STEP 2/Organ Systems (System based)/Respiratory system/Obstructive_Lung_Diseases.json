The mass fluctuates with her menstrual cycle. This clinical presentation is suggestive of a <strong>fibroadenoma</strong>. The best next step in the evaluation of suspected fibroadenoma in a<strong>&#160;patient younger than 35 years old&#160;</strong>is an <strong>ultrasound of the breast</strong>, as it can distinguish fluid-filled cysts from solid masses and characterize these masses as benign or suspicious for malignancy. If the patient is 35 years old or older, breast ultrasound and mammography are both indicated. &#160; <br><br>For an adult presenting with a breast mass suggestive of a fibroadenoma, ultrasonography, and mammography are useful in classifying the fibroadenoma as simple, complex, or giant based on distinct radiologic features. &#160; &#160; <br><br>With a <strong>simple fibroadenoma</strong>, ultrasonography often depicts a well-circumscribed, uniform, hypoechoic, oval, or round lesion, while mammography may show a well-circumscribed oval mass that is either hypodense or isodense to the surrounding breast tissue. Macrolobulation or partially obscured margins may also be seen. Simple fibroadenomas in young women that are asymptomatic and not enlarging may be followed with a repeat breast exam and imaging studies at 6 months to determine if they continue to be stable, or a core needle biopsy may be performed. &#160; <br><br>In ultrasonography, a <strong>complex fibroadenoma&#160;</strong>may exhibit features of a simple fibroadenoma, but will also have internal calcifications, irregular borders, or lobulations. A mammogram often reveals a well-circumscribed oval or round mass with 'popcorn' calcifications, and obscured or irregular borders. An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy with histopathology revealing sclerosing adenosis, duct epithelial hyperplasia, epithelial microcalcifications, and papillary apocrine changes, along with stromal and glandular elements of fibroadenomas confirms the diagnosis. &#160; <br><br>A <strong>giant fibroadenoma</strong> is typically larger than 5 cm on ultrasound, maintaining the well-circumscribed, uniform hypoechoic characteristics of simple fibroadenomas. Mammography may reveal a large, well-circumscribed mass that is hypodense or isodense to the surrounding breast tissue. It may be macrolobulated or have partially obscured margins. Importantly, giant fibroadenomas may be confused with phyllodes tumors due to their rapid increase in size. An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy can help differentiate between the two and excision is recommended for giant fibroadenomas. In giant fibroadenomas, hypercellular stroma, epithelial and myoepithelial hyperplasia, and proliferation of stromal and epithelial cells without a leaf-like growth pattern are typically seen. &#160; &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Breast ultrasonography:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Observation and repeat breast examination and imaging in 6 months:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>If ultrasonography demonstrates findings consistent with a simple fibroadenoma and the patient remains asymptomatic, then observation and repeat examination and imaging in 6 months to ensure stability would be appropriate treatment.

Clinically, it is characterized by unilateral breast pain, swelling, and a palpable<strong>&#160;mass or masses</strong> that can be <strong>mistaken for malignancy.</strong> Unlike typical mastitis, which is acute and often associated with lactation, granulomatous mastitis can<strong>&#160;recur sporadically&#160;</strong>with episodes varying in severity. Patients often report fluctuating, localized symptoms, with episodes of exacerbation and partial resolution. Over time, the condition may progress to form sinus tracts, leading to purulent discharge from the nipple or skin overlying the breast. &#160; &#160; <br><br>Unlike acute infectious mastitis or recurrent mastitis that can be seen in lactating and nonlactating women, granulomatous mastitis is not generally associated with systemic symptoms like fever or malaise unless it is associated with a secondary infection. While it can occur in women who have previously breastfed, it is not limited to the postpartum period and can arise years after lactation has ceased. Its presentation can be variable, sometimes mimicking<strong>&#160;breast cancer, especially inflammatory breast cancer,</strong> which necessitates evaluation with imaging with ultrasound and core needle biopsy to distinguish between the two.

It is typically associated with an<strong>&#160;underlying breast cancer</strong> in that breast. &#160; <br><br>Patients with Paget disease of the breast have <strong>underlying breast cancer (in situ or invasive) in 85 to 88 percent of cases,&#160;</strong>although often without an associated palpable breast mass or screening mammographic abnormality. Therefore, all patients require a <strong>full-thickness skin biopsy</strong> and <strong>diagnostic mammography</strong>. Staging for breast cancer involves the TNM system: tumor, node, and metastasis. <strong>Early-stage breast cancer</strong> includes patients with <strong>stage I, IIA,</strong> and a subset of stage IIB, while <strong>locally advanced breast cancer</strong> includes patients with a subset of stage IIB, IIIA to IIIC. &#160;<br><br>Most patients with early-stage disease can be offered surgery +/- chemotherapy/hormone therapy depending on the receptor status. Whereas, for locally advanced breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is usually recommended before surgery. <strong>Metastatic workup is only completed in locally advanced </strong>(disease that is T3 or greater, N2 or N3, M0), cases of<strong> inflammatory breast cancer, </strong>and in any patients with signs or symptoms suspicious of metastatic disease.&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Stage IA:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Stage IA patients are T1 (&lt; 2cm) and cN0 (no palpable nodes).

Adequate hydration and diuresis, in addition to amifostine (a free radical scavenger), are used to prevent this side effect. &#160; &#160; <br><br>3. <strong>Nausea and vomiting</strong>: Cisplatin is highly emetogenic.

In individuals with <strong>polycystic ovary syndrome</strong> (PCOS), there is unopposed estrogen exposure from chronic estrogen production without ovulation. This leads to an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. <br><br><strong>Unopposed estrogen exposure</strong> is a major risk factor for the development of <strong>endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN)</strong> and endometrial cancer. Unopposed estrogen can be endogenous or exogenous. Endogenous unopposed estrogen may result from <strong>chronic anovulation</strong>, as seen in <strong>PCOS</strong>, or from <strong>peripheral conversion</strong> of androgens to estrone in adipose tissue, as seen in <strong>obesity</strong>. Exogenous unopposed estrogen can occur in patients using <strong>estrogen therapy without progesterone</strong>, which is not recommended in those with a uterus. <br><br>Additional risk factors for the development of endometrial cancer include <strong>nulliparity, early menarche (&lt;12 years of age), late menopause</strong>, personal or family history of Lynch syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. <br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/srJL_iKIT3_L2bR4V6dFc31FSPO9lVB2/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Polycystic ovary syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Age of menarche:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The patient was 14 years old at menarche, which falls within the normal range. Early menarche (&lt; 12 years old) is a risk factor for endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia and endometrial cancer.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Age of menopause:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The patient&#8217;s last menstrual period was at age 50, and the average age of menopause is 51.4 years. Late menopause would be a risk factor for developing endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia and endometrial cancer.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Uterine fibroids:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Uterine fibroids can cause abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal patients. However, fibroids are not a risk factor for endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia and endometrial cancer.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Factor V Leiden mutation increases the risk of thrombosis. If a patient with factor V Leiden is on an anticoagulant, that can be a cause of uterine bleeding. However, it is not associated with endometrial cancer.</span></div>",
