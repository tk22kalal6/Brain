He has no signs or symptoms of respiratory distress or hypoxemia and has evidence of <strong>wheezing localized to the right lung</strong>. This patient&#8217;s presentation and his age are consistent with a <strong>foreign body aspiration</strong>. <strong>Bronchoscopy&#160;</strong>is the most appropriate next step for diagnosis and treatment.<br><br>For children presenting with respiratory symptoms, <strong>Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability and Exposure (ABCDE)</strong> should be assessed. If a patient is unstable, appropriate interventions should be taken, such as stabilizing airway, breathing, and circulation with possible intubation and intravenous fluids. If a patient is stable, then management depends on the diagnosis. When <strong>lower airway obstruction</strong> is present, the patient may have <strong>hypoxemia&#160;</strong>and/or <strong>respiratory distress</strong>. In these situations, <strong>oxygen&#160;</strong>and mechanical ventilation should be given as needed. Lower airway obstruction can also cause diffuse wheezing, such as during an asthma exacerbation, and albuterol is appropriate. <br><br>Foreign body aspiration most commonly occurs in children younger than two years old, and it can be life threatening. In witnessed episodes of cough and choking, the diagnosis is clear. With large objects, the obstruction may occur higher up and patients may present with stridor and respiratory distress. If the event is not witnessed and there is <strong>lower airway obstruction</strong>, signs can be more subtle, including <strong>acute onset coughing</strong>. On physical exam, patients may have <strong>localized wheezing or the unilateral absence of breath sounds</strong>. Obstruction typically occurs in the <strong>right lung</strong> since the right mainstem bronchus is wider and runs more vertically than the left mainstem bronchus. When foreign body aspiration is suspected based on clinical findings, <strong>bronchoscopy&#160;</strong>can be both <strong>diagnostic and therapeutic with the removal of the foreign body</strong>. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Albuterol:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Albuterol is the appropriate treatment for asthma.

      "solution": "This patient is a tall, thin male who developed sudden-onset chest pain and shortness of breath. The vital signs are notable for mild tachycardia. Chest x-ray reveals a small <strong>primary spontaneous pneumothorax</strong>, which is defined as one wherein the distance between the chest wall and visceral pleural margin is 2 cm or less. Patients with a small pneumothorax and minimal respiratory symptoms can be managed with supplemental <strong>100% oxygen</strong> and an <strong>observation period</strong> of usually six hours. After the observation period, a repeat chest x ray is performed. If the pneumothorax is unchanged or has improved, then the patient is deemed stable for discharge. Most small pneumothoraces will resolve over approximately 7-10 days. &#160; <br><br>For larger pneumothoraces (&gt; 2cm distance between the visceral pleura and chest wall) causing prominent respiratory distress, a <strong>tube thoracostomy</strong> should be performed. This procedure is accomplished by inserting a chest tube at the <strong>4th or 5th space mid axillary line</strong> on the affected side. Other indications for chest tube insertion include large traumatic pneumothorax, any pneumothorax with concomitant hemothorax, tension pneumothorax, bilateral pneumothorax, pneumothorax needing ventilator support, or exacerbation of a pneumothorax after conservative therapy.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ 100% FiO2 and observation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tube thoracostomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Chest tube insertion is indicated for any traumatic pneumothorax, pneumothorax with a concomitant hemothorax, tension pneumothorax, or large pneumothorax (&gt; 2 cm away from the chest wall) with significant respiratory symptoms.
