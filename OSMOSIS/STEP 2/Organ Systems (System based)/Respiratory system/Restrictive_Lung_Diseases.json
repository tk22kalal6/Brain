Transvaginal ultrasound has ruled out structural causes of AUB, and the patient has risk factors for endometrial cancer (i.e., type 2 diabetes, family history of Lynch syndrome). The most appropriate next diagnostic test is an <strong>endometrial biopsy</strong>. <br><br><strong>Endometrial biopsy</strong> is used to assess the endometrial tissue for benign glandular cells, endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN), or endometrial carcinoma. There are several ways to obtain a sample of the endometrial tissue, but the most common method is with an <strong>endometrial pipelle</strong>, which can be performed in the office. Hysteroscopy with direct biopsy of endometrial tissue can also be performed if results of a pipelle biopsy are inadequate, if a patient is unable to tolerate the office procedure, or if suspicion for EIN or endometrial carcinoma is high enough.<br><br>Endometrial biopsy is recommended for all patients who are <strong>&#8805;45 years of age with AUB</strong>, and for all <strong>postmenopausal patients</strong> with an <strong>endometrial thickness &gt;4 mm</strong>, due to the increased risk of endometrial carcinoma. In premenopausal patients, endometrial thickness does not correlate with the risk of endometrial cancer. In patients with AUB who are under 45 years of age, biopsy is indicated if risk factors for EIN or endometrial cancer are present. These include a history of unopposed estrogen exposure, type 2 diabetes, nulliparity, early age of menarche, late age of menopause, and a personal or family history of Lynch syndrome. In patients of any age with persistent AUB despite medical management, endometrial biopsy is also warranted. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Endometrial biopsy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Pelvic MRI is primarily used to further evaluate structural abnormalities such as fibroids or adenomyosis when ultrasound findings are inconclusive or in preoperative planning.

When interventions are necessary or desired by the patient, things to consider include the location of the leiomyoma, current desire for pregnancy, current desire for contraception, pre or post menopausal status, <strong>desire for future pregnancies</strong>, and whether or not the <strong>treatment goal</strong> is to <strong>reduce symptoms related to tumor bulk</strong>, and/or to <strong>reduce heavy menstrual bleeding</strong>.<br><br><strong>Medical management</strong> is typically used when the goal of treatment is to improve <strong>heavy menstrual bleeding</strong>. Medications include <strong>oral GnRH antagonists</strong>, such as elagolix and relugolix with hormonal add-back therapy to treat hypoestrogenic effects like hot flashes; the <strong>levonorgestrel intrauterine system or IUS</strong>; and contraceptive hormones, such as <strong>combined oral birth control pills</strong>, progesterone only pills and depot medroxyprogesterone. Another option for medical management is <strong>GnRH agonists</strong>, like <strong>depot leuprolide</strong>, which help decrease uterine size and bleeding and can be used as a bridge to other interventions, like surgery.

However, there is a risk of recurrent leiomyomas. <strong>Hysterectomy </strong>is the definitive surgical management for leiomyomas.

      "solution": "<strong>Platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents</strong> include cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. These agents inhibit DNA repair and replication by <strong>cross-linking adjacent guanines,</strong> preventing the DNA strands from being separated. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The type of DNA repair that occurs depends on if the damage is single or double-stranded. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Single-strand repair&#160;</strong>is accomplished via nucleotide, base excision, and mismatch repair. In <strong>nucleotide excision repair,</strong> specific endonucleases excise oligonucleotides that contain a pyrimidine dimer. A base-specific glycosylase removes the damaged base, subsequently filled in by DNA polymerase in base excision repair. In<strong>&#160;mismatch repair,</strong> mismatched bases in a new unmethylated DNA strand are excised. &#160; <br><br>On the other hand, double-strand repair occurs through non-homologous end-joining or homologous recombination. <strong>Non-homologous end-joining</strong> involves reattaching the ends of 2 DNA fragments that may not be homologous. This process causes loss of DNA and thus a higher rate of mutation. <strong>Homologous recombination</strong> requires two homologous DNA duplexes to occur. There is no loss of nucleotides, so the integrity of the DNA is better maintained. &#160; &#160; <br><br>Platinum-containing compounds are <strong>cell phase nonspecific </strong>and have the potential to<strong>&#160;inhibit both single-strand and double-strand repair. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cross-linking of adjacent guanine nucleotides in DNA:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Formation of thymine dimers:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>These are covalent linkages induced by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
