Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia should be up to date on immunizations <strong>for influenza, COVID-19, and pneumococcus</strong>. If a patient has only received PCV13, they need to receive a dose of pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV20) or <strong>pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23)</strong>.<br><br>Similar management strategies are used for patients with <strong>primary ciliary dyskinesia</strong> and <strong>cystic fibrosis</strong> (CF). Maintaining airway clearance and preventing respiratory infections with <strong>chest physiotherapy</strong> and regular <strong>exercise&#160;</strong>for both diseases is important. <strong>Nebulized hypertonic saline and recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase)</strong> are used in both diseases, but more often in patients with cystic fibrosis. Both types of patients should receive immunizations including PCV20 or PPSV23, influenza, and COVID-19. Respiratory infections should be treated promptly. Occasionally <strong>prophylactic Azithromycin</strong> is used in patients with recurrent bronchiectasis. If a patient is prone to <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <strong>nebulized tobramycin</strong> is often used.<br><br>Patients with <strong>cystic fibrosis</strong> often develop gastrointestinal symptoms and require additional nutritional and pancreatic support. This includes close monitoring of growth, <strong>pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy</strong>, supplementation with <strong>fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)</strong>, and <strong>oral salts</strong>. Some patients require insulin or ursodiol.<br><br><strong>Surveillance </strong>includes chest computed tomography and routine sputum cultures in patients with PCD, chest x-rays, and regular oropharyngeal cultures in patients with CF. Due to the gastrointestinal complications seen in patients with CF, they should undergo routine screening with liver function tests and oral glucose tolerance testing.<br><br>For patients with CF and PCD, Ear, Nose, and Throat physicians (ENTs) are often consulted regarding possible tympanostomy with tube placement and nasal polypectomy.

Premature infants experiencing apnea require a comprehensive evaluation to identify the underlying cause. Apnea of prematurity is a <strong>diagnosis of exclusion</strong>.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Consanguinity&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Consanguinity increases the risk of autosomal recessive genetic disorders, which can lead to congenital anomalies.

The patient&#8217;s mother <strong>did not receive adequate antenatal steroids</strong> prior to delivery. On lung auscultation, the patient has <strong>decreased breath sounds</strong> and <strong>crackles</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>throughout the lungs bilaterally. Given the patient&#8217;s prematurity, lack of adequate antenatal steroids, and non-focal lung findings, <strong>respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)</strong> is the most likely diagnosis. <strong>Chest x-ray</strong> findings associated with respiratory distress syndrome include <strong>diffuse ground glass opacities with air bronchograms</strong> along with <strong>low lung volumes</strong>. <br><br><strong>Respiratory distress syndrome is a common cause of respiratory distress in preterm infants and occurs secondary to surfactant deficiency typically produced by alveolar cells between 24-36 weeks' gestation</strong>. Risk factors for RDS include <strong>prematurity, exceptionally low birth weight</strong> (&lt;1500 grams), multiple gestation pregnancies, male sex, maternal diabetes, fetal distress or asphyxia, c-section delivery without labor, and family history of neonatal RDS. If there is concern for premature labor, mothers should be given <strong>two doses of antenatal corticosteroids</strong> to stimulate alveolar surfactant production. <br><br>On physical examination, patients with RDS typically exhibit <strong>tachypnea, nasal flaring, and retractions</strong>. There can be <strong>poor aeration</strong> and <strong>crackles </strong>on lung auscultation. Due to hypoxemia, the patient may be <strong>cyanotic</strong>. Clinical diagnosis of RDS can be made in preterm infants with respiratory distress and <strong>chest x-ray</strong> findings of <strong>low lung volumes</strong> and the classic <strong>diffuse reticulogranular ground glass opacities </strong>with <strong>air bronchograms</strong>. <strong>Echocardiography </strong>and <strong>pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturations</strong> may be ordered if there is a need to differentiate RDS from other causes of respiratory distress in the neonatal period. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Diffuse ground glass opacities with air bronchograms:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Focal infiltrates with air bronchograms:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;A&#160;chest radiograph&#160;showing&#160;focal infiltrates&#160;with air&#160;bronchograms would&#160;be seen&#160;in&#160;patients with&#160;neonatal pneumonia.

Given his history of end-stage renal disease, the most appropriate medication to administer for rapid sequence intubation is the non-depolarizing drug <strong>rocuronium</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Neuromuscular blocking medications are used most commonly during intubation, prolonged surgeries, and for the facilitation of mechanical ventilation. Several critical considerations arise when deciding whether to administer a non-depolarizing agent or a depolarizing agent. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Succinylcholine</strong>, the most widely used depolarization agent, carries a risk of inducing malignant hyperthermia and<strong>&#160;hyperkalemic cardiac arrest.</strong> The medication should be used with caution in patients with hyperkalemia and end-stage renal disease. It should be avoided in patients with <strong>burns causing significant tissue damage</strong> (due to increased risk of hyperkalemia) or history of malignant hyperthermia. In addition, succinylcholine is contraindicated in those with <strong>neurological injury&#160;</strong>(e.g., cerebral vascular accident, spinal cord injury) or <strong>degenerative neuromuscular conditions</strong> due to upregulation of acetylcholine receptors and risk of life-threatening hyperkalemia. For patients without any of the aforementioned contraindications, succinylcholine is the preferred agent of choice for <strong>rapid sequence intubation&#160;</strong>given its rapid onset and short duration of action. &#160; <br><br>In contrast, nondepolarizing medications such as <strong>cisatracurium </strong>and <strong>rocuronium</strong> have a much longer half-life and duration of action when compared to succinylcholine. These medications are ideal agents for <strong>prolonged surgery</strong> or<strong> mechanical ventilation synchrony. </strong>The specific nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker to use is largely dependent on the desired duration of effect as well as the patient&#8217;s hepatic and renal function. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Rocuronium:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Succinylcholine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient has a history of end-stage renal disease and is at risk of hyperkalemia.
