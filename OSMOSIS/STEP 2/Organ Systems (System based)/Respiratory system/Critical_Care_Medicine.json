She has continued to leak clear fluid since that time, but has no contractions, vaginal bleeding, or decreased fetal movement. Her first delivery was a full-term birth 2 years ago. She also has a history of herpes simplex virus (HSV), type 2, managed with prophylactic valacyclovir. Records show that routine antenatal screenings, including a pap test for this pregnancy, have all been normal. Temperature is 36.5&#176;C (97.8&#176;F), pulse is 78/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mmHg. On exam, the abdomen is gravid and non-tender. A pelvic exam shows gross pooling of clear fluid on the speculum, and the cervix is visually dilated 3 cm. A non-stress test (NST) has a baseline of 150/min, moderate variability, 2 accelerations, and no contractions. Which of the following clinical findings would be a contraindication to induction of labor?",

In the setting of ruptured membranes, a <strong>pulsating purple mass</strong> within the cervix is an <strong>umbilical cord prolapse</strong>, which is an <strong>obstetric emergency</strong> and an <strong>absolute contraindication</strong> to vaginal delivery and IOL. In this situation, the fetus must be manually elevated off the cervix and the patient taken for emergency cesarean. <br><br>IOL refers to the use of <strong>mechanical processes</strong> (e.g., mechanical dilation, artificial rupture of membranes [AROM]), and <strong>pharmacologic agents</strong> (e.g., prostaglandins, oxytocin) to mimic labor. Although regarded as safe, IOL does increase the risk of <strong>obstetric complications</strong> compared to spontaneous labor. The risks include tachysystole, non-reassuring fetal monitoring, cesarean birth, placental abruption, uterine rupture, intrapartum intraamniotic infection, and umbilical cord prolapse. For these reasons, it is important to be familiar with appropriate indications and contraindications for IOL (detailed in the table below) to minimize the risks associated with the procedure.<br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ef_ko_cMRQee2UYODwGsF6FHTcGh7Nlz/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ A purple pulsating mass in the cervical canal:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Visible&#160;Oral HSV lesions&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Visible&#160;Genital HSV lesions or prodromal&#160;symptoms,&#160;would&#160;be a contraindication for IOL, but&#160;the presence of&#160;oral&#160;HSV&#160;lesions would not be a contraindication&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ First delivery was standard cesarean birth:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;A&#160;history of a&#160;full-thickness uterine incision that extends through the&#160;strong&#160;upper&#160;contractile fibers&#160;of the uterus&#160;is a contraindication to vaginal birth due to the increased risk of uterine rupture associated with labor&#160;contractions.&#160;However,&#160;the&#160;incision in a&#160;standard, low transverse cesarean birth (LTCB)&#160;is made in the lower uterine&#160;segment and&#160;is&#160;at&#160;lower risk of rupture&#160;than&#160;prior&#160;high-vertical incisions, and therefore, is&#160;not&#160;a contraindication to IOL.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Single deepest vertical pocket of 1.2 cm on ultrasound:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Oligohydramnios,&#160;defined as a single DVP of &lt;&#160;2 cm,&#160;at term is&#160;an indication, rather than a contraindication, for IOL.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Two Short variable decelerations on NST:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Non-reassuring fetal monitoring is a contraindication to IOL.

Patients with <strong>molar pregnancies</strong> are at risk of developing <strong>gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN)</strong>. If the <strong>post-D&C hCG levels remain elevated</strong>, patients meet criteria for GTN. <strong>Low-risk GTN</strong> typically responds well to <strong>single-agent chemotherapy</strong>, which is the recommended initial treatment for this patient. <br><br>GTN is the <strong>malignant proliferation and spread of trophoblastic tissue</strong>. It is diagnosed by the persistence of hCG following a pregnancy event and occurs most often after molar pregnancies. Once diagnosed, the patient is assigned a stage and a risk score based on the initial evaluation results. In general, <strong>low-risk features</strong> include a younger age at presentation, a shorter time interval between the causative pregnancy and diagnosis of GTN, smaller primary tumor size, lower pre-treatment hCG levels, and no or few metastases. <br><br>The most common forms of GTN, including <strong>invasive moles</strong> and <strong>choriocarcinoma</strong>, are highly sensitive to chemotherapy. For this reason, low-risk disease is usually treated with single-agent chemotherapy. An overview of the appropriate management for low- and high-risk disease is presented in the table above.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Single-agent chemotherapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Multi-agent chemotherapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient has low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

A twin gestation and a <strong>lambda (&#955;) sign</strong> on ultrasound indicate a <strong>dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA)</strong> pregnancy, meaning that each fetus has its own amniotic sac and placenta. In these cases, delivery should occur <strong>between 38 and 38 6/7 weeks EGA</strong>.

A disadvantage is the need for an <strong>office visit for insertion and removal</strong>. <strong>Contraindications to an IUD</strong> include current or recent pelvic inflammatory disease, sexually transmitted infection at the time of insertion, uterine malformations, pregnancy or suspected pregnancy, malignancy of the reproductive organs, and undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding. <strong>Behavior-based methods</strong> of contraception such as withdrawal and fertility awareness, and <strong>direct barriers</strong> such as condoms and diaphragms are options as well, but tend to have <strong>less reliability</strong> due to human error.<br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/fuUjaZh6QjaTL6F_SwhN-MhdRB6QpYNl/_.png\"></div><br><sup>Image of an intrauterine device by Sarahmirk is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International, reproduced from <sup>Wikimedia Commons<sup> &#160;</sup></sup></sup><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Copper IUD:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is not recommended for patients over the age of 35 who smoke cigarettes.

She is interested in learning about sterilization. Her sex partners have all been biologically female, and she has had a single, long-term partner for the past year. Her medical history is notable for severe endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, and an appendectomy for a ruptured appendix. She takes oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for her endometriosis, which reduces pelvic pain somewhat. The physical exam reveals a 4 cm well-healed incision in the right lower quadrant; on a bimanual pelvic exam, the patient experiences generalized pelvic discomfort, and the uterus has poor mobility. Comprehensive contraceptive counseling is provided. The patient is surprised to learn there are so many options and decides to research long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods. At this time, why is permanent sterilization contraindicated in this patient?",

      "solution": "<strong>Sterilization</strong>, also known as <strong>permanent contraception</strong>, is a surgical procedure that is intended to permanently <strong>prevent future pregnancies.</strong> The only indication for permanent contraception is a <strong>patient&#8217;s desire</strong> for the procedure. Likewise, the only <strong>absolute contraindication</strong> to sterilization is the <strong>lack of consent from a fully informed patient.</strong> This means that for the patient to provide consent, she must be free from any coercion and truly <strong>understand all the options&#160;</strong>and the implications of her decision. At the end of this encounter, the patient expresses <strong>uncertainty about permanent contraception</strong> by stating her desire to learn more about LARCs. Therefore, performing a sterilization procedure on this patient is contraindicated until she confidently rejects all other forms of contraception in favor of sterilization. &#160; <br><br>Although patient desire is the only indication for sterilization, numerous patient factors may be obtained in history and exams that make <strong>alternative forms of contraception</strong> more favorable, as detailed in the table below. The patient should be counseled on these alternatives to obtain informed consent. Additionally, the risk of unintended pregnancy should be weighed against the risks of surgery and this should be discussed with the patient to obtain informed consent. &#160; <br><br>It is important for the counseling provider to <strong>clearly explain all the relevant medical facts&#160;</strong>and to make a medically sound <strong>contraceptive recommendation</strong>. For example, the physician in the vignette should inform the patient of her increased risk of regret due to her young age, as well as the potential increased risk of surgical injury due to suspected adhesive disease from endometriosis, and that for these reasons, a LARC is a better option to consider right now. However, the final decision to proceed with sterilization should always lie with the well-informed patient and may be based on personal preferences. Therefore, if the patient returns with strong, clear convictions desiring sterilization, it would be appropriate to proceed with the procedure at that time. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/_6vwkRK2TeGbPddtpPDGc7VLQGuub8uq/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Uncertainty about permanent contraception:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Having exclusively female sexual partners:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The biological sex and gender of a person&#8217;s partner(s) is not a contraindication for providing permanent sterilization.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Age &lt; 25 and lack of living children:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>There is no association between the number of living children a person has and the likelihood of regretting permanent sterilization, though a young age at the time of sterilization is associated with regret of permanent sterilization. Despite this, medical ethicists conclude that paternalism and infringing on one&#8217;s reproductive autonomy are worse than allowing a patient to make a well-informed decision that they may regret later. Therefore, neither young age nor low parity are contraindications to the procedure in a well-counseled patient.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Severe pelvic adhesive disease:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Endometriosis and ruptured appendicitis can both lead to severe pelvic adhesive disease, which is also suggested by poor mobility of pelvic structures on exam. Pelvic adhesions do increase the risk of surgical complications. However, patients have the right to reproductive autonomy, and a well-informed patient may still choose permanent sterilization, even if she chooses to stay on OCPs to control pain or bleeding symptoms or is not a perfect surgical candidate.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sterilization is not contraindicated in this patient:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>At the end of this encounter, the patient expresses uncertainty regarding her desire for permanent contraception by stating her intention to learn more about LARCs.

Migraine with aura is a contraindication to systemic COC due to an increased risk of <strong>stroke</strong>. <br><br><strong>Reversible contraception</strong> refers to any method of pregnancy prevention that doesn&#8217;t impact future fertility. The evaluation of a patient who desires reversible contraception begins by assessing the patient&#8217;s <strong>age </strong>and the timing of their last <strong>menstrual period</strong>. <strong>Sexual history</strong>, while not required, helps guide conversations on safe sexual practices and can be assessed using the &#8220;5 Ps&#8221;: Partners, Practices, Past history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), Prevention of STIs, and Pregnancy intention. Decisions about what type of contraception to use are driven by <strong>patient preference</strong> as well as the patient's <strong>medical eligibility criteria</strong> (MEC). The MEC is a set of standards that provides recommendations on the safety of contraceptives in the setting of different medical conditions and includes factors from the <strong>patient&#8217;s history</strong> such as active or prior medical diagnoses, mental health conditions, breastfeeding status, postpartum status, and medications.<br><br>When prescribing oral contraception, vital signs should be performed and the patient&#8217;s <strong>blood pressure and BMI should be assessed</strong>. These can be evaluated from either a current or prior recent office visit, as an in-person visit is not required before prescribing contraception. Hypertension is a contraindication to the use of combined oral contraception pills. Factors relating to pelvic health, such as evidence of <strong>pelvic infections</strong> or <strong>uterine anomalies</strong> should be considered as well; however, a <strong>pelvic examination is not required</strong> before prescribing oral contraceptive pills. Contraindications to a particular form of contraception may be revealed from either the historical or physical examination portions of the assessment. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Do you have a history of migraines with aura (classic migraines)?:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Have you ever been pregnant before?:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: While taking a comprehensive obstetric and gynecologic history is part of a thorough office visit, prior pregnancies are not a contraindication to systemic hormonal contraception.

Unless there is a specific indication for mastectomy, breast-conserving therapy is prefered and includes lumpectomy with RT. Patients with clinically suspicious axillary lymph nodes should be evaluated prior to surgery with imaging and biopsy. Those without clinical evidence of lymph node involvement should undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy during surgery, as this patient.

The tender axillary lymph nodes are most likely due to reactive lymphadenopathy from the infection. &#160;<br><br>Lactational mastitis is a common condition, affecting up to 10% of breastfeeding women. The risk is especially high during the first 3 months. The pathogenesis of lactational mastitis is complex and may occur in the settings of poor drainage, infrequent feeding, engorgement, nipple excoriation or cracking, rapid weaning or illness. The pathogenesis involves <strong>nipple trauma</strong>, which results in poor milk drainage and breast engorgement, which leads to compression of additional milk ducts, further engorgement, and milk stasis. Bacteria are subsequently able to penetrate the skin and proliferate within the stagnant milk. <em><strong>Staphylococcus aureus</strong></em> is the most common causative organism, which can colonize the neonate&#8217;s nasopharynx, leading to infection within the breast during feeding. The diagnosis of mastitis is based upon the clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests are generally not required; however, culture can assist in guiding the antibiotics regimen. &#160;<br><br>Initial management of non-severe cases is aimed to reduce pain and swelling (e.g., NSAIDs, cold compresses) and <strong>continuation of breastfeeding</strong> -- since lactostasis always precedes mastitis, active expression of breast milk to get rid of milk stagnation is of utmost importance. Management of infective lactational mastitis (persistent symptoms beyond 12 hours plus fever) involves<strong>&#160;antibiotic therapy</strong> with activity against S. aureus (nafcillin, oxacillin) and continuation of breastfeeding. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Your condition is due to an underlying malignancy; chemotherapy is indicated; stop breastfeeding:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive type of breast cancer that can occur in women at any age.

Despite antibiotics, the symptoms will recur. Findings include localized erythema and induration with a breast mass or masses with or without skin changes. Mammogram and core needle biopsy are needed to rule out malignancy.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Breast ultrasound:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Continue dicloxacillin and reassess in 48 hours:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>While continuation of antibiotics is essential in mastitis treatment, this patient has not improved on the prescribed antibiotics and therefore needs additional evaluation with ultrasound to rule out abscess.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient likely has puerperal mastitis complicated by abscess formation.
