Risk factors for uterine leiomyomas include <strong>family history of leiomyomas</strong>, early menarche, premenopausal status, increasing interval since last birth, hypertension, and obesity.<br><br><strong>Uterine leiomyomas</strong>, or <strong>fibroids</strong>, are <strong>benign&#160;</strong>tumors that grow in or around the uterus. They arise from the smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts of the myometrium. Patient presentation is largely dependent on the size, location, and number of leiomyomas present. Leiomyomas may be intramural (i.e., within the muscle layer), subserosal (i.e., underneath the outer lining of the uterus), or submucosal (i.e., underneath the endometrium). Subserosal and submucosal tumors may grow in a &#8220;<strong>pedunculated</strong>&#8221; fashion, where the mass is attached to the uterus by a thin stalk.<br><br>Most leiomyomas are small and <strong>asymptomatic</strong>. When symptoms are present they may include <strong>heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding</strong>, with or without anemia. Other symptoms such as <strong>pelvic pressure and pain</strong>, urinary frequency, and constipation can result from <strong>uterine enlargement</strong>. Leiomyomas can also cause reproductive problems, including <strong>infertility&#160;</strong>and <strong>miscarriage</strong>. The physical examination may be normal, or an <strong>enlarged or irregular uterus</strong> may be palpated.

In patients who wish to preserve fertility and have no evidence of carcinoma on endometrial sampling, <strong>progestin therapy</strong> is appropriate after counseling on the risk of progression to endometrial carcinoma.

If minimal or no response is seen, sampling should be repeated after another 3 to 6 months. If there is no response after 9 to 12 months, a hysterectomy may be indicated.

      "solution": "The combination of <strong>pelvic pain and bloating</strong> in a 22-year-old woman, a <strong>solid ovarian mass</strong> with internal vascularity on ultrasound, and <strong>elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)</strong> levels, points strongly towards a diagnosis of <strong>dysgerminoma</strong>. The <strong>\"fried egg\" appearance</strong> is a hallmark feature of dysgerminomas. It refers to the tumor cells being <strong>large, with clear cytoplasm</strong> and central, rounded nuclei. The clear cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus resembles the white of a fried egg, while the nucleus itself resembles the yolk. Lymphocytic infiltration, also characteristic of dysgerminomas, further aids in confirming the diagnosis.<br><br><strong>Dysgerminoma&#160;</strong>is the most common <strong>malignant germ cell tumor</strong> of the ovary. It typically presents in adolescent and <strong>young women</strong> as a <strong>unilateral solid ovarian mass</strong> but may be bilateral in 10% to 20% of cases. It is occasionally associated with gonadal dysgenesis. While <strong>LDH is elevated</strong>, other tumor markers are not typically elevated. Therefore, the presence of normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), CA-125, inhibin A, inhibin B, estradiol, and testosterone, further supports a diagnosis of dysgerminoma in this patient. In addition, the patient lacks symptoms suggestive of hormonal imbalances, such as virilization and irregular bleeding, that are often seen with other types of tumors.<br><br>When a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an ovarian neoplasm, the main objective is to determine if it is benign and can be managed expectantly or malignant, requiring more immediate intervention. Ultrasound findings that are consistent with malignancy include a complex mass with septations, solid components, increased doppler flow, and the presence of ascites. Tumor markers may help make the diagnosis and distinguish among the various types of ovarian cancer, but are not definitive. In the end, a <strong>definitive diagnosis</strong> can only be made with <strong>pathologic examination</strong>.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/hEMfYQuBRDCGWt45jrVsfj76R5awSi_w/_.png\"></div><br><sup>Dysgerminoma characterized by uniform cells resembling primordial germ cells separated by fibrous septa with lymphocytes.

In patients with a vascular ring/sling, <strong>symptoms improve with neck extension </strong>and <strong>worsen with neck flexion</strong>.<br><br>When assessing a patient with a lower airway obstruction, it is key to <strong>identify onset of symptoms</strong>. Onset is typically categorized into congenital, abrupt onset, subacute onset, and gradual onset. Diseases with gradual onset can be further differentiated based on the <strong>triggers </strong>for the symptoms. Triggers can range from environmental, such as cold temperature and exercise in the setting of asthma, to feeding in cases of GERD. <strong>Position changes</strong> are another trigger of symptoms in cases of <strong>tracheobronchomalacia </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>vascular ring/slings</strong>. Patients with tracheobronchomalacia are more affected by supine vs. prone position (symptoms worsen with supine position), whereas patients with vascular ring/sling are more affected by neck flexion vs. extension (symptoms worsen with neck flexion).<br><br>Oftentimes, the history and physical examination will allow for high clinical suspicion in cases of lower airway obstruction, but ultimately, additional testing is necessary for formal diagnosis. Bronchoscopy can be used to diagnose tracheobronchomalacia. CTA, MRA, or barium swallow study as part of initial work up can diagnose vascular ring/sling.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) can also cause <strong>pancreatic insufficiency</strong> which can lead to <strong>bulky, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea)</strong>.<br><br>Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene resulting in a defect in chloride channels affecting organs with secretory functions like the lungs and pancreas. &#160;Due to the defect in chloride channels, abnormally viscous secretions that are thick and sticky are produced. This primarily <strong>impairs airway clearance</strong> and increases the <strong>risk of respiratory infection</strong>. It often results in <strong>pancreatic insufficiency</strong> leading to <strong>steatorrhea </strong>characterized by frequent, bulky, foul-smelling stools that may be oily, and <strong>failure to thrive</strong> or poor weight gain due to malabsorption of fat and protein. Patients may also experience acute or recurrent pancreatitis and focal biliary cirrhosis. <strong>Newborns </strong>with CF may present with <strong>meconium ileus </strong>or<strong> prolonged jaundice</strong>.

On physical examination, patients can have <strong>nasal polyps, digital clubbing, and middle ear effusions</strong>.
