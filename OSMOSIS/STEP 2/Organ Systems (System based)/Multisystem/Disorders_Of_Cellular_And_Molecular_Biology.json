      "text": "A 26-year-old man presents to the clinic for evaluation of fever, fatigue, and sore throat, which have been ongoing for 2 weeks. He thinks he may have &#8220;mono.&#8221; The patient has had sexual intercourse with three partners over the past year and has been using condoms inconsistently. Temperature is 38.2&#176;C (100.8&#176;F), blood pressure is 110/85 mmHg, and pulse is 73/min. Physical examination reveals cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The tonsils are erythematous but normal in size. An HIV PCR test is positive for HIV-1. The patient is started on an antiretroviral regimen of emtricitabine, tenofovir, and dolutegravir. What is the mechanism of action by which dolutegravir acts as an HIV medication? &#160; ",

      "solution": "This patient is started on <strong>dolutegravir</strong>, which works as an integrase inhibitor. &#160; <br><br>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is initiated at the diagnosis of HIV infection. It typically consists of a 3-drug regimen, consisting of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and an integrase inhibitor. &#160; <br><br>Integrase inhibitors, as the name suggests, reversibly inhibits HIV integrase, thereby <strong>blocking the integration of the HIV genome into host cell chromosomes.&#160;</strong>These medications are recognized by the presence of<strong>&#160;&#8220;tegra&#8221;&#160;</strong>within their name (e.g., bictegravir, dolutegravir, elvitegravir, raltegravir). &#160; &#160; <br><br>Common side effects associated with integrase inhibitor therapy include<strong>&#160;nausea, headache,</strong> and <strong>myopathy with an increased creatine kinase level.&#160;</strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Protease inhibitor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Protease inhibitors include medications ending in &#8220;-navir&#8221;, such as atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir. By blocking viral protease, these agents are able to prevent HIV mRNA cleavage and the maturation of new viruses. They are associated with hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal intolerance, and lipodystrophy. &#160; &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Integrase inhibitor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Entry inhibitor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Entry inhibitors include enfuvirtide and maraviroc. Enfurvitide binds viral gp41 whereas maraviroc binds CCR-5 on T-cells/monocytes. In contrast, dolutegravir works as an integrase inhibitor. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are a mainstay of HIV treatment. They competitively inhibit nucleotides from binding to reverse transcriptase, thereby terminating DNA chain elongation. Examples of NRTIs include abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) include delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine. These medications allosterically inhibit reverse transcriptase, thereby terminating DNA chain elongation. In contrast, dolutegravir works as an integrase inhibitor. &#160;</span></div>",
