Following treatment, she develops palpitations and ECG changes that include ST segment depression and T wave inversions (U-waves) indicative of <strong>amphotericin-induced hypokalemia. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>Amphotericin B can induce nephrotoxicity via tubular injury and vasoconstriction, which ultimately results in hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and the RTA (normal anion gap acidosis). In fungal cells, amphotericin B binds to ergosterol, a component of the fungal cell membrane, and creates micropores. Similarly, it binds to cholesterol in host cell membranes (with lesser affinity) and increases membrane permeability. As a result, membrane electrochemical gradients are reduced, particularly between the renal tubular cells and the lumen. Potassium subsequently moves down this concentration gradient, resulting in a loss of potassium and limitated hydrogen ion secretion. Renal magnesium loss can also occur secondary to amphotericin nephrotoxicity. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Acute kidney injury is typically the first sign of amphotericin B induced nephrotoxicity. Normally, as the sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule increases, more NaCl diffuses into the macula densa. Tubuloglomerular feedback is initiated and afferent arteriole vasoconstriction occurs to limit NaCl losses. With amphotericin B use, permeability of macula densa cells increases and results in profound afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, a fall in GFR, and a subsequent rise in creatinine. &#160;<br><br>In order to limit amphotericin B associated nephrotoxicity, <strong>lipid formulations (liposomal and lipid complex) are used. Salt loading or volume expansion</strong> has also been found to be effective in limiting the fall in GFR as it reduces the sensitivity of the tubuloglomerular feedback system. Preventive measures to reduce nephrotoxicity include <strong>administering lower doses</strong> and <strong>avoiding co-administration of other nephrotoxic agents </strong>such as aminoglycosides or cyclosporine. Other adverse effects include fever, chills, and body aches. Intrathecal injections for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis can cause seizures, headache, and nerve palsies.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Hypokalemia &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Wide anion gap metabolic acidosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A wide anion gap metabolic acidosis is frequently associated with ethylene glycol or salicylate use, diabetic ketoacidosis, and methanol poisoning.

Hematologic toxicity is one of cyclophosphamide's most common, dose-limiting side effects. &#160; <br><br>Alkylating agents, like cyclophosphamide, are chemotherapeutic agents non-cell-cycle specific.

The hepatic process of glucuronidation relies on hepatic carbohydrate reserves, and in the fasting or malnourished state, glucuronidation of acetaminophen is reduced, which leads to increased microsomal metabolism and subsequent production of NAPQI. Normally, this toxic metabolite is inactivated by an antioxidant called <strong>glutathione</strong>. In therapeutic doses, acetaminophen does not cause severe side effects.

Cytochrome p450 is an enzyme that&#160;contains&#160;heme. In patients taking p450 inducers (e.g.&#160;barbiturates), circulating levels of heme are reduced as more p450 enzymes are produced. Lack of circulating heme reduces the negative feedback of ALA synthase-1, promoting the production of more heme (see image below). The underlying etiology of acute intermittent porphyria is an impairment in the activity of porphobilinogen deaminase, which leads to an&#160;accumulation of porphobilinogen (PBG). This can be detected in the urine.&#160;High levels&#160;of ALA and PBG can build up and become toxic.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by a mutation in the&#160;HMBS&#160;(also called PBGD) gene, which codes for porphobilinogen deaminase.

Of patients that do experience a&#160;porphyric&#160;attack, they are usually precipitated by three main factors &#8211; cytochrome p450 inducers, prolonged fasting, or acute infection (see image below).&#160;Porphyric&#160;attacks occur with varying symptomatology and usually include some combination of abdominal pain, back pain, neuropathic limb&#160;pain, and&#160;nausea and vomiting.

Examples of MAOI include tranylcypromine, phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and selegiline. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The enzyme MAO exists as MOAb and MAOa. MAOb metabolizes dopamine and MAOa metabolizes both serotonin and norepinephrine. <strong>Selegiline is a selective MAOb inhibitor at low doses and a non-selective MAO inhibitor at higher doses. Low-dose selegiline does not exert antidepressant effects and is a pharmacological agent used in the treatment of parkinson&#8217;s disease to increase cerebral levels of the monoamine dopamine.&#160;</strong> At higher doses, selegiline functions as a nonselective MAO inhibitor and is included in the management of treatment-resistant depression and atypical depression. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Other serotonergic antidepressants must be discontinued for 2 weeks prior to initiating an MAOI to prevent adverse effects such as a hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. Dietary restrictions limit the use of MAOI particularly tyramine-containing foods such as cured meat, cheese, and wines should be avoided to prevent a hypertensive crisis. Due to enhanced dopamine levels as a result of MAOb inhibition, selegiline can cause hypotension (which can put the elderly on treatment at an increased risk for falls and fractures), nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, gastrointestinal disturbances, urinary hesitancy, and myoclonic jerks. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/p9ot2O7zT4epFoWQVI9WAbPlRqy-B81j/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Resting tremors:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ History of bulimia nervosa&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Mirtazapine is an alpha2 antagonist that is used as an atypical antidepressant.

These findings are suggestive of <strong>neuroleptic malignant syndrome</strong> (NMS). The best initial step in management is to administer <strong>dantrolene</strong>.<br><br>NMS is a life-threatening neurological emergency that typically <strong>occurs days to weeks</strong> after starting the offending medication. It is associated with the use of <strong>typical antipsychotic drugs</strong> (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine) that block brain dopamine receptors (especially D2 receptors), <strong>antiemetic drugs</strong> (e.g., metoclopramide), and <strong>sometimes atypical antipsychotics</strong>.<br><br>NMS is characterized by <strong>confusion, coma, agitation, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability,&#160;</strong>and <strong>hyperthermia</strong>. These symptoms are almost identical to serotonin syndrome caused by antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, serotonin syndrome typically causes hyperreflexia and dilated pupils, whereas neuroleptic malignant syndrome is more commonly associated with <strong>hyporeflexia&#160;</strong>and <strong>normal pupils</strong>.<br><br>If the condition progresses, NMS can cause <strong>rhabdomyolysis&#160;</strong>and elevated creatinine kinase levels. Treatment of NMS consists of removing the offending agent and supportive care. In severe cases, <strong>dantrolene&#160;</strong>can be administered. Dantrolene depresses the excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle by acting as a ryanodine receptor antagonist and decreasing free intracellular calcium.<br><br>P.S.
