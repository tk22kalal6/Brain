However, the ulcer started giving off copious white discharge over the past few days. There has also been some pain and increasing redness around the area. Past medical history is significant for poorly-controlled type II diabetes mellitus. Current medications include metformin and insulin. Temperature is 37.6&#176;C (99.7&#176;F), blood pressure is 117/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respiratory rate is 12/min. Physical examination reveals a well-demarcated ulcer with a tender erythematous border and a sizeable purulent discharge on the left foot. Foot radiography does not show evidence of osteomyelitis. Wound cultures grow methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Blood cultures are negative. He is started on vancomycin and linezolid but fails to show improvement. He is subsequently started on tigecycline. What is the most likely adverse effect this patient will experience with tigecycline?",

The mechanism of amantadine-induced livedo reticularis is thought to occur secondary to altered catecholamine metabolism, which induces vasoconstriction in the dermal arterioles and limits flow to the capillary skin surface. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Amantadine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Selegiline:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Selegiline, an MAO-B inhibitor, is often used in patients &lt;65 years of age with mild Parkinson symptoms. A major side effect of MAO-B inhibitors includes drug interactions.

Petechial or purpuric rashes </strong>are seen with <strong>Rocky Mountain spotted fever. &#160; </strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Erythematous bull&#8217;s eye&#160;lesion&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect: </strong></span><span>Erythema&#160;</span><span>migrans</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>which is seen in patients with&#160;</span><span>L</span><span>yme</span><span>&#160;disease</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>presents as an</span><span>&#160;</span><span>erythematous bull&#8217;s eye lesion</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Th</span><span>is</span><span>&#160;patient&#160;</span><span>does not live in an area endemic&#160;</span><span>to</span><span>&#160;</span><span>L</span><span>yme</span><span>&#160;</span><span>disease,</span><span>&#160;and&#160;</span><span>he&#160;</span><span>has&#160;</span><span>exudative</span><span>&#160;</span><span>pharyngitis,&#160;</span><span>strawberry tongue,&#160;</span><span>cervical&#160;</span><span>lymphadenopathy</span><span>,&#160;</span><span>and a skin rash</span><span>;</span><span>&#160;the</span><span>&#160;</span><span>most likely&#160;</span><span>diagnosis</span><span>&#160;is&#160;</span><span>scarlet fever</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;which causes&#160;</span><span>a&#160;</span><span>sandpaper</span><span>-</span><span>like rash.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Erythematous target lesions with a dusky center&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>Lesions from&#160;</span><span>e</span><span>rythema multiforme</span><span>&#160;(EM)</span><span>&#160;a</span><span>ppear as&#160;</span><span>erythematous target lesions with a dusky center.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>The findings in this patient are more consistent with scarlet fever</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;which causes&#160;</span><span>a&#160;</span><span>sandpaper</span><span>-</span><span>like rash.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Sandpaper-like&#160;erythematous blanching&#160;rash&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct:</strong></span><span>&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Bullous lesions&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Bullou</span><span>s lesions are o</span><span>ften seen with infections with</span><span>&#160;</span><em><span>Staphylococcus&#160;</span><span>aureus </span></em><span>or</span><span>&#160;</span><span>with&#160;</span><span>autoimmune disease</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;The history and physical exam findings in this patient are more consistent with scarlet fever&#160;</span><span>due to&#160;</span><em><span>Streptococcus pyogenes</span><span>,</span></em><span>&#160;</span><span>which causes</span><span>&#160;</span><span>a&#160;</span><span>sandpaper</span><span>-</span><span>like rash.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Faint salmon-colored macules&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Rose spots&#160;</span><span>appear as&#160;</span><span>faint salmon-colored</span><span>&#160;macules</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>They are</span><span>&#160;seen in patients with typhoid fever</span><span>&#160;</span><span>who&#160;</span><span>typically</span><span>&#160;</span><span>present with&#160;</span><span>vomiting, diarrhea</span><span>,&#160;</span><span>abdominal&#160;</span><span>pain,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>and</span><span>&#160;history of</span><span>&#160;recent travel</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>The history and physical exam findings in this patient are more consistent with scarlet fever</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;which causes</span><span>&#160;a</span><span>&#160;sandpaper</span><span>-</span><span>like rash.</span>&#160;</span></div>",

These findings are consistent with <strong>measles&#160;</strong>infection, which can be diagnosed with <strong>measles reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).<br></strong><br>Most <strong>viral exanthems</strong> are <strong>diagnosed clinically</strong> based on <strong>history&#160;</strong>and <strong>physical examination</strong>. Occasionally, further evaluation is necessary. Rashes due to roseola infantum, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), varicella (chickenpox), and coxsackievirus (hand, foot, and mouth disease) usually do not require testing, since the clinical presentation provides enough information to make the diagnosis in most cases, and the care is supportive. Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is also usually a clinical diagnosis, but occasionally, testing is conducted to evaluate for the underlying virus (e.g., Ebstein-Barr virus, Hepatitis B) that precipitated the rash. <br><br>Since <strong>measles&#160;</strong>and <strong>rubella&#160;</strong>are vaccinated against with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, they are now infrequently seen in the United States. If there is suspicion for either one of these infections, confirmation should be done with <strong>serology&#160;</strong>or, in the case of <strong>measles</strong>, <strong>PCR&#160;</strong>testing. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also cause a maculopapular rash and should be confirmed due to the implications of the diagnosis. <strong>Acute HIV</strong> can be diagnosed with a <strong>positive p24 antigen and elevated ribonucleic acid (RNA) RT-PCR</strong>. <strong>Epstein-Barr virus</strong> can be confirmed by a <strong>positive Monospot or positive anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin M</strong>. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Measles&#160;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction&#160;(RT-PCR)&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Epstein Barr virus IgM:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s presentation of fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots, and rash is consistent with measles, which can be diagnosed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR.

Erythema migrans appear with<strong>&#160;early localized Lyme disease</strong> within days to two weeks after an infected tick bite. The skin lesion begins as a <strong>r</strong><strong>ed or purple-colored macule or papule</strong> and expands with <strong>enhanced central erythema</strong>. It may appear as a <strong>bull&#8217;s eye lesion</strong>, as in this case. The rash is often non-painful and non-pruritic and may be accompanied by systemic symptoms, such as <strong>fever, malaise, headache, stiff neck, myalgias,</strong> and<strong>&#160;arthralgias. Carditis</strong> with a prolonged PR interval on electrocardiography is a manifestation of<strong>&#160;early disseminated Lyme disease</strong>. The most common manifestation of <strong>l</strong><strong>ate Lyme disease</strong>, which occurs weeks to months after the initial infection, is <strong>arthritis</strong>, which is typically monoarticular, and affects the large joints, particularly the knee. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>The diagnostic evaluation of children who present with <strong>fever&#160;</strong>and <strong>rash&#160;</strong>involves narrowing down the most likely etiology based on <strong>history&#160;</strong>and <strong>physical exam including rash morphology</strong>. If the characteristic <strong>erythema migrans (bull&#8217;s eye lesion) rash</strong> is seen, and the patient lives in or has been to a Lyme endemic area, and there are no signs or symptoms of early disseminated or late disease, then no further work-up is required before treatment. If the patient has signs and symptoms of early disseminated or late Lyme disease, <strong>serology testing</strong> for <strong><em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em></strong> with an <strong>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</strong> with reflex to <strong>Western immunoblot</strong> should be performed. Positive serology confirms a diagnosis of Lyme disease. Repeat testing is recommended several weeks later if initial testing is negative due to low sensitivity of serologic testing in early disease. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ No testing is required:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong><strong>:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is commonly used to confirm infections such as <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em><em>.</em> Although PCR can be used to confirm Lyme disease, this test is not recommended for numerous reasons including a high false positive rate.

Patients with RMSF often have abnormal laboratory findings, such as<strong>&#160;thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia,</strong> and<strong>&#160;elevated liver enzymes.</strong> The diagnosis can be confirmed with<strong>&#160;serologic testing for <em>Rickettsia rickettsii. &#160; &#160;</em></strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Serologic testing for&#160;Rickettsia&#160;akari&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><em><span>Rickettsia&#160;</span><span>akari</span></em><span>&#160;</span><span>is&#160;</span><span>a</span><span>&#160;</span><span>gram-negative bacterium</span><span>&#160;that causes&#160;</span><span>rickettsialpox</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>Rickettsialpox</span><span>&#160;</span><span>is transmitted from mice and&#160;</span><span>presents as a chickenpox-like rash that can progress to&#160;</span><span>an eschar.&#160;</span><span>T</span><span>his patient&#8217;s petechial rash</span><span>&#160;includes</span><span>&#160;</span><span>the</span><span>&#160;</span><span>palms and soles</span><span>, and</span><span>&#160;developed</span><span>&#160;after travel to Oklahoma</span><span>, which</span><span>&#160;is</span><span>&#160;</span><span>instead&#160;</span><span>consistent with</span><span>&#160;Rocky Mountain spotted fever</span><span>; s</span><span>erologic&#160;</span><span>testing</span><span>&#160;for</span><span>&#160;</span><em><span>Rickettsia</span><span>&#160;</span><span>rickettsii</span><span>&#160;</span></em><span>s</span><span>hould be performed to confirm the&#160;</span><span>diagnosis</span><span>.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Serologic testing for&#160;Borrelia&#160;burgdorferi&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;</span><span>Borrelia</span><span>&#160;burgdorferi is&#160;</span><span>the</span><span>&#160;gram-negative spirochete</span><span>&#160;that causes Lyme disease.&#160;</span><span>The classic rash of&#160;</span><span>Lyme disease&#160;</span><span>is erythema</span><span>&#160;</span><span>migrans</span><span>&#160;</span><span>or a&#160;</span><span>bull's</span><span>&#160;eye&#160;</span><span>rash.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>This patient&#8217;s petechial rash includes the palms and soles, and developed after travel to Oklahoma, which is instead consistent with Rocky Mountain spotted fever; serologic testing for&#160;</span><em><span>Rickettsia&#160;</span><span>rickettsii</span></em><span>&#160;should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Serologic testing for Rickettsia&#160;rickettsii&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Blood cultures&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Blood cultures can diagnose infections associated with other rashes like typhoid fever and Streptococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS).

Most cases occur before the age of 6 years.

Exam findings can be used to distinguish mild staphylococcal infections, such as impetigo, from more severe infections, like SSSS. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Acute management of each condition differs significantly.

Therefore, these patients require special attention to airway, breathing, and circulation before further management. Once stabilized, patients with SSSS should be admitted to the hospital and receive intravenous fluids and antibiotic therapy targeted at <em>Staphylococcus&#160;</em>species. Since most strains of S. aureus produce penicillinase, a <strong>penicillinase-resistant antibiotic,</strong> such as nafcillin or oxacillin, is preferred. If risk factors are present for methicillin-resistant S. <em>aureus&#160;</em>(MRSA) or if the local prevalence of MRSA is high, vancomycin should be considered.

Superficial SSI is <strong>diagnosed clinically</strong> and further evaluated via wound culture and blood culture if systemic signs present. Point of care ultrasound may be performed to rule out an associated abscess or to guide drainage. Antibiotics should be provided if peri-incisional signs of infection extend more than five centimeters from the wound edge, if there is failure to improve after bedside wound opening, if implanted material is present, if the patient is immunocompromised, or if systemic signs of infection are present.<br><br><strong>Deep incisional SSI</strong> is an infection that extends into the <strong>peri-incisional muscles and fascial layers</strong>. Signs and symptoms include <strong>peri-incisional signs of infection</strong> (e.g. pain, erythema, warmth, purulent drainage) with additional <strong>deeper signs of infection</strong>. These include wound <strong>dehiscence or a fluctuant mass indicating abscess</strong>. Diagnosis involves clinical examination, deep wound and blood cultures, and <strong>bed-side ultrasound of the surgical site to assess for abscess formation</strong>. Unlike superficial SSIs, management of <strong>deep incisional SSIs always includes empiric systemic antibiotic therapy</strong> followed by tailored antibiotic therapy based on culture results, bedside wound opening, and <strong>possible surgical re-exploration</strong>. <br><br><strong>Organ/space SSI</strong> typically occurs with surgeries that involve <strong>implants </strong>(due to the increased risk of bacterial colonization) or bowel anastomosis (from bacterial leak). An organ space SSI usually <strong>lacks peri-incisional signs of infection</strong> but <strong>presents with systemic signs of infection</strong>, such as fever or hypotension and pain/tenderness where the operation was performed. It is diagnosed by the identification of an abscess or fluid collection in the affected organ/space on CT or MRI or with a positive culture from a previously installed surgical drain. Management includes systemic antibiotic therapy followed by tailored antibiotic therapy based on culture results, image-guided percutaneous drain placement of the affected organ/space, and possible surgical re-exploration and removal of implanted foreign devices. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Bed-side point of care ultrasound of the surgical site:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Bed-side incision and drainage:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of a deep surgical site infection with abscess formation.

Administration of antibiotic therapy without debridement is associated with a mortality rate approaching 100 percent. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Oral antibiotics&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect</span><span>: </span></strong><span>This patient with a skin/soft tissue infection presents with sepsis</span><span>;</span><span>&#160;</span><span>therefore,&#160;</span><span>expeditious</span><span>&#160;fluid resuscitation&#160;</span><span>and</span><span>&#160;</span><span>intravenous</span><span>&#160;antibiotics&#160;</span><span>are</span><span>&#160;necessary</span><span>, and he should be taken to the operating room for debridement.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Antifungal medication&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>: </strong>While this patient&#8217;s uncontrolled diabetes&#160;increases his risk of a fungal infection,&#160;given&#160;findings of&#160;hemodynamic instability,&#160;palpable crepitus&#160;and&#160;the&#160;CT&#160;showing&#160;air&#160;tracking&#160;along the fascial plane,&#160;necrotizing fasciitis&#160;can be diagnosed.

      "solution": "This patient presents with peri-incisional pain, warmth, erythema, and purulent discharge from the surgical wound; which is highly suggestive of a <strong>surgical site infection</strong>. <br><br>Surgical site infection (SSI) is an <strong>infection related to a surgical procedure</strong> that typically occurs near the surgical site between days 4 and 30 following surgery. It is most often caused by skin flora, including streptococcal species, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. It can also be caused by pathogens, such as anaerobic gut bacteria, encountered during bowel surgery. Patients typically present with <strong>pain or tenderness at the surgical site&#160;</strong>and <strong>peri-incisional signs of infection</strong>, including warmth, erythema, or purulent discharge. Patients can also develop systemic signs of infection (e.g. fever, hypotension, tachycardia), wound dehiscence, and a tender fluctuant mass under the skin suggestive of an abscess. SSI gets subdivided into three types depending on the depth of infection: <strong>superficial</strong>, <strong>deep</strong>, and <strong>organ-space</strong>.<br><br>The risk of surgical site infection is based on the <strong>surgical classification</strong> of wound contamination. The wound can be classified as clean, <strong>clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty</strong> based on factors like location of surgery, trauma history, or breaks in sterile technique. Patient factors also play a role in increasing the risk of SSI, including <strong>current smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, and immunosuppression</strong>.<br><br><strong>Smoking&#160;</strong>is considered a <strong>primary risk factor</strong> for developing a surgical site infection due to the vasoconstrictive effects of nicotine and poor tissue perfusion, alteration in nutrient transportation, and immune response.

These lesions are typically asymptomatic but may become itchy or inflamed due to friction.

However, the abrupt appearance of multiple seborrheic keratoses, known as the <strong><span>sign of&#160;</span><span>Leser-</span><span>Trelat</span></strong>, is a rare paraneoplastic phenomenon associated with internal malignancy, and patients should be evaluated further. <br><br>Most benign skin lesions can be diagnosed clinically based on a thorough history and physical examination.

A number of factors determine whether or not a lesion is suspicious for melanoma and should be biopsied. Clinically, the <strong>ABCDE criteria</strong> can serve as a <strong>guide for identifying suspicious lesions that may need to be biopsied:</strong>&#160;<strong>A</strong>symmetry, <strong>B</strong>order irregularity, <strong>C</strong>olor variegation, <strong>D</strong>iameter over 6mm, and<strong>&#160;E</strong>volution (change in size, color, or shape of a pre-existing lesion or report of a new growing lesion). Patient-reported symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or sensory changes in the lesion should heighten the suspicion of malignancy. Additionally, when a lesion <strong>looks conspicuously different</strong> (<strong>&#8220;ugly duckling&#8221; sign</strong>) from <strong>surrounding nevi</strong> (nevus phenotype), then a biopsy should be performed. The Glasgow Seven-point Checklist seen below can also help determine when lesions should be biopsied. &#160; &#160;<br><br>During a skin exam, trained physicians may use a <strong>dermatoscope&#160;</strong>which magnifies skin lesions and can detect features that may be suspicious for malignancy but are not visible to the naked eye. For example, a dermatoscope can reveal subsurface skin structures within the epidermis, dermoepidermal junction, and papillary dermis. Visualizing these structures can increase the diagnostic accuracy of skin exams.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/RajFqqovQTuZ2hGLDByL06MrSH_wGdKp/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Mw2IL4PZRkO4AuVBFHsH5EbnQceQUX8G/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Occupation with frequent sun exposure:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>While frequent sun exposure increases the risk of skin cancer, the appearance and features of the lesion are more pertinent to the diagnosis and evaluation of suspected melanoma.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lesion diameter of 5 mm:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Lesions greater than 6 mm should be biopsied.

Patients should also be educated about melanoma risk factors and advised to inform their clinician if self-examination reveals any changes in moles or potentially concerning skin lesions. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/8TaDT7YYSkuOn0M4jU07PT7SQaSgvkqN/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Current medication use:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Chronic use of medications that suppress the immune system (e.g. tacrolimus), can increase the risk of developing melanoma.

Venous ulcers are typically located between the knee and the ankle, with the <strong>medial and lateral malleolus being the most common sites</strong>. Patients generally describe a dull ache at the site of the ulcer and increased swelling of the involved extremity that improves with elevation. A <strong>history of recurrence of an ulcer</strong> in the same area is highly suggestive of a <strong>venous ulcer</strong>.<br><br>Venous ulcers are generally <strong>shallow and irregular</strong> with a wound bed lined with <strong>beefy red granulation tissue</strong>. Sometimes, a layer of superficial fibrinous gelatinous material is present, with a granulated wound bed underneath. The skin surrounding the ulcer can be eczematous, presenting with scaling, weeping and crusting that can be intensely pruritic. The leg is usually edematous, firm and warm with <strong>reddish-brown hyperpigmentation from hemosiderin deposits from chronic venous insufficiency</strong>. Dilated tortuous superficial veins may be visible on the surface.<br><br>Treatment of venous ulcers typically involves static compression therapy with hosiery or bandages, control of risk factors such as diabetes, and an exercise program.

Given his fever, elevated inflammatory markers, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (Hgb A1c &gt; 6.5%), and probe extending to the bone, he likely has underlying <strong>osteomyelitis </strong>and an MRI of the <strong>right foot</strong> should be performed for diagnosis.<br><br>Ulceration in diabetic patients can result from <strong>neuropathy alone</strong> or a combination of <strong>neuropathy and ischemia</strong>. Diabetic ulcers commonly occur in <strong>locations that experience repeated trauma</strong>, such as the <strong>plantar metatarsal heads</strong> and dorsal interphalangeal joints. When evaluating diabetic foot ulcers, it is important to determine the <strong>extent and depth of the wound</strong>, the presence of ischemia, and the presence of infection, all of which will help determine which diagnostic studies and treatments are appropriate. Approximately 60% of diabetic foot ulcers are complicated by infection.<br><br><strong>Osteomyelitis </strong>is a common complication of diabetic foot ulcers. Certain clinical findings should raise suspicion of osteomyelitis. These include <strong>grossly visible bone or probe-to-bone</strong>, large and deeper ulcers, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (70 mm/h). <strong>MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice</strong> - it is highly sensitive and specific for osteomyelitis and superior to radiographs, three-phase bone scans, and white blood cell scans. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ X-Ray of the right foot &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Plain radiographs can detect structural foot deformities, soft tissue gas, and foreign bodies and may be able to detect osteomyelitis. However, radiologic changes in osteomyelitis typically occur late in the course of the disease, and negative radiographs do not exclude the diagnosis. MRI of the foot should be performed for diagnosis, especially in early disease. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tagged WBC Scan:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A tagged WBC, also known as a tagged leukocyte scan, uses radioactive WBCs to identify areas of inflammation. Tagged WBC scans have similar sensitivity to bone scans for evaluation of osteomyelitis. However, they are time-consuming, require complex preparation, and are expensive. They are not the first-line diagnostic test for osteomyelitis, but they are sometimes useful in patients with Charcot arthropathy. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ MRI of the right foot:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ CT-A of the bilateral lower extremities:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: CT-A would be useful in cases where there is suspected arterial insufficiency. The locations of ischemic ulcers are typically in the most distal part of the toes. This patient does not have a history or physical exam findings consistent with arterial insufficiency, but instead has signs of infection and poorly controlled diabetes, making an infected diabetic ulcer the most likely diagnosis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ No further testing as clinical exam is sufficient for diagnosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient has systemic signs of infection and an ulcer where the probe extends to the bone, which raises suspicion of osteomyelitis. While a clinical exam is sufficient to diagnose the type of ulcer present, it is insufficient to rule out underlying osteomyelitis. MRI is required. &#160;</span></div>",
