The patient was likely started on a <strong>protease inhibitor</strong> as part of her treatment regimen.<br><br>Protease inhibitors (e.g., darunavir, indinavir, ritonavir) can be used to treat HIV infection. These medications bind and inhibit <strong>HIV-1 protease</strong>, thereby preventing the virus from processing the Gag-Pol polyproteins into its functional parts and thus impeding viral replication. Protease inhibitors are rarely used alone since HIV quickly develops resistance via point mutations of the <em>pol gene</em>, which is the gene that encodes HIV-1 protease. Typically, protease inhibitors are used as a part of the <strong>highly active antiretroviral therapy</strong> (HAART) combined with other drugs.<br><br>The most common side effects of protease inhibitors include <strong>gastrointestinal symptoms</strong> (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) and <strong>metabolic disorders</strong> (e.g., hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia). These metabolic disorders are often followed by <strong>lipodystrophy</strong>.

This syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder which results from a <strong>microdeletion at chromosome 22q11.2</strong>, and it is best diagnosed via fluorescence in situ hybridization.<br><br>The diagnosis of DGS is based upon a<strong>&#160;reduced number of CD3+ T cells</strong> in combination with either &#160;<strong>characteristic clinical findings</strong> or a demonstrated <strong>microdeletion on chromosome 22q11.2</strong>. Genetic analysis is normally performed using <strong>fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</strong>, which is more sensitive than the standard karyotyping and can be applied to both dividing (metaphase) and non-dividing cells (interphase). It uses a single-stranded complementary DNA segment tagged with a radiotracer specific for the localization of genes, allowing for direct visualization of chromosomal anomalies at the molecular level. In the case of <strong>DGS</strong>, FISH would demonstrate <strong>absence of fluorescence</strong> on the affected<strong>&#160;chromosome 22q11.2&#160;</strong>compared to fluorescence at the same locus on the second copy of unaffected chromosome 22.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/p4t91-6XQfymX4zmGpSjUUZDSm_O69Ls/_.jpg\"></div><br>Reproduced from Wikimedia Commons<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Karyotyping:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: With karyotyping, chromosomes are stained, ordered, and numbered according to morphology, size, arm-length ratio, and banding pattern.

Anaphylaxis refers to an acute, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs upon second exposure after sensitization to an antigen.

These mediators cause an overwhelming systemic inflammatory reaction that can ultimately result in anaphylactic shock or even death.<br><br>If anaphylaxis is suspected, <strong>intramuscular epinephrine should be administered immediately</strong> (typically in the lateral thigh), even before obtaining a history and physical examination. Epinephrine raises blood pressure, reduces bronchospasm, and counteracts other effects of circulating inflammatory mediators. <br><br>It is important for clinicians to recognize that patients may need multiple doses of epinephrine (up to 3). Most patients respond to a single dose of IM epinephrine, particularly if it is given promptly after the onset of symptoms. <strong>IM epinephrine may be repeated at 5- to 15-minute intervals</strong> if there is no response or inadequate response. In severe cases where IM epinephrine is inadequate, a slow, continuous infusion of epinephrine can be used.<br><br>H1 and H2 antihistamines and corticosteroids can be given as adjunctive therapy with epinephrine but they should not be given alone.
