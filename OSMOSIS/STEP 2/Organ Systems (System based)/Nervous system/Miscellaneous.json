This morning, the weakness worsened, and the patient started tripping on the stairs. A review of systems reveals recent gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and abdominal cramping. The patient feels unable to catch his breath. There is no significant past medical history, and no daily medication is taken. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, blood pressure is 120/72 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. There is symmetric bilateral weakness with ankle dorsiflexion and knee flexion and extension, as well as a loss of vibration sense. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in the bilateral lower extremities. Which of the following laboratory study results is most likely to be associated with this patient&#8217;s diagnosis?",

In temporal arteritis, there is inflammation and thickening of the vessel wall, which eventually can result in ischemia and complications, such as vision loss. As the name suggests, the temporal artery is the most common vessel involved; however, intracranial and extracranial vessels can be affected as well, especially the vertebrobasilar arterial system. More remote sites of vascular involvement include the aorta and its proximal branches, like the carotid, subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries. &#160; <br><br>The greatest risk factor for developing temporal arteritis is <strong>aging</strong>. The disease almost never occurs before the age of 50, and its incidence rises steadily thereafter. It peaks between the ages of 70 to 79 with over 80 percent of patients older than 70 years of age. Patients typically report a <strong>new-onset localized headache,&#160;</strong>described as<strong>&#160;unilateral pain in the temporal region&#160;</strong>that worsens over time. These symptoms are often associated with scalp pain and tenderness as well as systemic symptoms like <strong>fatigue</strong>, malaise, fever, and <strong>unintentional weight loss.&#160;</strong>In more severe cases, patients may notice symptoms suggestive of ischemia, including sudden vision changes ranging from diplopia to <strong>complete vision loss.</strong> There may also be pain with chewing, known as <strong>jaw claudication.</strong> Patients may have signs and symptoms of <strong>polymyalgia rheumatica,</strong> including neck, shoulder, and hip pain and stiffness. &#160; <br><br>Physical examination may reveal <strong>abnormalities in the temporal artery</strong>, including <strong>tenderness</strong>, ropiness, <strong>nodularity</strong>, and <strong>altered pulse quality</strong> due to occlusive vasculitis occuring within the vessel, while fundoscopic examination can reveal optic disc pallor and edema. If the vessels of the ophthalmic artery are affected, patients will present with visual symptoms, such as amaurosis fugax. Laboratory values are nonspecific but will often reveal signs of systemic inflammation like <strong>elevated inflammatory markers</strong> (e.g. ESR, CRP), thrombocytosis, and normocytic anemia. Diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy showing <strong>transmural inflammation,</strong> multinucleated giant cells, and mononuclear infiltrate.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/mVADD0sIQCWeu1G7OQuq-5W6SCmQobY-/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Proptosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Proptosis, or bulging of the eyes, is not typically associated with temporal arteritis.

Initiating<strong>&#160;intravenous corticosteroid</strong> therapy promptly is essential to mitigate inflammation, preserve vision, and <strong>prevent further visual impairment in patients with temporal arteritis and visual changes.</strong> These patients should also have an<strong>&#160;urgent ophthalmology consult. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>Patients presenting with<strong>&#160;temporal arteritis without visual symptoms</strong> can be started on <strong>oral steroids, typically prednisone.</strong> An outpatient ophthalmology consultation should be scheduled as soon as possible to assess the optic nerve.

Biopsy classically reveals<strong>&#160;transmural inflammation</strong> with<strong>&#160;multinucleated giant cells, mononuclear infiltrate, and disruption of the internal elastic lamina</strong> in affected arteries. However, false negative rates with biopsy are high, due to the discontinuous character of the histopathologic changes (skip lesions) and the fact that glucocorticoid treatment may reduce the sensitivity of temporal artery biopsy.
