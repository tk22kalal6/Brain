They likely have a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory stroke involving the left frontal eye field. &#160;<br><br>The <strong>frontal eye field&#160;</strong>refers to an area of the frontal lobe involved in visual field perception and voluntary eye movements. It plays a crucial role in <strong>conjugate horizontal gaze</strong> and <strong>saccades&#160;</strong>(fast eye movements). &#160; <br><br>In order to look to the right, the left frontal eye field synapses to the contralateral paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) via the superior colliculus. The efferent pathway from the PPRF passes to the right lateral rectus motor neurons (via the CN VI nucleus), resulting in abduction of the right eye. Excitatory signals are also sent to the contralateral medial rectus motor neurons (CN III) via the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), resulting in adduction of the contralateral (left) eye. &#160;<br><br><strong>Horizontal gaze palsy&#160;</strong>is typically caused by either a <strong>contralateral frontal eye field lesion</strong> or an<strong>&#160;ipsilateral PPRF lesion. &#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>The middle cerebral artery supplies the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere. Strokes involving the middle cerebral artery (MCA) can lead to lesions that also involve the frontal eye field.

The pregnancy was complicated by eclampsia requiring emergency cesarean delivery. The infant was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and discharged at 3 months of age. The hospital course was complicated by respiratory distress syndrome, grade III intraventricular hemorrhage without calcifications, and anemia that required multiple transfusions. Other developmental milestones are appropriate for age. The infant passed a repeat hearing screen at 12 months. Follow-up with ophthalmology shows no concerns. Weight, height, and head circumference are at the 20<sup>th</sup> percentile for age on the World Health Organization growth curve. Temperature is 37&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 105/min, respirations are 25/min, blood pressure is 83/36 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The anterior fontanelle is closed.

A non-contrast <strong>head CT</strong> is indicated to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage or other brain injury. <strong>Cervical spine X-rays</strong> are appropriate to quickly assess for vertebral fracture, dislocation, or spinal cord injury, even if further imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ultimately needed. <br><br>The diagnostic evaluation of a pediatric trauma patient follows stabilization during the primary survey and is guided by findings from the secondary survey. <strong>Head CT</strong> is warranted when there is loss of consciousness, altered mental status, focal neurologic deficits, or signs of <strong>skull fracture</strong> (e.g., skull irregularity, facial lacerations) or <strong>ocular injury</strong> (e.g., displacement of the globe, enophthalmos). <strong>Midline cervical tenderness</strong> or neurologic symptoms raise concern for <strong>cervical spine injury</strong>, which is initially assessed with cervical spine <strong>X-ray</strong> or, in some settings, CT. Thoracic trauma, suggested by chest pain, bruising, or abnormal breath sounds, is evaluated with chest imaging. Pelvic or genitourinary injury is indicated by pelvic tenderness, hematuria, or urethral bleeding and may require pelvic X-ray or CT.

Clinical findings supporting this include unresponsiveness, absence of purposeful motor responses to stimuli, and nonreactive pupils, suggesting loss of brainstem reflexes. The most appropriate next step is to provide definitive airway and respiratory support through <strong>intubation and mechanical ventilation</strong>.<br><br><strong>Brain death</strong> is defined as the irreversible cessation of all brain activity, including consciousness, brainstem reflexes, and spontaneous respiratory effort. It can result from a variety of causes such as trauma, stroke, hypoxic-ischemic injury, mass effect from structural lesions, infections, or toxic-metabolic disturbances. Most patients with brain death or impending brain death present with <strong>coma </strong>and should be considered <strong>medically unstable</strong>. <br><br>Until brain death is formally confirmed, and in the absence of legal documentation limiting resuscitative efforts, aggressive stabilization measures should be initiated, including those aimed at <strong>supporting the airway, breathing, and circulation</strong>. In most cases, <strong>intubation and mechanical ventilation</strong> are required to secure the airway and maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. <strong>Intravenous access</strong> should be established, and the patient should be placed on <strong>continuous monitoring of vital signs</strong>.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Intubation and mechanical ventilation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Active rewarming:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although the patient is mildly hypothermic, rewarming is not the immediate priority.

The patient is intubated and off sedation but remains unconscious without motor response to stimuli. Brainstem reflexes are absent. Serum toxicology is negative, and there are no metabolic or acid-base derangements. Medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, treated with lisinopril and simvastatin. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 60/min, respirations are 12/min (ventilator set rate), and blood pressure is 155/85 mmHg. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain obtained yesterday showed loss of gray-white matter differentiation, and a computed tomography (CT) scan today demonstrates signs of herniation.
