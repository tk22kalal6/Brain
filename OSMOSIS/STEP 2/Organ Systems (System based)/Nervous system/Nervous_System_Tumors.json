An anticholinergic medication, such as <strong>benztropine</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>or diphenhydramine, is the most appropriate treatment for the acute management of dystonia. <br><br><strong>Dystonic reactions (i.e., dyskinesias)</strong> are <strong>reversible extrapyramidal symptoms</strong> that develop shortly after starting medications that block dopamine receptors.

Dystonic reactions range in severity and can include torticollis, oculogyric crisis, and opisthotonos. These reactions are more common with the use of first-generation antipsychotics.

First-line treatment of multiple sclerosis is steroids during acute attacks; however, natalizumab is another approved treatment shown to have a significant benefit in patients with relapsing-remitting MS.<br><br>Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that can be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease. In multiple sclerosis patients, natalizumab has been shown to slow the progression of symptoms and decrease the rate of relapse in patients with relapsing-remitting courses.<br><br>Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against alpha-4-integrin receptors on endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Integrins are a class of selective adhesion molecules that are involved in the chemotaxis of leukocytes to the site of inflammation. Normally, leukocytes bind the integrins and then migrate from blood vessels to the site of inflammation. By blocking the integrins, natalizumab causes anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the leukocytes from migrating to the site of inflammation and inducing a proinflammatory response. In the brain, natalizumab blocks alpha4-beta1 integrins, preventing leukocytes from crossing the blood-brain barrier and entering the CNS, which is how it decreases inflammation in multiple sclerosis patients. <br><br>One of the major limitations of the use of natalizumab is the increased risk of reactivation of JC virus. JC virus is an opportunistic pathogen that resides in the oligodendrocytes in the brain. When the immune system is suppressed, such as in HIV or with natalizumab use, JC virus can get reactivated, leading to a disease known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is characterized by demyelination in the CNS due to the destruction of oligodendrocytes and is rapidly progressive and fatal. Therefore, patients taking natalizumab should be tested for anti-JC virus antibodies before starting treatment and continue to be tested periodically while on natalizumab, even if the initial anti-JC antibodies were negative.<br><br>Other side effects of natalizumab include headaches and nausea. In some patients, nucleated erythrocytes can appear in the peripheral blood, which has no clinical significance and usually disappear after stopping the treatment. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Osmotic demyelination syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a fatal condition that results from rapid correction of hyponatremia.

The affected eye cannot adduct, and the contralateral eye abducts with nystagmus; however, convergence and pupillary light reflexes are preserved. This condition is secondary to <strong>demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF)</strong>, which normally mediates communication between the CN III (oculomotor) and CN VI (abducens) nuclei to allow for coordinated horizontal eye movements. Unilateral MLF lesions often result from lacunar strokes in the pontine artery distribution, whereas bilateral MLF lesions are typically observed in patients with MS. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/VaOXzHwhRwaAe1bI7kF8wr_dQ7_K0TCo/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Oculomotor nerve &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Damage to the oculomotor nerve (CN III) leaves the actions of the lateral rectus and the superior oblique muscle unopposed, resulting in an abducted and depressed eye (&#8220;down and out&#8221;).

      "solution": "<strong>Pseudobulbar palsy&#160;</strong>is an <strong>upper motor neuron lesion</strong> involving the corticobulbar (supranuclear) pathways of <strong>cranial nerves IX, X, and XI.</strong> An upper motor neuron lesion occurs above the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves. Pseudobulbar palsy is caused by bilateral damage to the corticobulbar tracts. Causes of the condition include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), strokes, traumatic brain injury, neoplasm, and multiple sclerosis (as is the likely diagnosis in this patient). &#160; <br><br>The clinical presentation of pseudobulbar palsy includes <strong>dysphagia, dysarthria, dysphonia,</strong> and an <strong>increased gag reflex</strong>. Patients may also show signs of <strong>emotional lability</strong> and apathy. Of note, while the gag reflex is exaggerated in pseudobulbar palsy (upper motor neuron lesion), it is typically absent in bulbar palsy (lower motor neuron lesion). This difference is a key clinical sign used to distinguish between bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/7F-bvBglRFSJXtIcb7f-SfpxQXeRp2ro/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Demyelination of the bilateral corticobulbar tracts:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Mass in the jugular foramen:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A mass in the jugular foramen can compress cranial nerves IX, X, and XI and result in bulbar palsy.

Current medications include gabapentin as needed for neuropathy. The patient&#8217;s temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. Visual acuity is 20/20 in the left eye and 20/25 in the right eye. Physical examination reveals subjective sensory loss in the left upper extremity and associated pronator drift. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals a contrast-enhancing T2 hyperintense lesion in the right parietal cortex and a non-enhancing T2 hyperintense juxtacortical lesion in the left mesial frontal lobe. The patient is started on symptomatic treatment and intravenous corticosteroids. Which of the following, if prescribed, would prevent future relapses and slow disease progression?",
