This, in combination with <strong>tenderness&#160;</strong>over the<strong>&#160;lateral epicondyle,</strong> suggests a diagnosis of <strong>lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow)</strong> due to <strong>overuse of the forearm extensor muscles&#160;</strong>(extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor digitorum communis). Overuse leads to noninflammatory angiofibroblastic tendinosis at the common extensor origin of the lateral epicondyle. This condition is typically seen with<strong>&#160;repetitive wrist extension activities&#160;</strong>(such as a backhand stroke in tennis). &#160; &#160;<br><br>In contrast, pain over the medial epicondyle with resisted finger and wrist flexion suggests <strong>medial epicondylitis.</strong> Overuse of the<strong>&#160;wrist and hand flexors and forearm pronators</strong> can lead to medial epicondylitis.

      "solution": "This patient&#8217;s presentation is consistent with a <strong>radial nerve (deep branch) injury</strong> as it passes through the supinator muscle&#8211;likely due to repetitive pronation/supination (use of screwdrivers). The radial nerve enters the forearm anterior to the lateral epicondyle, where it branches into terminal superficial and deep branches.

Patients with severe side effects from TNF inhibitors should be switched to another class of medications.<br><br>Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-12/23 and can be used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, especially in patients who do not respond to TNF inhibitors or are intolerant to them (like this patient). It can also be used in the treatment of psoriasis and Crohn&#8217;s disease.<br><br>Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by binding to and inhibiting IL-12/23. IL-12 is an inflammatory mediator that is implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn&#8217;s disease, and psoriasis, as well as other inflammatory disorders. It activates T-cells and induces the differentiation of T-helper cells. &#160;In addition, it also helps in the formation of granulomatous inflammatory response along with other cytokines (e.g., Interferon-Gamma, Tumor Necrosis factor). Therefore, ustekinumab inhibits T-cell-mediated inflammatory response and decreases joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients with foot pain caused by&#160;<strong>infection </strong>may&#160;have&#160;a history of diabetes mellitus, smoking, or an immunocompromised state, as well as&#160;systemic symptoms such as fever, chills,&#160;or myalgias, with&#160;or without local skin trauma.&#160;Numbness and tingling may&#160;precede&#160;the onset of&#160;<strong>neuropathic foot pain</strong>, which patients describe as&#160;lancinating, electrical,&#160;or&#160;radiating&#160;pain,&#160;burning, or coldness.&#160;Other&#160;common&#160;causes of foot pain include&#160;osteoarthritis, crystal arthropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, hallux valgus,&#160;bone pain;&#160;and dermatologic conditions such as plantar warts,&#160;tinea, and mechanical keratosis, also known as&#160;corns&#160;and calluses.&#160;&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Excessive alcohol consumption:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Local bacterial infection:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Local bacterial infection does not directly cause gout.
