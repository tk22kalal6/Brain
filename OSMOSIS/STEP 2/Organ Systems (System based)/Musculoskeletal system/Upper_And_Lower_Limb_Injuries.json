It <strong>binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL-R)</strong> on the surface of hepatocytes and leads to its degradation, thereby resulting in elevated blood cholesterol levels. <strong>PCSK9 inhibitors</strong> are <strong>antibodies that bind PCSK9</strong> and <strong>prevent LDL-R degradation</strong>. This leads to an overall increase in LDL-R on hepatocytes which results in a major <strong>decrease in serum LDL</strong> (by increasing its uptake in hepatocytes) and is indicated in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol. PCSK9 inhibitors are also shown to decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events in susceptible individuals. It is available as a subcutaneous injection and must be administered every 2-4 weeks. It is a comparatively safe lipid-lowering drug with occasional <strong>injection site reactions</strong> (pruritus, rash) and rare neurocognitive toxicity (delirium, dementia).

The new drug added to his regime is a <strong>bile acid resin</strong>, common examples of which include <strong>cholestyramine, colestipol </strong>and <strong>colesevelam</strong>.<br><br><strong>Bile acid resins</strong> are large, positively-charged molecules that bind to the negatively-charged bile acid in the intestine, <strong>inhibiting reabsorption at the intestinal brush border</strong>. The <strong>liver </strong>compensates for the decreased bile acids by <strong>increasing the production of bile salts</strong> via its <strong>up-regulation of LDL receptor</strong> and an <strong>increase in the synthesis of hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase</strong> (which converts HMG CoA to mevalonate, a cholesterol precursor). Bile acid resins are not as effective as statins, which increase the LDL receptors and inhibit HMG-CoA, and that is why they are usually used in combination with statins. The LDL receptors also very slightly increase the uptake of VLDL. A minor increase in HDL levels is also observed. Its combination with a non-statin lipid-lowering agent (e.g., niacin, fibrates) may be useful in patients who are statin-intolerant and require intensive lipid-lowering therapy. Common <strong>adverse effects</strong> associated with bile acid resins include <strong>gastrointestinal upset</strong> (nausea, bloating and cramping) and <strong>impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) and drugs (e.g., digoxin, warfarin)</strong>. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Niacin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: &#160;Niacin, a lipid lowering drug, acts to prevent lipolysis by inhibiting hormone-sensitive lipase in adipose tissue.

The elevated urine output, high plasma osmolality, and inappropriately low urine osmolality are consistent with diabetes insipidus (DI). A <strong>positive desmopressin challenge test&#160;</strong>is diagnostic of<strong>&#160;central DI</strong>. <br><br>Hypernatremia is an electrolyte imbalance that occurs when serum sodium concentration exceeds 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Once hypernatremia is confirmed on a chemistry panel, further workup depends on the likely underlying cause. This can be narrowed by determining whether the patient is hypervolemic, euvolemic, or hypovolemic. Patients with <strong>hypovolemic hyponatremia</strong> may report volume losses, recent diuretic use, or inadequate fluid intake. These patients should have <strong>urine output&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;urine osmolality measured</strong>. <br><br>Patients with euvolemic hypernatremia may endorse polydipsia or polyuria and will appear hydrated on examination. <strong>Urine output and urine and plasma osmolality</strong> should be obtained. Differentiating central DI from nephrogenic GI can be achieved via a <strong>desmopressin challenge</strong>.<br><br>Patients with hypervolemic hypernatremia will demonstrate signs of volume overload, such as shortness of breath or peripheral edema.

The patient is a picky eater and drinks more juice than is recommended at 15 months. Although the patient frequently breastfeeds, the mother is unsure of her supply. The patient&#8217;s <strong>microcytic anemia</strong> and associated <strong>flow murmur</strong> support the history of inadequate intake, specifically iron intake. <strong>Inadequate caloric intake</strong> is the most likely etiology of his <strong>poor growth</strong>. <br><br><strong>Growth faltering</strong> refers to the <strong>inability to gain or maintain adequate weight</strong>. The most common cause of growth faltering is inadequate intake, which can be due to insufficient supply or other reasons for inadequate food consumption, such as oral aversion. Inadequate intake in the neonatal period may reflect <strong>improper mixing of formula or difficulties with breastfeeding</strong>. At older ages, <strong>inadequate food supplies and excessive consumption of unbalanced sources of nutrition </strong>most often lead to inadequate intake. <br><br>Reviewing growth parameters on a standardized growth chart is the first step in the evaluation of growth faltering. If the patient&#8217;s <strong>weight-for-age or BMI is more than 2 standard deviations (&lt;5<sup>th</sup> percentile) below the mean</strong> for age or if the <strong>weight-for-age has crossed 2 major percentile lines, growth faltering</strong> is diagnosed. To evaluate growth faltering secondary to inadequate caloric intake, a <strong>dietary assessment</strong> to examine <strong>calorie intake</strong> and <strong>feeding behaviors</strong> should be performed. History may reveal formula dilution, feeding massive quantities of juice or milk, an unbalanced diet that does not provide the necessary macronutrients for optimal growth, or food insecurity and resource instability. The evaluation for inadequate intake should also include assessing for vomiting, behavioral issues, mechanical feeding issues, and psychosocial issues.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Inadequate caloric intake&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased energy expenditure&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Increased energy expenditure&#160;can&#160;result from genetic conditions, immunodeficiencies, hyperthyroidism,&#160;or chronic cardiac, pulmonary, liver, or renal&#160;diseases,&#160;which are not noted in this infant.&#160;This infant&#8217;s heart murmur is an innocent murmur&#160;likely due&#160;to anemia.&#160;In this case, the&#160;limited food&#160;and high&#160;juice intake&#160;have&#160;most&#160;likely&#160;caused&#160;inadequate caloric intake&#160;leading to&#160;growth faltering.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inborn errors of metabolism&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Patients with Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) can present with vomiting, diarrhea, characteristic body odors, growth faltering, and labs showing hypoglycemia, ketonuria, and hyperammonemia, none of which are seen in this patient.

      "solution": "This 6-year-old girl&#8217;s presentation is consistent with <strong>late-onset Pompe disease</strong>, as evidenced by her progressive muscle weakness, dyspnea, orthopnea, recurrent respiratory infections, and elevated creatine kinase (CK) and liver enzymes. The combination of her <strong>poor respiratory effort</strong> on examination, <strong>low oxygen saturation,&#160;</strong>and <strong>respiratory acidosis</strong> suggests significant respiratory muscle weakness. As a result, <strong>emergent intubation&#160;</strong>and <strong>mechanical ventilation</strong> are required to stabilize her airway and breathing. <br><br>Late-onset Pompe disease is a <strong>glycogen storage disorder</strong> (GSD) caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase, resulting in the accumulation of glycogen primarily in muscle tissue. It typically presents after one year of age, and sometimes during adolescence, with <strong>progressive muscle weakness in a limb-girdle distribution</strong> (e.g. hip flexors), <strong>delayed gross motor development</strong>, and respiratory compromise due to <strong>diaphragmatic weakness</strong>. Laboratory studies commonly show elevations in <strong>CK&#160;</strong>and <strong>liver enzymes</strong> along with a <strong>deficiency of acid alpha glucosidase</strong>. This presentation contrasts with the more severe form of Pompe disease (the &#8220;classic infantile onset&#8221; form) which, as the name suggests, presents within the first 3 months of life and includes <strong>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</strong> in its phenotype. <br><br>In a patient presenting with an inborn error of metabolism like Pompe disease, an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong> should be performed. If the patient is unstable, the first step is to stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation. In patients with signs of poor respiratory effort and low oxygen saturation, <strong>emergent intubation and mechanical ventilation</strong> is needed to maintain the airway and prevent respiratory failure.

The most likely cause of this patient&#8217;s short stature is <strong>malnutrition&#160;</strong>or decreased caloric intake. <br><br>The initial evaluation of short stature requires a thorough history, physical examination, and <strong>evaluation of the growth chart</strong>. Important aspects of the history include birth history, dietary history, parental heights (in order to calculate mid-parental height), and family history of &#8220;later bloomers&#8221; or growth issues. The review of symptoms should be broad and assess for systemic symptoms and should especially highlight gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea). Physical examination should evaluate for dysmorphic features, pallor, murmur, goiter, skin findings, and lymphadenopathy. <br><br>One of the most important aspects of the physical examination in patients being assessed for short stature is an <strong>accurate height and weight</strong> measurement. <strong>Under age two</strong>, measurements should be plotted on a <strong>World Health Organization (WHO) growth chart</strong>. <strong>After age two</strong>, measurements should be plotted on a <strong>Centers for Disease Control (CDC) growth chart</strong>.

The most likely diagnosis is <strong>congenital rubella syndrome</strong> caused by maternal infection with <strong>rubella virus</strong>.<br><br>Congenital rubella infection occurs via <strong>vertical transmission</strong> when there is a history of maternal infection with the rubella virus during the early stages of gestation. Infection before 4 weeks of gestation can cause pregnancy loss, while infection between <strong>4 weeks and 4 months</strong> often causes <strong>congenital defects</strong>. Infection after 4 months typically does not lead to sequelae. <br><br>Patients with congenital rubella often present with a <strong>purplish-blue rash</strong> caused by dermal hematopoiesis (i.e. &#8220;blueberry muffin&#8221; rash), <strong>salt-and-pepper retinopathy, bilateral cataracts,&#160;</strong>and <strong>glaucoma</strong>. Cardiac manifestations include <strong>peripheral pulmonary stenosis&#160;</strong>and <strong>patent ductus arteriosus</strong>, which causes a &#8220;machine-like&#8221; murmur. Neurologic sequelae include developmental delays and <strong>sensorineural hearing loss</strong>. <br><br><strong>IgM and IgG titers</strong> for rubella and an <strong>echocardiogram&#160;</strong>should be ordered when congenital rubella is suspected.

This patient also has evidence of <strong>end organ dysfunction</strong> as evidenced by hypotension and acute kidney injury (diagnosed by elevated creatinine). Sepsis associated with cardiovascular dysfunction or multisystem organ failure is further classified as severe <strong>sepsis</strong>.<br><br><strong>Sepsis </strong>refers to a dysregulated immune response to infection and is frequently associated with organ dysfunction, shock, and death. The infection can be bacterial, viral, or fungal, and may originate from any tissue, initiating a complex interplay between infectious virulence factors and host defense mechanisms. The main goals of management are to identify and treat the infection while maintaining hemodynamic stability to prevent or minimize organ damage. <br><br>All pediatric patients undergoing evaluation for sepsis should have standard bloodwork performed including a <strong>complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, blood culture, lactic acid, urinalysis, coagulation profile, </strong>and <strong>blood gas analysis</strong>. Further workups should be tailored to the suspected source of infection (e.g., lumbar puncture and CSF studies for patients with suspected meningitis, or chest x-ray for patients with suspected pneumonia). Additional studies including inflammatory markers like procalcitonin can help assess infection and sepsis risk. <br><br>When sepsis is suspected, all patients should also be assessed for the presence of <strong>SIRS</strong>, as detailed in the chart above. Patients who screen positive for SIRS and have a source of infection can be diagnosed as having <strong>sepsis</strong>. Patients with <strong>severe sepsis</strong> have sepsis and organ dysfunction, while those with <strong>septic shock</strong> have severe sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction that persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Severe sepsis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Septic shock:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Septic shock is&#160;defined as patients with clinical evidence of&#160;severe sepsis and&#160;cardiovascular dysfunction (e.g.,&#160;persistent hypotension&#160;or two of the&#160;following: delayed&#160;capillary refill,&#160;oliguria, or&#160;elevated&#160;lactic acid)&#160;despite&#160;administration of resuscitative therapy.&#160;This patient has responded to intravenous fluids,&#160;so&#160;he&#160;is not in septic shock.&#160;The findings are consistent with severe sepsis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sepsis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Sepsis is broadly defined and diagnosed in patients meeting&#160;systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)&#160;criteria with an associated source of infection.&#160;Although this patient technically has sepsis, severe sepsis best describes the patient&#8217;s clinical picture,&#160;since there is also organ dysfunction.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Systemic inflammatory response syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Systemic inflammatory response syndrome&#160;(SIRS)&#160;is defined in children as&#160;2 or more of the following symptoms:&#160;temperature instability,&#160;tachycardia&#160;(or bradycardia in children younger than one),&#160;tachypnea,&#160;and either leukocytosis or leukopenia.&#160;This patient has SIRS,&#160;but there is&#160;a source of infection and evidence of end-organ dysfunction,&#160;making&#160;severe sepsis&#160;the more&#160;appropriate diagnosis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare condition&#160;that causes multisystem organ dysfunction&#160;following infection with&#160;SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).&#160;This patient does&#160;not&#160;have MIS-C since&#160;he does not have&#160;COVID-19.&#160;The findings are consistent with severe sepsis.&#160;</span></div>",

The infection can be bacterial, viral, or fungal, and may originate from any tissue,&#160;initiating&#160;a complex interplay between infectious virulence factors and host defense mechanisms. The main goals of management are to&#160;identify&#160;and treat the infection while&#160;maintaining&#160;hemodynamic stability to prevent or minimize organ damage.&#160; <br><br>Pediatric patients&#160;with&#160;<strong>sepsis </strong>(who are not fluid overloaded)&#160;should&#160;receive&#160;<strong>empiric intravenous fluids</strong>&#160;(starting&#160;with&#160;a 10-20 ml/kg bolus and repeating as necessary up to&#160;60 ml/kg),&#160;<strong>antibiotics</strong>, and&#160;<strong>source control </strong>if needed&#160;(e.g.,&#160;removal of an infected venous&#160;catheter).&#160;Patients undergoing treatment should be periodically&#160;<strong>reassessed for hemodynamic instability</strong>&#160;and&#160;worsening&#160;<strong>cardiovascular dysfunction</strong>&#160;by&#160;checking urine output, serial lactic acid levels, vital signs,&#160;and&#160;capillary refill. Patients with&#160;<strong>worsening </strong>findings despite adequate resuscitation should&#160;have&#160;<strong>central venous access</strong>,&#160;and be&#160;started on&#160;<strong>vasopressors</strong>,&#160;and&#160;antibiotics&#160;should be&#160;tailored to the&#160;likely&#160;source&#160;of infection. Patients receiving vasopressors&#160;need to&#160;be admitted to a pediatric ICU setting.&#160;&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Administer norepinephrine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Broaden antibiotic coverage:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Although this patient may&#160;require&#160;a change in antibiotic coverage, he&#160;currently has refractory septic shock and requires stabilization with a vasopressor.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administer an additional bolus of intravenous crystalloid:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>This patient has received&#160;</span><span>appropriate fluid</span><span>&#160;resuscitation for septic shock</span><span>&#160;and&#160;</span><span>continues to be hypotensive with poor perfusion and an increasing lactate</span><span>.
