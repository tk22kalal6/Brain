Laboratory results show leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. This patient most likely has <strong>congenital syphilis</strong>. A <strong>desquamating rash on the palms, soles</strong>, or diaper area is characteristic of congenital syphilis. <br><br>Congenital syphilis is caused by vertical transmission of <strong><em>Treponema pallidum</em></strong> from infected mothers. Maternal history may reveal <strong>limited prenatal care&#160;</strong>or a<strong>&#160;genital chancre</strong>. Newborn exam is typically normal at birth, but by <strong>1 to 2 months of age</strong>, infants typically develop a <strong>desquamative maculopapular rash</strong> (often seen on the <strong>palms, soles,&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;diaper area</strong>) and <strong>snuffles&#160;</strong>(rhinitis with <strong>mucopurulent nasal discharge</strong>). Other common findings include <strong>pseudoparalysis</strong> due to bone inflammation resulting in severe pain during movement, <strong>generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly,&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;condyloma lata</strong> (wart-like lesions on moist areas of skin). Late congenital syphilis presents after two years of age with oral findings like Hutchinson teeth and mulberry molars. Affected children can also develop deafness, interstitial keratitis, and skeletal abnormalities, such as saber shins. <br><br>With these physical examination findings, syphilis should be suspected. Complete blood count (CBC) may show <strong>thrombocytopenia&#160;</strong>and <strong>anemia</strong>. <strong>Venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL)&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;rapid plasma reagin (RPR)</strong> of the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the <strong>infant</strong> and blood of the <strong>mother&#160;</strong>should be obtained to make a diagnosis.

Patients with CLABSI will often have <strong>purulent drainage</strong> from the central line site as well. This patient has no urinary symptoms, no urinary leukocyte esterase or nitrites and only a small amount of pyuria, so CAUTI is unlikely. In addition, <em>S. aureus</em> is not usually a urinary pathogen, so if it were to be found in the urine culture, then this would indicate bacteremia rather than UTI. Given the <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia, this patient&#8217;s <strong>central line should be removed</strong>, and he should be started on empiric IV antibiotics that cover <em>S. aureus</em>. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Remove the central venous catheter:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Remove the urinary catheter:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: While this patient does have pyuria (WBC in the urine), it is not significant pyuria with only 3-5 white blood cells/hpf. Additionally, nitrites and leukocyte esterase are not present, and the patient has no symptoms to suggest a urinary tract infection. S. aureus is generally not a urinary pathogen, so if it is seen in the urine, it often indicates bacteremia. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Administer oral vancomycin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Oral vancomycin is used to treat <em>C. difficile</em> colitis.

Empiric treatment with IV vancomycin would be appropriate to cover for potential MRSA, with a change to nafcillin if the organism is methicillin-sensitive. Regardless of the antibiotic regimen chosen, the central venous catheter should be removed. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Repeat blood cultures:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Both blood culture bottles are positive and no intervention has been done yet (e.g., removing an indwelling catheter, starting antibiotics) so there is no reason to repeat cultures at this time. After treatment is started blood cultures can be repeated to ensure clearance of bacteremia. &#160;</span></div>",

Hospitalized patients who develop a new fever should be promptly evaluated for a <strong>nosocomial (healthcare-associated) infection</strong>. The main types of nosocomial infections are catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), surgical site infection (SSI), hospital- or ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP or VAP), and healthcare-associated <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> infection (CDI). Of note, elderly patients who develop nosocomial infections can often present only with fatigue or altered mental status and without fevers and leukocytosis. <br><br>This patient has been hospitalized for several days and has both a central venous catheter and a urinary catheter in place, increasing the risk of a nosocomial infection. Depending upon the suspected source, the workup for <strong>nosocomial infection</strong> may include obtaining <strong>blood and urine cultures; chest imaging; and stool testing</strong>. If 1 of 2 blood culture bottles is positive for a pathogenic organism (e.g. <em>S. aureus</em>), this is considered a true infection. If <strong>1 of 2 bottles is positive for a commensal (normal flora) organism</strong> such as <em>S. epidermidis</em>, this may reflect <strong>contamination&#160;</strong>of the specimen, and another set of blood cultures should be drawn. If both bottles are positive for a commensal organism, this indicates a true infection.<br><br>This patient has two blood culture bottles positive for coagulase-negative <em>Staphylococcus&#160;</em>(likely <em>S. epidermidis</em>). Therefore this should be treated as the cause of a true infection, and antibiotics should be started and the central venous catheter should be removed unless there is a major contraindication. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ No further testing is needed:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Repeat blood cultures:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Commensal (normal flora) organisms can sometimes contaminate blood cultures.

Administration of <strong>intravenous furosemide</strong> is the most appropriate next step.<br><br>Differentiating between the systemic diseases that can cause bilateral lower extremity edema is critical as the workup and management is very different for each one. <strong>Liver failure</strong>, <strong>renal failure</strong>, and <strong>CHF</strong> are the major systemic causes of bilateral lower extremity edema, though there are several other causes.<br><br><strong>Liver failure</strong> may be chronic (cirrhosis) or acute. True acute liver failure requires the patient to have encephalopathy, coagulopathy (elevated INR or PT), and liver injury (elevated transaminases or bilirubin) and requires emergent transfer to a liver transplant center for evaluation. Presentation of chronic liver failure is more indolent with findings of hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, other stigmata of cirrhosis, and declining liver synthetic function, usually in the setting of an appropriate cause (e.g. alcohol use disorder, hepatitis B virus infection). <strong>Renal failure</strong> is diagnosed based on elevated serum creatinine or a significant drop in urine output, and may also be chronic or acute. Nephrotic syndromes notoriously cause severe lower extremity edema, but any significant renal failure can cause this. Renal ultrasound, urine protein studies, and even kidney biopsy may be needed to make the diagnosis.<br><br><strong>CHF</strong> leads to venous congestion and typically presents with dyspnea and fatigue. Symptoms can vary depending on whether right- and left-sided heart failure is present, but many patients will have signs of pulmonary and peripheral edema. Venous congestion can cause renal failure (termed cardiorenal syndrome) and in some cases congestive hepatopathy.

Patients who have been physically abused may have marks or bruising in <strong>unusual locations&#160;</strong>such as on the torso, neck, mouth, or ears. Non-accidental trauma should be suspected when fractures of the posterior or lateral ribs, scapulae, or vertebrae are present if metaphyseal &#8220;corner&#8221; or &#8220;bucket-handle&#8221; fractures are seen on radiographs, or if there is evidence of multiple fractures in various stages of healing. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><strong><br>Sexual abuse&#160;</strong>can cause age-inappropriate sexual behaviors, dysuria, enuresis, or genital injuries.

Risk factors for atelectasis include <strong>incisional pain, shallow breathing</strong> with poor alveolar recruitment, depressed cough from narcotics, prolonged bed rest, and <strong>smoking history</strong>.<br><br>Postoperative fever is defined as a systemic body temperature that is at or above 38&#176;C or 100.4&#176;F within the postoperative period which gets divided into <strong>4 phases</strong> based on the <strong>timing</strong> of the fever: <strong>immediate, acute, subacute, and delayed</strong>. <br><br>An <strong>immediate&#160;</strong>postoperative fever occurs within <strong>24 hours</strong> of the procedure. The most common cause is <strong>physiologic</strong>, but life-threatening complications such as acute transfusion reactions or adverse drug reactions can also occur. Physiologic fevers are transient, self-limited, and tend to occur following surgeries involving high levels of tissue trauma. <strong>Acute transfusion reactions</strong> should be suspected in patients who received <strong>blood products</strong> or have a personal or family history of transfusion reactions. Physical exam findings include flushing, skin rash, angioedema, respiratory distress, or hypotension. An adverse drug reaction can occur if the patient receives anesthetics, antibiotics, or other medications.<br><br>The <strong>acute phase</strong> of postoperative fever occurs between <strong>postoperative days 1 to 7</strong>.

There are 2 important diagnoses that should not be missed during this time: <strong>anastomotic leaks</strong> and <strong><em>clostridium difficile&#160;</em>infection</strong>. In an anastomotic leak, patients will present with abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or obstipation after abdominal surgery. Physical exam will reveal abdominal tenderness, distension, and signs of peritonitis (such as rebound, guarding, and decreased bowel sounds). The use of antibiotics increases the risk of <em>Clostridium Difficile</em> infection. Patients will complain of colicky abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, nausea, abdominal tenderness, and distension. <br><br>Lastly, the <strong>delayed&#160;</strong>phase of postoperative fever occurs <strong>more than 30 days</strong> after the procedure. Most fevers that occur at this stage are unrelated to the surgery and caused by community infections such as upper respiratory infections. However, <strong>device or prosthesis infections</strong> and <strong>fistula formation</strong> are two complications that should not be missed. A device or prosthesis infection should be considered when there is intraoperative device implantation (such as mesh during hernia repair, ICD) or prosthesis implantation during joint replacement surgery. Patients will present with erythema, edema, and tenderness around the implantation site. Fistulas may occur in patients that have undergone resections requiring anastomosis or postoperative chemoradiation. They often present with erythema, tenderness, foul discharge, or bleeding from a visible fistula site. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Atelectasis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acute transfusion reaction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Acute transfusion reactions present within the first 24 hours after surgery with the transfusion of blood products.

This condition typically presents with the head tilted towards the affected side and the chin rotated away from the affected side, limiting the neck&#8217;s range of motion. This posturing is because the condition mimics the action of the sternocleidomastoid, which functions to flex the head toward the side of contraction (in this case, the right) and laterally rotate the head or chin away from the side of the contraction (in this case, the left). &#160;<br><br>Torticollis can be congenital or acquired, as described below:&#160;<ul><li>&#160;<strong>Congenital torticollis</strong> is the most common type of torticollis. This postural deformity of the neck develops prenatally and is most often caused by the development of a fibrous tissue tumor in the sternocleidomastoid muscle and less often by neurological or bony abnormalities. &#160;</li><li>&#160;There is also <strong>congenital muscular torticollis</strong>, a postural deformity that is typically evident 2-4 weeks after delivery and often occurs during delivery when there is tearing of the muscle fibers of the baby's neck, resulting in subsequent fibrosis and shortening of the neck muscles. &#160;&#160;</li><li>&#160;<strong>Acquired torticollis</strong> typically appears after delivery and can be caused by various conditions that cause injury or inflammation to the muscles of the neck. These can range from trauma to infection or neurological disorders. Acquired torticollis typically occurs in children but can occur in adults as well. &#160;</li></ul>Adults usually acquire a type of torticollis referred to as <strong>spasmodic torticollis</strong>, or <strong>cervical dystonia</strong>, resulting from strenuous movement or awkward positioning for too long. Spasmodic torticollis is a chronic and painful condition characterized by involuntary contraction of the neck muscles, leading to involuntary tilting, turning, flexing, or extending the neck. In most cases, the cause of spasmodic torticollis is unknown, but more serious causes include cervical spine injuries, such as fractures and subluxations. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Sk5K34pySjGbKRIK5cePEiXgQLie5ctF/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Clavicle fracture:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Clinical findings of a clavicle fracture include asymmetric contour, crepitus, edema, decreased or absent movement of the arm on the affected side, and crying with passive movement of the arm on the affected side.

With examination showing limited range of motion in the hip joint with internal rotation and abduction, and mild pain with movement. Radiography shows <strong>flattening of the right femoral head</strong> confirming the diagnosis of <strong>Legg-Calv&#233;-Perthes disease (LCPD)</strong>.<br><br>LCPD is an <strong>idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral head</strong>, most commonly seen in children aged 3-12 years, with a peak incidence between 5 and 7 years, and a higher prevalence in males.<br><br>With LCPD, children often experience <strong>chronic and progressive hip, groin, thigh, or knee pain</strong> that <strong>worsens with activity</strong>. Patients can have an <strong>antalgic gait</strong>, where the child avoids weight-bearing on the affected side. Radiographs taken in the early stages of LCPD might appear normal. However, as the disease progresses to subacute or chronic stages, the typical findings include a <strong>flattened and fragmented femoral head, sclerosis</strong>, and alternating regions of lucency and density, indicating necrotic bone replacement by new bone. Management typically involves non-weight-bearing and conservative measures like bracing or splinting. Surgery may be necessary in cases where the femoral head is not adequately contained within the acetabulum.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/iggJi07ASAy_sGYv6zEWmkVqQbaWcSAM/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Legg-Calv&#233;-Perthes disease (LCPD):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: SCFE typically presents in preadolescent and adolescent children, and is associated with obesity.

Also, inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP are typically elevated. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Osteosarcoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Osteosarcoma typically presents with localized pain that may be present at rest and night. Lesions are typically present in the metaphyseal areas of the long bones and radiographs can show a characteristic sun-burst appearance. This patient's imaging features are not consistent with osteosarcoma. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Transient synovitis of the hip:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Transient synovitis often follows a viral infection. It typically presents acutely and resolves within 2 weeks. The six-week duration of symptoms and the radiographic findings are more consistent with Legg-Calv&#233;-Perthes disease (LCPD). &#160;</span></div>",
