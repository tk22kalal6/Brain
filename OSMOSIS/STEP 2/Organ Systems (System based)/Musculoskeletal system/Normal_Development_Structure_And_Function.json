      "solution": "This patient has seizures, altered mental status, neuromuscular excitability, and autonomic instability in the setting of recent venlafaxine and phenelzine use. She most likely has <strong>serotonin syndrome</strong> and should be started on cyproheptadine. &#160; <br><br>Serotonin syndrome is a life-threatening condition caused by<strong>&#160;serotonin accumulation and over stimulation</strong> of the nervous system. This syndrome is characterized by skin flushing, autonomic instability, agitation, muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, seizure, and coma. It usually occurs in individuals treated with a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and another medication that increases serotonin levels, such as phenelzine or another monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). &#160; &#160;<br><br>In general, patients are advised to wait for at least <strong>two weeks</strong> after discontinuing an antidepressant before initiating treatment with phenelzine or another MAOI. This helps prevent the accumulation of serotonin and reduces the risk of developing serotonin syndrome. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients with serotonin syndrome can be treated with <strong>cyproheptadine</strong>, a serotonin antagonist that blocks 5-HT2 receptors. Other measures include supportive care, sedation with benzodiazepines, and cessation of all serotonergic medications. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/rT1zqZNQTsS-6mLdLKwRgqyNR7i-ps6I/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Dantrolene&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Dantrolene is used to treat malignant hyperthermia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a condition that arises from antipsychotic toxicity. However, the patient&#8217;s recent history of phenelzine and venlafaxine use raises concerns for serotonin syndrome. Dantrolene is not used in managing serotonin syndrome. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Phentolamine&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Phentolamine is a nonselective alpha-blocker used to treat hypertensive crises.

However, none of the physical exam findings are present in this patient, making opioid overdose unlikely. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cyproheptadine&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sodium bicarbonate&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Tricyclic antidepressant toxicity can present with convulsions, neurological depression, cardiotoxicity, and respiratory depression.
