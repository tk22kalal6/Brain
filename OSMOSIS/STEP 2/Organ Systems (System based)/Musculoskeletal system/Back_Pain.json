      "solution": "This patient presents with moderate pain, tingling and swelling, without sensory or motor deficits, and with mild pain with passive stretching. She has a normal potassium level and a mildly elevated CPK level. These findings suggest a possible diagnosis of <strong>acute compartment syndrome</strong>. Considering the patient's recent history of a right femoral artery embolectomy, the most probable underlying cause is <strong>ischemia-reperfusion syndrome</strong> which is associated with increased interstitial edema and intracellular swelling that can lead to a <strong>rise in intracompartmental pressure and ACS</strong>.<br><br>In the absence of more suggestive findings such as pain that is out of proportion to physical examination, significant pain with passive stretching of the muscles in the compartment, and a tense &#8220;wood-like&#8221; compartment, with potential motor and sensory deficits, the findings are <strong>inconclusive for ACS</strong>, and <strong>compartment pressure measurements</strong> are needed to <strong>confirm the diagnosis</strong>. This test involves inserting a needle or catheter into the affected compartment to measure the pressure. A pressure measurement &#8805; 30 mmHg, or a delta pressure (diastolic blood pressure minus compartment pressure) &#8804; 30 mmHg is diagnostic for ACS and is an indication of emergent surgical fasciotomy. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/9RkXuAIiQrS6xxB2h-_qxg7uQA6nv_04/_.png\"></div><br>Patients who are suspected of having ACS, but whose compartment pressure does not meet diagnostic criteria, should undergo hourly monitoring with <strong>serial extremity and compartment exams</strong>. If the physical examination and symptoms show consistent improvement, acute compartment syndrome can be ruled out. However, if exam findings or symptoms worsen, compartment pressure measurements should be repeated.<br><br>In cases where the patient presents with classical <strong>physical examination findings</strong> that indicate compartment syndrome such as pain out of proportion to physical findings, significant swelling, a tense &#8220;wood-like&#8221; muscle compartment, significant pain with passive stretching, and motor/sensory deficits that progress over a few hours, a <strong>clinical diagnosis of acute</strong><strong>compartment syndrome can be made</strong> and emergent surgical fasciotomy is indicated. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Compartment pressure measurement of the right lower extremity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Doppler ultrasound of the right lower extremity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although unilateral lower extremity swelling and a history of afib may indicate DVT and the need for doppler ultrasound, the clinical findings and history of right femoral artery embolization are more suggestive of a diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome from ischemia-reperfusion syndrome. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) angiography of the right extremity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Contrast-enhanced CT angiography can evaluate vascular patency and anatomy, helping to exclude other potential causes of limb pain, such as arterial thrombosis.

      "solution": "This patient presents with an effusion, pain, and joint instability after a <strong>rapid deceleration</strong> mechanism of injury. Together, these findings are concerning for an anterior cruciate ligament tear, best confirmed on physical examination with the <strong>Lachman test</strong>.<br><br>The knee's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most anterior ligamentous component of the knee joint. It prevents the tibia from sliding out in front of the femur and provides rotational stability. The ACL is the most commonly injured ligament in the knee and typically occurs in sports during moments of <strong>rapid deceleration, direction changes, or pivoting on a lower extremity with the foot planted</strong>. Symptoms include the sensation of a &#8220;pop&#8221; or &#8220;tear&#8221; during the injury as well as significant effusion, pain, and sensation of joint instability immediately after the incident.<br><br>Two physical examination techniques with high sensitivity for detecting ACL tears are the <strong>Lachman test</strong> and the <strong>anterior drawer test</strong>. The <strong>Lachman test</strong> involves flexing the knee at 20&#176;with the patient supine. At the same time, the examiner places one hand behind the tibia and the other hand grasps the patient's thigh and pulls the tibia forward. A positive test is indicated by anterior translational of the tibia or a &#8220;soft&#8221; end feel. The anterior drawer test involves the examiner grasping the proximal lower leg below the tibial plateau with the knee in 90&#176;of flexion and attempting to translate the lower leg anteriorly with the patient's foot planted on the examination table. Definitive diagnosis of ACL tear is achieved with MRI. Signs of ACL tear on MRI include swelling, increased signal intensity, fiber discontinuity and abnormal ACL orientation. An empty notch sign which is a fluid signal at the site of femoral attachment at the intercondylar notch may be seen and it denotes avulsion at the femoral attachment. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Lachman test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ober test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The Ober test is used to evaluate tension in the iliotibial band. This test would not help assess for an anterior cruciate ligament injury which is present in this case.. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ McMurray test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The McMurray test is used to detect a meniscal injury, which is less likely given this patient&#8217;s decreased effusion size and the presence of full range of motion of the knee without locking or clicking.. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Thessaly test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The Thessaly test, like the McMurray test, detects meniscal injuries. A meniscal tear is less likely in this patient, given that the swelling happened immediately and is subsequently subsiding and he has full range of motion of the knee without locking or clicking. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Posterior drawer test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The posterior drawer test detects excessive posterior translation or a &#8220;soft&#8221; endpoint of the proximal tibia when the posterior cruciate ligament is injured. Posterior cruciate ligament injury commonly occurs with a direct blow to the front of the knee such as when a bent knee hits the dashboard in a motor vehicle collision. Based on this patient&#8217;s mechanism of injury, an anterior cruciate ligament injury is more likely. &#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "This patient&#8217;s radiograph, mechanism of injury, and exam findings are consistent with a<strong>&#160;femoral neck fracture</strong>&#8211;one of the most common hip fracture patterns. Femoral neck fractures are common in older patients, especially those with underlying osteoporosis. They can occur with low energy falls and have a high morbidity and mortality rate. &#160; <br><br>Hip fractures get divided into <strong>intracapsular&#160;</strong>(femoral head and neck) or <strong>extracapsular&#160;</strong>(intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric). Specifically, a femoral neck or head fracture is an intracapsular, displaced fracture that typically occurs following a fall onto the lateral hip. Patients with a displaced femoral neck fracture are generally <strong>unable to bear weight&#160;</strong>on the affected side and present with a<strong>&#160;shortened leg with external rotation</strong> of the affected hip (due to the psoas and iliacus muscle contraction without acetabular counterforce). Notably, intracapsular fractures can be associated with disruption of the blood supply from the <strong>medial circumflex artery</strong>, resulting in <strong>avascular necrosis.</strong> Femoral head fractures are often associated with posterior dislocation of the hip and are at increased risk of sciatic nerve injury. Because of the potential for avascular necrosis with intracapsular fractures arthroplasty with hip replacement is typically the procedure of choice. &#160; <br><br>In contrast, an<strong>&#160;intertrochanteric fracture</strong> is an <strong>extracapsular fracture</strong> that occurs between the greater and lesser trochanters. A subtrochanteric fracture which is defined as a fracture within 5 cm distal to the lesser trochanter is also considered an extracapsular fracture. Clinical presentation is similar to femoral neck fractures. Both fracture patterns require surgical correction (e.g. open reduction with internal fixation) unless the patient is not a good surgical candidate. With extracapsular fractures the blood supply is usually intact and fixation is the procedure of choice. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/aa5TwEsMSjyJ9s9GQwLw-Sb-Rg_OXc5p/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Posterior dislocation of the femoral head:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Posterior dislocation of the femoral head occurs secondary to high-velocity motor vehicle collisions.

However, aspiration of the synovial fluid in pseudogout demonstrates rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent crystals. &#160; <br><br>The pathogenesis of CPPD is similar to that of gout. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals cause joint synovial cells to secrete <strong>proinflammatory cytokines</strong> such as IL-1, which recruits <strong>neutrophils&#160;</strong>and macrophages, further promoting the inflammatory process. <strong>Colchicine</strong> is an inhibitor of microtubule assembly. It is therefore hypothesized that the drug inhibits crystal endocytosis and/or presentation to intracellular inflammasomes, which helps prevent propagation of the inflammation process. <strong>Daily, low-dose colchicine</strong>, therefore, will help reduce future episodes of pseudogout attacks. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Colchicine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Allopurinol&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>In patients with gout, the rate of recurrent episodes can be reduced by decreasing uric acid production.
