In both adolescents and children, pars defects can be caused by overuse of the low back, mainly from sports that involve repetitive back bend-like motion.

She was wearing her costume, which includes a corset, and noticed numbness and burning sensation over the lateral side of her left thigh following the rehearsal. Past medical history is noncontributory. BMI is 35 kg/m2. Vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination demonstrates loss of light touch and pinprick sensation over the upper lateral thigh. Lower extremity strength is 5/5 bilaterally, and deep tendon reflexes are +2. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally. Pain is reproduced with tapping immediately below the anterior superior iliac spine. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient&#8217;s condition?",

Commonly identified risk factors include pregnancy, <strong>tight-fitted clothes</strong>/seat belts, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Affected patients present with <strong>pain, paresthesias</strong> (numbness and tingling), and <strong>hypoesthesia </strong>(diminished sensation) over the upper outer thigh. Muscle strength, however, is normal as the LFCN does not carry motor fibers. Symptoms may be reproduced with tapping over the lateral aspect of the inguinal ligament (Tinel's sign). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Diagnosis is clinical, and most patients are managed with weight loss and avoidance of exacerbating factors (e.g. avoiding tight-fitted clothing). Anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, or gabapentin) can help reduce neuropathic pain in patients with refractory symptoms. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Compression of the ilioinguinal nerve:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The ilioinguinal nerve innervates the medial thigh, inguinal region, and lower abdomen.
