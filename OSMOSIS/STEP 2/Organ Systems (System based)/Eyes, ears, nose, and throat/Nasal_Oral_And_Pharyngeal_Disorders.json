      "solution": "This patient is most likely suffering from <strong>warfarin-induced skin necrosis,&#160;</strong>which typically occurs during the first few days of warfarin therapy. <strong>Warfarin inhibits vitamin K- dependent &#611;-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues&#160;</strong>of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X &#160;by inhibiting the VKOR complex. It also<strong> inhibits the production of natural anticoagulants protein C and S. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>Protein C activity is decreased by 50% during the first few days of warfarin therapy due to its shorter half-life than factors II and X, resulting in its shorter half-life, a<strong> transient hypercoagulable state.&#160;</strong>During the initial days of warfarin therapy, <strong>prolonging the prothrombin time (PT)&#160;</strong>reflects <strong>inhibition of factor VII,</strong> which also carries a short half-life. More importantly, this does not represent adequate anticoagulation because additional vitamin K-dependent factors are insufficiently reduced (it takes approximately five days with adequate dosing). &#160; &#160;<br><br>When warfarin is chosen as the agent for long-term anticoagulation, it is started on the same day as<strong> heparin for five days.</strong> Heparin&#8217;s activation of antithrombin enables anticoagulation during the initial, transient hypercoagulable state caused by warfarin.

Approximately half of this variability is known to be caused by clinical or lifestyle factors (e.g., a patient&#8217;s age, weight, BMI, gender, smoking status, existing conditions, and concomitant medications), as well as by <strong>genetic factors&#8211;including variants in the <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>or <em>CYP2C9&#160;</em>gene. &#160;</strong><br><br>The <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>and <em>CYP2C9&#160;</em>genotypes are the most critical genetic determinants of warfarin dosing. Warfarin targets the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme (VKORC1), catalyzing the rate-limiting step in vitamin K recycling (converting vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K). This, in turn, inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. &#160;<br><br>A common non-coding variant, <em>VKORC1</em>, c.-1639G&gt;A, is associated with increased sensitivity to warfarin. <strong>Patients with this variant require lower doses of warfarin, as standard doses may result in a supratherapeutic INR and subsequent bleeding complications.</strong> The polymorphism occurs in the promoter region of the VKORC1 gene and is thought to alter a transcription factor binding site, leading to lower protein expression. As a result, patients starting warfarin therapy who are carrying at least one &#8220;A&#8221; (mutated) allele at the -1639 locus require lower initial and maintenance doses compared with patients carrying a G/G (wild type) genotype at this locus. &#160;<br><br>Less commonly, <strong>missense mutations in <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>can lead to warfarin resistance&#160;</strong>and higher dose requirements.

Patients can report additional bleeding sites (menorrhagia, hematemesis, hematochezia, hematuria). History may reveal immediate excessive bleeding following a trauma or surgery. In some cases, patients may report recent infections, immunodeficiency or autoimmune conditions, or a recent <strong>introduction of new medications</strong> or vaccines. In this case, the patient started taking <strong>naproxen</strong>, which has been associated with ITP. Other medications that have been associated with ITP include certain antibiotics (beta-lactams, linezolid, etc.), anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, etc.), quinine, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. &#160;&#160;<br><br>The physical examination typically reveals a well-appearing patient with non-palpable, flat <strong>petechiae, purpura,</strong> and <strong>ecchymoses on skin examination.</strong> In some cases, subconjunctival hemorrhages or mild active bleeding like epistaxis can be seen. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Gestational thrombocytopenia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Gestational thrombocytopenia is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic pregnant patients.

Patients with ITP exhibit a platelet count of &lt;100,000/uL and a reduced number of platelets or giant platelets on peripheral smear.

The platelet count is normal, and the ristocetin cofactor assay does not demonstrate platelet aggregation. Additionally, she has a first degree relative with a history of mucosal bleeding. Together, these findings are consistent with <strong>von Willebrand disease</strong> (vWD), the <strong>most common</strong> inherited bleeding disorder. Treatment for this disease involves administration of <strong>DDAVP or desmopressin</strong>, which works by<strong>&#160;releasing vWF from the vascular endothelium.&#160;</strong><br><br><strong>vWD&#160;</strong>is inherited in an<strong>&#160;autosomal dominant fashion</strong>, so at least one first degree relative is affected as well. The disease is caused by a quantitative or qualitative defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF), which acts as a bridge between subendothelial collagen and the GpIb receptor found on the platelet surface. The disease is divided into three subtypes: <strong>type I&#160;</strong>is the most common and is associated with a decrease in vWF, whereas<strong>&#160;type II&#160;</strong>has dysfunctional vWF, and <strong>type III</strong> with no detectable vWF. &#160; <br><br>With decreased amounts, defective, or complete loss of vWF, platelet plug formation is impaired. This manifests as mucosal bleeding, easy bruising, heavy menstrual bleeding, and prolonged bleeding following dental extractions. Diagnosis relies on family history and laboratory findings that typically<strong>&#160;show a normal platelet count, prolonged bleeding time, and normal to slightly increased PTT</strong> since vWF carries and protects factor VIII. Additionally, no platelet aggregation will occur with the <strong>ristocetin cofactor assay</strong>.

These findings are concerning for a <strong>rectus sheath hematoma</strong>. This patient is at risk of developing <strong>hemorrhagic shock</strong> without immediate intervention since a large volume of blood can be lost before a rectal sheath hematoma is suspected and diagnosed.<br><br>A rectus sheath hematoma is caused by arterial bleeding that leads to abdominal pain and a tender abdominal wall mass. Patients on anticoagulation are at an increased risk of developing this condition, as are patients who have recently undergone abdominal surgery. It often can be <strong>difficult to diagnose</strong> and <strong>differentiate from other causes of acute abdominal pain</strong>. If patients can raise their legs or head, and with that, the abdominal pain gets worse, then they have a positive Carnett sign, which indicates that the origin of the pain is the abdominal wall rather than an intra-abdominal source.<br><br>The first step in assessing a patient presenting with an abdominal wall mass is to perform an ABCDE assessment to determine if they are stable or unstable.
