In patients with suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), tests for ADAMTS13 activity level and ADAMTS13 inhibitors are used to confirm the diagnosis.

However, warfarin also inhibits <strong>proteins C and S,&#160;</strong>which are factors that function as anticoagulants (these proteins are thought of like the brakes on the coagulation cascade). &#160; <br><br>Specifically, <strong>inhibition of protein C leads to a hypercoagulable state since it has the shortest half-life of all factors inhibited by warfarin.&#160;</strong>At therapeutic doses, the anticoagulant effects of warfarin outweigh the hypercoagulable ones, but protein C is depleted before the other factors during the initiation of the medication. This creates a temporarily hypercoagulable state during which the patient is more prone to clotting. This factor imbalance manifests in paradoxical pro-coagulation, resulting in microthrombules of blood vessels in the skin and subsequent purpura and necrosis.

They can be <strong>inherited&#160;</strong>(e.g., <strong>factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutations, deficiencies of protein C, S, and antithrombin)</strong> or <strong>acquired</strong>, such as with<strong>&#160;antiphospholipid syndrome.&#160;</strong>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>All patients who present with thrombosis should be assessed for <strong>provoking risk factors,</strong> which include recent or temporary conditions that increase the risk of clotting. These may include recent surgery or immobilization, active malignancy, or active pregnancy. If <strong>no provoking risk factors are present, and&#160;</strong>the patient is <strong>&lt; 45 years of age,</strong> has<strong>&#160;recurrent thromboses,</strong> or has <strong>thromboses in multiple veins and/or unusual sites;&#160;</strong>they should be<strong>&#160;screened for a hypercoagulable disorder.</strong> While the inherited thrombophilic disorders listed above generally cause venous thrombosis, <strong>antiphospholipid syndrome</strong> can lead to <strong>arterial and venous thrombosis&#160;</strong>and should be considered in any patient with <strong>unexplained arterial thrombosis. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Personal history of middle cerebral artery thrombosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong><strong>:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Personal history of a spontaneous abortion at 9 weeks gestation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:&#160;</strong>Recurrent (three or more) spontaneous abortions before 10 weeks of gestation is suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome in the appropriate clinical setting.
