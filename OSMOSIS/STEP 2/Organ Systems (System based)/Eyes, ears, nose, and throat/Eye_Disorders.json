      "solution": "This patient with anemia, family history of sickle cell anemia and renal papillary necrosis, and medical history of severe chest pain from vaso-occlusive crises has <strong>sickle cell disease (SCD)</strong> that warrants treatment with <strong>hydroxyurea</strong>. SCD, also called sickle cell anemia, is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder that is caused by a genetic mutation that <strong>substitutes glutamic acid with valine</strong> in the sixth position of the beta globin chain in adult hemoglobin. Replacing glutamic acid, a negatively charged molecule, with valine, a neutral molecule, creates a hydrophobic effect on the surface of the beta globin chain and creates what is called <strong>Hemoglobin S (HbS)</strong>. This hydrophobic surface interacts with the hydrophobic molecules on other beta globin chains and causes them to polymerize. Especially when there is acidosis, hypoxia, or dehydration, HbS changes its shape and aggregates with other HbS proteins to form long chains that distort erythrocytes into a crescent or sickled shape. This distortion leads to both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. &#160; <br><br>Since inheritance of SCD is autosomal recessive, a patient must have both copies of the gene to get the disease. If the person has just one copy of the mutation and one normal hemoglobin A gene, or HbA, then they have <strong>sickle cell (HbS) trait</strong> and are said to be a carrier for SCD. In this scenario, the family history of sickle cell disease in the maternal uncle and renal papillary necrosis in the paternal grandfather indicate that the patient&#8217;s parents likely both have sickle cell trait. Peripheral blood smear may show sickled erythrocytes or Howell-Jolly bodies, which are basophilic nuclear remnants seen in erythrocytes and indicative of a nonfunctional or absent spleen. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/HRVyUAZ8TqKxOjhboNYN2d3oQjOfRDIM/_.png\"></div><br><br>Testing for sickle cell anemia may be done prenatally via amniocentesis, in newborns, or during sickle cell crisis in children and adults. Definitive diagnosis is achieved via <strong>hemoglobin electrophoresis</strong>. &#160;Management of patients with sickle cell disease includes a modified vaccination schedule, regular hydration, prophylactic penicillin (due to increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria), pain management, and avoidance of extreme heat or cold, intense exercise, and hypoxic conditions. Patients with six or more vaso-occlusive episodes in a year also require treatment with <strong>hydroxyurea</strong>, which increases levels of fetal hemoglobin, also called <strong>hemoglobin F (HbF)</strong>.<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/L3k_IsmwSP_wnf0bHqTDAOCCQxa771x-/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/XLPX4liCS8SOUkwEFjoBRkBmT_Cbd9a3/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/m564H3JsQR2LdvuZ83OPI0h1RmCzxPoh/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hemoglobin A1c:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Hemoglobin A1c, which is used to monitor disease progression in patients with diabetes, may be lower than expected in patients with sickle cell anemia due to increased turnover.

He likely has<strong>&#160;X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA). &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>XLSA is due to a defect in the <strong>&#948;-aminolevulinate (ALA) synthase gene</strong>. Since heme synthesis takes place in the mitochondria, iron is normally delivered to the mitochondria. Due to the enzyme defect, however, iron accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix of these erythrocytes and forms the characteristic sideroblastic ring. Since ringed-sideroblasts are immature red blood cells, they are usually seen on <strong>bone marrow biopsy</strong> and rarely seen in the bloodstream. In addition, due to the accumulation of iron, patients typically have increased iron levels, increased ferritin levels, and low/normal total iron binding capacity (TIBC). &#160;<br><br>ALA synthase uses <strong>pyridoxine (vitamin B6)</strong> as an essential cofactor in the first step of heme synthesis. Therefore, in children with XLSA, supplemental pyridoxine should be given to stimulate the defective enzyme, resulting in improved heme production.

Her <strong>vegan&#160;</strong>diet and the <strong>hypersegmented neutrophils</strong> (see above) on peripheral smear make <strong>megaloblastic anemia</strong> from<strong>&#160;B12 or folate deficiency</strong> the likely cause of anemia. &#160; <br><br>When evaluating anemia in a newborn or infant, it is important to use <strong>age-appropriate normal values</strong>. For example, a normal hemoglobin at 3 days old is 18.5 g/dL compared to 11.2 g/dL at 2 months old. In the setting of anemia, the most important parts of a complete blood cell count are the <strong>hemoglobin and hematocrit</strong>, the <strong>mean corpuscular value (MCV),&#160;</strong>and the other cell lines (white blood cells and platelets). The MCV will differentiate <strong>microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias</strong>. It is important to check other cell lines to ensure it is isolated anemia and not aplastic anemia. &#160; &#160;<br><br>A <strong>peripheral smear</strong> can help identify the etiology of the anemia. For example, basophilic stippling of red blood cells is pathognomonic for lead poisoning, <strong>segmented neutrophils</strong> are pathognomonic for<strong>&#160;B12 and folate deficiency,</strong> and toxic granules are consistent with an inflammatory process. A <strong>reticulocyte count</strong> should be obtained in the setting of anemia to determine if the anemia is due to underproduction (low reticulocyte count) or red blood cell destruction or loss (elevated reticulocyte count). &#160; &#160;<br><br>If the patient has <strong>microcytic anemia, iron studies</strong> and <strong>lead level</strong> should be obtained.

Newborn screen was positive for a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) of 30 mIU/L (normal: &lt; 20 mIU/L) and free thyroxine (T4) of 1ng/dL (normal: 0.8-2 ng/dL). This finding was confirmed, and she subsequently started on Levothyroxine 1.5 weeks ago. She is at the 30th percentile for length and 8th percentile for weight. Temperature is 37.2&#176;C (98.9&#176;F), pulse is 158/min, respirations are 36/min, blood pressure is 70/42 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is 99%. On examination, she has jaundice of her face and upper torso and a small reducible umbilical hernia. Blood work is obtained due to persistent jaundice and is shown below.

      "solution": "This patient has <strong>congenital hypothyroidism</strong> that was picked up on newborn screening and confirmed with subsequent thyroid function tests. A <strong>large anterior fontanelle</strong> is a common finding in patients with congenital hypothyroidism. This patient&#8217;s history of <strong>feeding problems</strong> and persistent <strong>jaundice&#160;</strong>and <strong>umbilical hernia</strong> on physical examination are consistent with the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism. Labs confirm hyperbilirubinemia and <strong>macrocytic anemia</strong>, both of which can be associated with congenital hypothyroidism. &#160; <br><br>When narrowing down the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with <strong>anemia</strong>, the <strong>patient&#8217;s age</strong> is important, as some causes of anemia occur only at certain times in a child&#8217;s life, such as physiologic anemia of infancy which occurs around 8-12 weeks of life. Whether the patient has a <strong>history of prematurity&#160;</strong>should also be considered. Premature infants are at risk for anemia of prematurity around 4-8 weeks of life. History should also include diet history, medications, exposures (such as exposure to lead paint), recent infections, family history of anemia, and <strong>newborn screen results. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Anemia in newborns and infants can present with generalized<strong>&#160;fatigue and malaise.</strong> On physical exam, patients may have<strong>&#160;tachycardia, palpitations, dyspnea, a flow murmur, and/or pallor.</strong> Congenital disorders associated with anemia often have associated <strong>physical abnormalities</strong> that may help narrow down the differential. For example, Diamond Blackfan anemia has associated thumb malformations (see below), craniofacial abnormalities, short stature, and heart defects. In addition to the physical examination findings noted above, patients with congenital hypothyroidism may also present with periorbital edema, macroglossia, and hypotonia. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/_7jBeSA4RSi2hx3xdCRtrQWUQ3uP_SOM/_.png\"></div><br><strong>Triphalangeal thumb <br></strong>Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Large anterior fontanelle:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypertonia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient has congenital hypothyroidism which presents with hypotonia, not hypertonia.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Thumb malformation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient has congenital hypothyroidism which does not have associated thumb malformations.

Laboratory evaluation shows <strong>microcytic anemia, iron deficiency,&#160;</strong>and <strong>basophilic stippling of RBCs</strong> (see below) on peripheral smear. History, physical exam, and laboratory findings are consistent with anemia secondary to <strong>lead poisoning</strong>, which can be confirmed by checking a <strong>lead level. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br><strong><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ekZfF_BySFq0G4Qs8aZs17YgRNGN-FK3/_.png\"></div></strong><br><br>Once a patient diagnosed with anemia is deemed stable, the first step in evaluation is to obtain a reticulocyte count. A <strong>reticulocyte count above</strong> the reference range suggests <strong>anemia secondary to red blood cell destruction</strong>, whereas a <strong>reticulocyte count below&#160;</strong>the reference range suggests <strong>anemia secondary to underproduction</strong>. Anemias secondary to underproduction can be classified into three categories based on the <strong>mean corpuscular volume (MCV): microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemia.</strong>&#160; &#160;<br><br>A diagnosis of <strong>microcytic anemia</strong> with a low reticulocyte count warrants testing of iron studies. If iron deficiency is confirmed, a lead level and peripheral smear should be obtained to differentiate <strong>iron deficiency anemia</strong> from anemia due to <strong>lead poisoning.</strong> Patients who drink<strong>&#160;large volumes of milk&#160;</strong>are at high risk for iron deficiency anemia because milk blocks iron absorption. Breast milk is also low in iron, so breastfed infants should start on iron supplementation at 4 months. People who live in <strong>homes built before 1978,&#160;</strong>especially if they are undergoing renovation, are at risk for lead poisoning and subsequent anemia. Lead poisoning causes anemia by preventing iron absorption and inhibiting heme synthesis. &#160; <br><br>A diagnosis of <strong>normocytic anemia</strong> with low reticulocyte count is likely secondary to <strong>physiologic anemia of infancy, anemia of prematurity, transient erythroblastopenia of childhood</strong>, or <strong>infection</strong>. These can often be differentiated based on patient age or, in the case of infection, by a concomitant viral or bacterial infection. &#160; <br><br>A diagnosis of <strong>macrocytic anemia</strong> with low reticulocyte count is likely secondary to<strong>&#160;B12 or folate deficiency, Diamond-Blackfan syndrome,</strong> or <strong>congenital hypothyroidism.</strong> A history of a <strong>vegan diet</strong> puts patients at risk for B12 and folate deficiency. Diamond-Blackfan and congenital hypothyroidism are two genetic disorders that have specific physical exam characteristics that may help determine the diagnosis. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Lead level:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ B12/folate level:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>B12/folate deficiency is typically seen in vegan individuals, and it causes macrocytic anemia.

Oral&#160;<strong>supplementation </strong>with&#160;<strong>ferrous sulfate</strong>&#160;is recommended,&#160;and length of treatment depends on the severity of the&#160;anemia. Oral supplementation is&#160;recommended to be taken&#160;<strong>with acidic foods</strong>&#160;for better absorption and&#160;<strong>should not be taken with milk, eggs, or soy</strong>,&#160;which are&#160;foods&#160;that limit absorption.

Combined with an unsuccessful bone marrow aspiration (dry tap), these features suggest <strong>hairy cell leukemia (HCL)</strong>. HCL is an indolent B-cell neoplasm found in middle-aged men characterized by bone marrow failure and infiltration of the reticuloendothelial system. <strong>Purine analogs</strong> (i.e. <strong>cladribine</strong> or pentostatin) are the preferred initial treatment for most patients with symptomatic HCL and normal renal function.<br><br>Cladribine is a purine analog that <strong>inhibits DNA synthesis</strong> by acting specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle through various mechanisms. It becomes phosphorylated into a triphosphate form which is subsequently incorporated into newly synthesized DNA strands. It can also <strong>inhibit DNA polymerase</strong>, the key enzyme of DNA replication. Cladribine is also resistant to adenosine deaminase, which is the enzyme that usually degrades purines. Thus, this agent can reach very high levels inside cells, decreasing de novo purine synthesis. This agent is the medication of choice for treating patients with HCL and other leukemias.

      "solution": "This patient was most likely started on <strong>bleomycin</strong>, an antitumor antibiotic used frequently to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. Bleomycin acts on the <strong>G2 phase</strong> of the cell cycle and prevents cells from proceeding to the M stage (mitosis).<br><br>The cell cycle is normally divided into 4 stages: G1, S, G2, and M (mitosis). In order to progress from one stage to another, proliferating cells must pass through <strong>surveillance checkpoints</strong>. These checkpoints are found mainly in-between the G1-S phase and G2-M phase. If the cell is found to have mutated DNA, regulatory proteins at the checkpoints (e.g., p53) are activated and prevent the cell from progressing to the next stage until the DNA is repaired. If the DNA damage is irreversible, the cell undergoes apoptosis. Mutations in genes controlling the checkpoints enable cells to enter mitosis without DNA repair, thus leading to cancer.<br><br>The antitumor antibiotic bleomycin acts primarily on the G2 phase of the cell cycle. It attaches to DNA by intercalating with specific base pairs and generating <strong>free radicals</strong>, which cause breaks in the DNA strand. In contrast, although other antitumor antibiotics (e.g., actinomycin B, anthracyclines) also intercalate with DNA, they are <strong>cell cycle non-specific</strong>.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/R5y3w65VQP_cWb0WTM1j-BgsTamaPrqP/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Disruption of microtubules assembly:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine) inhibit the formation of microtubules.

It usually presents with a constellation of findings that can be remembered with the term <strong>CRAB</strong>: hyper<strong>C</strong>alcemia, <strong>R</strong>enal dysfunction, <strong>A</strong>nemia, and <strong>B</strong>one lesions. The hypercalcemia seen in MM can often lead to <strong>constipation</strong>. &#160; <br><br><strong>Hypercalcemia&#160;</strong>is a common finding in patients with MM due to<strong>&#160;increased bone resorption,</strong> secondary to secretion of <strong>osteoclast-activating factors</strong> by malignant plasma cells. Elevated calcium levels can lead to polyuria, polydipsia, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and <strong>constipation</strong>. Some patients with MM may have blurred vision or headaches from <strong>hyperviscosity syndrome,&#160;</strong>which is due to the increased production of immunoglobulins. <strong>Recurrent infections</strong> are another hallmark feature of MM since malignant transformation impairs the ability of plasma cells to produce a diverse array of antibodies. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Constipation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Asymmetrically enlarged and firm prostate on digital rectal examination:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>An asymmetrically enlarged and firm prostate suggests prostate cancer.

The condition tends to develop in patients with autoimmune diseases (e.g., <strong>systemic lupus erythematosus</strong>, <strong>rheumatoid arthritis</strong>), solid tumor malignancies, and use of certain medications (e.g., penicillin, sulfonamides, phenytoin).

In cases of ITP with critical bleeding, a <strong>combination of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoids</strong> is administered along with platelet transfusions. &#160; <br><br>Treatment objectives for ITP involve sustaining a safe platelet count to prevent significant bleeding. In instances of mild to moderate <strong>asymptomatic thrombocytopenia</strong> (&gt; 30,000 cells/&#956;L), the majority of patients have a stable and benign course, and <strong>observation&#160;</strong>without other treatment can be provided. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients with or without minor bleeding and low platelet counts that put them at risk for bleeding are typically treated with glucocorticoids or IVIG if they cannot take glucocorticoids or if there is no improvement in platelet counts with glucocorticoids. &#160; <br><br>For patients with<strong>&#160;severe thrombocytopenia</strong> (&lt; 30,000 cells/&#956;L), there is a risk of future bleeding, requiring initial treatment with <strong>high-dose oral corticosteroids</strong> (1 mg/kg), even if patients have no symptoms. Combination treatment with glucocorticoids and IVIG is typically used. &#160; <br><br>In cases of <strong>critical bleeding where there is bleeding into a critical anatomical site or there is hemodynamic instability&#160;</strong>or respiratory compromise, a <strong>combination of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoids</strong> is administered. This approach is based on the rationale that each treatment modality operates through distinct mechanisms, and their combination may have an augmentative effect, although specific studies directly addressing this combination have not been reported. Glucocorticoids suppress the production of anti-platelet antibodies; IVIG binds to and inactivates antibodies that are already present in the circulation. In addition, patients with critical bleeding typically have platelet counts below 20,000 microL; therefore, <strong>platelet transfusions</strong> are also given. &#160; <br><br>If the initial medications prove ineffective at increasing the platelet count, <strong>second-line&#160;</strong>treatment options include<strong>&#160;thrombopoietin-receptor agonists</strong> such as <strong>romiplostim&#160;</strong>and <strong>immunomodulators&#160;</strong>like <strong>rituximab</strong>.

This patient&#8217;s two lower extremity venous thromboses were&#160;likely provoked, both by orthopedic injuries, surgery, or immobility.

They can be <strong>inherited&#160;</strong>(e.g., factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutations, deficiencies in&#160;protein C, S, and antithrombin) or <strong>acquired&#160;</strong>(e.g.&#160;antiphospholipid syndrome).&#160; &#160; <br><br>All patients with thrombosis should be assessed for <strong>provoking risk factors,</strong>&#160;which include conditions that increase the risk of clotting. These may include recent surgery injury or immobilization, active malignancy, or active pregnancy. If <strong>no provoking risk factors are present</strong> then patients should be screened for <strong>hypercoagulable disorder&#160;</strong>if they are<strong> &lt; 45 years of age</strong>, have <strong>recurrent thromboses,</strong> or<strong> thromboses in multiple veins and/or unusual sites, </strong>or are <strong>young and have arterial thrombosis. &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>In patients without an underlying medical condition (e.g. cirrhosis),<strong> portal, hepatic, and mesenteric vein thromboses </strong>are&#160;considered unusual and testing for hypercoagulable disorders should be performed.
