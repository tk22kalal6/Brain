In addition to hydroxychloroquine, <strong>oral glucocorticoids</strong> (like <strong>prednisone</strong>) would be the preferred treatment for moderate disease activity without major organ-threatening disease. The potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids can significantly reduce the symptoms of a lupus flare and prevent further progression of the disease.<br><br>Treatment for SLE depends on <strong>disease severity</strong>. All patients with SLE should be started on <strong>hydroxychloroquine </strong>due to its ability to <strong>reduce the frequency of flares</strong> and <strong>prevent long-term organ damage</strong>. For <strong>mild SLE flares</strong>, characterized by symptoms such as mild skin and joint involvement and mild cytopenias, <strong>hydroxychloroquine </strong>should be used and <strong>NSAIDs or low-dose glucocorticoids may be added</strong>. For <strong>moderate disease flares</strong>, which may present with more pronounced symptoms and <strong>moderate cytopenias</strong>, as seen in this patient, treatment includes the <strong>addition of oral moderate-dose glucocorticoids</strong>. If response is inadequate despite combined therapy, additional immunosuppressants (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) are indicated. For <strong>severe SLE</strong> with organ-threatening complications a more intensive treatment strategy is indicated. This consists of a combination of <strong>hydroxychloroquine, high-dose glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressive therapy</strong> (e.g. mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide). ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are also used to treat renal disease. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Oral glucocorticoids:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased dose of hydroxychloroquine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: While hydroxychloroquine is beneficial for long-term management of systemic lupus erythematosus, it does not provide immediate control of moderate disease flares.

All patients should then undergo chest imaging beginning with chest radiography but also including <strong>CT imaging of the chest.&#160;</strong>Imaging will generally show reticular or nodular opacities in all types of &#160;pneumoconiosis. Additional findings can sometimes differentiate between the different types of pneumoconiosis (e.g. eggshell calcification in silicosis and pleural plaques in asbestosis). In patients with a very clear exposure history and classic imaging findings, the diagnosis can often be made after CT imaging of the chest. However, if the diagnosis is unclear, then <strong>bronchoscopy with</strong><strong>&#160;bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)&#160;</strong>should be performed.

Integrins are a class of selective adhesion molecules that are involved in the chemotaxis of leukocytes to the site of inflammation. Normally, leukocytes bind the integrins and then migrate from blood vessels to the site of inflammation. By blocking the integrins, natalizumab causes anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the leukocytes from migrating to the site of inflammation and inducing a proinflammatory response.

When the immune system is suppressed, such as in HIV or with natalizumab use, JC virus can get reactivated, leading to a disease known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is characterized by demyelination in the CNS due to the destruction of oligodendrocytes and is rapidly progressive and fatal. Therefore, patients taking natalizumab should be tested for anti-JC virus antibodies before starting treatment and continue to be tested periodically while on natalizumab, even if the initial anti-JC antibodies were negative.<br><br>Other side effects of natalizumab include headaches and nausea. In some patients, nucleated erythrocytes can appear in the peripheral blood, which has no clinical significance and usually disappear after stopping the treatment. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Osmotic demyelination syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a fatal condition that results from rapid correction of hyponatremia.

For <strong>secondary hyperparathyroidism</strong>, particularly when it is related to malabsorption disorders such as celiac disease or <strong>post-gastric bypass surgery</strong>, the emphasis is on correcting nutrient deficiencies including <strong>supplementing with calcium and vitamin D</strong>, and managing any underlying malabsorptive conditions. <strong>Tertiary hyperparathyroidism</strong>, which develops from prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism, typically requires <strong>surgical intervention</strong> due to the parathyroid glands' autonomous functioning. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Vitamin D and calcium supplementation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Furosemide:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A loop diuretic is not indicated in this scenario as it can promote calcium loss through urine.

The ideal therapy for this patient would be to target this mutation selectively. Only imatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor,&#160;does this of the listed answer choices.<br><br><strong>Imatinib</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>is a&#160;<strong>tyrosine kinase inhibitor</strong>&#160;commonly used for chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and some types of GISTs. Imatinib functions by inhibiting the kinase domain of the&#160;<em>BCR-ABL</em>&#160;tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinases are enzymes responsible for signal transduction cascades responsible for cell proliferation. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases selectively inhibits the proliferation of cancers that overexpress them. The KIT kinase is structurally&#160;similar to&#160;the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. This prompted a clinical trial&#160;immediately&#160;to investigate the use of imatinib in the treatment of KIT tumors, such as GISTs. Now, using imatinib is&#160;established&#160;as first-line therapy in treating metastatic GIST. A common side effect of imatinib therapy is fluid retention, hepatotoxicity, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.

For example, patients with bronchiectasis tend to have copious sputum production, whereas patients with UACS may have minimal sputum, and patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have none. Environmental exposures, known allergies, and tobacco use should also be explored. Associated symptoms may also point toward the underlying etiology, such as heartburn (GERD), shortness of breath (asthma or COPD), an <strong><span>abnormal sensation in the throat</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;or frequent throat clearing</span></strong> (UACS). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Physical examination should include examination of the ears, nose, throat, and lungs.

In the absence of&#160;trauma,&#160;infectious&#160;causes like septic arthritis or osteomyelitis&#160;should be considered.&#160;This is&#160;particularly&#160;important&#160;in patients with systemic&#160;signs and&#160;symptoms,&#160;such as fever&#160;or chills,&#160;or with risk factors,&#160;like&#160;a history of intravenous drug use.&#160;These conditions can be confirmed&#160;with&#160;blood tests, synovial fluid analysis, and imaging&#160;(with MRI).&#160;If trauma and infection are&#160;unlikely&#160;but diabetes&#160;is&#160;present,&#160;then patients should&#160;be&#160;assessed&#160;for neuropathic&#160;pain&#160;with&#160;nerve&#160;conduction velocity studies.&#160;If&#160;tendinopathies, osteoarthritis,&#160;or systemic arthritis&#160;like&#160;rheumatoid arthritis&#160;is suspected, further evaluation with ultrasound,&#160;MRI, joint&#160;aspiration,&#160;and specific blood tests should be&#160;considered.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Complete blood count and C-reactive protein&#160;(CRP)&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:</span><span>&#160;While&#160;</span><span>an elevated white blood cell count or&#160;</span><span>CRP</span><span>&#160;may</span><span>&#160;support the diagnosis of a</span><span>&#160;joint</span><span>&#160;infection</span><span>&#160;</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>.</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;septic arthritis</span><span>)</span><span>,&#160;</span><span>they&#160;</span><span>w</span><span>o</span><span>uld</span><span>&#160;not definitively&#160;</span><span>identify</span><span>&#160;</span><span>the</span><span>&#160;causative organism&#160;</span><span>or confirm the diagnosis</span><span>.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ X-ray of the ankle:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:</span><span>&#160;An X-ray can help&#160;</span><span>identify</span><span>&#160;fractures or&#160;</span><span>signs of&#160;</span><span>osteomyelitis</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;but</span><span>&#160;</span><span>X</span><span>-</span><span>ray&#160;</span><span>is not sensitive or specific&#160;</span><span>enough&#160;</span><span>for&#160;</span><span>diagnosing&#160;</span><span>septic arthritis.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Arthrocentesis</span><span>&#160;</span><span>with</span><span>&#160;</span><span>s</span><span>ynovial</span><span>&#160;fluid analysis&#160;</span><span>is</span><span>&#160;</span><span>the best test for diagnosing</span><span>&#160;septic arthritis</span><span>&#160;and guiding treatment.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the ankle:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:</span><span>&#160;MRI is useful for&#160;</span><span>providing&#160;</span><span>detailed imaging of&#160;</span><span>the&#160;</span><span>soft tissue and&#160;</span><span>bone</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;but</span><span>&#160;</span><span>arthrocentesis would be better to confirm the diagnosis of septic arthritis and to guide the choice of antibiotics.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Nerve conduction velocity study:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:</span><span>&#160;Nerve conduction velocity studies are used to diagnose neuropathies.

This patient has clinical findings suggestive of <strong>dehydration</strong>, including <strong>vasovagal symptoms with standing up</strong>.

However, symptoms alone are not effective in further elucidating the type of SVT, and all patients should have an electrocardiogram for formal diagnosis of the arrhythmia. Physical examination may reveal clues (e.g., regular pulse or irregular pulse) or bounding neck pulses, which are occasionally observed in patients with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Importantly, patients should be assessed for signs of instability including altered mental status, poor perfusion (e.g., delayed capillary refill), or hypotension. Further history may provide additional clues regarding the origination of arrhythmia such as recent alcohol or caffeine intake, dehydration, or medical comorbidities such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, or smoking.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Poor oral intake, vomiting, and&#160;diarrhea:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Family history of arrythmia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>A family history of&#160;</span><span>arrhythmia&#160;</span><span>may predispose&#160;</span><span>patients&#160;</span><span>to conditions such as Wolf-Parkinson-</span><span>White</span><span>; however,&#160;</span><span>WPW typically</span><span>&#160;predisposes&#160;</span><span>patients to&#160;</span><span>orthodromic&#160;</span><span>AVRT</span><span>, which&#160;</span><span>presents&#160;</span><span>as a</span><span>&#160;regular,</span><span>&#160;narrow complex tachycardia with&#160;</span><span>P</span><span>-waves&#160;</span><span>that&#160;</span><span>immediately</span><span>&#160;follow the QRS complex.

Cytochrome p450 is an enzyme that&#160;contains&#160;heme. In patients taking p450 inducers (e.g.&#160;barbiturates), circulating levels of heme are reduced as more p450 enzymes are produced. Lack of circulating heme reduces the negative feedback of ALA synthase-1, promoting the production of more heme (see image below). The underlying etiology of acute intermittent porphyria is an impairment in the activity of porphobilinogen deaminase, which leads to an&#160;accumulation of porphobilinogen (PBG). This can be detected in the urine.&#160;High levels&#160;of ALA and PBG can build up and become toxic.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by a mutation in the&#160;HMBS&#160;(also called PBGD) gene, which codes for porphobilinogen deaminase. Patients with AIP are often asymptomatic, with some patients never experiencing any symptoms. Of patients that do experience a&#160;porphyric&#160;attack, they are usually precipitated by three main factors &#8211; cytochrome p450 inducers, prolonged fasting, or acute infection (see image below).&#160;Porphyric&#160;attacks occur with varying symptomatology and usually include some combination of abdominal pain, back pain, neuropathic limb&#160;pain, and&#160;nausea and vomiting. Attacks can vary in severity, with more severe cases involving mental status changes, progressive renal dysfunction, and even death.&#160;The vast majority of&#160;patients are diagnosed with genetic testing for&#160;<em>HMBS </em>gene mutations. &#160;&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Depletion of delta-aminolevulinic&#160;acid&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect</span><span>: </span></strong><span>Delta-</span><span>aminolevulinic</span><span>&#160;acid (ALA) is an important intermediary in the heme biosynthesis pathway.

      "solution": "This patient with a history of asthma presents with a cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and use of accessory muscles after running out of his albuterol inhaler. He has evidence of severe <strong>asthma exacerbation</strong> and <strong>concomitant respiratory acidosis</strong>, as evidenced by arterial blood gas results. For patients with severe asthma exacerbations, acute management involves administration of <strong>bronchodilator treatment</strong> with <strong>inhalation of short-acting beta-2-selective adrenergic agonists</strong> like <strong>albuterol&#160;</strong>and application of <strong>non-invasive ventilation</strong> (e.g., <strong>bilevel positive airway pressure</strong>) and intravenous corticosteroids. If this patient continues to have progressive hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis despite intensive therapy, this can indicate worsening obstruction or respiratory muscle fatigue necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. <br><br><strong>Respiratory acidosis</strong> refers to an increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide or pCO2, with or without a compensatory increase in bicarbonate resulting in increased hydrogen ion concentration in the blood. This condition is almost always caused by <strong>hypoventilation</strong>, usually from the central nervous system, obstructive or parenchymal pulmonary, or iatrogenic conditions. Respiratory acidosis is characterized by an <strong>arterial pH below 7.35 and a pCO2 above 45 millimeters of mercury</strong>. <br><br>Many conditions can cause respiratory acidosis, including central nervous system (CNS), neuromuscular, obstructive, and parenchymal pulmonary etiologies; however, the approach remains the same in terms of acute management. For all patients with respiratory acidosis, acute management involves stabilizing the <strong>airway, breathing, and circulation</strong>, obtaining IV access, and placing the patient on continuous vital sign monitoring, and providing supplemental oxygen as needed. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Once the etiology of the acidosis is&#160;determined,&#160;<strong>targeted management should&#160;</strong><strong>proceed</strong>. For example, asthmatic patients should&#160;receive&#160;inhaled&#160;bronchodilator therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and steroids. If a foreign body ingestion/food aspiration is suspected, patients should undergo&#160;the&#160;Heimlich&#160;maneuver, or have the foreign body removed under direct visualization. If&#160;acidosis is&#160;related to&#160;recreational substance&#160;overdose, patients&#160;should receive the&#160;appropriate corrective&#160;reversal agent&#160;(e.g.,&#160;naloxone for opiate overdose, or flumazenil for benzodiazepine overdose).&#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Inhaled&#160;albuterol and bi-level positive airway pressure:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Rapid sequence intubation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: Rapid sequence intubation should be performed as a last resort for patients with respiratory acidosis&#160;</span><span>from&#160;</span><span>severe</span><span>&#160;as</span><span>thma exacerbation.&#160;</span><span>If this patient continues to have progressive hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis despite intensive&#160;</span><span>therapy, this</span><span>&#160;ca</span><span>n&#160;</span><span>ind</span><span>icate</span><span>&#160;wo</span><span>rsening obstruction or&#160;</span><span>respiratory</span><span>&#160;muscle&#160;</span><span>fatigue,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>and intubation</span><span>&#160;and mechanical ventilation should be considered.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Heimlich maneuver&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: This patient can&#160;</span><span>speak&#160;</span><span>clearly</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;in&#160;</span><span>5&#8211;7-word</span><span>&#160;sentences</span><span>,</span><span>&#160;</span><span>making</span><span>&#160;foreign body aspiration</span><span>&#160;</span><span>as the cause of respiratory distress&#160;</span><span>unlikely</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>This patient has evidence of&#160;</span><span>a severe</span><span>&#160;asthma exacerbation that should be treated with&#160;</span><span>inhaled&#160;</span><span>Albuterol and bi-level positive airway pressure.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Naloxone&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: This patient has no evidence of opiate&#160;</span><span>intoxication or overdose</span><span>&#160;despite his history of opiate use disorder.&#160;</span><span>The patient has equal and reactive pupils on examination</span><span>&#160;and is&#160;</span><span>awake, alert,</span><span>&#160;and oriented</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;Patients with respiratory distress from</span><span>&#160;opi</span><span>ate intoxication</span><span>/overdose typically are somnolent with</span><span>&#160;</span><span>constricted pupils bilaterally.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Terbutaline:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>: Terbutaline</span><span>&#160;is&#160;</span><span>a beta</span><span>-</span><span>agonist</span><span>&#160;that</span><span>&#160;can be used as a refractory measure&#160;</span><span>to</span><span>&#160;treat patients with severe asthma exacerbation</span><span>s</span><span>.&#160;</span><span>Intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous beta-agonists like</span><span>&#160;epinephrine and terbutaline</span><span>&#160;</span><span>are&#160;</span><span>typically&#160;</span><span>avoided&#160;</span><span>in asthma&#160;</span><span>exacerbations</span><span>&#160;because inhaled short-acting selective beta agonists like albuterol have equal or greater efficacy</span><span>&#160;</span><span>with</span><span>&#160;limited side effects.</span>&#160;</span></div>",

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be further classified using <strong>immunophenotyping</strong>, with B-cell markers, such as CD19 and CD20, or T-cell markers, such as CD3. <br><br>Once the type of lymphoma is identified, additional studies may include imaging (computed tomography (CT) or PET scans) and bone marrow biopsy to stage the disease and guide treatment decisions.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Chemotherapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient has Reed Sternberg cells on biopsy, indicating Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

It is classified into prerenal, renal (intrinsic), and postrenal AKI, based on the site of the underlying cause. <strong>Postrenal AKI</strong> is further classified into <strong>upper or lower</strong> urinary tract obstruction, based on the level of the blockage.<br><br>The acute management of postrenal AKI begins with an ABCDE assessment (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) to determine patient stability. Patients who are <strong>unstable&#160;</strong>may report pelvic discomfort, poor urine stream, and urinary retention, and may have signs of volume overload (e.g., wheezing, rales, peripheral edema). Treatment parallels that for stable patients (e.g., Foley catheter placement for urinary retention), but with heightened attention to airway and breathing and prompt correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Depending on severity, <strong>noninvasive ventilation strategies</strong>, such as bilevel positive airway pressure, or emergent <strong>hemodialysis&#160;</strong>may be necessary when <strong>volume overload, hyperkalemia, severe metabolic acidosis, or symptomatic uremia</strong> are present.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Emergent hemodialysis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation</span><span>.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Bilevel positive airway pressure:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although there is evidence of volume overload, the patient is not in significant respiratory distress that requires noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.

The elevated urine output, high plasma osmolality, and inappropriately low urine osmolality are consistent with diabetes insipidus (DI). A <strong>positive desmopressin challenge test&#160;</strong>is diagnostic of<strong>&#160;central DI</strong>. <br><br>Hypernatremia is an electrolyte imbalance that occurs when serum sodium concentration exceeds 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Once hypernatremia is confirmed on a chemistry panel, further workup depends on the likely underlying cause. This can be narrowed by determining whether the patient is hypervolemic, euvolemic, or hypovolemic. Patients with <strong>hypovolemic hyponatremia</strong> may report volume losses, recent diuretic use, or inadequate fluid intake. These patients should have <strong>urine output&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;urine osmolality measured</strong>. <br><br>Patients with euvolemic hypernatremia may endorse polydipsia or polyuria and will appear hydrated on examination. <strong>Urine output and urine and plasma osmolality</strong> should be obtained. Differentiating central DI from nephrogenic GI can be achieved via a <strong>desmopressin challenge</strong>.<br><br>Patients with hypervolemic hypernatremia will demonstrate signs of volume overload, such as shortness of breath or peripheral edema. Measuring urine sodium and creatinine to calculate a <strong>fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa)</strong> can help differentiate excess salt load from primary aldosteronism. The table below summarizes key findings for important causes of hypernatremia.<br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/rypgzyWTQ8WWld3349Ufsp5YTUu-IC5P/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Central diabetes insipidus (DI):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Nephrogenic DI occurs when the kidneys fail to respond to vasopressin (ADH). Unlike central DI, patients with nephrogenic DI typically show little to no increase in urine osmolality in response to desmopressin.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Mannitol administration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, can increase urine output and lower urine osmolality. However, the urine osmolality would not increase with a desmopressin challenge.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Primary aldosteronism:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Primary aldosteronism is a cause of hypervolemic hypernatremia that presents with hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and volume overload. This patient is euvolemic on exam, and primary aldosteronism is associated with normal plasma osmolality. Additionally, urine osmolality would not increase with a desmopressin challenge.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Insensible losses:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Insensible losses (e.g., fever, excessive sweating) can contribute to hypovolemic hypernatremia. However, such losses typically present with low urine output and high urine osmolality. Additionally, this patient appears euvolemic on exam.</span></div>",
