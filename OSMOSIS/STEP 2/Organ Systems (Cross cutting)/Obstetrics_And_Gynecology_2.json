      "solution": "This patient presents with <strong>heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB)</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>and <strong>dysmenorrhea (DM)</strong> that is secondary to <strong>adenomyosis&#160;</strong>based on the findings described in the vignette. Adenomyosis is caused by the implantation of <strong>endometrial glands within myometrial tissue</strong>, resulting in significant pain and bleeding during regular menses. The uterus may be mildly <strong>tender&#160;</strong>even outside of menses, which can lead to <strong>chronic pelvic pain</strong> and/or <strong>dyspareunia&#160;</strong>in some patients. Risk factors for adenomyosis include a history of uterine surgery, shorter menstrual cycles (&#8804; 25 days), and early menarche. On exam, the uterus may be <strong>globally enlarged&#160;</strong>and is often described as <strong>globular&#160;</strong>or <strong>boggy&#160;</strong>(i.e., the uterus feels squishy). Because there are no large masses, the uterus retains a <strong>smooth contour</strong> on exam. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Pelvic ultrasound&#160;</strong>should be performed in patients who present with HMB. It can provide valuable information about the presence or absence of potential <strong>structural causes of HMB,</strong> including adenomyosis.

In PCOS, excessive androgens often result in <strong>hirsutism&#160;</strong>and <strong>acne</strong>, but androgen levels are typically <strong>not high enough</strong> to cause <strong>virilization </strong>(i.e. the development of male body characteristics, such as <strong>clitoromegaly </strong>or deepening of the voice).

Therefore, she has progressed <strong>past the point when systemic analgesia</strong>, such as <strong>opiates&#160;</strong>or <strong>epidural analgesia</strong>, can be safely administered. Cervical dilation of 10 cm is considered &#8220;fully dilated&#8221;; and with the baby in the described position, pushing will soon begin. Systemic opiates should be avoided at this stage due to risk of <strong>respiratory depression in the newborn</strong>, and there is not sufficient time for placement of regional anesthesia such as an epidural or intrathecal analgesic. <br><br>Pharmacological analgesia options in labor include systemic opiates, inhaled agents, regional anesthesia, local anesthesia, and general anesthesia. Systemic opiate medications can be a good option when there is limited additional support available, as they can be administered by the labor and delivery team without the need for an anesthesiologist. Medication options for this route include fentanyl, morphine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, or remifentanil. These various <strong>opioids&#160;</strong>are similar in effectiveness. An additional benefit of opioid analgesia is the low cost. Systemic opioids can also offer quick relief compared to an epidural, which takes time to place and take effect. However, the effectiveness of systemic opioids is limited, as they do not take away all labor pain completely and wear off after a couple of hours. &#160;<br><br>Systemic opioid analgesia is generally safe. The major maternal side effects are nausea and vomiting, but they can also cause <strong>respiratory depression</strong>. There are several instances where opioids should be avoided in labor.

The initial evaluation of GTN includes a <strong>comprehensive physical exam</strong>, including pelvic, chest, abdomen, and neurologic exams, a <strong>pelvic ultrasound</strong>, <strong>chest radiograph</strong> (CXR), and basic serum lab tests. <br><br>GTN is the <strong>malignant proliferation and spread of trophoblastic tissue</strong>. It is most common following a <strong>molar pregnancy</strong>, though it can develop after any type of pregnancy.

Therefore, hCG levels are followed <strong>every 1 to 2 weeks</strong> after uterine evacuation of a molar pregnancy. <strong>Rising or plateauing levels</strong> indicate persistent trophoblastic tissue and confirms GTN. <br><br>Once GTN is diagnosed, patients must be evaluated for signs of metastasis, which is common. GTN typically originates in the uterus and spreads first to the vagina and/or lungs, which is why the initial evaluation should include a pelvic exam, ultrasound, and CXR. <strong>Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis </strong>and/or<strong> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain</strong> are indicated if there are signs of metastasis on the initial evaluation (e.g., vaginal lesions, abnormal findings on CXR, neurologic exam, liver function tests).<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Comprehensive exam, pelvic ultrasound, and chest radiograph:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Comprehensive exam, pelvic ultrasound, imaging of brain, chest, and abdomen/pelvis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The patient&#8217;s plateauing hCG levels meet criteria for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).

This means that each twin has its <strong>own amniotic sac while sharing a single placenta</strong>. Vascular anastomoses exist within 95% of monochorionic (MC) placentas, which can result in <strong>uneven blood flow</strong>, with blood being shunted from one twin (the donor) to the other (the recipient). This complication is known as <strong>twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS)</strong>. <br><br>Serial <strong>ultrasounds every 2 weeks</strong> are recommended in MC gestations starting at 16 weeks estimated gestation age (EGA) to screen for TTTS. Findings suggestive of this condition include <strong>volume depletion</strong> (e.g., non-visualized bladder or oligohydramnios in the donor) or <strong>volume overload</strong> (e.g., polyhydramnios or hydrops fetalis in a recipient). If TTS is detected, treatment involves laser therapy. <br><br>Dichorionic (DC) gestations are diagnosed by the presence of a <strong>triangular wedge of hyperechoic uterine tissue at the base of a thicker intertwined membrane</strong>, known as the <strong>lambda sign</strong>. In DCDA pregnancies, each fetus has its own placenta and amniotic sac, making vascular anastomoses unlikely. For higher-order multiples, chorionicity must be determined for all fetuses by identifying an intertwined membrane, T-sign, or lambda-sign between them.<br>&#160; <node/><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/v5AfV_2eThuC89RGIPl8Q3TJSeS7FPwa/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Blood may be shunted from one twin to the other via the placenta:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ An increased likelihood of premature placental separation compared to other types of twin gestations:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Premature placental separation, known as placental abruption, is most commonly associated with abdominal trauma, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, structural uterine anomalies, and substance use.

The perineum courses through the pudendal canal and terminates into its branches in the ischioanal fossa.

She most likely has postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. PPH (Postpartum hemorrhage) is a postpartum complication and an obstetric emergency. PPH is classically defined as blood loss &gt;500 ml within 24 hours of birth. However, it is clinically assessed by blood loss that is significant enough to cause signs and symptoms of hypovolemia. &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>The most common causes of postpartum hemorrhage include an atonic uterus or trauma to the birth canal. Atonicity of the uterus relates to the failure of contraction and retraction of the uterine sinuses by the uterine musculature following delivery of the fetus and the placenta. Risk factors for an atonic uterus include multiparity, overdistention of the uterus as seen in multiple pregnancies, hydramnios and macrosomia, prolonged labor, anesthesia, and precipitate labor. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Initial management includes fluid replacement, uterine massage, and the cervix and vagina inspection to rule out traumatic PPH. Oxytocin and misoprostol are administered to promote uterine contraction. If the uterus remains atonic, surgical intervention may be warranted. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The blood<strong>&#160;supply of the uterus&#160;</strong>is primarily provided by the <strong>uterine arteries and the ovarian arteries</strong>. The uterine artery is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. It runs medially towards the cervix in the broad ligament, crosses the ureter at the lateral border of the cervix and the lateral fornix of the vagina, and ascends towards the hilus of the ovary to anastomose with the ovarian artery. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Surgical intervention in PPH can involve selective ligation/embolization of<strong>&#160;bilateral uterine arteries&#160;</strong>at the lateral border between the upper and lower uterine segment. If bleeding continues,<strong>&#160;ligation of the ovarian arteries</strong> is done at the infundibulopelvic ligaments. If this fails, ligation of the <strong>anterior division of the internal iliac artery</strong> may be done to reduce distal blood flow. Abdominal aortic compression is a temporizing measure to reduce blood flow to the uterus. If the uterus fails to contract and to bleed continues despite the above measures, the decision to perform a <strong>hysterectomy&#160;</strong>may be necessary. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Uterine artery in the broad ligament&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ovarian artery in the infundibulopelvic ligament&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The blood supply of the uterus includes the uterine arteries and ovarian arteries.

Torsion occurs when the ovary twists over its supporting ligaments,<strong>&#160;compromising blood flow</strong>. Patients commonly present with<strong>&#160;sudden onset severe pelvic pain,</strong> with or without nausea and vomiting. With chronic or delayed torsion, the ovary can become <strong>necrotic</strong>, leading to fever and peritonitis. Adnexal torsion is more common when the<strong>&#160;size of the ovary is increased above 5 cm.</strong> Therefore, <strong>cysts&#160;</strong>and <strong>neoplasms&#160;</strong>are frequent causes. The condition is most likely to occur in women of <strong>reproductive age</strong>, and <strong>pregnancy&#160;</strong>is an independent risk factor. &#160;Patients undergoing<strong>&#160;infertility treatments&#160;</strong>and those with <strong>polycystic ovarian syndrome</strong> are also at increased risk of ovarian torsion. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/i_l2vBMKTX2NqYWAK15j7fppRYG6-zd6/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Infertility treatment:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Nulliparity&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Pregnancy is a risk factor for ovarian torsion; nulliparity does not increase the risk. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sedentary lifestyle&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A sedentary lifestyle is not a risk factor for ovarian torsion.

      "solution": "The combination of <strong>pelvic pain and bloating</strong> in a 22-year-old woman, a <strong>solid ovarian mass</strong> with internal vascularity on ultrasound, and <strong>elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)</strong> levels, points strongly towards a diagnosis of <strong>dysgerminoma</strong>. The <strong>\"fried egg\" appearance</strong> is a hallmark feature of dysgerminomas. It refers to the tumor cells being <strong>large, with clear cytoplasm</strong> and central, rounded nuclei. The clear cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus resembles the white of a fried egg, while the nucleus itself resembles the yolk. Lymphocytic infiltration, also characteristic of dysgerminomas, further aids in confirming the diagnosis.<br><br><strong>Dysgerminoma&#160;</strong>is the most common <strong>malignant germ cell tumor</strong> of the ovary. It typically presents in adolescent and <strong>young women</strong> as a <strong>unilateral solid ovarian mass</strong> but may be bilateral in 10% to 20% of cases. It is occasionally associated with gonadal dysgenesis. While <strong>LDH is elevated</strong>, other tumor markers are not typically elevated. Therefore, the presence of normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), CA-125, inhibin A, inhibin B, estradiol, and testosterone, further supports a diagnosis of dysgerminoma in this patient. In addition, the patient lacks symptoms suggestive of hormonal imbalances, such as virilization and irregular bleeding, that are often seen with other types of tumors.<br><br>When a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an ovarian neoplasm, the main objective is to determine if it is benign and can be managed expectantly or malignant, requiring more immediate intervention. Ultrasound findings that are consistent with malignancy include a complex mass with septations, solid components, increased doppler flow, and the presence of ascites. Tumor markers may help make the diagnosis and distinguish among the various types of ovarian cancer, but are not definitive. In the end, a <strong>definitive diagnosis</strong> can only be made with <strong>pathologic examination</strong>.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/hEMfYQuBRDCGWt45jrVsfj76R5awSi_w/_.png\"></div><br><sup>Dysgerminoma characterized by uniform cells resembling primordial germ cells separated by fibrous septa with lymphocytes.

The most appropriate next step in the management of advanced ovarian cancer is to perform an <strong>exploratory laparotomy, surgical staging, </strong>and <strong>maximal cytoreductive surgery</strong>.<br><br>The first ovarian cancer surgical objective is to determine accurate <strong>FIGO staging</strong>.

The second objective is to perform <strong>maximal cytoreduction</strong> or <strong>debulking</strong>, removing as much cancer tissue as possible. Patients with minimal residual disease after surgery, preferably only microscopic, or at least with gross disease 2 cm or less in diameter, will have higher survival rates. To achieve these surgical goals, various procedures are performed, including <strong>peritoneal washings</strong>, careful examination of the abdomen and pelvis to identify all sites of cancer spread, <strong>biopsy of suspicious areas</strong> and adhesions, infracolic omentectomy, <strong>total abdominal hysterectomy</strong>, <strong>bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy</strong>, selective <strong>lymphadenectomy </strong>of pelvic and paraaortic nodes, and <strong>excision of all possible tumor masses</strong>.<br><br>Following surgery, this patient with advanced ovarian cancer should be treated with <strong>adjuvant </strong><strong>chemotherapy</strong>, likely a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin.

Due to this variability, accurately diagnosing them may require a combination of imaging techniques. <strong>Pelvic ultrasound</strong> should always be the <strong>first step</strong> in the diagnostic workup. It may not detect all tumors; therefore, if the pelvic ultrasound is unrevealing or inconclusive, additional visualization methods may include <strong>sonohysterogram or hysteroscopy</strong>. A <strong>sonohysterogram&#160;</strong>is performed by injecting a small amount of saline into the uterine cavity during a transvaginal ultrasound, opening the endometrial cavity to allow inspection of the contours of the endometrium. The procedure is especially useful in cases of <strong>pedunculated submucosal</strong> leiomyomas. A <strong>hysteroscopy&#160;</strong>(see graphic below) consists of inserting a camera into the endometrial cavity, along with saline to inspect the inner lining of the uterus. This method can be used to visually <strong>diagnose and treat submucosal leiomyomas</strong>. <strong>Magnetic resonance imaging</strong> is typically performed ahead of surgical planning in complex cases, or when there is continued diagnostic uncertainty. <strong>Laboratory testing</strong> can be performed to determine if there is <strong>pregnancy or anemia</strong>. <strong>Endometrial biopsy</strong> should be performed when there is concern for malignancy.<br>&#160; &#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/vFHlY__EQU_QkAo_w9fDZWR9So6SDRxM/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Pelvic ultrasound:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hysteroscopy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A hysteroscopy involves inserting a camera into the endometrial cavity and infusing saline to inspect the inner lining of the uterus.

The exact etiology is unknown, but it is thought to involve either a defect in urothelium protective components or mast cell activation. There may be associations with other pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome and pelvic floor myalgia. Interstitial cystitis pain is <strong>triggered by bladder filling</strong> and may be noted as pain in the lower abdomen, pelvis, and back. Pelvic examination may reveal anterior <strong>vaginal wall</strong> or <strong>u</strong><strong>rethral tenderness</strong>, as well as <strong>pelvic floor tenderness. &#160;</strong><br><br>Diagnosis is based on a thorough history, physical examination, and exclusion of other potential causes of the patient&#8217;s symptoms, such as recurrent urinary tract infection, urethral diverticulum, endometriosis, and neoplasia.

The pelvic ultrasound finding of a <strong>complex, heterogeneous intrauterine mass containing multiple small cysts</strong> supports this diagnosis. The cysts result from the swelling of chorionic villi. Phrases used to characterize a molar pregnancy are &#8220;bunch of grapes,&#8221; &#8220;snowstorm appearance,&#8221; or &#8220;honeycombed uterus.&#8221; &#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Molar pregnancy,&#160;</strong>also known as <strong>hydatidiform mole,</strong> results from the abnormal growth of hCG producing <strong>trophoblastic tissue</strong>. This leads to significantly<strong>&#160;elevated hCG&#160;</strong>levels (&gt;100,000 milli-international units/mL). Although definitive diagnosis requires histopathologic examination of evacuated uterine contents, ultrasound can be a useful diagnostic modality. Besides intrauterine findings consistent with a molar pregnancy, the presence of thin-walled <strong>multilocular cysts,</strong> suggestive of <strong>theca-lutein cysts</strong>, in the ovaries further supports the diagnosis. The most common type, which is complete mole, will have no fetal tissue present. A partial mole can contain fetal tissue, but it will typically be non-viable. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The most common symptom of a <strong>molar pregnancy</strong> is <strong>vaginal bleeding.</strong> It may be light spotting or heavy and is often painless. Other signs and symptoms include <strong>nausea&#160;</strong>and <strong>vomiting&#160;</strong>more severe than usual morning sickness, pre-eclampsia, and a<strong>&#160;uterus larger than dates</strong>. In addition, high levels of hCG can overstimulate the <strong>ovaries to produce theca-lutein cysts&#160;</strong>and the thyroid gland to overproduce thyroxine. <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/4h4Pae8TTzCWjScZDhvDBXlnR5yhQIHc/_.png\"></div><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/K_Q1PiPEQvec-rQmb6nTGwMYTL2r6POA/_.png\"></div><br><br><span>Transvaginal ultrasonography</span><span>&#160;showing a molar pregnancy</span>&#160; &#160; <br><br><span>Reproduced from:&#160;</span><span>Wikipedia</span><span>&#160;</span>&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Empty extrauterine sac with a hyperechoic ring:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong><span>Incorrect:</span><span>&#160;</span></strong><span>This ultrasound finding suggests a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy since the empty gestational sac is&#160;</span><span>located</span><span>&#160;outside of the uterus.

Bleeding from a vasa previa can result in rapid fetal exsanguination, so these patients should be monitored as <strong>inpatients&#160;</strong>starting around 30 to 34 weeks, receive corticosteroids for fetal maturation, and undergo<strong>&#160;C-sections between 34 and 37 weeks. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>Diagnosis and management of stable patients with placenta and vasa previa are detailed in the table below. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/5rugQv9zQgGgaJLBhif8qWAnTiyljVpI/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Placental edge 25 mm from the os and umbilical vessels 15 mm from the os:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct: </strong></span><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Placental edge 15 mm from the os and umbilical vessels 25 mm from the os:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>These findings are consistent with a low-lying placenta.

Because menstruation is a normal phenomenon, clinical judgment is&#160;required&#160;to&#160;determine&#160;if and how quickly uterine bleeding must be stopped.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br>For patients with&#160;<strong>unstable vital signs</strong>&#160;and active, heavy uterine bleeding, a&#160;<strong>dilation and curettage (D&C) </strong>is often&#160;appropriate. A&#160;<strong>uterine tamponade balloon</strong>&#160;can be placed as a temporizing agent pre-operatively, or in the operative room following a D&C to help with hemostasis.

In the setting of ruptured membranes, a <strong>pulsating purple mass</strong> within the cervix is an <strong>umbilical cord prolapse</strong>, which is an <strong>obstetric emergency</strong> and an <strong>absolute contraindication</strong> to vaginal delivery and IOL. In this situation, the fetus must be manually elevated off the cervix and the patient taken for emergency cesarean. <br><br>IOL refers to the use of <strong>mechanical processes</strong> (e.g., mechanical dilation, artificial rupture of membranes [AROM]), and <strong>pharmacologic agents</strong> (e.g., prostaglandins, oxytocin) to mimic labor. Although regarded as safe, IOL does increase the risk of <strong>obstetric complications</strong> compared to spontaneous labor. The risks include tachysystole, non-reassuring fetal monitoring, cesarean birth, placental abruption, uterine rupture, intrapartum intraamniotic infection, and umbilical cord prolapse. For these reasons, it is important to be familiar with appropriate indications and contraindications for IOL (detailed in the table below) to minimize the risks associated with the procedure.<br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ef_ko_cMRQee2UYODwGsF6FHTcGh7Nlz/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ A purple pulsating mass in the cervical canal:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Visible&#160;Oral HSV lesions&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Visible&#160;Genital HSV lesions or prodromal&#160;symptoms,&#160;would&#160;be a contraindication for IOL, but&#160;the presence of&#160;oral&#160;HSV&#160;lesions would not be a contraindication&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ First delivery was standard cesarean birth:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;A&#160;history of a&#160;full-thickness uterine incision that extends through the&#160;strong&#160;upper&#160;contractile fibers&#160;of the uterus&#160;is a contraindication to vaginal birth due to the increased risk of uterine rupture associated with labor&#160;contractions.&#160;However,&#160;the&#160;incision in a&#160;standard, low transverse cesarean birth (LTCB)&#160;is made in the lower uterine&#160;segment and&#160;is&#160;at&#160;lower risk of rupture&#160;than&#160;prior&#160;high-vertical incisions, and therefore, is&#160;not&#160;a contraindication to IOL.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Single deepest vertical pocket of 1.2 cm on ultrasound:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Oligohydramnios,&#160;defined as a single DVP of &lt;&#160;2 cm,&#160;at term is&#160;an indication, rather than a contraindication, for IOL.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Two Short variable decelerations on NST:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Non-reassuring fetal monitoring is a contraindication to IOL.

However, only <strong>Tetralogy of Fallot</strong> increases the risk of morbidity related to obstetrical anesthesia. An important part of this patient&#8217;s care includes a <strong>prenatal consultation with an anesthesiologist</strong> to create a pain management plan for labor and delivery. <br><br>All patients whose peripartum anesthesia care may be challenging, or who are known to be at risk for significant morbidity related to obstetrical anesthesia, should have an <strong>anesthesia consultation</strong> to aid in providing quality patient care surrounding birth. High-risk conditions for complications with obstetrical anesthesia include <strong>cardiac diseases</strong> such as cardiomyopathy, and congenital or acquired disorders like repaired Tetralogy of Fallot; <strong>hematological abnormalities</strong> such as immune or gestational thrombocytopenia; and patients who <strong>do not want blood transfusions</strong>, such as Jehovah&#8217;s witnesses. Other high-risk conditions include spinal, muscular, and neurological diseases such as prior spinal cord injuries; prior vertebral surgeries; arterial-venous malformations; aneurysms; and Chiari malformations. Other diseases that may increase the risk of obstetrical anesthetic complications are those that can cause abnormal coagulation including chronic renal insufficiency and liver diseases such as hepatitis or cirrhosis. <br><br>Additional risk factors for anesthesia complications include an anticipated difficult airway, obstructive sleep apnea, body mass index greater than 50 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, myasthenia gravis, dwarfism, and history of solid organ transplantation.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;</span><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Type 2 diabetes:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Pre-gestational diabetes such as type 2 diabetes, even if it is well controlled, is a high-risk complication in pregnancy.

Past medical history is significant for asthma. Vitals are within normal limits. Over a two-hour triage, the cervix changes from 2 cm to 4 cm dilation, and the patient is admitted to the hospital in labor. The birth plan outlines the patient's fervent desire to avoid pharmacological interventions that involve needles, due to an intense fear of needles. Her doula helps with relaxation techniques along with aromatherapy. Shortly after admission, the patient notes a large gush of fluid, and testing confirms the rupture of membranes. On recheck, the cervix remains at 4 cm. After rupture of membranes, the contractions significantly increase in intensity, and she requests pharmacological pain management.

Her birth plan outlines a desire only to use options that do not involve a needle for administration; therefore, <strong>nitrous oxide</strong> is the best choice for pharmacological pain management currently. Nitrous oxide is self-administered using a mouthpiece or facemask, making it a good option for patients who have a fear of needles. <br><br>There are many additional benefits of nitrous oxide use. Patients have control over the administered amount and timing, maternal movement is maintained, additional monitoring is not required, and the effect quickly wears off once the mask is removed. The main adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness. Of note, it can also be used during repair of vaginal lacerations after delivery. &#160; &#160; &#160;Pharmacological pain management options in labor include systemic opiate analgesia, nitrous oxide, regional anesthesia such as epidural or spinal/intrathecal analgesia, and local anesthesia such as a pudendal block. Unless a patient has a contraindication, it is important to discuss all options with the patient. <br><br>Non-pharmacological pain management options included massage, movement, immersion in water during the first stage of labor, acupuncture, relaxation, aromatherapy, and hypnotherapy. Some patients choose to hire a birth doula, or professional labor coach, to provide one-on-one support during labor. This can be helpful, especially in patients who want to avoid pharmacological interventions. <br><br>A patient&#8217;s desires may change throughout labor. The provider should consider requests for pharmacological pain medication during labor, even if the patient&#8217;s initial plan were to avoid them. Maternal request for pain medication is a sufficient indication for pain medications regardless of initial intent. <br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Zhbz0sDbSaSFp7BwFT7npFJUTI_w4gR_/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Nitrous oxide:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;</span><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Intrathecal injection:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: An intrathecal injection is a single injection into the intrathecal space that provides rapid onset of a dense sensory block; however, the effects last only a few hours and are therefore better suited for C-section deliveries.

In general, <strong>low-risk features</strong> include a younger age at presentation, a shorter time interval between the causative pregnancy and diagnosis of GTN, smaller primary tumor size, lower pre-treatment hCG levels, and no or few metastases. <br><br>The most common forms of GTN, including <strong>invasive moles</strong> and <strong>choriocarcinoma</strong>, are highly sensitive to chemotherapy. For this reason, low-risk disease is usually treated with single-agent chemotherapy. An overview of the appropriate management for low- and high-risk disease is presented in the table above.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Single-agent chemotherapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Multi-agent chemotherapy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient has low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

This patient likely has an invasive mole or choriocarcinoma, which are much more common.</span></div>",

History is notable for two prior uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal deliveries at term, with neonates weighing 3800 g and 3900 g, respectively. The patient takes prenatal vitamins and a daily aspirin. Temperature is 36.7&#176;C (98.1&#176;F), pulse is 78/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 118/76 mmHg. The abdomen is non-tender, and the symphysis-fundal height is 33 cm. Ultrasound shows that Baby A (the presenting twin) is in a breech presentation with a fetal heart rate (FHR) of 140/min and an estimated fetal weight (EFW) at the 23<sup>rd</sup> percentile for EGA; Baby B is in a vertex presentation with a FHR of 150/min and an EFW at the 20<sup>th</sup> percentile for EGA (14% discordance). A triangular wedge of hyperechoic material is present at the base of a thick intertwined membrane. What is the most appropriate delivery plan to discuss with this patient based on today&#8217;s findings?",

A twin gestation and a <strong>lambda (&#955;) sign</strong> on ultrasound indicate a <strong>dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA)</strong> pregnancy, meaning that each fetus has its own amniotic sac and placenta. In these cases, delivery should occur <strong>between 38 and 38 6/7 weeks EGA</strong>. Twin gestations with separate amniotic cavities (i.e., DCDA and monochorionic diamniotic [MCDA] gestations) can be delivered vaginally in two situations:<br><br><ol><li>Both fetuses present in a <strong>cephalic&#160;</strong>presentation, OR</li><li>The <strong>presenting fetus</strong>&#160;<strong>is cephalic</strong>, and the second twin is both non-cephalic and <strong>no more than 20% larger</strong> than the presenting fetus (i.e., &lt; 20% discordance).&#160;</li></ol><br>This recommendation is based on the <strong>minimal risk of fetal head entrapment</strong> during breech extraction of the second fetus, as the cervix and maternal pelvis have already accommodated the first twin. A cesarean delivery (c-section) is recommended when the presenting fetus is in a breech presentation, as seen in the vignette, and when the second twin is non-cephalic and significantly larger than the first. <br><br>Also, even patients with multifetal gestations who are candidates for a labor trial should be offered an elective c-section and counseled on the risks and benefits of both approaches. <strong>Monoamniotic&#160;</strong>gestations should be delivered via <strong>c-section</strong> due to the elevated risk of <strong>cord entanglement</strong> during delivery. Higher-order multiples should also be delivered by c-section given the complexity of these cases. <br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/b8QKZexyQoSDcFtX0HaOv5VvQf_bGAsr/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ C-section is indicated at 32 to 34 weeks EGA:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This management plan is appropriate for patients with monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) pregnancies.

A medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy and a prior stroke increases the likelihood of detrusor muscle underactivity, which can impair bladder emptying.
