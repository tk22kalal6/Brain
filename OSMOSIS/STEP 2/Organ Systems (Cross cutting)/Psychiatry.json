The patient was at home eating dinner with his family when he suddenly experienced an acute onset occipital headache with associated diaphoresis and palpitations. The patient experienced a similar episode one month ago while drinking wine, which subsequently self-resolved. Past medical history is notable for anxiety, depression, and Parkinson disease. His medications include venlafaxine, levodopa, alprazolam, and selegiline. Temperature is 37.7&#176;C (99.9&#176;F), pulse is 121/min, respirations are 22/min, blood pressure is 201/102 mmHg, and O2 saturation is 96% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears diaphoretic but is otherwise neurologically intact. A CT-brain is negative for an acute intracranial process, and electrocardiogram demonstrates sinus tachycardia.

The underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood, but is thought to be due to a combination of genetic predisposition and dopaminergic receptor blockade secondary to antipsychotic agent use. Clinical manifestations typically appear 1-3 days after initiation of an antipsychotic agent. Symptoms begin with <strong>altered mental status&#160;</strong>and progress to <strong>autonomic instability</strong>,<strong>&#160;diaphoresis</strong>, <strong>encephalopathy</strong>, and <strong>hyperthermia</strong> (temperatures typically exceed 104&#176;F or 40.5&#176;C).

An anticholinergic medication, such as <strong>benztropine</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>or diphenhydramine, is the most appropriate treatment for the acute management of dystonia. <br><br><strong>Dystonic reactions (i.e., dyskinesias)</strong> are <strong>reversible extrapyramidal symptoms</strong> that develop shortly after starting medications that block dopamine receptors. Dopamine blockade can cause <strong>involuntary muscle contractions</strong>, leading to <strong>abnormal muscle stiffness</strong> and <strong>difficulty relaxing the affected muscles</strong>. Dystonic reactions range in severity and can include torticollis, oculogyric crisis, and opisthotonos. These reactions are more common with the use of first-generation antipsychotics. However, even second-generation antipsychotics like <strong>aripiprazole</strong>, which are <strong>partial agonists of dopamine receptors</strong>, increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. &#160;<br><br>Patients with dystonia should be given an <strong>anticholinergic medication</strong>, like benztropine or diphenhydramine, for symptom management. Patients with mild dystonia may respond well to oral anticholinergic medication, while more severe cases, such as in patients experiencing oculogyric crisis, may require intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration. The most effective way to reduce the risk of future dystonic reactions is to switch to an alternative medication with a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Benztropine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Propranolol:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:&#160;</span><span>Propranolol</span><span>&#160;is effective&#160;</span><span>for</span><span>&#160;</span><span>movement disorders such as&#160;</span><span>akathisia</span><span>&#160;</span><span>or tremor</span><span>.

The mainstay of treatment is <strong>supportive care</strong>, focusing on <strong>airway, breathing, and circulation</strong>. Most cases of isolated benzodiazepine intoxication or overdose improve with time as the drug is metabolized, and no specific antidote is required. <br><br><strong>Flumazenil</strong>, a competitive antagonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, may reverse sedation but is generally <strong>avoided in patients with seizure risk</strong>, including those with <strong>epilepsy </strong>or<strong> chronic benzodiazepine use</strong>. Its use may precipitate withdrawal seizures and render benzodiazepines ineffective if seizures occur. <br><br>Gastrointestinal decontamination measures such as activated charcoal are not routinely recommended due to limited benefit and risk of aspiration in sedated patients. Gastric lavage is also no longer routinely used given the elevated risk of complications and lack of clear benefits. <br><br>Given the overlapping clinical features of opioid and benzodiazepine toxicity, <strong>naloxone </strong>is often administered when the diagnosis is unclear. In this case, lack of response to naloxone supports benzodiazepine overdose. Finally, when managing an acute overdose, empiric interventions should not be delayed by diagnostic testing when clinical suspicion is high. <strong>Early supportive measures</strong>, such as respiratory support <strong>(e.g., supplemental oxygen, intubation) </strong>and <strong>intravenous fluids</strong> remain the cornerstone of care. <br><br>P.S.

Other diagnoses that can be in the differential include Acute intoxication from stimulants like cocaine and MDMA which can cause similar symptoms. As seen in NMS. However, these agents do not cause the <strong>severe rigidity</strong> that is pathognomonic for NMS. <strong>Akathisia</strong> is a movement disorder that can also be caused by antipsychotic medications; however, patients typically have uncomfortable restlessness and do not typically present with altered mental status. <strong>Tardive dyskinesia</strong> is another movement disorder caused by excessive dopamine antagonism; however, it does not cause autonomic instability, severe rigidity, or acute symptoms requiring treatment in the emergency department. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hyperreflexia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;This patient taking pimozide and presenting with&#160;muscle rigidity, altered mental status and urinary incontinence&#160;most&#160;likely&#160;has&#160;NMS.

The vignette states that the patient underwent an amputation following a motor vehicle accident, and his current symptoms are rooted in that traumatic experience. <br><br>The timing of symptom onset is essential when considering a diagnosis of PTSD. If a patient has a history of psychiatric symptoms before experiencing a traumatic event, the trauma may have exacerbated an existing condition. However, a trauma-related disorder is more likely if a patient with no prior psychiatric history develops symptoms following the trauma. It is important to recognize that patients can, and often do, meet criteria for both a trauma-related disorder and another psychiatric disorder. <br><br>Another factor to consider when diagnosing PTSD is the overlap of trauma-related symptoms with those of other psychiatric conditions. Patients with trauma-related disorders <strong>experience symptoms specifically tied to the traumatic event</strong>. In contrast, conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder lack a single, identifiable focal point and involve more generalized symptom patterns. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Obsessive-compulsive disorder:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although both post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder can involve repetitive, distressing thoughts, this patient&#8217;s intrusive thoughts are tied to his traumatic experience.

Given this patient&#8217;s Y-BOCS score is 24, they appear to have <strong>severe OCD</strong>. For severe OCD, <strong>combining cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with medication</strong> is the preferred first-line treatment. <br><br><strong>Exposure and response prevention (ERP)</strong> is a specific type of <strong>CBT</strong> that uses graded exposure to feared stimuli. For example, ERP might involve encouraging this patient to engage in their compulsions only twice instead of three times, with the goal of gradually reducing the behavior further. <br><br>Validated rating scales, such as the <strong>Y-BOCS</strong>, help quantify <strong>the level of impairment</strong> and guide recommended therapy options&#8212;including CBT, clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A Y-BOCS score of <strong>8-15 indicates mild</strong> OCD, <strong>16-23 indicates moderate</strong> OCD, and a score of <strong>24 or higher suggests severe</strong> OCD. Patients with mild OCD may be effectively managed with either medications or CBT alone, while moderate OCD may benefit from medications alone or in combination with CBT. In contrast, severe OCD generally requires a combined approach of CBT and medication. The Y-BOCS is also valuable for <strong>tracking treatment response</strong>.

The patient is currently taking fluvoxamine but has not experienced significant improvement in symptoms or changes in their Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive score (Y-BOCS). A previous trial with fluoxetine provided minimal benefit. In addition to pharmacotherapy, the patient participates in exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP), which has provided only mild benefit. There is no significant medical history or other psychiatric history. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 84/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. The mental status exam reveals an anxious-appearing adult with meticulous grooming and hygiene. Laboratory studies, including a complete blood count and complete metabolic panel, are within normal limits, and a urinary drug screen is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in patient care?",

First-line treatment for severe OCD typically includes a <strong>combination of psychotherapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</strong>. However, for patients who do not respond to at least two therapeutic trials of SSRIs, <strong>switching to clomipramine</strong> is a reasonable next step. <br><br>Although SSRIs are generally preferred due to their favorable side effect profiles, clomipramine has comparable efficacy in treating OCD. As a tricyclic antidepressant, clomipramine has a different pharmacokinetic profile and may benefit some patients who have not responded to SSRIs. However, before starting clomipramine, patients should be screened for a history of heart disease, including congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, due to the risk of QTc prolongation. Additionally, patients should be counseled on potential anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary hesitancy, sedation, and weight gain.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cross taper to clomipramine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Genetic testing:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Genetic testing can be helpful in assessing for possible mutations related to drug metabolism.

Given the inadequate response to fluvoxamine (an SSRI), switching to a different first-line medication like clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) is likely to be more effective than augmenting with buspirone.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Augment with aripiprazole:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Aripiprazole is a second-generation antipsychotic medication that may be used as an augmentation agent with a selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors <strong>(SSRIs)</strong> and selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors <strong>(SNRIs)</strong> can be considered as adjunctive treatments in addition to CBT for social anxiety disorder.

Clonidine, along with <strong>guanabenz&#160;</strong>and <strong>guanfacine</strong>, is an &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist. These medications stimulate &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), especially those in the medulla. This decreases norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, which leads to lower blood pressure. As a result, these medications can be used to treat <strong>hypertension</strong>.<br><br>Likewise, &#945;<sub>2</sub>-receptor agonists (clonidine in particular) act on &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors present in the prefrontal cortex, where they exert the same inhibitory effect on norepinephrine release. Moderating the amount of norepinephrine in this part of the brain helps &#8220;tune out&#8221; irrelevant stimuli and sharpens focus. As a result, clonidine is helpful in the treatment of <strong>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</strong> (ADHD) and tics in <strong>Tourette syndrome</strong>.<br><br>Another &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist is <strong>alpha-methyldopa</strong>, which is converted to methyl norepinephrine centrally to decrease the adrenergic outflow by &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist action from the central nervous system, leading to reduced total peripheral resistance and decreased systemic blood pressure.

In such cases, the current antidepressant is tapered and stopped, and the new drug is started immediately or after a washout period.<br>&#160; &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/4iCaJl2uTmW3B66wT5ZafHFoSN_roHFZ/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Discontinue fluoxetine and switch to duloxetine at the same dose&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;In most cases switching directly from an SSRI to an SNRI at an equivalent, the dose is favorable as SNRIs carry strong serotonergic properties.

When considering a diagnosis of OCD, it is important to gather information about <strong>functional impairment</strong>; for example, this patient arrives late for school and work due to these symptoms. A key detail that helps distinguish OCD from other anxiety disorders is the presence of <strong>repetitive behaviors that lead to a reduction in anxiety</strong>, as seen when this patient experiences less anxiety after repeatedly washing their hands. A helpful clinical pearl for patients with contamination-subtype OCD is to look for a bilateral erythematous hand rash caused by the abrasion from frequent handwashing, as described in this vignette.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder shares some features with OCD.
