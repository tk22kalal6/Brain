This is because potassium-sparing diuretics increase sodium and water loss via urine, which helps decrease plasma volume, cardiac output, and extracellular fluid volume. In addition, potassium-sparing diuretics that act as aldosterone receptor antagonists (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone) are useful in treating conditions associated with <strong>hyperaldosteronism&#160;</strong>(e.g., adrenal adenoma, adrenal hyperplasia).<br><br>Finally, spironolactone and amiloride can bind to androgen receptors and prevent testosterone from binding.

      "solution": "This patient&#8217;s <strong>headache and dizziness</strong> are most likely due to the development of <strong>nitrate tolerance</strong>, a significant problem in patients on chronic nitrate therapy. &#160;<br><br><strong>Isosorbide dinitrate</strong> is a nitrate used in the long-term prevention of <strong>angina pectoris.</strong> It acts by causing venous smooth muscle relaxation (via cGMP), leading to a decrease in cardiac preload, which, in turn, causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. Continuous nitrate administration results in the development of tolerance (tachyphylaxis). Therefore, <strong>intermittent therapy</strong> with<strong>&#160;nitrate-free intervals (8-10 hours,&#160;</strong>usually timed <strong>during bed-time&#160;</strong>when cardiac work is minimum) must be provided to allow adequate time for the regeneration of reduced sulfhydryl groups (which helps restore vascular sensitivity to nitrates). &#160;<br><br>The mechanism of nitrate tolerance is not well understood. Still, it is thought to result from <strong>decreased&#160;</strong><strong>vascular sensitivity to nitrates</strong> and <strong>increased activity of the vasoconstrictor renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)&#160;</strong>in patients on chronic nitrate therapy. A similar effect is observed in industrial workers exposed to nitroglycerin (from explosives production) during the workweek, i.e. they develop tolerance to the vasodilation of nitrates after the initial period of headache and dizziness. The loss of tolerance over the weekend results in the recurrence of headache and dizziness upon re-exposure.

As a result, the uncharged form of the drug can cross the blood-brain barrier, accumulate in the brain, and result in <strong>altered mental status</strong> and <strong>cerebral edema.</strong> Moreover, the uncharged form of salicylate can be reabsorbed from the renal collecting system, thereby preventing drug elimination and perpetuating its harmful effects in the setting of an overdose. &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Treatment of overdose with weak acids is often achieved via <strong>alkalinization&#160;</strong>through<strong>&#160;sodium bicarbonate administration</strong>. By increasing systemic pH, salicylate converts to its charged (deprotonated form) and thus cannot rapidly diffuse into the central nervous system, as charged molecules do not easily diffuse across the blood-brain barrier. Alkalinization also results in the trapping of salicylate anions within the renal tubule, preventing back-diffusion across the renal epithelium into c circulation. &#160; &#160;<br><br>P.S.

PBC is more prevalent in women, with a female-to-male ratio of 9:1. While it is often asymptomatic, patients can present with fatigue and pruritus. <strong>Fatigue&#160;</strong>is one of the <strong>most common early symptoms</strong> of the disease. As the disease progresses, patients may experience <strong>pruritus</strong>, which is due to the accumulation of bile salts in the skin. Studies have recently shown that the fatigue seems to stem from muscle mitochondrial dysfunction, due to the autoimmune destruction of mitochondria that characterizes the condition.<br><br>Physical examination findings in the early stages of PBC may be unremarkable, but as the disease progresses, signs of chronic liver disease, such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) and hepatomegaly may be seen. In later stages, patients can have signs of liver cirrhosis like ascites and spider angiomata (small, spider-like blood vessels on the skin).<br><br>Typically, <strong>alkaline phosphatase</strong> levels are elevated in PBC. If they exceed 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, a positive <strong>antimitochondrial antibody (AMA)</strong> test result can establish the diagnosis without the need for a liver biopsy. The primary treatment for PBC is ursodeoxycholic acid, which is associated with histologic improvement, increased survival rates, and reduced reliance on liver transplantation. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ySEWaGqPRvmPGyCyNTJp58g6SLuk7iIx/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Fatigue:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cold intolerance:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Cold intolerance is typically associated with hypothyroidism.

Syncope in individuals with HCM can occur due to several mechanisms.<br><br>1. <strong>Obstruction of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT)</strong>. Thickening of the heart muscle around the left ventricle can obstruct the outflow of blood from the left ventricle, especially during exercise or exertion, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure and syncope.<br><br>2. <strong>Arrhythmias&#160;</strong>associated with HCM, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia can lead to a rapid decrease in cardiac output and cause syncope.<br><br>3. <strong>Ischemia</strong>: The thickened heart muscle in HCM may require more oxygen, and narrowed coronary arteries, which are often found in HCM patients, can limit oxygen supply to the heart muscle. During increased physical activity, the heart muscles may become ischemic, leading to symptoms like chest pain and syncope.<br><br>The physical examination can be normal in HCM, as it is in this patient, or it may reveal a nonspecific <strong>fourth heart sound</strong>, a <strong>systolic murmur</strong>, or an LV lift. Patients with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction might have a sharp, crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur. This murmur usually starts just after the first heart sound (S1) and is most audible at the apex and lower left sternal edge. Various physical examination techniques can alter the level of obstruction, leading to a variation in the loudness of the murmur. Diagnosis is made with <strong>echocardiography</strong>, which typically demonstrates asymmetric LV hypertrophy primarily affecting the <strong>interventricular septum</strong>, dynamic LVOT obstruction, LV diastolic dysfunction, and left atrial dilation. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ambulatory ECG monitoring:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Ambulatory ECG monitoring is helpful for diagnosing intermittent arrhythmias and could detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia which can lead to syncope.

In cases of ITP with critical bleeding, a <strong>combination of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoids</strong> is administered along with platelet transfusions. &#160; <br><br>Treatment objectives for ITP involve sustaining a safe platelet count to prevent significant bleeding. In instances of mild to moderate <strong>asymptomatic thrombocytopenia</strong> (&gt; 30,000 cells/&#956;L), the majority of patients have a stable and benign course, and <strong>observation&#160;</strong>without other treatment can be provided. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients with or without minor bleeding and low platelet counts that put them at risk for bleeding are typically treated with glucocorticoids or IVIG if they cannot take glucocorticoids or if there is no improvement in platelet counts with glucocorticoids. &#160; <br><br>For patients with<strong>&#160;severe thrombocytopenia</strong> (&lt; 30,000 cells/&#956;L), there is a risk of future bleeding, requiring initial treatment with <strong>high-dose oral corticosteroids</strong> (1 mg/kg), even if patients have no symptoms. Combination treatment with glucocorticoids and IVIG is typically used. &#160; <br><br>In cases of <strong>critical bleeding where there is bleeding into a critical anatomical site or there is hemodynamic instability&#160;</strong>or respiratory compromise, a <strong>combination of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoids</strong> is administered. This approach is based on the rationale that each treatment modality operates through distinct mechanisms, and their combination may have an augmentative effect, although specific studies directly addressing this combination have not been reported. Glucocorticoids suppress the production of anti-platelet antibodies; IVIG binds to and inactivates antibodies that are already present in the circulation. In addition, patients with critical bleeding typically have platelet counts below 20,000 microL; therefore, <strong>platelet transfusions</strong> are also given. &#160; <br><br>If the initial medications prove ineffective at increasing the platelet count, <strong>second-line&#160;</strong>treatment options include<strong>&#160;thrombopoietin-receptor agonists</strong> such as <strong>romiplostim&#160;</strong>and <strong>immunomodulators&#160;</strong>like <strong>rituximab</strong>.

Cathartics such as sorbitol, magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, sodium phosphate, or sodium sulfate cause an osmotic imbalance which draws water into the large bowel lumen. Cathartics are often used as bowel prep agents for colonoscopy or surgical prep. Others, like polyethylene glycol (not to be confused with ethylene glycol, in antifreeze), can be used for daily maintenance or to help facilitate the disimpaction of bowel contents in severely constipated patients. Overuse of some cathartics can cause severe dehydration and acute kidney injury (as some magnesium is reabsorbed). In the case of this frail 75-year-old patient on hospice care, a cathartic would be inappropriate due to the increased risk of dehydration. In addition, a stimulating agent would be more appropriate since his stools are not hard or difficult to pass. <br><br>Senna is a stimulant laxative which is often prescribed with docusate, an emollient laxative. Stimulant laxatives act by directly stimulating the intestinal mucosa and producing peristalsis. Emollient laxatives act as a surfactant by decreasing the surface tension of water, allowing water to soften stool. Senna/docusate is typically prescribed as a combination when initiating opioid therapy in order to prevent opioid-induced constipation.

Following treatment, she develops palpitations and ECG changes that include ST segment depression and T wave inversions (U-waves) indicative of <strong>amphotericin-induced hypokalemia. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>Amphotericin B can induce nephrotoxicity via tubular injury and vasoconstriction, which ultimately results in hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and the RTA (normal anion gap acidosis). In fungal cells, amphotericin B binds to ergosterol, a component of the fungal cell membrane, and creates micropores. Similarly, it binds to cholesterol in host cell membranes (with lesser affinity) and increases membrane permeability. As a result, membrane electrochemical gradients are reduced, particularly between the renal tubular cells and the lumen. Potassium subsequently moves down this concentration gradient, resulting in a loss of potassium and limitated hydrogen ion secretion. Renal magnesium loss can also occur secondary to amphotericin nephrotoxicity. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Acute kidney injury is typically the first sign of amphotericin B induced nephrotoxicity. Normally, as the sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule increases, more NaCl diffuses into the macula densa. Tubuloglomerular feedback is initiated and afferent arteriole vasoconstriction occurs to limit NaCl losses. With amphotericin B use, permeability of macula densa cells increases and results in profound afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, a fall in GFR, and a subsequent rise in creatinine. &#160;<br><br>In order to limit amphotericin B associated nephrotoxicity, <strong>lipid formulations (liposomal and lipid complex) are used. Salt loading or volume expansion</strong> has also been found to be effective in limiting the fall in GFR as it reduces the sensitivity of the tubuloglomerular feedback system. Preventive measures to reduce nephrotoxicity include <strong>administering lower doses</strong> and <strong>avoiding co-administration of other nephrotoxic agents </strong>such as aminoglycosides or cyclosporine. Other adverse effects include fever, chills, and body aches. Intrathecal injections for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis can cause seizures, headache, and nerve palsies.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Hypokalemia &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Wide anion gap metabolic acidosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A wide anion gap metabolic acidosis is frequently associated with ethylene glycol or salicylate use, diabetic ketoacidosis, and methanol poisoning.

Assessing the 10-year <strong>atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)</strong> risk in susceptible patients is helpful and can help guide lipid-lowering therapy. According to the guidelines, this patient should be started on a <strong>statin&#160;</strong>since it decreases the risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients <strong>aged 40-75 and with diabetes</strong>.<br><br><strong>Statins&#160;</strong>(e.g., pravastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) are a class of medications that act by <strong>competitively inhibiting</strong> the enzyme <strong>HMG-CoA reductase</strong>, which helps convert HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a cholesterol precursor. Of note, this step is the rate-limiting reaction in cholesterol synthesis.<br><br>Statins lead to a <strong>decrease in hepatic cholesterol synthesis&#160;</strong>and <strong>increase in LDL recycling</strong> via upregulation of LDL receptors on hepatic cells. The LDL receptors not only increase the uptake of LDL-cholesterol but also increase the uptake of VLDLs (the major carrier of TG) to a smaller extent, resulting in a <strong>moderate decrease in TG levels</strong>. Furthermore, the liver increases its production of HDLs, which carry cholesterol back from the peripheral tissues to the liver.<br><br>The net effects include a <strong>significant reduction in LDL levels</strong>, a modest decrease in TG levels, and a modest increase in HDL levels.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/zTv4aPTGSCO17s4MWMsTGWHgRq23lzMd/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inhibition of cholesterol absorption at the intestinal brush border:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption at the intestinal brush border, thereby reducing liver cholesterol stores.

Intracranial pathologies, such as a mass lesion, hemorrhage, or other conditions resulting in increased intracranial pressure, can lead to respiratory alkalosis through central neurogenic hyperventilation. The brainstem's <strong>respiratory centers</strong> are sensitive to changes in intracranial pressure and can become <strong>overstimulated</strong>, causing an <strong>increase in the respiratory</strong> rate and subsequent <strong>hyperventilation</strong>.<br><br>When <strong>respiratory alkalosis</strong> is suspected in the context of <strong>neurological symptoms</strong>, immediate steps should include <strong>imaging studies</strong>, <strong>such as a CT scan</strong> of the head to identify the underlying pathology. It is crucial to stabilize the patient's condition, which may involve measures to <strong>reduce intracranial pressure</strong>, such as elevating the head of the bed, administering hypertonic saline or mannitol, and ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The radiograph obtained in this patient demonstrates <strong>osteophytes</strong>, which are classic findings in spondylosis. Other findings consistent with spondylosis include decreased intervertebral disc space, and facet joint hypertrophy. <br><br>The diagnostic workup for an adult with mechanical back pain begins with taking a detailed history and physical examination to identify the nature and characteristics of the pain, along with any red flag symptoms. Plain X-rays can detect bony abnormalities like spinal fractures, spondylolysis, and spondylolisthesis. Spondylolysis often presents with a \"Scotty dog\" sign on oblique X-rays, while spondylolisthesis shows vertebral displacement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for evaluating soft tissue structures and differentiating between causes of low back pain. Findings associated with spinal stenosis include narrowing of the spinal canal with neural impingement. Findings associated with disc herniation include protrusion or extrusion of intervertebral discs causing nerve root compression. Findings seen with spondylosis include degenerative changes like disc space narrowing, osteophytes, and facet joint hypertrophy. <strong>MRI</strong> is critical in the workup of <strong>low back pain with red flag features</strong> and should be performed urgently when any red flags are present. Muscle strain or sprain is typically diagnosed clinically with a history of recent overuse or injury and physical exam findings of localized tenderness and muscle spasm without neurological deficits. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Spondylosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct</strong></span><span>: See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Muscle strain:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect</strong></span><span>:</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Patients with m</span><span>uscle strain&#160;</span><span>generally present</span><span>&#160;with acute, diffuse back pain following overexertion or injury, often with&#160;</span><span>paraspinal&#160;</span><span>muscle spasm</span><span>s</span><span>.

A family history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) might indicate Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, which may present with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain.

The severity of withdrawal symptoms can vary depending on the duration and intensity of opioid use and the type of opioid involved. Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include <strong>agitation, anxiety, muscle aches, watery eyes, runny nose (rhinorrhea), excessive sweating (diaphoresis)</strong>, insomnia, and frequent yawing. Additional findings can include abdominal cramping, diarrhea, dilated pupils (mydriasis), goose bumps, and nausea. <br><br>Management of opioid withdrawal in the emergency department focuses on alleviating symptoms and ensuring patient safety. An initial evaluation should include an <strong>ABCDE assessment</strong>, along with the <strong>establishment of IV access</strong> for fluid and medication administration, and vital sign monitoring. In patients who present with naloxone-induced withdrawal symptoms after an intoxication event, it is particularly important to monitor their mental and respiratory status for potential <strong>reemergence of opioid intoxication effects</strong> due to the short duration of action for naloxone. <strong>Non-opioid medications</strong> (e.g., alpha-2 agonists, antiemetics, antidiarrheals) or <strong>buprenorphine&#160;</strong>(a partial mu agonist) are appropriate options for symptom management. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Intravenous access:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Oral metoprolol&#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Beta blockers, such as metoprolol, are used to control heart rate in certain situations (e.g., atrial fibrillation).

However, the abrupt appearance of multiple seborrheic keratoses, known as the <strong><span>sign of&#160;</span><span>Leser-</span><span>Trelat</span></strong>, is a rare paraneoplastic phenomenon associated with internal malignancy, and patients should be evaluated further. <br><br>Most benign skin lesions can be diagnosed clinically based on a thorough history and physical examination. Benign lesions are usually <strong>symmetrical</strong> in <strong>shape, color, and structure</strong>, with a size <strong><span>&lt;</span><span>&#160;</span><span>6&#160;</span><span>mm</span></strong>. They are typically stable over time with little to no change in appearance and without spontaneous bleeding. &#160;<br><br>Lesion location and features of a patient&#8217;s history can aid in determining the diagnosis. For example, <strong><span>actinic keratos</span><span>e</span><span>s</span></strong> are common in sun-exposed areas and often are seen in the context of repeated sun exposure. Patients with <strong>pyogenic granuloma</strong> commonly have a history of pregnancy or treatment with retinoids, chemotherapy, antiretrovirals, or immunosuppressive medication. <strong>S</strong><strong>ebaceous hyperplasia</strong> is associated with hormonal changes, such as menopause, or the use of immunosuppressive therapy or antiretroviral medications. <strong>Lentigo&#160;</strong>often occurs in patients with a history of fair skin, sun damage, phototherapy, or radiation therapy; <strong>keloids and dermatofibromas</strong> occur in an area of prior skin trauma or inflammation. Lastly, patients with acrochordon (skin tags) may have a history of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or hormonal imbalances. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Seborrheic keratosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Melanocytic nevus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A melanocytic nevus (commonly known as a mole) is a flesh-colored, pink, tan, or brown papule that&#8217;s dome-shaped or pedunculated and typically soft or rubbery in texture.

On lactulose, he has had a return to his baseline mental status, and, therefore,&#160;should be discharged on<strong><span>&#160;lactulose indefinitely</span><span>.</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Lactulose&#160;</span></strong>remains the cornerstone of treatment for <strong>hepatic encephalopathy&#160;</strong>(HE), even after symptoms have resolved. It&#160;helps to&#160;<strong>prevent the recurrence of encephalopathy</strong> by reducing the absorption of ammonia in the gut.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Lactulose, a nonabsorbable disaccharide, works by lowering ammonia levels in the blood through two mechanisms: it acidifies the colon, converting ammonia to ammonium, which cannot be absorbed; and it promotes the excretion of ammonia through the stool by acting as a cathartic. Lactulose can be continued indefinitely in patients with HE who have had a good response. It is typically titrated to achieve <strong>2-3 soft stools per day,</strong> which helps to prevent the recurrence of HE by maintaining low ammonia levels. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>The antibiotic <strong>Rifaximin&#160;</strong>is often used as an <strong>adjunct to lactulose</strong> in patients with recurrent episodes of HE despite adequate lactulose therapy. It works by reducing the population of ammonia-producing gut bacteria, thereby decreasing ammonia production. While lactulose remains the first-line treatment, rifaximin is added in cases of recurrent or persistent HE to enhance the therapeutic effects and reduce the risk of relapse. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>After adding rifaximin to the treatment regimen,&#160;the patient's response should be reassessed after 48 hours. If there is noticeable improvement in mental status, lactulose should be continued indefinitely, and rifaximin should be continued for <strong>at least three months</strong>. However, if the patient's condition does not adequately improve, it may indicate severe liver dysfunction, necessitating&#160;<strong>surgical consultation to evaluate for liver transplantation. &#160; </strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Continue lactulose indefinitely&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong><strong>: </strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Discontinue lactulose:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong><strong>:</strong>&#160;Discontinuing&#160;lactulose is inappropriate&#160;because&#160;it increases the risk of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy.

      "solution": "This patient presents for evaluation of an<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>eyelid lesion</strong> without concerning features for a more insidious process (e.g. vision changes, fevers). Given the description of <strong>gradual onset&#160;</strong>and the finding of a <strong>firm nontender nodule felt in the inner eyelid</strong>, the most likely diagnosis is a <strong>chalazion</strong>. These lesions result from obstruction of a meibomian gland, leading to the formation of a sterile lipogranuloma. They typically occur in the middle of the upper eyelid and are nontender; they may be erythematous. Chalazia typically resolve with conservative management, like warm compresses, over several months. &#160; &#160;<br><br>When evaluating patients with eyelid lesions, it is important to assess for <strong>erythema, edema, and tenderness to palpation of the eyelid.&#160;</strong>If these are present, serious conditions, such as <strong>orbital cellulitis,&#160;</strong>should be ruled out. Findings consistent with orbital cellulitis include fever, vision changes, pain with extraocular eye movements, violaceous discoloration, significant erythema and tenderness, and possibly proptosis. &#160; &#160; <br><br>If orbital cellulitis or other serious ophthalmological conditions are ruled out clinically, benign eyelid diseases can be considered, such as <strong>chalazion or hordeolum (stye).

The most likely finding on urinalysis with microscopy in patients with AIN is <strong>white blood cells without bacteria (i.e. sterile pyuria)</strong>. Other findings on urinalysis with microscopy can include <strong>white blood cell casts,</strong> which reflect underlying tubular inflammation and interstitial immune cell infiltration, and <strong>eosinophils</strong>. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>The diagnostic workup for acute kidney injury&#160;(AKI) involves a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging to determine the underlying cause. Initial testing includes assessing serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes, along with calculating the BUN-to-creatinine ratio. This ratio helps differentiate prerenal AKI (BUN: creatinine &gt;20:1) from intrinsic and postrenal causes. Urinalysis can&#160;identify key features such as proteinuria, hematuria,&#160;white blood cells, red blood cells, white blood cell casts, or muddy brown casts.

Given that he has never received the <strong>herpes zoster (shingles) vaccination</strong>, he should have it administered during this visit. This vaccine should be administered to all patients &#8805; 50 years old. <br><br>At each well-patient geriatric visit, patients should undergo a <strong>comprehensive history and physical exam</strong>, followed by <strong>screening and counseling</strong> about a variety of topics, including recreational substance use, mental health, functional status, and fall risk. All patients should have their past medical and surgical history, family and social history, sexual activity, medications, and diet and exercise habits reviewed. Patients should have a physical examination, including height, weight, body mass index, and vital signs. These factors then help determine the need for further diagnostic screening and management. Geriatric patients may get yearly vaccinations for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for all adults over 65 years old.

PUD is generally caused by <strong>medications&#160;</strong>that erode the gastric lining (e.g., NSAIDs, corticosteroids) or by <strong><em>Helicobacter pylori</em></strong>, a Gram-negative bacterium. Rarer causes include high gastric acid-producing states such as stomach cancer or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. <br><br>Patients should first be assessed for hemodynamic stability. If patients are <strong>unstable or have high-risk features</strong> (e.g., melena, severe and constant abdominal pain) then emergent <strong>upper endoscopy</strong> should be performed. If there is concern for peritonitis or perforated viscus, then emergent <strong>CT imaging</strong> of the abdomen should be considered. <br><br>For hemodynamically stable patients suspected of having PUD, <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> testing should be performed first. In patients <strong>older than 60 years old</strong> or those with <strong>features concerning for malignancy</strong> (e.g., unintentional weight loss), <strong>upper endoscopy</strong> should be the first step with gastric or duodenal biopsies sent for <em>H. pylori&#160;</em>testing.

If test results are positive, patients should be treated with 14 days of <strong>amoxicillin</strong>, <strong>clarithromycin</strong>, and a <strong>proton pump inhibitor</strong>. They will then require proof of eradication via repeat testing. If <em>H. pylori</em> testing is negative, common etiologies such as NSAID-induced PUD should be investigated.

The patient's history can generally differentiate between these three etiologies. Alcohol-induced hepatitis (and sometimes cirrhosis) will typically cause RUQ pain that does not change with eating or position. Pancreatitis can cause RUQ or LUQ pain but classically causes epigastric pain that worsens with eating and with lying down. Older age and a longstanding history of alcohol use increases the likelihood of cirrhosis.
