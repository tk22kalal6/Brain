Normally, the immune system has several &#8220;checkpoint&#8221; functions that help prevent it from attacking its cells. Immune cells, such as regulatory T-lymphocytes, play a crucial role in this process.

Features of the physical examination that will help guide the differential include the <strong>rash location, rash distribution (local vs widespread), rash description (macular, papular, vesicular),&#160;</strong>presence or absence of <strong>erythema&#160;</strong>and whether it <strong>blanches, tenderness&#160;</strong>of the lesions and surrounding skin, and any associated findings such as joint swelling, fever, or neurologic changes.

The absence of significant cardiopulmonary or focal neurological abnormalities on examination often points towards a psychogenic origin&#160;rather than a neurologic cause&#160;of&#160;hyperventilation.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Carpopedal spasm&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>:&#160;See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hyperreflexia&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>:&#160;Hyperreflexia can be associated with electrolyte imbalances.

Of the medications listed, only <strong>disopyramide</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>is known to <strong>induce acute decompensated heart failure</strong> in patients with known impaired cardiac contractility. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Disopyramide is a<strong>&#160;class IA antiarrhythmic&#160;</strong>that is used most often to treat ventricular arrhythmias and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This class of drugs works by <strong>inhibiting voltage-dependent fast sodium channels</strong> in cardiac muscle cells. When an electrical current propagates down the heart and reaches a myocyte, the nearby fast sodium channels typically open and allow a large rush of sodium ions into the cell, quickly raising the charge of the inner cellular membrane from negative to positive. This influx of sodium ions is stopped by the closing of the channel's inactivation gate, which reacts more slowly to the depolarization than to the channel's opening function. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>By serving as a fast sodium channel blocker in both the atria and the ventricles, disopyramide is able to <strong>slow the speed</strong> at which the heart depolarizes as an organized unit, and also <strong>decrease the strength</strong> of the heart's contractions. As such, one of disopyramide's feared complications is acute heart failure, and thus it cannot be used in patients with impaired systolic function.&#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Disopyramide:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Correct: </strong></span><span>See Main Explanation.</span>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lidocaine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><span><strong>Incorrect:</strong></span><span>&#160;Lidocaine is a class IB antiarrhythmic that works by blocking sodium channels and preferentially affects ischemic tissue and Purkinje fibers.

Based on the Centor Criteria, which is used to determine the need for testing for streptococcal pharyngitis, this patient has a score of 4 (age 15-44 yo, tonsillar exudates, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, absence of cough), and likely has<strong>&#160;streptococcal pharyngitis. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>IM and streptococcal pharyngitis can present similarly, though<strong>&#160;strep pharyngitis</strong> is more often associated with tender swollen lymphadenopathy in the <strong>anterior cervical chain,</strong> and <strong>symptoms of IM are more often prolonged</strong>. If IM is suspected, serum <strong>heterophile antibody testing</strong> should be performed. If this is positive, then IM is confirmed. However, it is common to have false negative results early in the disease course therefore If heterophile antibody testing is negative and IM is strongly suggested, a complete blood count and peripheral smear should be performed. If the <strong>absolute lymphocyte count &gt;4000/mm3 OR &gt;50% OR &gt;10% atypical lymphocytes</strong> are seen on the peripheral smear, then <strong>anti-EBV viral capsid IgM testing</strong> should be performed; and if this is positive, then IM is confirmed.

Most cases of traveler&#8217;s diarrhea are caused by bacterial entero-pathogens, and typically <strong>symptoms resolve with supportive care</strong> that may include antacids, bismuth-subsalicylate, and anti-diarrheal agents (e.g. loperamide). <br><br>All patients who are returning from travel with a fever should be presumed to have an <strong>endemic illness from the country where they traveled</strong>. They should have a targeted history and physical examination, which can often reveal clues as to the specific underlying disease process. Importantly, all patients should be screened for the <strong>presence of a rash</strong> (and its clinical characteristics, if present) which can further narrow the differential diagnosis, in addition to inquiring about associated risk factors (e.g. arthropod bite). <br><br>When a specific disease is suspected, further confirmatory testing can be performed via a variety of modalities, including <strong>nucleic amplification testing, serology, </strong>and <strong>stool/blood culture</strong>. However, traveler's diarrhea can be diagnosed clinically based on a history of travel, three or more unformed stools per 24 hours, and associated abdominal symptoms.

The next step in evaluating suspected <strong>postrenal AKI</strong> is to distinguish <strong>upper-tract from lower-tract obstruction</strong>. A bedside <strong>post-void residual (PVR) bladder scan</strong> rapidly confirms whether urine is being retained in the bladder, signifying a lower-tract process. <br><br>Acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to a sudden decline in kidney function that results in electrolyte imbalances, extracellular dysregulation, and accumulation of nitrogenous wastes such as ammonia and uric acid. It is diagnosed by a rise in <strong>serum creatinine</strong>, and <strong>urinalysis&#160;</strong>is typically used to screen for intrinsic renal disease, infection, or hematuria. Postrenal AKI results from urinary outflow obstruction, which increases intraluminal pressure and reduces glomerular filtration; classification as upper (ureteral) versus lower (bladder/urethral) obstruction helps narrow the differential. <br><br>Once postrenal AKI is suspected, a post-void residual <strong>(PVR) bladder scan</strong> quantifies the residual volume of urine and is a key fork in the diagnostic pathway. A PVR <strong>&#8805;100 mL</strong> indicates <strong>lower urinary tract obstruction</strong> and warrants immediate catheterization. Further imaging (e.g., ultrasound, CT) or cystoscopy may be indicated if a bladder outlet obstruction or urethral obstruction are suspected. History and physical examination may also reveal clues about the etiology in cases of benign prostatic hypertrophy, neurogenic bladder, or medication-induced urinary retention (e.g. use of medications with <strong>anticholinergic</strong> properties, such as diphenhydramine in this case).

Administration of <strong>intravenous furosemide</strong> is the most appropriate next step.<br><br>Differentiating between the systemic diseases that can cause bilateral lower extremity edema is critical as the workup and management is very different for each one. <strong>Liver failure</strong>, <strong>renal failure</strong>, and <strong>CHF</strong> are the major systemic causes of bilateral lower extremity edema, though there are several other causes.<br><br><strong>Liver failure</strong> may be chronic (cirrhosis) or acute. True acute liver failure requires the patient to have encephalopathy, coagulopathy (elevated INR or PT), and liver injury (elevated transaminases or bilirubin) and requires emergent transfer to a liver transplant center for evaluation. Presentation of chronic liver failure is more indolent with findings of hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, other stigmata of cirrhosis, and declining liver synthetic function, usually in the setting of an appropriate cause (e.g. alcohol use disorder, hepatitis B virus infection). <strong>Renal failure</strong> is diagnosed based on elevated serum creatinine or a significant drop in urine output, and may also be chronic or acute. Nephrotic syndromes notoriously cause severe lower extremity edema, but any significant renal failure can cause this. Renal ultrasound, urine protein studies, and even kidney biopsy may be needed to make the diagnosis.<br><br><strong>CHF</strong> leads to venous congestion and typically presents with dyspnea and fatigue. Symptoms can vary depending on whether right- and left-sided heart failure is present, but many patients will have signs of pulmonary and peripheral edema. Venous congestion can cause renal failure (termed cardiorenal syndrome) and in some cases congestive hepatopathy.

Heavy alcohol use and previous episodes of recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) which can result from chronic alcohol use, are clues to the diagnosis. Chronic pancreatitis is caused by <strong>inflammation and fibrosis of the pancreas</strong> which leads to <strong>epigastric pain</strong> that can range from mild to severe. Additionally, destruction of the pancreas results in exocrine and endocrine insufficiency leading to malabsorption, steatorrhea, and weight loss, as well as hyperglycemia from diminished insulin production. On imaging, the pancreas will often appear atrophied with extensive ductal calcifications and ductal dilatation. <br><br>One of the most important aspects of assessing and managing patients with chronic pancreatitis is <strong>pain control</strong>. Adequate pain control can be difficult to achieve and multiple different treatments may need to be employed. Medications typically used for chronic pancreatitis include <strong>NSAIDs, acetaminophen</strong>, opiates, TCAs, SSRIs, pregabalin, and antioxidants.

Given her young age, BMI, and family history of autoimmune disease, the most likely diagnosis is <strong>type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)</strong>, which is supported by the low C-peptide level that indicates low endogenous insulin production. The best next step in the management is to start <strong>insulin replacement therapy</strong> which should preferably consist of <strong>basal long-acting insulin (glargine)</strong> given once or twice a day, and <strong>rapid-acting insulin (aspart)</strong> given as a pre-meal bolus. <br><br>Treating T1DM involves a comprehensive approach that includes insulin replacement, glucose monitoring, dietary planning, regular exercise, and patient education. The goal of treatment is to <strong>mimic the body's natural insulin secretion</strong>. The total daily insulin dose is often started at 0.3 to 0.7 units per kilogram per day, divided into multiple daily injections. Half of this dose is usually given as a longer-acting, basal form of insulin such as glargine, or detemir which provides a steady level of insulin over a 24-hour period. The other half is divided into bolus doses of rapid-acting insulin analogs such as aspart, lispro, or glulisine given prior to meals, providing coverage for the carbohydrate content of meals (insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio) and allowing for corrections based on the premeal blood glucose level (insulin sensitivity factor). <br><br><strong>Diabetes self-management education and support</strong> is very important in the treatment of T1DM. This includes education on insulin administration, blood glucose monitoring, carbohydrate counting, and how to adjust insulin dosing based on blood glucose concentrations and carbohydrate intake as well as changes in routine (such as during illness or increased physical activity). Patients should also be taught to recognize, prevent, and treat hypo- and hyperglycemia.<br><br>Patients started on initial treatment for T1DM should be seen in <strong>3 months for a recheck of HbA1c levels</strong>.

Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is a clinical syndrome characterized by bradycardia and hypotension in response to mechanical stimulation of the carotid sinus (e.g. shaving, wearing a tie, head turning).

A comprehensive review of the patient's medical and medication history is also essential as conditions, like inferior wall MI, or medications, such as beta-blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, can contribute to bradycardia.

The cardiovascular exam should include inspection for jugular venous distention; palpation of the carotid pulse; auscultation of the carotid arteries for bruits; and assessment of the precordium for murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The respiratory examination should focus on the patient's breathing pattern and auscultation for abnormal breath sounds. A focused neurological examination helps rule out central causes of bradycardia or syncope by assessing mental status, cranial nerves, motor and sensory function, coordination, and reflexes.

Laboratory studies demonstrate l<strong>ow aldosterone and renin levels</strong> consistent with <strong>hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism</strong>, a common complication of <strong>diabetic nephropathy. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Causes of hyperkalemia fall into one of the following categories: increased potassium load, transcellular shifts of potassium, or decreased renal excretion of potassium. The history can be used to identify increased dietary intake or supplementation of potassium. If this is not a factor, causes of transcellular shifts of potassium should be considered. This may include medications (e.g., beta-agonists, digoxin, succinylcholine), acidosis, hyperosmolality (e.g. hyperglycemia), and cell destruction (e.g., tumor lysis, rhabdomyolysis). &#160; <br><br>The workup for <strong>decreased renal excretion of potassium</strong> is more involved. A low urine sodium level (&lt; 25 mmol/L) can signify decreased effective arterial blood volume (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis), while a low eGFR may point to acute or chronic kidney disease as the cause. If these are ruled out, the <strong>aldosterone level</strong> should be checked. If this level is normal or elevated, there may be tubular resistance to aldosterone. This can occur with certain medications (e.g., spironolactone, trimethoprim), pseudohypoaldosteronism, and obstructive uropathy. However if the <strong>aldosterone level is low</strong>, check the &#160;<strong>renin level.

Medications should be reviewed, as certain drugs, such as thiazide diuretics, lithium, vitamin D supplements, and calcium-containing antacids can cause hypercalcemia. &#160; &#160;<br><br>If there is no obvious cause, then <strong>a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level</strong> should be checked to distinguish between <strong>PTH-mediated and non-PTH-mediated causes of hypercalcemia</strong>. Elevated or inappropriately normal PTH indicates primary hyperparathyroidism or familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, whereas a low PTH suggests a PTH-independent cause such as malignancy or hyperthyroidism. If PTH is not elevated then<strong>&#160;PTH-related peptide</strong>, alkaline phosphatase, and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D should be checked. TSH and SPEP may be ordered if there is still uncertainty regarding the cause of hypercalcemia. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Z9WFgzGWSgOcC1-4VUvwm4RcQWOOCqhG/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 24-hour urinary calcium excretin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The best next step is to measure the serum PTH level to assess for underlying primary hyperparathyroidism, since primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy cause most cases of hypercalcemia. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Serum protein electrophoresis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Serum electrophoresis is indicated to help diagnose multiple myeloma.

Approximately half of this variability is known to be caused by clinical or lifestyle factors (e.g., a patient&#8217;s age, weight, BMI, gender, smoking status, existing conditions, and concomitant medications), as well as by <strong>genetic factors&#8211;including variants in the <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>or <em>CYP2C9&#160;</em>gene. &#160;</strong><br><br>The <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>and <em>CYP2C9&#160;</em>genotypes are the most critical genetic determinants of warfarin dosing. Warfarin targets the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme (VKORC1), catalyzing the rate-limiting step in vitamin K recycling (converting vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K). This, in turn, inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. &#160;<br><br>A common non-coding variant, <em>VKORC1</em>, c.-1639G&gt;A, is associated with increased sensitivity to warfarin. <strong>Patients with this variant require lower doses of warfarin, as standard doses may result in a supratherapeutic INR and subsequent bleeding complications.</strong> The polymorphism occurs in the promoter region of the VKORC1 gene and is thought to alter a transcription factor binding site, leading to lower protein expression. As a result, patients starting warfarin therapy who are carrying at least one &#8220;A&#8221; (mutated) allele at the -1639 locus require lower initial and maintenance doses compared with patients carrying a G/G (wild type) genotype at this locus. &#160;<br><br>Less commonly, <strong>missense mutations in <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>can lead to warfarin resistance&#160;</strong>and higher dose requirements.

ACD/AI occurs in the setting of chronic conditions, such as malignancy, infection, or autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammation dysregulates iron homeostasis, primarily by increasing <strong>hepcidin&#160;</strong>and other cytokines, to <strong>prevent iron release</strong>.

Since intravenous (IV) medications are delivered directly into the bloodstream, their bioavailability is said to be 1, or 100%. Ingested medications have varying amounts of bioavailability, thus making IV medications more effective in many cases. However, some oral medications have such high bioavailability that they are almost equivalent to IV doses. As a medication passes through the GI tract, some of it may be delivered to the liver and partially metabolized, leaving less medication available for later delivery to the target tissue. This is referred to as the<strong>&#160;first-pass effect.</strong> In addition, the medication also needs to diffuse across cellular membranes to eventually be delivered to the target tissue, further potentially lowering the bioavailability. &#160; <br><br>The <strong>pKA&#160;</strong>of a medication is used to measure the relative acid strength; medications with a weaker pKA (more positive) are weaker acids and tend to be absorbed better in acidic environments (e.g. the proximal duodenum). Weak base medicines are absorbed better in basic environments (e.g. the distal ileum). &#160; The <strong>volume of distribution</strong> of a medication refers to how much a medication distributes through the body compartments.

The frequency of the phlebotomy is tailored to the iron profile. The target ferritin level is <strong>&lt; 300 &#956;g/L.&#160;</strong>Importantly, <strong>hemoglobin levels&#160;</strong>should be checked before each phlebotomy session with a target hemoglobin level of 12-13 g/dl.

      "solution": "This patient has developed an elevation in serum creatinine after kidney transplantation. Absence of significant findings on urinalysis and the elevated BUN/creatinine ratio suggests a prerenal cause. This is most likely due to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction caused by cyclosporine. &#160; <br><br>Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that is used frequently to prevent transplant rejection and can also be used in treatment of certain autoimmune disorders. Normally, after T-cells are exposed to an antigen, calcineurin gets activated and dephosphorylates a transcription factor known as the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT). NFAT then translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription of immune mediator cytokines; most importantly interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 provides the signal needed for T-cell activation and proliferation. Cyclosporine inhibits the transcription of IL-2 by inhibiting calcineurin, thereby halting T cell proliferation and protecting the transplanted organ from T cell-mediated injury. &#160; &#160;<br><br>One of the major limitations of cyclosporine use is its severe nephrotoxic effects. Acute nephrotoxicity is related to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, which decreases the glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and creatinine clearance. As there is no intrinsic kidney injury, the urinalysis is usually bland. This is usually reversible with cyclosporine dose reduction. Long-term use can cause chronic nephrotoxicity marked by tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which is usually irreversible. Cyclosporine can also cause hypertension, gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-JoTbcv5SKOTjUF-N9G1ZHf6TOex1HJX/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cyclosporine side effect:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sirolimus side effect:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant that is frequently used in combination with cyclosporine as a prophylaxis for transplant rejection.

This mechanism of action is consistent with that of <strong>aldosterone</strong>. Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, will ultimately result in hypertension and hypernatremia due to the retention of sodium and osmotic shifts. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Aldosterone binds to aldosterone receptors on <strong>&#945;-intercalated cells</strong> and <strong>principal cells</strong> in the collecting tubule of the nephron. In &#945;-intercalated cells, aldosterone induces increased secretion of hydrogen ions into the collecting duct lumen by promoting both the synthesis and activity of the <strong>H+/K+ exchange transporter.</strong> In principal cells, aldosterone works to increase the synthesis and activity of the <strong>Na+/K+ ion transporter</strong>. These changes result in increased potassium secretion into the collecting duct and retention of sodium in the blood. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The net effect of aldosterone is thus increased sodium retention, thereby <strong>increasing hydrostatic pressure&#160;</strong>and, as a surrogate, blood pressure.

Valvular incompetence of the deep and superficial veins can be determined by performing a <strong>Trendelenburg test</strong>. The affected leg is raised emptying the veins, then a tourniquet is applied to constrict only the superficial veins. <strong>The test is positive</strong>, if upon standing with the tourniquet in place for 30 seconds, the varicosities remain collapsed and when the tourniquet is removed, the internal saphenous vein rapidly fills with blood from above.
