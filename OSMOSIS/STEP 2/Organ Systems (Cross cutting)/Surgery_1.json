      "solution": "This patient sustained a head injury after she was struck from behind and fell backward onto the hood of a car. Notably, she was wearing a helmet. The mechanism of injury in this scenario involves anterior displacement of her neck due to the impact of the car and backward momentum of her head due to the increased weight of her head with her helmet. This pattern of injury, similar to a whiplash injury, can also cause fractures of the C2 vertebrae known as a <strong>Hangman&#8217;s fracture</strong> or <strong>traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis</strong>.<br><br>Understanding the physiopathology of a Hangman&#8217;s fracture requires an appreciation of the unique features of the C1 and C2 vertebrae. Unlike the subaxial spine, the C1 and C2 vertebrae <strong>do not possess an intervertebral disc</strong>. Stabilization of these vertebrae, therefore, occurs via unique ligaments which allow for the support and rotational flexibility of the cranium. In a fracture of C2, this specialized anatomy becomes a great obstacle due to the physical instability of the fragments, which leads to impaired healing of the fracture and the potentially life-threatening complication of spinal cord laceration if the unstable bone fragments come in contact with the spinal cord posteriorly. Cervical orthostasis is usually achieved through a Halo-vest device.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Instability of the fracture &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Avascular necrosis of the cervical foramen &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The vertebral bodies typically have abundant access to arterial blood flow, even in the setting of fractures.

Therefore, compression of the spinal column causing neuropathy is a rare occurrence. Rather, unstable fractured fragments have the potential to lacerate the spinal cord and cause traumatic injury, which can be lethal. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Respiratory depression &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Respiratory depression occurs due to herniation of the brain secondary to traumatic brain injury or secondary to brainstem injury.

Brown pigment stones, on the other hand, can precipitate when the biliary tract is infected by certain microbes (e.g., E. coli, Clonorchis sinensis) that produce &#946;-glucuronidase, an enzyme that unconjugates previously conjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin is water insoluble and combines with calcium to form brown pigment stones. &#160;<br><br>However, the most common gallstones are cholesterol stones. Bile formation is the only significant pathway for the body to eliminate excess cholesterol, either as free cholesterol or as bile salts. Cholesterol becomes water-soluble when combined with bile salts; therefore, when cholesterol concentrations exceed the solubility capacity of bile salts (supersaturation), cholesterol stones can form. Conditions that<strong>&#160;increase cholesterol synthesis&#160;</strong>(e.g. obesity) or <strong>decrease bile salt formation</strong> (e.g., malabsorptive conditions, medications such as fibrates) predispose individuals to forming gallstones.

The pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves alterations in the vascular wall, which leads to a loss of vascular structural proteins and reduction of wall strength. Risk factors include older age, male gender, cigarette smoking, Caucasian race, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and family history of large artery aneurysms (e.g., iliac, femoral, popliteal). &#160; <br><br>The majority of patients are asymptomatic and diagnosis is made via screening or is discovered incidentally on routine physical examination. Those with symptoms often present with abdominal, back, or flank pain. When a rupture occurs, the classic presentation is severe pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. When addressing back pain, it is important to keep in mind visceral pain as a differential diagnosis.

      "solution": "This patient has epigastric pain radiating to the back, an elevated lipase level, and likely history of gallstones. These findings are suggestive of <strong>gallstone pancreatitis</strong>. Gallstone disease is the most common cause of acute pancreatitis in the Western world. The condition arises when a gallstone enters the common bile duct and <strong>obstructs outflow</strong> from the pancreatic duct. As a result, pancreatic enzymes cannot be excreted, and they instead begin to autodigest the organ&#8217;s parenchyma, resulting in inflammation and, if severe, necrosis. Patients can present with epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea/vomiting, and skin findings such as Cullen sign (periumbilical ecchymosis) or Grey Turner sign (flank ecchymosis). &#160;<br><br>The diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis can be made if the patient has: 1) acute<strong>&#160;upper abdominal pain&#160;</strong>radiating to the back; 2) amylase or lipase levels <strong>three-times the upper limit of normal</strong>; and 3) the presence of <strong>gallstones on imaging</strong>. In addition, patients may have elevated liver transaminase and bilirubin levels secondary to biliary tract obstruction and bile backflow. &#160;<br><br>In regards to imaging, the first step is to visualize the gallstones using a<strong>&#160;right upper quadrant</strong> (RUQ) <strong>ultrasound</strong>, which is inexpensive, sensitive, and widely available. An alternative option is an abdominal CT scan. However, this modality is less preferred, since it unnecessarily exposes patients to ionizing radiation. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/yjynvBl_Tiad1wRSWD7_BxqvTHGc6Ugi/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Obtain serum amylase levels:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient has epigastric pain radiating to the back, lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit, and a likely history of gallstones.

Together, these findings suggest <strong>adhesive capsulitis</strong> (also termed <strong>frozen shoulder syndrome</strong>). <br><br>Adhesive capsulitis is a poorly understood condition that results in global stiffness and pain of the glenohumeral joint. Current research postulates the condition results from spontaneous inflammation of the joint capsule, followed by the development of adhesions and fibrosis of the synovial lining. Clinically, patients present with subacute symptoms including deep, nagging shoulder pain and associated <strong>limitations in passive and active range of motion</strong> (particularly external rotation and abduction). The condition is often idiopathic but has been associated with a history of shoulder injury, diabetes, dyslipidemia, Parkinson disease, immobilization, and antiretroviral therapy. <br><br>The disease progresses through three distinct phases. First, patients experience an acute phase characterized by severe disabling shoulder pain that worsens at night, with some associated stiffness. This phase lasts 2-9 months. Next, an intermediate phase occurs wherein pain decreases but stiffness and severe loss of shoulder motion ensues. This phase lasts 4-12 months. Finally, a recovery phase occurs, wherein patients regain shoulder mobility.<br><br>Diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis is primarily clinical, as imaging findings are generally noncontributory, and <strong>radiographs are often normal</strong>.

Together, these findings are consistent with an <strong>upper gastrointestinal bleed,&#160;</strong>with the most likely source being a peptic ulcer. &#160; <br><br>The assessment of acute gastrointestinal bleeding begins with determining hemodynamic stability versus instability. This step can be achieved by measuring vital signs and performing a comprehensive physical examination, which should include a <strong>digital rectal exam.&#160;</strong>Afterwards, two <strong>large bore IVs</strong> (18 gauge or larger) should be placed for intravenous access, and initial laboratory studies including a <strong>type and screen, complete blood count, liver function tests</strong>, and <strong>coagulation parameters</strong> should be obtained. &#160; <br><br>Certain laboratory parameters can provide clues to the underlying cause of the patient&#8217;s gastrointestinal bleeding. In particular, a <strong>BUN/creatinine ratio exceeding 30&#160;</strong>is suggestive of an upper gastrointestinal bleed in patients without renal failure due to increased intestinal absorption and breakdown of heme. In contrast, the BUN/creatinine ratio tends to be either low or normal in patients with a lower gastrointestinal bleed.

While an elevated BUN can be seen in the setting of esophageal varices (also an upper gastrointestinal bleed), it is a less likely culprit in this patient.

These findings are consistent with rotator cuff injury. The most commonly injured rotator cuff muscle is the <strong>supraspinatus</strong>.<br><br>The rotator cuff muscles include the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. These muscles coordinate complex movements of the shoulder joint and are commonly injured in athletes as well as older adults, resulting in a rotator cuff injury. The etiology of injury is often multifactorial and often stems from repetitive movements against resistance, rather than a single episode of trauma or injury to the shoulder. <br><br>The majority of rotator cuff injuries involve the supraspinatus, which is responsible for abduction of the arm. Patients often describe nagging pain localized to the deltoid that worsens with overhead movements. If a full thickness tear is present, patients may have weakness or an inability to raise the arm overhead. <br><br>The <strong>empty can test</strong> (also termed Jobe test) has a high specificity for supraspinatus injuries. In this test, the patient is placed in a standing or sitting position, and the arm is raised parallel to the ground in the scapular plane with the arm rotated to full internal rotation. Once rotated, the clinician pushes down on either the wrist or elbow, and the patient is instructed to resist the downward pressure.

      "solution": "This patient with severe Crohn disease and prolonged therapy with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is presenting with fever and acute right upper quadrant pain; in conjunction with her laboratory values showing leukocytosis and her ultrasound imaging demonstrating a thickened gallbladder wall with no visible gallstones, she likely has <strong>acute acalculous cholecystitis.</strong> This is more common in elderly patients, those who are already seriously ill, or those who have been on <strong>TPN&#160;</strong>for a prolonged period of time. The cause is <strong>gallbladder hypomotility</strong> and <strong>bile stasis</strong> which concentrates the bile, making it toxic to the gallbladder walls, eventually leading to inflammation and necrosis.

Since HIDA scans take longer, it should only be considered in hemodynamically stable patients. For a HIDA scan, a radioactive tracer is injected into a vein, which then enters the bile-producing cells in the liver that will secrete the tracer into bile.

SBO occurs when a blockage in the small bowel prevents the passage of intraluminal contents (e.g., gas, chyme), which results in distention of the bowel proximal to the obstruction. This condition manifests as pain, abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting. SBO is often mechanical (physical), and secondary to adhesions or tumors.<br><br>Imaging can aid in the diagnosis and identify the underlying etiology of mechanical obstruction. An abdominal X-ray is typically the first step, which may demonstrate <strong>distended small bowel loops and air-fluid levels</strong>. It can also evaluate for signs of <strong>perforation</strong>, such as <strong>pneumoperitoneum</strong>. An abdominal CT can provide additional information, such as the identification of a <strong>transition point (where the bowel is distended to the point of obstruction but collapsed beyond it)</strong>. Conservative management is often appropriate for these cases of SBO.<br><br><strong>Two or more transition points</strong>, as seen on this patient&#8217;s CT, indicate a <strong>closed-loop obstruction</strong>, which may be due to <strong>adhesions, hernias, or volvulus</strong>. Closed-loop obstructions are unlikely to resolve with supportive care and are at risk for progression to bowel ischemia and perforation. These patients <strong>require surgical intervention</strong>.<br><br>Other CT findings that indicate the need for surgical intervention include evidence of <strong>bowel ischemia (e.g., pneumatosis, portal venous gas), small bowel tumors, gallstone ileus, an ingested foreign body, and intussusception</strong>. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Volvulus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Gallstone ileus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s history and examination are concerning for a small bowel obstruction.

      "solution": "The <strong>greater omentum</strong> is an important sheet-like curtain of vascularized fatty tissue which hangs down from the greater curvature of the stomach, draping over the intestines. The purpose of the greater omentum is threefold: 1) Fatty thermal insulation and a physical promotility agent for the intestines, 2) physical barrier to protect against infections and wounds, and 3) centralized hub for immune activity. &#160; &#160; <br><br>Pathologies involving the omentum are rare. The greater omentum can undergo <strong>torsion</strong>, whereby the omentum pivots on its long axis and cuts off its blood supply. The greater omentum can whorl around a nidus of adhesion or tumor, as is seen in the CT above. Since the omentum is vascularized, this whorling is an acute surgical emergency as it can cause acute ischemia and subsequent necrosis of the omentum. Torsion of the greater omentum can present as an acute abdomen. The twisted segment is often localized to the right-side segment and presentation with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain can mimic acute appendicitis. However nausea and vomiting are typically absent. &#160; &#160; <br><br>Greater omental torsion can be primary when there is no underlying abnormality or secondary when an underlying lesion is the cause of torsion such as with <strong>post-surgical adhesions</strong> as seen in this case. <strong>It has been postulated that torsion</strong> of the greater omentum is caused by the greater length and mobility of the right side of the omentum due to the differing embyologic origins of the omentum. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Developmental anomaly:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>These findings are characteristic of omental torsion.

Acquired diaphragmatic hernias occur at sites of weakness in the diaphragm that arise from <strong>embryonic fusion sites</strong>.

This phenomenon occurs because the right hemidiaphragm is <strong>protected by the large size of the liver. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Hiatal hernias</strong> also occur when gastrointestinal contents protrude into the chest cavity through an opening in the diaphragm. They protrude through the opening in the diaphragm called the hiatus. Hiatal hernias occur when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity. There are two types of hiatal hernias: sliding hernias and paraesophageal hernias. <strong>Sliding hernias</strong> occur when the fundus of the stomach bulges directly into the thoracic cavity. In contrast, <strong>paraesophageal hernias</strong> occur when the gastric fundus bulges into the thoracic cavity adjacent to the esophagus. Sliding hernias are generally asymptomatic and more common than paraesophageal hernias.

      "solution": "This patient has a classic presentation of<strong>&#160;acute appendicitis.</strong> During surgical removal of the appendix, the <strong>teniae coli</strong> can be used as a landmark. <strong>Teniae coli</strong> are three separate longitudinal ribbons of smooth muscle outside the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colons. They are visible and can be seen just below the serosa or fibrosa. The bands converge at the root of the vermiform appendix. During surgery, the appendix can be located by<strong>&#160;following the taenia</strong> to their <strong>origin at the base of the cecum. &#160;</strong><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/zpxVMVb_SBG93BT2g5DvzzQ0QBWYQNfA/_.png\"></div><br><br>The appendix is usually located 2-cm beneath the ileocecal valve in the RLQ at a <strong>retrocal location</strong>. The initial <strong>periumbilical pain</strong> in appendicitis is <strong>referred pain</strong> due to the irritation of the general <strong>visceral afferent fibers&#160;</strong>(T10) of the autonomic nervous system, secondary to the luminal distension stretching of the smooth muscle. The subsequent shift of the pain to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) results from irritation of the <strong>parietal peritoneum</strong> and the abdominal wall which is located at the <strong>McBurney point&#160;</strong>(two-third distance from the umbilicus to the anterior superior iliac spine). With peritoneal irritation, the abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to palpation or sudden release of pressure. (i.e. rebound tenderness). &#160; &#160;<br><br>While the <strong>retrocecal&#160;</strong>location is the<strong>&#160;most common location of the appendix,</strong> its location is highly variable and it can be located in almost any area of the abdomen, depending on developmental abnormalities, pregnancy, and prior abdominal surgeries. This can lead to variability in the clinical presentation of appendicitis. For example, the <strong>obturator sign</strong> is pain with internal rotation of the right hip, suggestive of a <strong>pelvic appendix.</strong> The<strong>&#160;psoas sign&#160;</strong>which is pain with external rotation or passive extension of the right hip is suggestive of a<strong>&#160;retrocecal appendix &#160;</strong><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/szjPa_hIRdivGdjujdcvreRoTa6mzFda/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ligament of Treitz:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The duodenum is demarcated from the stomach by the pylorus and from the jejunum by the ligament of Treitz.

A number of factors determine whether or not a lesion is suspicious for melanoma and should be biopsied. Clinically, the <strong>ABCDE criteria</strong> can serve as a <strong>guide for identifying suspicious lesions that may need to be biopsied:</strong>&#160;<strong>A</strong>symmetry, <strong>B</strong>order irregularity, <strong>C</strong>olor variegation, <strong>D</strong>iameter over 6mm, and<strong>&#160;E</strong>volution (change in size, color, or shape of a pre-existing lesion or report of a new growing lesion). Patient-reported symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or sensory changes in the lesion should heighten the suspicion of malignancy. Additionally, when a lesion <strong>looks conspicuously different</strong> (<strong>&#8220;ugly duckling&#8221; sign</strong>) from <strong>surrounding nevi</strong> (nevus phenotype), then a biopsy should be performed. The Glasgow Seven-point Checklist seen below can also help determine when lesions should be biopsied. &#160; &#160;<br><br>During a skin exam, trained physicians may use a <strong>dermatoscope&#160;</strong>which magnifies skin lesions and can detect features that may be suspicious for malignancy but are not visible to the naked eye. For example, a dermatoscope can reveal subsurface skin structures within the epidermis, dermoepidermal junction, and papillary dermis. Visualizing these structures can increase the diagnostic accuracy of skin exams.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/RajFqqovQTuZ2hGLDByL06MrSH_wGdKp/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Mw2IL4PZRkO4AuVBFHsH5EbnQceQUX8G/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Occupation with frequent sun exposure:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>While frequent sun exposure increases the risk of skin cancer, the appearance and features of the lesion are more pertinent to the diagnosis and evaluation of suspected melanoma.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lesion diameter of 5 mm:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Lesions greater than 6 mm should be biopsied.

The colonoscopy findings seen in colon cancer are the same as those seen with rectal cancer.

For <strong>inoperable cases</strong>, <strong>chemotherapy&#160;</strong>is recommended initially. Post-chemotherapeutic tumor restaging informs the subsequent therapeutic. A marked reduction in metastatic burden suggests a successful chemotherapeutic response and opens the possibility for surgical intervention.

The two main subtypes of anal cancer are <strong>squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)</strong> which is the most common type, and <strong>adenocarcinoma</strong>. Although rare, the incidence of anal cancer has been increasing over the last two decades likely due to the spread of <strong>human papillomavirus (HPV)</strong> which is the <strong>primary cause of anal SCC</strong>. A <strong>history of anogenital warts</strong>, which HPV causes, is a significant risk factor for the development of anal cancer. <br><br>Patients with suspected anal cancer should have a thorough history taken to evaluate for risk factors. Anal cancer is strongly associated with a <strong>history of HPV infection (anal, cervical, vaginal, vulvar)</strong>, particularly the high-risk strains <strong>HPV 16 </strong>and <strong>18</strong>. HPV-related anal cancers often arise from precursor lesions, and individuals with a history of <strong>anogenital warts</strong> are at increased risk of developing these lesions and subsequently anal cancer. HPV is transmitted sexually therefore a <strong>high lifetime number of sexual partners</strong>, as well as <strong>receptive anal intercourse</strong>, increase the likelihood of contracting the virus and developing anal cancer. Patients who are <strong>immunocompromised</strong>, including those living with HIV infection, are also at an increased risk for anal cancer, and <strong>cigarette smoking</strong> increases the risk.<br><br>Patients may present with anal pain, rectal bleeding, and a sensation of a mass within or around the anus. On <strong>digital rectal exam</strong> (DRE) the clinician may note a <strong>palpable perianal or anal mass</strong>, which can be firm, fixed, or ulcerated.

It most commonly occurs at the <strong>ileocecal junction.</strong> Intussusception typically presents in infants and toddlers aged <strong>4 to 36 months,</strong> and patients may have a history of<strong> preceding viral illness</strong> (e.g. upper respiratory infection). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>Patients can present with<strong> crampy, intermittent, severe abdominal pain.</strong> They may have <strong>nausea, vomiting,</strong> and<strong> bloody stool with or without mucus.</strong> Oftentimes, patients will draw their knees up toward their abdomen to relieve the pain. Physical examination can reveal <strong>hypotension </strong>and <strong>tachycardia</strong>. Abdominal examination may show no tenderness or point tenderness in the mid or lower right abdomen. A <strong>&#8220;sausage-shaped&#8221; mass</strong>&#160;may be palpated in the mid-right abdomen or right lower quadrant. In cases of perforation or peritonitis, abdominal distention, rebound tenderness, and guarding may be seen.

In stable patients without evidence of bowel perforation, peritonitis, or shock, <strong>nonoperative bowel reduction using an enema</strong> (pneumatic or hydrostatic) is the treatment of choice.

Lasting one to two years, this phase is characterized by structural and functional changes to the remaining small bowel and colon that will lead to increased nutrient absorption and slowed gastrointestinal transit. Treatment should always <strong>begin with supportive care,</strong> which may include both<strong>&#160;oral and IV nutritional supplementation. Oral food and fluid intake should be optimized</strong> first and then <strong>supplemented with IV if needed.</strong> At times, both oral and enteral feedings may be required.

It is most often caused by skin flora, including streptococcal species, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. It can also be caused by pathogens, such as anaerobic gut bacteria, encountered during bowel surgery. Patients typically present with <strong>pain or tenderness at the surgical site&#160;</strong>and <strong>peri-incisional signs of infection</strong>, including warmth, erythema, or purulent discharge. Patients can also develop systemic signs of infection (e.g. fever, hypotension, tachycardia), wound dehiscence, and a tender fluctuant mass under the skin suggestive of an abscess. SSI gets subdivided into three types depending on the depth of infection: <strong>superficial</strong>, <strong>deep</strong>, and <strong>organ-space</strong>.<br><br>The risk of surgical site infection is based on the <strong>surgical classification</strong> of wound contamination. The wound can be classified as clean, <strong>clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty</strong> based on factors like location of surgery, trauma history, or breaks in sterile technique. Patient factors also play a role in increasing the risk of SSI, including <strong>current smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, and immunosuppression</strong>.<br><br><strong>Smoking&#160;</strong>is considered a <strong>primary risk factor</strong> for developing a surgical site infection due to the vasoconstrictive effects of nicotine and poor tissue perfusion, alteration in nutrient transportation, and immune response.
