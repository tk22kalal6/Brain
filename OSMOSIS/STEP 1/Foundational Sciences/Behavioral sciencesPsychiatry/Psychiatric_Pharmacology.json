The condition is characterized by <strong>abnormal behavior</strong> while sleeping and usually occurs during the first third of the night. Movements may be minor (e.g. sitting up in bed) but can extend to leaving the bed and walking. The patient&#8217;s eyes are often open, and the sleepwalker may mumble. Movement is clumsy, but if uninterrupted, the person can usually safely return unaided or gently aided to a lying position and continue their sleep.<br><br>Since the patient is unaware of their actions, <strong>safety&#160;</strong>is a prominent concern. Precautions (e.g., locking doors, closing windows) should be taken to make sure the patient cannot leave the house. In certain cases, pharmacological intervention may be needed to prevent harm. <strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> can help treat somnambulism specifically by suppressing stage 3 of NREM sleep. <br><br>Likewise, benzodiazepines can be used to treat <strong>sleep terror disorder</strong>, which also occurs during stage 3 of NREM sleep. Sleep terror disorder usually affects children and is characterized by marked <strong>autonomic nervous system activation</strong> (e.g., tachycardia, tachypnea, tremulousness, mydriasis).<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Reduces stage 3 of nonrapid eye movement sleep &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreases sleep latency &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Benzodiazepines do reduce sleep latency, which is the amount of time from full wakefulness to sleep onset, and thus they are often used as hypnotics.

Decreased activity in the mesocortical pathway causes the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., flat affect, anhedonia, apathy). Increased activity in the mesolimbic pathway leads to positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions). As a result, the <strong>mesolimbic pathway</strong> is the <strong>primary target of antipsychotic medications</strong>.<br><br>Atypical antipsychotics have two main mechanisms of action: <strong>inhibition of dopamine D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway</strong> and <strong>inhibition of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the mesocortical pathway</strong>. These medications treat various conditions, including <strong>schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, mania, </strong>and <strong>Tourette syndrome</strong>.<br><br>Commonly used atypical antipsychotics include clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, paliperidone, risperidone, lurasidone, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Mesolimbic:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Mesocortical:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Decreased activity in the mesocortical pathway causes the negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as anergia, apathy, and lack of spontaneity.

Clonidine, along with <strong>guanabenz&#160;</strong>and <strong>guanfacine</strong>, is an &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist. These medications stimulate &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors on the presynaptic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), especially those in the medulla. This decreases norepinephrine in the sympathetic neurons, which leads to lower blood pressure. As a result, these medications can be used to treat <strong>hypertension</strong>.<br><br>Likewise, &#945;<sub>2</sub>-receptor agonists (clonidine in particular) act on &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors present in the prefrontal cortex, where they exert the same inhibitory effect on norepinephrine release. Moderating the amount of norepinephrine in this part of the brain helps &#8220;tune out&#8221; irrelevant stimuli and sharpens focus. As a result, clonidine is helpful in the treatment of <strong>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</strong> (ADHD) and tics in <strong>Tourette syndrome</strong>.<br><br>Another &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist is <strong>alpha-methyldopa</strong>, which is converted to methyl norepinephrine centrally to decrease the adrenergic outflow by &#945;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist action from the central nervous system, leading to reduced total peripheral resistance and decreased systemic blood pressure.

None of the patient&#8217;s other medications are associated with nephrogenic DI.<br><br>DI is defined as the passage of large volumes (&gt;3 L/24 hr) of dilute urine (&lt; 300 mOsm/kg). There are 2 main forms of diabetes insipidus, central, and nephrogenic. Central DI is caused by a decrease in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, whereas nephrogenic DI results from resistance of the kidneys to ADH. Both can present with polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia.<br><br><strong>Central DI</strong> may be distinguished from <strong>nephrogenic DI&#160;</strong>with a water deprivation test, which involves withholding all water intake and measuring urine osmolality. Afterward, ADH is administered to delineate whether the DI is central or nephrogenic. In both central and nephrogenic DI, urine osmolality will initially be less than 300 mOsm/kg after water deprivation. With ADH administration, the osmolality will be <strong>&gt; 750 mOsm/kg in central DI</strong>. In contrast, there will be <strong>no change in nephrogenic DI</strong> given the kidneys are unable to respond to ADH.<br><br>Treatment for central and nephrogenic DI involves <strong>adequate fluid replacement</strong>, which can be accomplished through oral intake, and <strong>discontinuation of offending agents</strong> (e.g. lithium).
