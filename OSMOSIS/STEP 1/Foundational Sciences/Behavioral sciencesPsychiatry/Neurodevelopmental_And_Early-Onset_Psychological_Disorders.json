      "solution": "This boy&#8217;s inattention, distractibility, and forgetfulness are characteristic of <strong>attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</strong> (ADHD).<br><br>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent and pervasive <strong>inattention, impulsivity,&#160;</strong>and <strong>hyperactivity</strong>. The condition is <strong>more common in males</strong> than females (3-4:1). Diagnosis of ADHD requires the onset of several symptoms (see below table) <strong>before age 12</strong> and impairment in <strong>multiple settings</strong> (e.g. school and home). Therefore, physicians should provide a patient&#8217;s teacher with behavioral rating scales during the diagnostic evaluation to help establish the presence of ADHD symptoms in the classroom setting. For instance, children with ADHD may exhibit inattentiveness and poor organizational skills at school with resultant <strong>poor academic performance</strong>.<br><br>ADHD shows high concurrent comorbidity with other neurodevelopmental disorders, including <strong>autism spectrum disorder</strong>, specific <strong>learning disorders</strong> (e.g., dyslexia, dysgraphia), <strong>intellectual disability</strong>, and <strong>tic disorders</strong>.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/gvq_0jq2Ql6cefOh2gCvHTjoTfuhw7Gx/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Behavioral report from the child&#8217;s teacher &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hearing evaluation &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hearing impairment can mimic attention-deficit hyperactive disorder. While hearing impairment can cause poor school performance and failure to respond to speech, it would not account for the patient&#8217;s difficulty with completing everyday tasks and distractibility. Moreover, this patient does not have any speech deficits, which makes hearing impairment even less likely. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Genetic testing for FMR1&#160; &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Genetic analysis for mutations in the <em>FMR1</em> gene can help diagnose Fragile X syndrome, which may present with symptoms similar to attention-deficit hyperactive disorder. Patients with Fragile X syndrome also typically have characteristic physical features, such as a long, narrow face, enlarged ears, and a protruding chin. In contrast, these physical features are absent in this patient. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Polysomnography:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A polysomnography can be performed in children suspected of having sleep apnea, which can present with difficulty paying attention, daytime sleepiness, and poor school performance. The greatest risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea in children include adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obesity. In contrast, this patient had a tonsillectomy and has a normal BMI for his age, which makes sleep apnea less likely to be the underlying cause of his symptoms. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Evaluation for maternal alcohol use during pregnancy &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Inquiring about maternal alcohol use is helpful if fetal alcohol syndrome is suspected.

      "solution": "<strong>Enuresis</strong>, also known as bedwetting, is when individuals repeatedly urinate on themselves while asleep. To make this diagnosis, episodes must occur at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months in someone older than <strong>5 years of age</strong>. Enuresis can be further divided into primary and secondary enuresis.<br><br><strong>Primary enuresis</strong> is defined by urinary incontinence in children who have never achieved nighttime dryness (no &#8220;dry&#8221; period for longer than six consecutive months) as well as no underlying medical factors contributing to their incontinence (e.g., diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, urinary tract infection). <strong>Secondary enuresis</strong> describes new-onset enuresis after a dry period of at least 6 months. Secondary enuresis is typically caused by underlying factors, such as diabetes mellitus or obstructive sleep apnea.<br><br>Most children outgrow bedwetting by the time they reach puberty. If enuresis persists, patients are usually treated using <strong>behavioral modification</strong> techniques, such as <strong>restricting fluid intake</strong> before bedtime or <strong>voiding at scheduled times</strong>. Adults can also help children avoid shame and embarrassment via <strong>positive reinforcement</strong>, by rewarding certain positive behaviors like going to the toilet. If these fail to work, individuals may use a <strong>bedwetting alarm</strong> or have children sleep on a special pad that sets off the alarm when it becomes wet.<br><br>Refractory cases may require the use of medications like <strong>desmopressin</strong>, which is an antidiuretic hormone (ADH) analog. An alternative is <strong>imipramine</strong>, a tricyclic antidepressant.

These symptoms are concerning for <strong>Tourette syndrome</strong> (TS), which is strongly associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder.<br><br>TS is a neurological disorder characterized by <strong>motor&#160;</strong>and <strong>phonic tics</strong> that develop during childhood. TS is thought to occur due to a disturbance in the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (mesolimbic) circuit, which results in disinhibition of the limbic and motor systems. Tics are the clinical hallmark of the condition and are characterized by sudden, brief, intermittent movements (motor tics) or utterances (phonic tics). The diagnosis of TS is based upon clinical symptoms present <strong>before age 18</strong>.

Therefore, when the brain of a patient with Rett syndrome is in the early stages of development, the low levels of MeCP2 proteins are sufficient for normal brain development.
