The primary effects of opiates that do not exhibit tolerance are <strong>pupillary constriction</strong> (miosis) and <strong>constipation</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Tolerance&#160;</strong>refers to an increase in the dose needed to produce a given pharmacological effect. In the setting of opiate use, this phenomenon results in part from desensitization of the opiate receptors. With prolonged activation by an agonist, the &#956;-opioid receptors become phosphorylated by various intracellular kinases, directly desensitizing the receptor or uncoupling the receptor from its G-protein. &#160; &#160; <br><br>Tolerance is an important concept in opiate use disorder. As patients require higher and higher doses to achieve the same analgesic or euphoric effects, they are at greater risk of overdosing and subsequently developing life-threatening<strong>&#160;respiratory depression</strong> and<strong>&#160;apnea. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Pupillary constriction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Euphoria&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Euphoria is one of the effects of opiates that exhibit tolerance, meaning that higher and higher doses of the substance are required to achieve the same effect. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Analgesia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Analgesia is one of the effects of opiates that exhibit tolerance, meaning that higher and higher doses of the substance are required to achieve the same effect.

NAS is characterized by <strong>hypertonia, autonomic instability</strong> (e.g., sweating and sneezing), irritability, poor sucking reflex, tachypnea, and seizures. The common symptoms of NAS are outlined in the image below. Affected patients often have biological mothers who received little or no prenatal care. There are also often underlying risk factors associated with opiate use (e.g. hepatitis C infection).
