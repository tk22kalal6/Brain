      "solution": "This patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of major depression during the winter months with remission by spring, suggestive of <strong>major depressive disorder</strong> (MDD) <strong>with a seasonal pattern</strong> (also called <strong>seasonal affective disorder</strong> [SAD]). SAD is a mood disorder with depressive symptoms that occurs at a specific time of year with full remission at other times of the year. It most commonly occurs during <strong>fall </strong>or <strong>winter</strong>, although a less common form occurs during spring or summer. The criteria for MDD with a seasonal pattern according to the DSM-V is as follows:<br>&#160;<ul><li>&#160;Regular temporal relationship between the onset of a major depressive disorder and a particular time of the year&#160;</li><li>&#160;Full remission at a particular time of year (typically spring or summer months)&#160;</li><li>&#160;2 depressive episodes in the last 2 years reflecting the seasonal relationship&#160;</li></ul>Risk factors for SAD include notable family history, <strong>female </strong>sex, living at a <strong>northern latitude</strong>, and young adulthood (18 to 30 years of age). The pathophysiology of SAD remains uncertain, but current theories postulate underlying circadian rhythm disruption, dysregulation of the melanopsin signaling pathway and negative impact on serotonin reuptake, and dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The primary treatments for SAD include <strong>antidepressants, light therapy</strong> (e.g., bright light therapy, dawn simulation), and psychotherapy.&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Major depressive disorder with a seasonal pattern &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Major depressive disorder &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and MDD with a seasonal pattern differ in that symptoms tend to improve in the summer and spring months.

      "solution": "<strong>Postpartum psychosis</strong> occurs in 0.1-0.2% of patients within the first 2-4 weeks following delivery and is most often seen in patients with underlying <strong>bipolar disorder</strong>. However, this condition also commonly occurs in patients with underlying major depression with psychotic features, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder. Features include <strong>paranoid</strong>, grandiose, or bizarre <strong>delusions</strong>, mood swings, confused thinking, and <strong>grossly disorganized behavior</strong>. Delusions of postpartum psychosis are typically related to the patient's mood state (e.g., in a depressed state, the patient may believe that the baby is evil or that people close to them are trying to poison them).<br><br>In the first year after childbirth, suicide risk increases 70-fold; suicide is the leading cause of maternal death up to one year after delivery. Therefore, patients demonstrating signs and symptoms of postpartum psychosis should be considered for <strong>immediate psychiatric hospitalization</strong>, as the risk of suicide/homicide (typically infanticide) is much higher in these patients. In addition to hospitalization, patients with postpartum psychosis should be started on <strong>antipsychotic medications</strong> (e.g., quetiapine, risperidone).<br><br>P.S.

He used to play the piano in his spare time, but he states he no longer enjoys it due to his inability to concentrate. His appetite has increased and he has gained 4.1-kg (9-lb) over this time.
