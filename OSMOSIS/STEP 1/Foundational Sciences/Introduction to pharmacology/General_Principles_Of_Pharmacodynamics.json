The main stimuli for the sympathetic nervous system are norepinephrine and epinephrine which act on the adrenergic receptors throughout the body leading to cellular responses.<br><br>The adrenergic receptors are divided into two main categories, alpha, and beta-adrenergic receptors. Alpha-adrenergic receptors are further divided into alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that, once stimulated, lead to the activation of an intracellular second messenger. However, the type of the G-protein coupled to each receptor is different and the effects are completely different. In addition, alpha-1 and alpha-2 are found in different locations around the body.<br><br>Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors are mainly found on the surface of the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels, the pupillary dilator muscle in the eye, and the sphincters in the bladder and the intestines. When stimulated, alpha-1 receptors increase the calcium concentration inside the cell through a cascade of secondary messengers, which leads to smooth muscle contraction. Therefore, the effects of alpha-1 receptor stimulation include vasoconstriction, mydriasis, and urinary and fecal retention.<br><br>On the other hand, alpha-2 adrenergic receptors are found in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors act as negative feedback on the sympathetic nervous system, and when stimulated, inhibit cellular responses via the inhibition of secondary messengers. The effects of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors stimulation include inhibition of the sympathetic outflow, vasodilation, decreased aqueous humor production, and increased platelet aggregation. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Stimulation of alpha-2-adrenergic receptors act as a negative feedback mechanism and inhibits the sympathetic nervous system outflow.

Pharmacodynamics studies a drug's molecular, biochemical, and physiologic effects or actions on the body. All drugs produce their effects by interacting with biological structures or targets (e.g. <strong>receptors</strong>) at the molecular level to induce a change in how the target molecule functions regarding subsequent intermolecular interactions. These interactions include <strong>receptor binding, post-receptor effects,</strong> and <strong>chemical interactions</strong>. Examples of these types of interactions include: &#160; <br><br><ol><li>&#160;Drugs binding to an active site of an enzyme&#160;</li><li>&#160;Drugs that interact with cell surface signaling proteins to disrupt downstream signaling&#160;</li><li>&#160;Drugs that act by binding molecules like monoclonal antibodies&#160;</li></ol>&#160;Moreover, the pharmacodynamics of a drug helps to determine <strong>dose-response relationships,</strong> i.e. the relationships between drug concentration and effect to determine the <strong>duration of action, therapeutic index, adverse effects,&#160;</strong>and associated<strong>&#160;mechanisms of action. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>In summary, pharmacokinetics refers to the movement and modification of the therapeutic agent in the body or what the body does to the agent.

      "solution": "A <strong>competitive antagonist</strong> is defined as a pharmacologic antagonist that can be <strong>overcome by increasing the agonist concentration</strong>. This is because both the agonist and antagonist bind to the same site on the receptor. In the presence of a fixed agonist concentration, increasing concentrations of a competitive antagonist inhibit the agonist response; high antagonist concentrations prevent the response almost wholly. Conversely, sufficiently high concentrations of agonist can surmount the effect of a given concentration of the antagonist; that is, the Emax for the agonist remains the same for any fixed concentration of antagonist. Because the antagonism is competitive, the presence of the antagonist increases the agonist concentration required for a given degree of response. So the agonist concentration-effect curve is shifted to the right.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/JJSZ6OFBSQ2CrPNjJm9MA09vSZKIkf6R/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Physiological antagonist &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: A physiological antagonist binds to a different receptor molecule, producing an effect opposite of that produced by the drug it antagonizes.
