Glycogenesis takes place primarily in two organs, the liver and the skeletal muscles. <strong>The main mediator of glycogen synthesis is insulin.</strong> Insulin is secreted after meals (especially carbohydrate-rich meals) and functions to maintain normal glucose levels in the blood. Insulin stimulates the glucose uptake in the tissues and also stimulates the enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis (i.e., glycogen synthase). &#160; <br><br>On the other hand, epinephrine and glucagon inhibits the synthesis of glycogen by inhibiting the glycogen synthase and mediates its breakdown. These hormones are released when blood glucose levels drop and function to raise the blood glucose levels back to normal. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Insulin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Glucagon:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Glucagon is a pancreatic enzyme that is released when the blood glucose levels drop.

According to his study, the glucose showed uptake into two main organs after a meal and stored in the form of a glycogen. In addition, he noticed that in the first organ (organ Z), glycogen storage is metabolized and broken down to glucose, which is then transported to the blood, while in the second organ (organ X), the glucose from glycogen metabolism is not exported outside the cells into the bloodstream but is used by the cells of that same organ. Which of the following are most likely organs studied in this experiment? &#160;",

      "solution": "Glycogen is a polymer of glucose molecules that functions mainly in the storage and regulations of blood glucose levels. In states of high blood glucose (e.g., after a meal), the synthesis of glycogen from glucose increases, and vice versa when the blood sugar levels drop. &#160; <br><br>The main two sites for glycogen storage and metabolism are the <strong>liver and the skeletal muscle</strong>. However, the function of glycogen in these two organs differ. In the liver, glycogen is stored and, when blood glucose levels drop, it is broken down into glucose molecules and is then exported outside the liver into the blood to maintain normal blood glucose levels. &#160; <br><br>However, in the skeletal muscle, the glycogen metabolism and the resulting glucose molecules are not exported into the bloodstream but are used by the skeletal muscles themselves to generate energy needed for contractions. &#160; <br><br>The ability to release the glucose from glycogen into the bloodstream in the liver is mainly due to the presence of the enzyme called glucose-6 phosphatase, which converts glucose-6 phosphate to glucose, which can then be exported outside the cells. The enzyme glucose-6 phosphatase is not present in skeletal muscle, and hence, skeletal muscle cannot export glucose into the bloodstream, and the glucose from glycogen breakdown in skeletal muscle is used by the muscle cell itself to provide energy for contractions. &#160; <br><br>Finally, glycogen can be found in other tissues including the heart, the kidneys, and the brain. However, its function in those organs are not well understood and is believed to not be a major contributor to the regulation of blood glucose levels. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Organ Z &#160;&#160;Organ X &#160;&#160;LiverSkeletal muscles &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Organ Z &#160;Organ X &#160;LiverKidney &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although glycogen can be found in the kidneys, its function is still not well understood.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Organ Z &#160;Organ X &#160;Skeletal muscle &#160; Liver:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Glucose from glycogen breakdown in the liver is exported outside into the bloodstream; however, glucose produced from glycogen breakdown in the skeletal muscle is not exported and is used by the skeletal muscle cells themselves. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Organ Z &#160;Organ X &#160;LiverBrain:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although glycogen can also be found in the brain, its function is not well understood. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Organ Z &#160;Organ X &#160;BrainHeart:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Glycogen can be found in the heart and the brain, but the function of glycogen in these organs is not well understood and is not thought to be contributing to the storage and regulation of glucose. &#160;&#160;</span></div>",
