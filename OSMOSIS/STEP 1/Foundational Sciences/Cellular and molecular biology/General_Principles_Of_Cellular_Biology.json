      "solution": "The<strong>&#160;Gq receptor</strong> is one of the three types of <strong>G-protein-coupled receptors</strong>. G-protein-coupled receptors are seven-pass transmembrane receptors that have an alpha, beta, and gamma subunit. When a ligand binds, this activates the G-protein by allowing GTP to bind to the alpha subunit instead of GDP. This allows the alpha subunit to dissociate from the rest of the G-protein and either activate or inhibit other proteins in the cell (depending on which type of G-protein it is). &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/TmfHyw12Q4ycO4LYj5y0nUmQS9aqfpzy/_.png\"></div><br>Gq is one type of G protein, that once activated, it activates an enzyme called PLC which then cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Both IP3 and DAG work together to continue the signaling. IP3 stimulates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The released calcium helps DAG activate a protein called protein kinase C, which then starts acting on other proteins and activating them, thereby inducing the response of the cells. &#160;<br><br>Other examples of hormones that have Gq-coupled receptors are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), Oxytocin, Antidiuretic hormone (V1-receptor), Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), Histamine (H1-receptor), Angiotensin II, and gastrin. &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/1vL5SGSaTYmjtRZw03ViZiYHSMKH_qeK/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Ligand binding to a Gs receptor leads to activation of adenylate cyclase and formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

      "solution": "The three main methods of endocytosis are phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. In <strong>phagocytosis</strong>, debris, bacteria, and dead cells are engulfed by specific phagocytic cells to form <strong>phagosomes</strong>. These cells then fuse with lysosomes to form <strong>phagolysosomes</strong>, which degrade engulfed bacterial or foreign material. &#160; <br><br><strong>Pinocytosis </strong>is used by most cells for the uptake of extracellular fluid and dissolved molecules. This process involves the invagination of cell membranes with vesicle formation and transport to the cytosol via motor proteins. <strong>Receptor-mediated endocytosis</strong> for uptake of specific molecules (e.g., iron and cholesterol). In this process,<strong> clathrin-coated</strong> pits lined with receptors bind to a specific molecule. The edges of the pit coalesce with the subsequent linkage of clathrin proteins. Subsequently, the vesicle pinches off and merges with the endosome to separate receptors into a second vesicle.
