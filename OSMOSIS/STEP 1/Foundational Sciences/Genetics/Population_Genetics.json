Genetic linkage is the most prominent exception to Gregor Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment, which asserts that separate genes assort independently of each other. &#160; <br><br>With genetic linkage, two separate genes lie very close together on the same chromosome and are inherited together as a single unit during meiotic crossover. A common example of this phenomenon includes human hair and eye color&#8211;e.g. blonde hair and blue eyes are more commonly inherited together than blonde hair and brown eyes. &#160;Genetic linkage can provide useful information regarding allelic foci, allowing researchers to calculate <strong>recombination frequencies</strong> and generate <strong>linkage maps</strong> that show the order and relative distances of genes on a chromosome. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Genetic linkage &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Autosomal dominant inheritance &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Autosomal dominant inheritance occurs when one variant of a gene on a chromosome masks or overrides the effect of a different variant of the same gene on the other copy of the chromosome. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Imprinting:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Imprinting refers to diseases where one gene copy is silenced by methylation, and only the other copy is expressed.

If a genetic disease mutation affects a recessive allele and it takes two mutant copies to cause a disease, it is called a recessive inheritance pattern. Autosomal recessive diseases (e.g., sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, etc.) only occur when a person has two recessive alleles (rr). Heterozygotes with only one mutant allele (Rr) are considered to be carriers of the disease, even though they don&#8217;t have the disease phenotype. For example, here are several scenarios: &#160; <br><br><ul><li>If two parents are carriers for sickle cell disease - they are both heterozygous Rr. They make gametes that have the normal R allele, or the recessive mutant r allele.
