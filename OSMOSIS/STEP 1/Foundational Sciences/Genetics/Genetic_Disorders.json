      "solution": "<strong>Meconium ileus</strong> is often the first manifestation of <strong>cystic fibrosis</strong> (CF) and occurs in approximately 20% of patients diagnosed with CF. This neonate received inconsistent prenatal care; if a prenatal ultrasound had been performed, meconium ileus would likely have been detected by the presence of hyperechoic bowel or peritoneal calcifications. The mother is a carrier of CF, which can be deduced from her father dying of respiratory complications at a young age, likely due to CF. &#160; <br><br>CF is characterized by an absent or abnormal transmembrane ion channel that regulates chloride transport. This abnormality interferes with bicarbonate, sodium, and water secretion, ultimately resulting in <strong>inadequate luminal hydration</strong>. The inspissated luminal contents can result in a meconium ileus, which <strong>obstructs normal small bowel passage</strong>. Neonates typically present with failure to pass his/her first stool (meconium), abdominal distension, and occasionally bilious vomiting. Complications include <strong>intestinal perforation</strong>, which would present with signs of <strong>sepsis&#160;</strong>(e.g., tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension). &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/gLOWfqNnS7Wet9mKh16TYBCwRQOHhjbz/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Abnormal neural crest cell migration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Newborns with Hirschsprung&#8217;s disease (HD) also typically present with signs of intestinal obstruction in the neonatal period. However, rectal examination of HD patients would show increased rectal tone, as well as the &#8220;squirt sign,&#8221; in which there is forceful expulsion of stool during digital rectal palpation.

IRT is a precursor to trypsin that is normally found in the pancreas.

Heterozygous carriers of cystic fibrosis can also have a raised IRT, and therefore, it is not diagnostic. Diagnosis is confirmed with <strong>quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis</strong>, better known as the <strong>sweat test</strong>. After chemical stimulation of the sweats glands with pilocarpine, the amount of chloride in the sweat is measured.

      "solution": "This child presents with hyperphagia, weight gain, and history of hypotonia and poor sucking in infancy; he likely has <strong>Prader-Willi syndrome</strong>, a rare genetic disorder caused by<strong>&#160;genomic imprinting.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Typically, people inherit two genes, one from each parent, and both genes are active. However, occasionally only one of these genes is active, while the other copy is silenced. Which copy of the gene is active depends on parental origin. In some cases, specific genes are only active when inherited from the father, while others are only active when inherited from the mother. This phenomenon is known as<strong>&#160;genomic imprinting</strong>. The underlying mechanism of genomic imprinting involves <strong>DNA methylation</strong>, wherein adding a methyl group to the gene silences its expression. &#160; <br><br>In some cases, the active gene is mutated or deleted, which can automatically result in disease because the other copy is silenced or &#8220;imprinted&#8221; (i.e. there&#8217;s no backup for that gene). For example, the genes involved in <strong>Prader-Willi syndrome</strong>, which are found on <strong>chromosome 15q</strong> (in a section known as the Prader-Willi critical region, or PWCR), require an active paternal copy &#8211; the maternal copy of the PWCR is always silenced. Therefore, if an individual inherits a mutation or deletion in the PWCR from their biological father, they will develop Prader-Willi syndrome. However, if their maternal copy of the PWCR is mutated or deleted, the individual will instead be strictly a carrier of the disease; this is because their maternal copy would have been silenced regardless. &#160;<br><br>Another issue that can arise due to genetic imprinting is in cases of <strong>uniparental disomy</strong>, wherein a patient inherits two copies of a chromosome (or two copies of parts of the chromosome) from one parent and none from the other. This phenomenon becomes problematic for conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome, in which <strong>maternal&#160;</strong>uniparental disomy results in the patient having zero paternal copies of the PWCR on chromosome 15q &#8211; in this case, both maternal copies will automatically be silenced, and the patient will manifest with Prader-Willi syndrome, just as if they had had a paternal mutation or deletion in the PWCR. Maternal uniparental disomy accounts for about 25% of cases of Prader-Willi syndrome, while 75% are simply the result of a mutated or deleted paternal copy of the PWCR. &#160;<br><br>A similar phenomenon is seen in <strong>Angelman syndrome</strong>, although this condition instead requires an active maternal copy of the UBE3A gene (which is also found on <strong>chromosome 15</strong>), and the paternal copy is silenced. Therefore, in cases of paternal uniparental disomy, both paternal copies of UBE3A are automatically silenced, but the patient has no active maternal copies to express, and thus they will subsequently develop Angelman syndrome. The condition is characterized by intellectual disability, inappropriate laughter, and a persistently happy demeanor. Paternal uniparental disomy accounts for about 5% of cases of Angelman syndrome, while 95% are simply the result of a mutated or deleted maternal copy of UBE3A. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/fVkxRU7rQriYJYRBG6yIyvvcTWGhgphW/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Maternal uniparental disomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Paternal uniparental disomy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Angelman syndrome can result from paternal uniparental disomy.

With the CGG expansion, cytosine nucleotides become methylated which subsequently <strong>silences the FMR-1 gene</strong>, thereby decreasing Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) production. This protein carries multiple neuronal functions and is critically important to normal neurological development. &#160; <br><br>Patients with FGS are typically born without the characteristic phenotypic physical examination features. Neurodevelopmental abnormalities begin as the infant grows, and most patients present with <strong>delayed motor and verbal milestones</strong>. In addition, a significant number of patients with FGS develop behavioral abnormalities, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Most physical findings develop in the early pre-pubertal period and include a long face, flat feet, and large protruding ears. The hallmark physical finding in FGS patients is <strong>macroorchidism&#160;</strong>(enlarged testicles) which is not apparent until puberty. &#160;<br><br>FGS is diagnosed via genetic PCR testing which measures the CGG repeats in the FMR-1 gene. Patients with FGS have &gt;200 repeats, and those with CGG repeats between 55-200 have a pre-mutation. These carrier patients exhibit milder symptoms with fewer physical findings or evidence of mental disability. However, it is important to note that trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders such as FGS exhibit anticipation &#8211; meaning with subsequent generations, the number of repeats will increase, so the symptoms of FGS will grow more pronounced as the mutation is passed down through generations. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/hiLYRtfSTwqan8Sg99qPkvOBRnObnBzx/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Macroorchidism:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acute lymphoblastic leukemia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Hepatic/muscle biopsies would stain<strong>&#160;positive for</strong><strong>&#160;Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stains</strong>, indicating the accumulation of glycogen intermediates.<br><br>Cori disease presents during infancy and childhood with<strong>&#160;hepatomegaly&#160;</strong>and <strong>hypoglycemia</strong> due to liver disease. Patients also have ketoacidosis, hyperlipidemia, and growth retardation; these features that may be indistinguishable from Von Gierke disease (GSD I). However, Cori disease can be distinguished from Von Gierke disease by<strong>&#160;hypotonia</strong> (less profound in Von Gierke disease), weakness, wasting of skeletal muscle, and involvement of the heart, as seen in this patient. <strong>Cardiomegaly&#160;</strong>is a significant complication that can result in left ventricular hypertrophy or arrhythmias as the disease progresses.<br><br>Another distinguishing feature between Cori disease and Von Gierke disease is the resolution of symptoms in Cori disease with fructose administration (since gluconeogenesis is still intact), while in GSD I, symptoms are aggravated with fructose administration.<br><br>Diagnosis is confirmed by <strong>detecting low enzymatic activity&#160;</strong>in skeletal muscles and hepatic tissue.

The syndrome is characterized by hamartomas of the CNS and skin, <strong>angiofibromas</strong>, <strong>shagreen patches</strong>, hypomelanotic macules (\"ash leaf spots\"), <strong>cardiac rhabdomyoma</strong>, renal angiomyolipoma, intellectual disability and behavioral problems. <strong>Shagreen patches&#160;</strong><strong>are&#160;</strong>connective tissue nevi plaques with a leathery texture, whereas <strong>angiofibromas&#160;</strong>(adenoma sebaceum) are small flesh-colored, tiny papules of the cheeks that contain fibrous tissue. The expression of the disease varies substantially. The diagnosis of TSC can be made clinically or through genetic testing. &#160;<br><br>Cardiac rhabdomyoma is the <strong>most common primary cardiac tumor in children</strong>, and 90% are associated with tuberous sclerosis. Rhabdomyomas are hamartomatous growths that are mostly asymptomatic, and they typically require no intervention as they tend to <strong>regress spontaneously</strong>. Symptoms, if present, are caused by blood flow obstruction or cardiac rhythm disturbances (e.g., heart block, arrhythmias). Macroscopically, cardiac rhabdomyomas present as gray-white masses that protrude into the ventricular chambers.

The CFTR gene encodes a transmembrane chloride channel that regulates ion transport in the epithelial cells of various organs (e.g., sweat glands, lungs, pancreas). &#160;<br><br>When eccrine sweat is initially produced, it is isotonic with extracellular fluid. As the sweat travels through the duct to the skin surface, chloride is normally reabsorbed by the CFTR channel, with sodium and water following.
