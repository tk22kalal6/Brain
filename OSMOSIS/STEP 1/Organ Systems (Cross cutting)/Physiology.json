This results in a more robust and longer-lasting immune response because the T-cells release cytokines that stimulate class-switching, affinity maturation, and memory B- and T-cell formation. &#160; <br><br>Subunit vaccines use a highly immunogenic subunit to produce active immunity against certain microorganisms. Some of these subunits can be polysaccharides, such as the <strong>capsular polysaccharide</strong> used in vaccines against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B </em>and <em>Neissieria meningitides. &#160;&#160;</em><br><br>When the polysaccharide antigen is used alone in the vaccines, it will result in a <strong>thymus-independent response,</strong> a weaker response that will not last long. Therefore, booster doses and adjuvants are usually required to maintain immunity. &#160; <br><br>On the other hand, the capsular polysaccharide can be <strong>conjugated with a protein</strong>. This results in switching the immune response to a thymus-dependent reaction involving T-cells because the antigen can be presented to T-cells and activate them, causing a much more robust and longer-lasting immune response. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ The conjugated antigen results in a more robust immune response that involves T-cells and B-cells &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The polysaccharide-only antigen creates a longer-lasting immune response. &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Polysaccharide-only antigens are thymus-independent antigens that cannot activate T-cells.

An increase in stroke volume means more blood is ejected from the heart, which would result in an increased SBP and pulse pressure. Similarly, a decrease in vascular compliance means the ejected blood is pushing against a stiff vascular wall, which would also increase SBP and pulse pressure. <br><br>These physiological parameters can be illustrated via some clinical scenarios. One example is <strong>arteriosclerosis</strong>, which leads to <strong>decreased arterial compliance</strong>. SBP will increase whereas DBP, which is determined by total peripheral resistance (provided chiefly by the arterioles), will remain largely unchanged. The end result is an increased pulse pressure. Another example is <strong>aortic stenosis</strong>. In this condition, narrowing of the aortic valve interferes with the ejection of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta and results in a <strong>decreased stroke volume</strong>.

The body responds to short-term changes in blood pressure via the arterial baroreflex to maintain mean arterial pressure between 85 and 100 mm Hg. The decreased pressure causes the walls of the <strong>aortic arch</strong> and <strong>carotid sinus</strong> to become less stretched, and the baroreceptors start firing less frequently. The <strong>glossopharyngeal</strong> and <strong>vagus nerve</strong> carries that decreased signal to the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem (nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla). These centers <strong>stimulate the sympathetic</strong> and <strong>inhibit the parasympathetic nervous systems from bringing the pressure back up to normal</strong>. Specifically, the vasomotor center increases the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system, causing the arterioles to narrow, increasing the total peripheral arterial resistance and constriction of veins. This increases more blood return to the heart. <strong>Increased venous return</strong> means more preload, which also increases cardiac output. &#160;Meanwhile, the cardiac accelerator center in the medulla is also stimulated, increasing the heart rate and contractility. In contrast, the cardiac decelerator center is deactivated, reducing the parasympathetic effects on the heart, which speeds up the heart rate.

Afterward, each T-cell undergoes <strong>positive selection</strong> in the thymic cortex, which involves testing the ability of the T-cell to bind with MHC I and II receptors on the surface of thymic cortex cells.

In contrast, T-cells that fail to bind with MHC receptors will undergo apoptosis. &#160; <br><br>The next step involves <strong>negative selection</strong>, which helps ensure the thymus is not producing self-reactive T-cells. This stage occurs in the thymic medulla, which expresses the <strong><em>AIRE&#160;</em>gene</strong> and enables the cells to express antigens generally found in other body organs (e.g., bones, ovaries, pancreas). It essentially allows the thymus to serve as a microcosm of the entire body. T-cells that bind self-antigens undergo apoptosis.

The most significant Rh antigen is the <strong>D antigen. &#160; <br></strong><br>Rh-positive people can <strong>receive </strong>both <strong>Rh-negative and Rh-positive blood</strong> since they do not have antibodies against the Rh glycoprotein. But if an <strong>Rh-negative</strong> person receives Rh-positive blood, they could develop a <strong>hemolytic transfusion reaction.</strong> That's why hospitals do not typically give Rh-positive blood to Rh-negative patients. It can be done in an emergency because these individuals don't have naturally occurring Rh antibodies since they require exposure to Rh-positive RBCs (prior blood transfusion recipient or pregnant women carrying a fetus with Rh-positive blood). So, for someone who doesn&#8217;t have Rh antibodies, Rh-positive blood might be okay the first time, but then they'll develop antibodies and won't be able to receive Rh-positive blood in the future. &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/8gajD1USSF6cHu9CdP0hG5hvRpmY9Frg/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Type AB positive &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This answer choice is incorrect.

During the maturation process, B cells (and T cells) undergo VDJ rearrangement, randomly altering the variable (antibody-binding) region of the B cell and T cell receptors. Activated B cells within the spleen and lymph nodes also undergo <strong>somatic hypermutation</strong> and subsequent <strong>affinity maturation.</strong> When these activated B cells bind to an antigen, they express CD40, which binds to the CD40 ligand from nearby T cells. This binding causes the T cells to secrete cytokines which induce an enzyme in B cells called AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase). AID then replaces many cytidine nucleotides with uridine in single strands of DNA within the B cell receptor (BCR) variable region. These uridine nucleotides are then &#8220;repaired&#8221; via base excision or mismatch repair, eventually leading to a strand of DNA different from the original. As replication of this activated B cell progresses, this somatic hypermutation occurs many times in many different ways, presenting a slightly different antigen-binding site (variable region) in each daughter cell. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The daughter B cells with a stronger affinity to the original antigen will bind to it more strongly than other daughter B cells. These daughter B cells will then go on to replicate, allowing more and more B cells with a strong affinity to develop. The B cells that developed BCR with less affinity during this random process will eventually die out as they cannot compete with the affinity of the other daughter B cells. This entire process is referred to as <strong>affinity maturation</strong>, as over time, the affinity of the BCR to the antigen matures and becomes stronger. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Isotype switching &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Isotype switching refers to a change within the constant region (Fc) of a B cell receptor or antibody, causing B cell receptors or antibodies to convert between IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM.

      "solution": "The action potential is electrical activity across the cell membrane. In the heart, two distinct types of action potentials occur in 2 different types of cells, the pacemaker cells, and the cardiac myocytes. <br><br>The myocytes are the contractile units of the heart and make up the myocardium. Their action potential is characterized by 5 different phases: <br><br><strong>Phase 4</strong>: Also known as the <strong>resting phase</strong>. It is the initial phase where the ion channels are mainly closed and the membrane potential is resting at -90 mV. Because of the presence of gap junctions between the myocytes, some positive ions leak from neighboring cells that are depolarized (mainly calcium ions) bringing the membrane potential up to -70 mV, which is the threshold potential for depolarization.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Heu5sSXxSpaRLYftHRLfEfJdTTi3QiOS/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><strong>Phase 0</strong>: This is known as the <strong>depolarization phase</strong>. When the membrane potential reaches the threshold (-70 mV), the <strong>voltage-gated sodium channels</strong> open and the rapid influx of sodium into the cells brings the membrane potential up to +20 mV.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/F-nhk1IPQ3KwFThNnBRs0WowTTCvkb0S/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><strong>Phase 1</strong>: the <strong>initial repolarization phase</strong>. After the membrane potential of myocytes reaches +20 mV, depolarization ends and the sodium channels close. This is followed by the opening of the <strong>voltage-gated potassium channels</strong>. The efflux of potassium towards the outside of the cell causes the membrane potential to drop until phase 2 starts. The initial repolarization is responsible for the notch seen in the myocytes action potential.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/rjLvSlzITd6tdUGLgwEQVb9cQD2OzDhl/_.png\"></div><br><strong>Phase 2</strong>: the <strong>plateau phase</strong>. Shortly after the opening of the voltage-gated potassium channels in phase 1, <strong>voltage-gated calcium channels</strong> open and allow calcium ions to influx into the cells. In this phase, the inward current by calcium ions balances the outward current of potassium channels, and the membrane potential stabilizes, thus called the plateau phase. This phase is important in the myocyte action potential because it is responsible for the length of the action potential and the calcium influx is what actually causes the myocytes to <strong>contract</strong>. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/5F8EpLwuTNOmoDy5uSVTpoXFS1a-fGFT/_.png\"></div><br><strong>Phase 3</strong>: the <strong>repolarization phase</strong>. Here the voltage-gated calcium channels close while the voltage-gated potassium channels remain open, and the potassium continues to efflux outside the cell bringing the membrane potential back to the resting potential (-90 mV), thus, marking the end of the action potential. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/BVi7nkx2Rhauuw_ft8a_QFo-RmSvGM77/_.png\"></div><br>Finally, few notable differences can be made between the action potentials of myocytes and skeletal muscles. First of all, myocytes are electrically coupled with gap junctions, while skeletal muscle cells are not. Additionally, the plateau phase in myocytes action potentials is absent in skeletal muscle action potentials.

After spontaneous depolarization in the SA node, the action potential spreads throughout the atria through the atrial conduction fibers at a rate of 1 ms, allowing the atria to contract together.<br><br>After that, the wave reaches the atrioventricular (AV) node in order to reach the ventricles. The <strong>AV node has the lowest conduction velocity in the entire heart</strong> at a rate of 0.1-0.5 ms. This is beneficial to allow the atria to contract and fill the ventricles before ventricular depolarization and contraction starts.<br><br>After that, the conduction travels through <strong>the His-Purkinje system, which has the highest conduction velocity of the heart</strong> (around 2-4 ms). This fast conduction allows the depolarization wave to reach both ventricles at the same time, allowing for coordinated contraction of the ventricles. Finally, within the ventricles, the conduction velocity is around 1 ms. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/2WGR4s8eQkCyzNqxKiVB95EBRO2GEV7k/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ His-Purkinje system &gt; atria &gt; ventricles &gt; AV node:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Atria &gt; ventricles &gt; His-Purkinje system &gt; AV node &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The fastest area of conduction in the heart is the His-Purkinje system. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ventricles &gt; atria &gt; His-Purkinje system &gt; AV node:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The fastest area of conduction in the heart is the His-Purkinje system. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ AV node &gt; ventricles &gt; atria &gt; His-Purkinje system:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The fastest area of conduction in the heart is the His-Purkinje system, while the AV node is the slowest. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ AV node &gt; atria &gt; ventricles &gt; His-Purkinje system:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The fastest area of conduction in the heart is the His-Purkinje system, while the AV node is the slowest. &#160;</span></div>",

Active vitamin D starts out as either vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), which is derived from dietary plant sources, or vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), which is either derived from dietary animal products but can also be made in skin cells that are exposed to sunlight. &#160; <br><br>When vitamin D2 and D3 reach the small intestine, they get packaged along with bile salts into micelles, which get absorbed into the enterocytes. They are then incorporated into chylomicrons, which travel through the lymphatic system to enter the blood. In the blood, they bind vitamin D-binding proteins, which take them to the liver. In the <strong>hepatic endoplasmic reticulum</strong>, vitamin D2 and D3 are converted to <strong>25-hydroxy ergocalciferol</strong> and <strong>25-hydroxycholecalciferol</strong>, respectively, by the enzyme <strong>25-hydroxylase</strong>. These re enter the blood and travel to the<strong>&#160;proximal tubules of the kidneys</strong>, where the enzyme<strong>&#160;1-alpha-hydroxylase&#160;</strong>converts 25-hydroxy ergocalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to <strong>1,25-dihydroxy ergocalciferol</strong> and<strong>&#160;1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol</strong>, respectively, which are the active forms of vitamin D. &#160; <br><br>In the skin, keratinocytes produce 7-dehydrocholesterol, a precursor molecule for cholecalciferol. When the skin is exposed to sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol absorbs ultraviolet B radiation and is converted to previtamin D3 via photolysis. Then, heat generated by cellular metabolic activities causes the previtamin D3 molecule to isomerize (change its shape) to form vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol. The vitamin D3 molecules then enter the blood, and follow the same path as dietary cholecalciferol to the liver, and then to the kidneys. &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/2a3H1NukQvytG324ahHC9aszRna0NYMO/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cholecalciferol &#8594; 25-hydroxycholecalciferol &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The conversion of cholecalciferol to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol by 25-hydroxylase takes place in the liver. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ 25-hydroxycholecalciferol &#8594; 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ergocalciferol &#8594; 25-hydroxyergocalciferol &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The conversion of ergocalciferol to 25-hydroxyergocalciferol by 25-hydroxylase takes place in the liver.

      "solution": "The ear contains the <strong>organ of Corti</strong> which is responsible for transforming sound waves into electrical impulses. This organ is mechanically coupled to the external environment by the tympanic membrane and the middle ear ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes). Pressure changes in the external auditory meatus, resulting from sound waves, cause the tympanic membrane to vibrate. These vibrations are transferred to the oval window. The <strong>middle ear amplifies</strong> the force of sound waves because the <strong>oval window has a smaller surface area than that of the tympanic membrane</strong>. When the vibration of the oval window causes a traveling wave in the basilar membrane, hair cells are pushed against the tectorial membrane. Each frequency leads to vibrations at specific locations on the basilar membrane&#8211;that is, <strong>low frequencies</strong> are heard at the <strong>apex&#160;</strong>near the helicotrema (wide and flexible) and <strong>high frequencies</strong> are heard best at the<strong>&#160;base of the cochlea&#160;</strong>(thin and rigid). &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-WltEeFBRGunKQ7SOlfwhzvZQQiHThcU/_.png\"></div><br><br>Hair cells have a tall <strong>kinocilium </strong>at one edge of the cell, which is surrounded by approximately 100 stereocilia. Deformation of the stereocilia toward the large kinocilium results in the opening of mechanically gated cation channels. The resulting entry of potassium (K+) from the <strong>K+-rich endolymph</strong> causes depolarization of the hair cell and Ca2+ entry. The release of neurotransmitters by exocytosis from the base of the cell excites the neurites of the auditory neurons. Axons of the auditory nerve synapse first in the cochlear nuclei of the medulla. Many second-order neurons pass via the lateral lemniscus directly to the inferior colliculi, whereas others synapse in the superior olivary nucleus of the pons first. Third- (or fourth-) order neurons pass from the inferior colliculus to the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, where the signal is relayed via the white matter of the acoustic radiation to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The outer hair cells are responsible for the transduction of sound &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The inner hair cells are responsible for the transduction of sound. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The scala vestibuli and scala tympani are both filled with endolymph &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The scala vestibuli and scala tympani are both filled with perilymph, which has a similar composition to other extracellular fluids.

Gynecomastia is defined as benign proliferation of the glandular breast tissue in males. It differs from the female breast development by the lack of terminal alveolar development in response to progesterone. Patients typically present with a mass or ridge of glandular tissue that is symmetrically distributed around the nipple. It may be tender or asymmetric. Gynecomastia can be physiologic or pathologic, primary (e.g. Klinefelter syndrome) or secondary (e.g. drugs). The vast majority of gynecomastia cases in children and adolescents are physiologic. &#160;<br><br><strong>Neonatal breast hypertrophy &#12540;&#160;</strong>This occurs in both boys and girls during the neonatal period and is thought to be related to placental transformation of androgens to estrogens, which stimulate glandular proliferation in the fetus.

Gynecomastia peaks during mid-puberty, coinciding with peak height velocity at age 12 to 14 years, and Tanner stage 3 to 4. The pathogenesis is thought to be related to an imbalance in the androgen-to-estrogen ratio, in which a relative increase in extratesticular production of estrogen may play a role in the development of gynecomastia. While most cases of physiologic pubertal gynecomastia resolve spontaneously (typically one year of onset), management is individualized and based on the degree of psychosocial distress.

      "solution": "This question is asking how changes in stroke volume and arterial compliance will affect pulse pressure. <br><br><strong>Pulse pressure</strong> is defined as the difference between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Pulse pressure is directly proportional to <strong>stroke volume</strong> and inversely proportional to <strong>arterial compliance</strong>. An increase in stroke volume means more blood is ejected from the heart, which would result in an increased SBP and pulse pressure. Similarly, a decrease in vascular compliance means the ejected blood is pushing against a stiff vascular wall, which would also increase SBP and pulse pressure. <br><br>These physiological parameters can be illustrated via some clinical scenarios. One example is aortic <strong>stiffening</strong>, which can be due to natural aging or secondary to arteriosclerosis. The condition will lead to <strong>decreased arterial compliance</strong>. As a result, SBP will increase whereas DBP, which is determined by total peripheral resistance (provided chiefly by the arterioles), will remain largely unchanged.<br><br>As an aside, it is worth mentioning that in patients with significant aortic changes following chronic hypertension, stiffening of the aorta reduces the elastic reservoir capacity, and more blood runs off from each stroke volume during systole, which results in a reduced blood volume within the aorta at the onset of diastole, resulting in lower DBP.<br><br>Another example is <strong>aortic stenosis</strong>. In this condition, narrowing of the aortic valve interferes with the ejection of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta and results in <strong>decreased stroke volume</strong>.

It has two different cycles: the <strong>ovarian cycle</strong> and the <strong>endometrial cycle</strong>. The phases of the uterine cycle include:<br><br>-<strong>Proliferative phase</strong> (corresponds to ovarian follicular phase): Following the menstrual period, high estrogen levels (produced by ovarian follicles) stimulate endometrial thickening and growth of endometrial glands. In addition, there is a slight growth of spiral arteries (due to the influence of estrogen), which help supply the growing functional endometrium. Rising estrogen levels also make the cervical mucus more hospitable to incoming sperm.

      "solution": "The immune system helps defend the body against infections and foreign molecules. It is made up of 2 parts: the <strong>innate </strong>and the<strong> adaptive immune responses. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>The innate immune system is the first-line defense against pathogens invading the body. The innate immune system is made of immune cells, which are <strong>macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, </strong>and <strong>natural killer cells.</strong> In addition, it also includes other non-immune parts like the physical barrier of the <strong>skin</strong> and the secretions and enzymes in the body (e.g. gastric acid). The innate immune system is non-specific, which means that it responds in the same way to different pathogens. One of the features of this system is that it is fast and the immune cells can destroy the foreign body or pathogen within hours of entering the body. However, one of the drawbacks of the innate immune system is the lack of memory, and therefore will not be able to recognize an antigen or a foreign body if encountered again and will respond exactly the same as the first encounter of such antigen. &#160; <br><br>Innate immunity against pathogens relies on the<strong> pattern recognition receptors</strong> (PRR) which recognizes and detects a wide range of pathogens that share common structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Once they recognize PAMPs, the innate immune cells are able to destroy the pathogens immediately. Examples of PAMPs include lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the surface of gram-negative bacteria as well as flagellin on the surface of bacteria. These PAMPs are found on the cell surface of the pathogen and therefore surface PRR will be able to recognize them. Additionally, intracellular PRR are able to recognize intracellular PAMPs like viral DNA or RNA. &#160; <br><br>On the other hand, the <strong>adaptive immune response</strong> is made of <strong>lymphocytes </strong>and <strong>antibodies</strong>. It is specific against every single pathogen and this leads to a slower reaction than that of innate immunity. However, adaptive immune cells (lymphocytes) are able to form <strong>memory cells</strong>, and once a pathogen is encountered again, a much <strong>stronger and faster response occurs. </strong>The adaptive immune cells are capable of secreting immunoglobulins (i.e. antibodies) and cytokines that help modulate the immune response. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ The complement system is part of the innate immune system &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The adaptive immune system cells have receptors that recognize surface structures shared between different pathogens but not found on the surface of their own body cells &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Unlike the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system is specific and recognizes each different pathogen by its specific antigens. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ All the cells of the lymphoid lineage are part of the adaptive immune system &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Natural killer cells originate from the lymphoid lineage, but they are part of the innate immune system. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The innate immune system is able to mount a stronger immune response when encountering a pathogen for the second time. &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Unlike the adaptive immune system, the innate immune system does not have memory cells.

      "solution": "Action potentials in the heart start in the pacemaker cells, and the most common location is the sinoatrial (SA) node given their automaticity and ability to fire action potentials on their own at a higher rate than any other part of the heart. After the pacemaker cells in the SA node initiate an action potential, it travels through the conduction system to the myocytes of the atria and the ventricles causing them to contract. <br><br>First, the wave spreads to the atria through the fast conducting system called the atrial internodal tract, which ensures that the action potential spreads to the right and left atria, and to all cells within each atria at almost the same time, and therefore, the atria contracts at the same time ejecting blood into the ventricles.<br><br>At the same time, the action potential is also sent to the atrioventricular node (AV node) to reach the heart. In the AV node there is a notable slowing in the propagation of the action potential into the ventricles. This delay is due to two reasons: 1. The AV nodal cells are small in diameter, and therefore more resistant to electrical current 2. The AV node depolarization is mediated by the influx of calcium ions, not sodium ions. Calcium influx is slower than sodium influx and, therefore, delays the action potential.<br><br>Because the AV node is the place where the action potential travels from the SA node and the atria into the ventricles, this conduction delay is very important. It is this delay that allows the ventricles to fill completely before they depolarize and contract, thus maintaining the stroke volume and cardiac output.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/bLcCfEtzSH_nonRVIdK6DqHvRVmC_pqB/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Decreased left ventricular stroke volume &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased left ventricular stroke volume:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: If the delay in the AV node is eliminated, it will give less time for the ventricles to fill, thus causing decreased ventricular stroke volume. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased cardiac output &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: If the delay between atrial contraction and ventricular contraction is shortened, it will give less time for the ventricles to fill, thus causing decreased cardiac output. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased left atrial end-diastolic pressure &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Because the atria will have less time to completely eject blood in the ventricles, some blood will remain in the atria, and therefore, the atrial end-diastolic pressure is expected to increase. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: If the delay in the AV node is eliminated, it will give less time for the ventricles to fill, thus causing decreased LVEDV. &#160;</span></div>",

C1 has 3 components: C1q, C1r, and C1s. C1q has no enzymatic activity but has a site that binds the Fc portion of the antibody when it is bound to an antigen. On the other hand, C1r and C1s both have serine protease activity but are inactive in normal states. The classical pathway starts when C1q binds to the Fc portion of an antibody bound to an antigen causing conformational changes in the structure of C1, exposing the C1s and C1r, where they can now function. Next, the activated C1 cleaves C2 into C2a and C2b; and C4 into C4a and C4b. C2b and C4b join together and bind to the surface of the pathogen, forming a complex called C4bC2b, or C3 convertase. C3 convertase then cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b where C3b functions as an opsonin. However, a small amount of C3b formed join the C4bC2b on the surface of the antigen forming a new complex called C4bC2bC3b, which is also known C5 convertase, which then cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. Finally, C5b activates C6 to C9 and this complex (C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9) forms what is known as the <strong>membrane attack complex</strong> and causes lysis of the cell membrane of the pathogen. &#160; <br><br>The lectin-binding pathway starts with a protein called mannose-binding lectin protein, which binds mannose on the surface of microbes (e.g. bacteria) and gets activated. Once activated, mannose-binding lectin protein functions like the activated C1 by cleaving C4 and C2 forming C4b2b complexes (C3 convertase). The rest of the pathway is similar to the classical pathway. &#160; <br><br>Finally, there is the alternative pathway. Normally, there is a small amount of C3 that gets cleaved spontaneously into C3a and C3b without the need for C3 convertase. In case a pathogen was present, this C3b binds to the surface of the pathogen. Once it does, a protein called factor B joins C3b on the surface of the pathogen and gets cleaved (by a factor called factor D) into 2 subunits Aa and Bb. Bb remains attached to C3b and together they function as C3 convertase, thus amplifying the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cleavage of C2 and C4 to form C3 convertase &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cleavage of C3 to form C3a and C3b &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Mannose-binding lectin protein, activated by binding mannose, functions like activated C1 and cleaves C2 and C4.

      "solution": "This question is asking which of the listed changes will lead to an increase in cardiac contractility. Among the answer choices, only an elevation in intracellular calcium levels will increase <strong>cardiac contractility</strong>. <br><br>Cardiac contractility is a measure of the strength with which cardiomyocytes contract. Factors that <strong>increase intracellular calcium</strong> will stimulate cardiac contractility. Examples of such factors include:<br><br><strong>1) Sympathetic stimulation</strong> activates &#946;1-receptors. This change promotes downstream phosphorylation of proteins like <strong>sarcolemmal calcium channels</strong> on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane, increasing SR&#8217;s ability to release calcium. Furthermore, sympathetic stimulation promotes phospholamban phosphorylation, a protein found on the SR membrane that regulates calcium ATPase. This change increases calcium ATPase activity, bringing more calcium into the SR. Thus, more calcium can be released during subsequent depolarizations. Finally, phosphorylation of plasma membrane <strong>L-type calcium channels</strong> will increase their permeability, allowing more extracellular calcium entry into the cardiomyocyte.<br><br><strong>2) Increased heart rate</strong> means more action potentials per unit of time. Each action potential&#8217;s inward calcium influx increases the total calcium that enters the cell. With more significant amounts of calcium within the cell, the sarcoplasmic reticulum also accumulates more calcium for subsequent action potentials.<br><br><strong>3) Inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump</strong> will indirectly decrease the activity of the <strong>Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca2<sup>+</sup> exchanger</strong> and result in increased intracellular calcium levels.

      "solution": "The monthly <strong>menstrual cycle</strong> averages around 28 days and begins on the first day of menstruation. It has two different cycles: the <strong>ovarian cycle</strong> and the <strong>endometrial cycle</strong>. The phases of the ovarian cycle include:<br><br>-<strong>Follicular phase</strong> (corresponds to menstrual and proliferative phases of the endometrium): It refers to the first 2-weeks of a four-week cycle. After days 1-7 of the menstrual cycle, low levels of estradiol and progesterone allow GnRH pulses to induce secretion of increasing amounts of FSH, which then initiate the development of several ovarian follicles. As the follicles grow and estrogen is released into the bloodstream, increased estrogen levels act as negative feedback on FSH secretion.<br><br>As a result, some of the developing ovarian follicles will stop growing, regress, and die off. However, one dominant follicle will continue to grow and undergo ovulation. It secretes estrogen, making the pituitary more responsive to the pulsatile action of GnRH from the hypothalamus. The pituitary in response secretes FSH and LH. This surge (LH surge) usually happens a day or two before ovulation (around day 14) and is responsible for stimulating ovarian follicle rupture and the release of the oocyte.<br><br>-<strong>Luteal phase</strong> (corresponds to secretory phase of the endometrium): Following ovulation (day 14), the remnant of the ovarian follicle becomes the corpus luteum. The luteinized granulosa cells secrete more progesterone than estrogen during the luteal phase. <br><br>Progesterone acts as a negative feedback signal on the pituitary, decreasing the release of FSH and LH. It also secretes inhibin, which similarly inhibits the release of FSH and LH. These changes result in a decline in estrogen levels and a rise in progesterone levels. If the oocyte is not fertilized, the corpus luteum gradually degenerates into the nonfunctional corpus albicans that do not make hormones. Eventually, estrogen and progesterone levels decrease, leading to the beginning of a new menstrual cycle.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/eYl7chP2TTm_vw3tPOoPtz6RSryv8W_a/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Production of estrogen and inhibin during ovulation results in a decline in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: During the mid-follicular phase, follicles produce greater amounts of estrogen and inhibin.

      "solution": "Pacemaker cells are where the action potential of the heart starts; therefore, they are responsible for setting the rhythm and the rate of the heart. These cells continuously generate action potentials that are then conducted to the rest of the heart. The most important pacemaker cells are the <strong>sinoatrial (SA) nodes located in the right atrium</strong> near the opening of the superior vena cava. Additionally, the atrioventricular (AV) node is a small structure in the heart, near the coronary sinus on the interatrial septum, which also contains pacemaker cells. Other pacemaker cells are also found in the internodal tract, the Bundle of His, and the Purkinje fibers.<br><br>The action potential in the pacemaker cells is different from the rest of the heart, and is divided into 3 main phases: phase 4, phase 0, and phase 3.<br><br><strong>Phase 4, also known as the pacemaker phase</strong>, is unique to the pacemaker cells. In this phase, there is a <strong>gradual depolarization</strong> due to the <strong>slow influx of sodium ions</strong> into the cells through the &#160;hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN channel); these may sometimes be referred to as the &#8220;funny&#8221; current (If). This slow influx of sodium brings the membrane potential from -65 mV to the threshold of the pacemaker cells -40 mV. <strong>The slope of this phase determines the heart rate</strong>.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/q1GCnBVoShWDIRz7kXoY0jroT8mTtUxN/_.png\"></div><br><strong>Phase 0, is the depolarization phase</strong>. Once the action potential of the pacemaker reaches the threshold of -40 mV, <strong>voltage-gated calcium channels</strong> open and the influx of calcium ions into the cells causes depolarization and brings the membrane potential up to +10 mV. Note that the <strong>depolarization of the pacemaker cells is due to the influx of calcium ions, and not sodium ions unlike the myocardial cells</strong>.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/2DgE7q__RdyV3rTp6VWkjgGpQv6_VmrW/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><strong>Phase 3, is the repolarization phase</strong>. Finally, once depolarization is complete, the voltage-gated calcium channels close and the <strong>potassium channels open</strong>. This results in a rapid efflux of potassium ions outside the cells bringing the membrane potential back to -65 mV or even lower. During this phase, both the HCN channels bringing sodium ions in and the potassium channels bringing potassium ions out of the cell are open; however, because much more potassium ions leave than sodium enters the cell, the membrane potential drops. After phase 3 is done, the action potential is complete, and the cell enters phase 4 again to start a new action potential. <br>&#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/kD1fddyNQfC6orEZ3m0vT_ROQw_xwP-M/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Influx of sodium ions into the cell &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Influx of calcium ions into the cell &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Depolarization of the pacemaker cells (phase 0) is due to the influx of calcium ions into the cells.

      "solution": "B cells and T cells both undergo <strong>V(D)J rearrangement</strong> during the cell maturation process to promote diversity among antigen-binding at the variable regions of the B cell and T cell receptors. Within the variable regions of the B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR), the hypervariable region is created when the two chains of the receptor bind together to form the final antigen-binding site. Within these hypervariable regions, V(D)J rearrangement occurs extensively. This process starts with beta-chains in T cells and heavy chains in B cells, where random V, D, and J regions are combined with random nucleotides between them. These resultant cells with incomplete receptors are then tested with multiple other chains (alpha-chains for T cells and light chains for B cells) to ensure they are functional and not self-reactive. Alpha-chains (T cells) and light chains (B cells) only contain V and J regions, so they undergo a similar process but without any D genes. This eventually leads to a pool of immune cells with one chain containing a wide variety of VDJ combinations, which is paired with a wide variety of other chains containing a wide variety of VJ combinations. &#160; <br><br>The actual process of V(D)J rearrangement is accomplished via several important enzymes, including recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1), RAG2, Artemis, Ku DNA-protein-kinase, terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT), and others.

      "solution": "This patient has <strong>physiologic jaundice of the newborn</strong>, a common condition that manifests within 2-7 days after birth. The condition is often seen in preterm infants and Asian newborns. &#160;<br><br>Physiologic jaundice of the newborn is caused by three factors. First, fetal erythrocytes have<strong>&#160;shorter lifespans</strong>. As a result, more unconjugated bilirubin gets produced. Second, newborn livers have<strong>&#160;immature UDP-glucuronyl transferase&#160;</strong>that is inefficient in conjugating bilirubin. Third, there is<strong>&#160;increased enterohepatic circulation</strong> of bilirubin. This phenomenon is because there is a lower concentration of bacteria in neonatal digestive tracts, and therefore there is less intestinal bacterial conversion of conjugated bilirubin to urobilin, which is excreted via urine. As a result, more conjugated bilirubin is broken down into unconjugated bilirubin by beta-glucuronidase (an intestinal enzyme) and reabsorbed. &#160;<br><br>Physiologic jaundice of the newborn is usually a<strong> benign condition</strong> that resolves in 1-2 weeks. Most cases do not require treatment. In severe cases, treatment with <strong>non-UV phototherapy </strong>is used to isomerize unconjugated bilirubin into a water-soluble form that can be excreted via urine. This therapy prevents <strong>kernicterus</strong>, which occurs when large amounts of unconjugated bilirubin deposit in the brain and cause neurological damage. &#160; <br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Destruction of neonatal erythrocytes by maternal antibodies:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This describes ABO and Rh-incompatibility. Both of these conditions occur when maternal antibodies cross the placenta and attack fetal red blood cells, resulting in their lysis.

This leads to increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin and an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. However, this patient is producing 6-7 wet diapers per day, which indicates that he is well-hydrated and successfully breastfeeding. A helpful tip in determining the minimum number of wet diapers in the first week of life is that it is usually equivalent to the number of days since birth (e.g. a 5-day-old infant should produce 5 wet diapers/day).&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Breakdown of blood accumulated under the scalp&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Breakdown of blood in a cephalohematoma can cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

The murmur results from regurgitation of blood due to malaligned valve margins secondary to prolapse. The click is caused by the sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae as they are pulled tight by the ballooning valve leaflets.<br><br>In patients with MVP, there is a set left ventricular (LV) size during systole at which prolapse occurs. Therefore, maneuvers that change the LV end-diastolic volume affect the timing of the click and the murmur. <strong>Decreases in LV volume</strong> (e.g. secondary to decreased preload during the straining phase of Valsalva) reduce the tension and increase the slack in the mitral valve apparatus. Because the ventricular walls are closer, they reach the critical LV size earlier, leading to an <strong>earlier systolic click</strong>. The opposite is also true, i.e. increases in LV volume (e.g. secondary to increased preload during squatting) increase the distance between ventricular walls, thereby taking more time to reach the critical LV size, as a result of which prolapse occurs later in systole or not at all. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Decrease in left ventricular volume:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased blood flow through an abnormal valve:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Murmurs that increase in intensity due to increased blood flow include murmurs produced due to stenotic and regurgitant valves (e.g. mitral regurgitation).

      "solution": "<strong>Estrogen</strong> is a female sex hormone produced mainly by the ovaries. The estrogen receptors are members of the superfamily of steroid hormone receptors found primarily in the nucleus. &#160; <br><br><strong>Pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone</strong> (GnRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the pulsatile pituitary release of<strong>&#160;luteinizing hormone</strong> (LH) and<strong>&#160;follicle-stimulating hormone&#160;</strong>(FSH). Both FSH and LH stimulate ovarian production of estradiol and progesterone. The variations in pulsatile release of the gonadotropins result in a cyclic response of ovarian function. Each cycle lasts 28 days and can be divided into two phases of 14 days each. During the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, estrogen makes the superficial layer of the uterus (endometrium) thicken up and sprout progesterone receptors. It also acts as a negative feedback signal, making the pituitary secrete less FSH as estrogen levels rise. &#160; <br><br>Right before ovulation, the markedly high estrogen levels make the pituitary much more sensitive to the actions of hypothalamic GnRH. These changes result in a positive feedback signal, leading to a massive surge of FSH and LH that leads to <strong>ovulation</strong>. &#160; <br><br>During the luteal phase, progesterone binds to receptors in the endometrium and stimulates the endometrial glands to produce more secretions, which prepare the uterus for a potential pregnancy. Progesterone acts as a negative feedback signal during the luteal phase - making the pituitary secrete less LH. In turn, the levels of progesterone decrease as well, and menstruation follows. &#160; <br><br>Estrogen promotes the development of <strong>internal/external genitalia, endometrial proliferation,&#160;</strong>and increases <strong>watery cervical mucus</strong> production. In the ovaries, it exerts potent mitotic effects on granulosa cells. In the breast, estrogen stimulates<strong>&#160;growth and differentiation</strong> of the ductal epithelium, induces mitotic activity of ductal cylindrical cells, and stimulates the growth of connective tissue.

All oogonia either develop into primary oocytes or become atretic (degenerate). The <strong>maximal number of oogonia</strong> is achieved at the <strong>20th week of gestation</strong>, at which time 6 to 7 million oogonia are present in the ovary.

A primary oocyte with its surrounding epithelial cells is called a<strong>&#160;primordial follicle.</strong> Beginning in puberty and extending through the reproductive years, several primordial follicles mature each month into primary follicles. A few of these continue development to secondary follicles. One or two secondary follicles progress to a tertiary or Graafian follicle stage. The first meiotic division completes this stage to produce a haploid secondary oocyte and a polar body. During this process, cytoplasm is conserved by the secondary oocyte. Consequently, the polar body is disproportionately small. The secondary oocyte halts meiosis at <strong>prophase II.</strong> One of the secondary oocytes is then released at ovulation. If the oocyte is fertilized by sperm, completion of the second meiotic division follows. If fertilization fails to occur, the oocyte degenerates before the second meiotic division is completed. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Knb2cp1MRXaqF2Ly0SOiW-ZMTB24HRR-/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The primary oocyte is arrested in metaphase I until puberty:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The primary oocyte is arrested in prophase I until puberty. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pituitary FSH makes the granulosa cells produce more androstenedione:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Pituitary FSH makes the granulosa cells produce more estrogen.

The loop can be divided into four phases: isovolumetric contraction, systolic ejection, isovolumetric relaxation, and ventricular filling.

Hence, the height of the pressure-volume loop will increase. Furthermore, an increase in afterload means less blood can be pumped out of the heart during each beat.
