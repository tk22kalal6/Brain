This condition is most often the result of a direct blow to the external ear &#8211; particularly the components containing cartilage, such as the helix, the antihelix, the concha, tragus, and antitragus. <br><br>The skin overlying the cartilaginous components of the ear is tightly adherent to the underlying perichondrium, which subsequently supplies nutrients to the cartilage below. When trauma occurs to the cartilaginous components of the external ear, blood can accumulate between the perichondrium and cartilage. Without proper drainage, the hematoma acts as a mechanical barrier between the cartilage and its perichondrial blood supply, ultimately resulting in necrosis, fibrosis and neocartilage formation. The result is a cosmetically deformed external ear, known as cauliflower ear. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Subperichondrial space:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ External acoustic meatus &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The external acoustic meatus is a short, curved tube that burrows through the temporal bone and ends at the tympanic membrane.

Afferent signals of the gag reflex are sent via the glossopharyngeal nerve, which is also responsible for sensation in the posterior one-third of the tongue. &#160;<br><br>A reflex arc typically consists of sensory receptors, the afferent sensory nerve that sends an impulse to the central nervous system, and an efferent motor nerve that transmits a motor response.

During a spinal cord transection, <strong>the patient loses all sensation and voluntary movement inferior to the lesion site.</strong> For example, if a transaction occurs between C4 and C5, the patient will lose all motor and sensory functions below this level, rendering them quadriplegic. &#160;If transection happens between C6 and C8, there&#8217;s a complete loss of lower limb function combined with a loss of hand and a variable amount of upper limb function. &#160; <br><br>Damage to specific tracts can also occur via partial spinal cord transection.

The pathogenesis of Zenker diverticulum is not entirely clear, but it is thought to be associated with altered function of the upper esophageal sphincter, esophageal dysmotility, or esophageal shortening. This dysfunction leads to impaired bolus passage and increased intraluminal pressure. As a result, the mucosa and submucosa emerge through a natural area of weakness, the Killian's triangle. In contrast to a Meckel diverticulum, a Zenker diverticulum is a false diverticula which contains only mucosa and submucosa. Patients typically present with complaints of dysphagia, regurgitation, halitosis (bad breath), and occasionally an observed neck mass.

      "solution": "This patient presents with multiple risk factors for developing vitamin B12 deficiency (cobalamin), including <strong>chronic alcohol use</strong> and <strong>metformin</strong> use. Additionally, the physical examination demonstrates dysfunction of the <strong>spinocerebellar, lateral corticospinal, and dorsal column pathways</strong>, consistent with <strong>subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. &#160;&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Several spinal cord pathologies can be identified via a careful neurological examination to reveal the affected spinal cord tract(s). For example, <strong>subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord</strong> results when vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is absent or deficient. It may become deficient due to malabsorptive disease (e.g., Crohn disease, pernicious anemia), dietary restriction (e.g. veganism), or medications that interfere with cobalamin absorption (e.g., metformin, proton pump inhibitors). When physiologic stores of vitamin B12 are low, levels of methylmalonic acid increase, which causes degeneration of the myelin sheath of the <strong>spinocerebellar, lateral corticospinal,&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;dorsal column pathways,</strong> resulting in subacute combined degeneration (SCD). SCD manifests with symptoms of gait ataxia, paresthesias, and impaired position/vibration sense. Furthermore, SCD can cause psychiatric symptoms, including <strong>worsening depression</strong> or signs of <strong>dementia</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Additional noteworthy patterns of spinal cord pathologies include Brown-Sequard syndrome, syringomyelia, and tabes dorsalis. <strong>Brown-Sequard syndrome</strong> is a rare asymmetrical spinal cord injury pattern that occurs following a stab wound, penetrating injury, or, less commonly, fracture or blunt trauma. It results in <strong>ipsilateral loss</strong> of motor function, vibration, and proprioception due to the <strong>dorsal columns and corticospinal tract damage.</strong> In addition, contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation occurs at one or two levels below the lesion due to injury of the <strong>spinothalamic tracts</strong> (which decussate at the anterior commissure). Brown-Sequard syndrome may also be associated with <strong>Horner syndrome</strong> (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) if the lesion occurs <strong>above the T1 level</strong> and causes damage to the <strong>oculosympathetic pathway</strong>. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Syringomyelia</strong> describes a <strong>cystic cavity</strong> within the spinal cord, usually within the <strong>central canal,</strong> that can expand over time and compress the <strong>anterior white commissure,</strong> a structure directly anterior to the cervical canal. The anterior white commissure is the decussation site for the spinothalamic tracts, relaying pain and temperature sensation. As a result, syringomyelia causes a \"<strong>c</strong><strong>ape-like,\" bilateral, symmetrical loss of pain and temperature sensation</strong> in the <strong>upper extremities</strong>. Syringomyelia is associated with Chiari I malformation, a congenital condition characterized by abnormally shaped cerebellar tonsils that herniate below the level of the foramen magnum. &#160; <br><br>Lastly, <strong>tabes dorsalis</strong> arises due to infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by <em>Treponema</em> <em>pallidum</em>, the spirochete that causes syphilis. Tertiary infection of the spinal cord leads to demyelination and degeneration of the <strong>dorsal column and roots,</strong> resulting in findings of gait ataxia and incoordination. The condition takes nearly 20 years to develop after the initial infection. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Spinocerebellar tracts, lateral corticospinal tracts, and dorsal columns &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Anterior white commissure &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Chiari I malformation is characterized by cerebellar tonsillar ectopia and is most commonly associated with a syrinx within the spinal cord.

Any tumor that arises within the pineal gland is termed a pinealoma. The main three tumors that can arise within the pineal gland include germ cell tumors, pineal parenchymal tumors, and gliomas. Germ-cell tumors can secrete hCG, which, in boys, leads to activation of LH receptors on the Leydig cells. This results in <strong>increased testosterone</strong> production and precocious puberty. In girls, hCG-secreting tumors do not cause precocious puberty, because activation of both FSH and LH receptors is required for estrogen production. In girls, however, a urine pregnancy test will be falsely positive. &#160;<br><br>Symptoms of pinealomas may include headaches, lethargy, signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g. papilledema), hydrocephalus and <strong>pretectal syndrome (Parinaud syndrome)</strong>, in which compression of the pretectal area results in a classic constellation of neuro-ocular symptoms including <strong>upward gaze</strong><strong>&#160;limitation, bilateral eyelid retraction</strong> (Collier sign), and <strong>light-near dissociation</strong> (&#8220;Argyll Robinson pupil&#8221;). &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Raphe nucleus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The raphe nucleus is found in the medulla and is responsible for serotonin secretion.

A chest x-ray will demonstrate the apex of the heart in the right chest. &#160;<br><br>It should be noted that when the condition occurs in isolation, dextrocardia is often associated with additional, more severe cardiac anomalies as compared to situs inversus, which is typically benign and often diagnosed incidentally.<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/9eq-xgNzQNqFUvAUrU8NKXwQRWqRk7YW/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Apex of the heart located in the right chest&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Displacement of the tricuspid valve leaflets into the right ventricle&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Ebstein anomaly is caused by in utero exposure to lithium.

This condition typically presents with the head tilted towards the affected side and the chin rotated away from the affected side, limiting the neck&#8217;s range of motion. This posturing is because the condition mimics the action of the sternocleidomastoid, which functions to flex the head toward the side of contraction (in this case, the right) and laterally rotate the head or chin away from the side of the contraction (in this case, the left). &#160;<br><br>Torticollis can be congenital or acquired, as described below:&#160;<ul><li>&#160;<strong>Congenital torticollis</strong> is the most common type of torticollis.

Less common sites of aortic trauma include the ascending aorta, the distal descending aorta at the level of the diaphragm, and the mid-thoracic descending aorta, because these areas of the aorta are more anatomically fixed and thus less subject to movement. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/lJ8RtBe8S6O6Qr1AC2C8FUJ6RE20a5G3/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Aortic isthmus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Distal descending aorta:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>While this is a potential area of trauma, it is less likely to be injured due to its relatively fixed position at the diaphragm. <strong>&#160;</strong>&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sinotubular junction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This location is an uncommon site of injury and is rarely involved in traumatic aortic pathology. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Clavicle&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>While this patient endorses shoulder pain, there is no crepitus on exam, and the patient has full range of motion of the shoulder, making a clavicular injury less likely. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Manubrium&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This patient does endorse retrosternal chest pain; however, no crepitus is appreciated, and there is no evidence of a fracture pattern obtained on the radiograph above. &#160;</span></div>",

Finally, a recovery phase occurs, wherein patients regain shoulder mobility.<br><br>Diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis is primarily clinical, as imaging findings are generally noncontributory, and <strong>radiographs are often normal</strong>.

Peripheral artery disease, a type of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), is caused by insufficient tissue perfusion due to narrowing or occlusion of the aorta or one of the more distal branches supplying the limbs. Similar to coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, the development of an <strong>atherosclerotic plaque</strong> that narrows or completely occludes an artery is the number one cause of peripheral artery disease, and therefore these diseases often exist together. Risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and hyperlipidemia, raise the suspicion for peripheral artery disease. &#160;<br><br>The location of a patient&#8217;s pain can indicate where the occlusion is: &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ot6OYptVSsqc4yF13aBaLJlARyifnzgC/_.png\"></div><br><br>This patient&#8217;s thigh pain, without pain in the hips or buttocks, suggests there is an occlusion in the femoral artery.

Lumbosacral radiculopathy is often caused by nerve root compression due to <strong>disc herniation</strong> or <strong>spondylosis&#160;</strong>(degenerative changes). The compressed nerve carries both sensory and motor fibers. The specific sensory distribution of a single nerve root is termed <strong>dermatome</strong>, while the muscles served by a single spinal nerve root are termed <strong>myotome</strong>.

Anterior epistaxis can usually be managed by pinching the nasal alae together for at least 10 minutes while sitting upright.

It arises from bleeding from the <strong>Woodruff plexus</strong>, a vascular network formed by anastomoses between the sphenopalatine and posterior pharyngeal arteries.

      "solution": "This patient presents with worsening abnormal curvature of the penis with associated erectile dysfunction. In conjunction with his history of Dupuytren contracture, he is likely suffering from <strong>Peyronie disease&#160;</strong>(PD). The pathophysiology of PD is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be initiated by microtrauma followed by local inflammation and <strong>collagen deposition in the tunica albuginea</strong>. PD is most common between the ages of 45&#8211;60 and is associated with conditions such as<strong>&#160;Dupuytren contracture</strong>, diabetes, and in patients following radical prostatectomy.<br><br>The most common findings of PD include penile pain, abnormal penile curvature, and indentation. Nearly 40&#8211;50% of patients present with concurrent<strong>&#160;erectile dysfunction</strong>, resulting in an increased risk of depression, relationship difficulties, and body dysmorphia. Diagnosis is clinical via patient history and penile examination, which demonstrates penile plaque(s) and penile curvature or deformity.<br><br>For patients with mild curvature and normal erectile function, observation is acceptable. If the curvature worsens or results in sexual dysfunction, medical or surgical management is advised. Initial medical management includes oral <strong>pentoxifylline</strong>, which decreases transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-1-mediated fibrosis and prevents deposition of collagen type I. In addition, the FDA approved Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum (CCH) is the first and only agent to receive FDA approval for the treatment of PD. The collagenase produced by the bacteria Clostridium histolyticum degrades both types I and II collagen within the PD plaque.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/bhjiGNY5RhSTgG3lJsfi1UXDSve_Ga86/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ A:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The skin of the penis becomes affected in patients with ulcerative sexually transmitted infections including herpes simplex, syphilis, and haemophilus ducreyi.

In particular, dilation of the <strong>left gastric and azygos veins</strong> contributes to the development of esophageal varices. &#160; <br><br>Patients with esophageal varices can have life-threatening <strong>hematemesis&#160;</strong>if the varices rupture. This complication may occur when eating hard food or during vomiting. In severe cases, patients may develop signs of circulatory insufficiency (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia). &#160;<br><br>Treatment of actively bleeding esophageal varices is with <strong>endoscopic band ligation</strong>, which can also prevent recurrence of hemorrhage. In patients with esophageal varices with non-active bleeding, prophylaxis with a nonselective beta-blocker (e.g. propranolol) can be used; beta-blockers reduce the portal pressure, thereby reducing the risk of future bleeding. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/5N3cRjCBRSKP1TXpaRtlANKVR-m-fg_P/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Short gastric vein:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>&#160;Incorrect: </strong>The short gastric vein is found on the greater curvature of the stomach.

Excitatory signals are also sent to the contralateral medial rectus motor neurons (CN III) via the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), resulting in adduction of the contralateral (left) eye. &#160;<br><br><strong>Horizontal gaze palsy&#160;</strong>is typically caused by either a <strong>contralateral frontal eye field lesion</strong> or an<strong>&#160;ipsilateral PPRF lesion. &#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>The middle cerebral artery supplies the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere. Strokes involving the middle cerebral artery (MCA) can lead to lesions that also involve the frontal eye field.

These findings are consistent with <strong>prepatellar bursitis</strong>.<br><br>Knee bursitis is a common condition that arises secondary to inflammation of bursa sacs surrounding the knee joint. Within the knee there are multiple bursal or fluid-filled synovial sacs that help to lubricate and cushion the skin, tendons, and bones. The commonly inflamed or injured bursa includes the <strong>prepatellar, infrapatellar, suprapatellar, </strong>and <strong>pes anserine bursa</strong>. Prepatellar and infrapatellar bursitis commonly occur in patients with chronic trauma to the anterior knee, such as those involved in professions who spend most of their day on their knees (e.g. plumbers). Suprapatellar bursitis is less common and often arises due to regression failure of the transverse septum formed in embryonic life between the suprapatellar plica and knee joint. The pes anserine bursa is located medially and commonly presents as swelling and pain at the medial aspect of the knee.<br><br>Clinically, knee bursitis presents as pain and swelling of the affected bursa <strong>without significant restrictions in the passive or active range of motion</strong>. The bursae are located extra-articularly, meaning the joint space itself remains unaffected when bursitis ensues. As a result, mobility within the joint itself remains unchanged. Additional clinical features include a preference to hold the knee in extension, warmth, erythema, and tenderness to palpation.

      "solution": "This patient sustained significant blunt force trauma to the abdomen and developed an <strong>acquired diaphragmatic hernia&#160;</strong>(ADH). ADH usually arises due to a sudden increase in pleuroperitoneal pressure resulting from blunt or penetrating trauma. Acquired diaphragmatic hernias occur at sites of weakness in the diaphragm that arise from <strong>embryonic fusion sites</strong>. They almost always occur in the <strong>left hemidiaphragm</strong>. This phenomenon occurs because the right hemidiaphragm is <strong>protected by the large size of the liver. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Hiatal hernias</strong> also occur when gastrointestinal contents protrude into the chest cavity through an opening in the diaphragm. They protrude through the opening in the diaphragm called the hiatus. Hiatal hernias occur when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity. There are two types of hiatal hernias: sliding hernias and paraesophageal hernias. <strong>Sliding hernias</strong> occur when the fundus of the stomach bulges directly into the thoracic cavity. In contrast, <strong>paraesophageal hernias</strong> occur when the gastric fundus bulges into the thoracic cavity adjacent to the esophagus. Sliding hernias are generally asymptomatic and more common than paraesophageal hernias. Paraesophageal hernias have the possibility of strangulation and, as a result, more often warrant surgical repair. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-ILBHZVPQA67VD0VK7RcwU4YSw2X_16g/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased bone mineral density:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient&#8217;s imaging reveals a left-sided diaphragmatic hernia without any evidence of fracture that could have been caused by low bone mineral density in conjunction with trauma.

These findings are suggestive of ovarian torsion, which necessitates urgent intervention. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Ovarian torsion is a common gynecological emergency among women of reproductive age, although it can occur in any age group.<strong>&#160;Clinical symptoms</strong> include sudden onset abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting with or without an adnexal mass. The most important <strong>risk factor</strong> for adnexal torsion is the presence of ovarian cysts or tumors, particularly those greater than 5 cm in size. Ovarian tumors are more common amongst women of reproductive age as most benign tumors (functional cyst, corpus luteum cysts) are associated with hormonal changes and ovulation induction therapy. <strong>Pathogenesis&#160;</strong>of ovarian torsion involves rotation of the ovary around the axis of its ligamentous attachment, the infundibulopelvic ligament. The presence of a large ovarian mass increases the likelihood of torsion. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The <strong>infundibulopelvic ligament/suspensory ligament of the ovary&#160;</strong>attaches the superior pole of the ovary to the pelvic sidewall and contains the ovarian vessels. Rotation around its axis can impair the blood supply to the ovaries, which are detected as decreased blood flow on a doppler USG. Compression of the blood vessels impairs lymphatic and venous drainage and impedes arterial supply. Ovarian edema can progressively worsen and result in ischemia, local hemorrhage, and infarction complications. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Ovarian torsion&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ectopic pregnancy&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> An extrauterine pregnancy is unlikely to cause abdominal pain as her last menstrual period was two weeks ago, and she has a negative pregnancy test. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Tubo-Ovarian abscess&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>A tubo-ovarian abscess would cause fever and leukocytosis, neither of which are present in this patient.

When the palatine tonsils alone are removed, the procedure is referred to as a <strong>tonsillectomy</strong>; when both the palatine tonsils and the pharyngeal tonsils (adenoids) are removed, it is referred to as an <strong>adenotonsillectomy</strong>. Typically, some surrounding connective tissue is also removed during these procedures.<br><br>During this procedure, several structures are at risk of injury, including the <strong>internal carotid artery, glossopharyngeal nerve, and tonsillar artery</strong>. The internal carotid artery lies posterior-lateral to the palatine tonsils and is a source of brisk and difficult to control bleeding when injured intraoperatively. The superior constrictor muscle lies lateral to the palatine tonsil and immediately deep to these muscles.

Together, these findings are concerning for an anterior cruciate ligament tear, best confirmed on physical examination with the <strong>Lachman test</strong>.<br><br>The knee's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most anterior ligamentous component of the knee joint. It prevents the tibia from sliding out in front of the femur and provides rotational stability. The ACL is the most commonly injured ligament in the knee and typically occurs in sports during moments of <strong>rapid deceleration, direction changes, or pivoting on a lower extremity with the foot planted</strong>. Symptoms include the sensation of a &#8220;pop&#8221; or &#8220;tear&#8221; during the injury as well as significant effusion, pain, and sensation of joint instability immediately after the incident.<br><br>Two physical examination techniques with high sensitivity for detecting ACL tears are the <strong>Lachman test</strong> and the <strong>anterior drawer test</strong>. The <strong>Lachman test</strong> involves flexing the knee at 20&#176;with the patient supine. At the same time, the examiner places one hand behind the tibia and the other hand grasps the patient's thigh and pulls the tibia forward. A positive test is indicated by anterior translational of the tibia or a &#8220;soft&#8221; end feel. The anterior drawer test involves the examiner grasping the proximal lower leg below the tibial plateau with the knee in 90&#176;of flexion and attempting to translate the lower leg anteriorly with the patient's foot planted on the examination table. Definitive diagnosis of ACL tear is achieved with MRI. Signs of ACL tear on MRI include swelling, increased signal intensity, fiber discontinuity and abnormal ACL orientation. An empty notch sign which is a fluid signal at the site of femoral attachment at the intercondylar notch may be seen and it denotes avulsion at the femoral attachment. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Lachman test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ober test:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The Ober test is used to evaluate tension in the iliotibial band.

In addition, he likely has concurrent infectious mononucleosis given his symptoms of fatigue, sore throat, and findings of swollen, erythematous tonsils bilaterally with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. In combination, these findings are concerning for a <strong>splenic rupture</strong> and associated <strong>internal bleeding. &#160; &#160; <br></strong><br>The patient experienced <strong>left shoulder pain&#160;</strong>after the tackle and grimaces from left shoulder pain when the legs are elevated. This finding of left shoulder pain from irritation of the left diaphragm is known as the <strong>Kehr Sign</strong>. It is a classic example of<strong>&#160;referred pain.&#160;</strong>The pathophysiology of Kehr Sign is the same as that of other types of referred pain: visceral pain in one location of the body is interpreted as somatic pain in another due to effects of temporal and spatial summation of nerves arising from the same spinal level. &#160; &#160; <br>In this case, splenic rupture and filling of the abdominal cavity with blood irritates the<strong>&#160;inferior surface of the left diaphragm</strong>. Irritation of the underside of the diaphragm is signaled by the <strong>phrenic nerve</strong> which carries pain signals up to spinal nerve levels C3 and C4. The <strong>supraclavicular nerve</strong>, which innervates the skin over the shoulder, also inserts at cervical levels C3 and C4.

A second-degree perineal tear involves injury to the perineal body. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Perineal tears are a common obstetric injury following difficult vaginal childbirth. They are distinct from an episiotomy, an intentional enlargement of the vaginal introitus to facilitate delivery. &#160; <br><br>An episiotomy is a surgical incision that involves the perineum and the posterior vaginal wall during the second stage of labor. Episiotomies are done to minimize perineal injuries caused by overstretching the perineum by the fetal head; however, they are not routinely <strong>indicated</strong>. &#160;Possible indications for an episiotomy include conditions when the physician anticipates a perineal tear, elderly primigravida, macrosomia, face to pubis delivery, forceps/ventouse delivery, breech delivery, or shoulder dystocia. &#160; &#160;<br><br>There are two common <strong>approaches&#160;</strong>to an episiotomy; a mediolateral approach and a median approach. &#160;In a <strong>mediolateral episiotomy,</strong> the incision is made at an angle and proceeds from the vaginal opening diagonally downwards to the left or the right in a straight line that runs an inch away from the anus. &#160;During a mediolateral episiotomy, structures incised include the posterior vaginal wall, superficial and deep transverse perineal muscles, bulbospongiosus, part of the levator ani, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. &#160; <br><br>In the <strong>median episiotomy</strong>, the incision proceeds from the vaginal opening downwards. Median episiotomies bifurcate the perineal body, which supports the female pelvic organs, particularly the posterior vaginal wall. Incision of the perineal body poses a risk of pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence. Midline episiotomies can also extend into the anal sphincter and cause sphincter dysfunction and fecal incontinence. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/uWVZ64HDSceOf5SmIYZBFWjUSv_ARI3k/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/lsAuTeclQO_r3HxUMKV01-nGTomXgFF3/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Perineal body&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Anal mucosa:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Fourth-degree perineal tears involve the anal sphincter complex and the anal mucosa.

Conditions like malignant ovarian tumors may require the ligation of the ovarian arteries in the infundibulopelvic ligament. The course of the ureter in the female pelvis is close to the uterine and ovarian vessels. Ligation of the uterine or ovarian vessels poses the risk of accidental ligation of the ureter. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The ureter lies anterior to the internal iliac artery and then continues posteriorly to the ovary in the ovarian fossa along with the uterine vessels. At this point, the ureter is at risk of injury during an oophorectomy and should be appropriately identified before ligation of the ovarian vessels. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The ureter then descends, crossing the ischial spine until it lies in the inferomedial portion of the broad ligament. In the broad ligament, the uterine artery is anterosuperior to the ureter (&#8220;=the bridge&#8221;) until it crosses the ureter in the lateral portion of the broad ligament. During a hysterectomy, the uterine artery is identified at the junction of the lower uterine segment and the cervix and ligated at the lateral border of the uterus.

      "solution": "This patient presents with a recent history of significant weight loss presents with intermittent gross hematuria and lumbar pain. The abdominal CT scan demonstrates left renal vein compression at its distal segment between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery with mild proximal dilatation. In combination, this presentation is consistent with nutcracker syndrome (NCS). &#160; <br><br>NCS occurs when the <strong>left renal vein,</strong> which drains blood from the left kidney, becomes <strong>squeezed between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)&#160;</strong>and <strong>abdominal aorta</strong>. Normally, the aortomesenteric angle (between SMA and aorta) is around 45 degrees, with the renal vein cushioned by a bit of fat in the mesentery. If there is significant weight loss which shrinks the mesenteric fat, this angle is reduced, and the arteries begin to pinch the left renal vein, causing renal hypertension. Over time, the high pressures cause small breaks in the renal blood vessels. Patients typically present with<strong>&#160;gross hematuria</strong> and <strong>left flank pain</strong> that may improve or worsen depending on positioning. &#160; <br><br>Since the left gonadal vein drains via the left renal vein, nutcracker syndrome can also result in<strong>&#160;left testicular pain</strong> in males or <strong>left lower quadrant pain</strong> in females, especially during intercourse and during menstruation. An unusual manifestation of NCS includes <strong>varicocele&#160;</strong>formation and varicose veins in the lower limbs. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ypqvyLGnT0illKYap83BBonhRe2dICHu/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ureteric stone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Ureteric stones lie within the ureter at any point from the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) to the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ).

Femoral neck fractures are common in older patients, especially those with underlying osteoporosis. They can occur with low energy falls and have a high morbidity and mortality rate. &#160; <br><br>Hip fractures get divided into <strong>intracapsular&#160;</strong>(femoral head and neck) or <strong>extracapsular&#160;</strong>(intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric). Specifically, a femoral neck or head fracture is an intracapsular, displaced fracture that typically occurs following a fall onto the lateral hip. Patients with a displaced femoral neck fracture are generally <strong>unable to bear weight&#160;</strong>on the affected side and present with a<strong>&#160;shortened leg with external rotation</strong> of the affected hip (due to the psoas and iliacus muscle contraction without acetabular counterforce). Notably, intracapsular fractures can be associated with disruption of the blood supply from the <strong>medial circumflex artery</strong>, resulting in <strong>avascular necrosis.</strong> Femoral head fractures are often associated with posterior dislocation of the hip and are at increased risk of sciatic nerve injury. Because of the potential for avascular necrosis with intracapsular fractures arthroplasty with hip replacement is typically the procedure of choice. &#160; <br><br>In contrast, an<strong>&#160;intertrochanteric fracture</strong> is an <strong>extracapsular fracture</strong> that occurs between the greater and lesser trochanters. A subtrochanteric fracture which is defined as a fracture within 5 cm distal to the lesser trochanter is also considered an extracapsular fracture. Clinical presentation is similar to femoral neck fractures. Both fracture patterns require surgical correction (e.g. open reduction with internal fixation) unless the patient is not a good surgical candidate. With extracapsular fractures the blood supply is usually intact and fixation is the procedure of choice. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/aa5TwEsMSjyJ9s9GQwLw-Sb-Rg_OXc5p/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Posterior dislocation of the femoral head:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Posterior dislocation of the femoral head occurs secondary to high-velocity motor vehicle collisions.

Genitourinary fistulas form between the urinary and genital tracts. The transmission can occur between the bladder (vesicovaginal) or urethra (urethrovaginal) and the genital tract. Fistulas in the genital tract can result from obstetric trauma to the vaginal wall (instrumental vaginal delivery), ischemia to the vaginal wall from prolonged and obstructed labor, malignancies of the genital tract, operative injuries (eg, abdominal hysterectomies), or radiation therapy. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In developing countries, the most common cause of fistulas is obstetric trauma.
