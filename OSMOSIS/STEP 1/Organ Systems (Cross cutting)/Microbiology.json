Candidiasis is an opportunistic infection caused by the fungus <em>Candida albicans</em> that most commonly occurs in immunosuppressed hosts (e.g. AIDS, hematologic malignancies). However, this condition can occur in healthy patients who wear dentures, patients with xerostomia (dry mouth), and those treated with antibiotics or inhaled corticosteroids. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Most patients with oral thrush are asymptomatic. However, when symptomatic, patients typically experience a &#8220;<strong>sensation of cotton in their mouth,</strong>&#8221; along with a loss of taste. In some cases, pain during eating and swallowing occurs. Oropharyngeal examination typically reveals white plaques on the buccal mucosa, palate, tongue, or the oropharynx that is <strong>easily scrapable</strong> with an instrument like a tongue depressor. Confirmatory diagnosis can be made by scraping the lesions and performing KOH preparation on the scrapings, which will reveal <strong>budding yeasts with or without hyphae. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Treatment for oral thrush involves <strong>antifungal therap</strong>y (e.g., clotrimazole, fluconazole) for several days.

Hepatitis D, unlike other forms of viral hepatitis, requires co-infection with hepatitis B, since the virus is <strong>dependent on HBsAg for viral entry</strong>. &#160; <br><br><strong>Hepatitis D</strong> is an <strong>RNA delta virus</strong> that is transmitted sexually and parenterally; however, most cases occur via contamination with infected blood products. The virus is composed of a single strand of RNA, without cellular machinery to mediate its own replication and information encoding viral capsid proteins for its progeny.

If universal vaccination against hepatitis B were present, hepatitis D would have no portal for entry, since the vaccine generates antibodies against HBsAg. &#160; <br><br>Often, co-infection with hepatitis B and D occurs at the same time, or it may occur at a later time in patients that are already chronic carriers of hepatitis B.

Given the patient&#8217;s prolonged course of illness, biphasic pattern, and presence of purulent discharge, his presentation is most consistent with <strong>bacterial rhinosinusitis.</strong> The condition is often caused by <strong>Streptococcus pneumoniae.</strong><br><br>Rhinosinusitis is characterized by inflammation and obstruction of sinus drainage through the nasal cavities. <strong>Viral pathogens,</strong> such as rhinovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza viruses, are the most common cause. Bacterial causes of rhinosinusitis include Streptococcus pneumoniae, <strong><em>Haemophiluus influenzae</em></strong>, and<strong><em>&#160;Moraxella catarrhalis</em></strong>.<br><br>As these pathogens infect the nasal mucosa, inflammation follows, causing hypersecretion and increased vascular permeability. These changes result in extravasation of fluids into the nasal cavity and sinuses. Furthermore, many of these pathogens exert direct toxic effect on nasal cilia, impairing mucociliary clearance. Ultimately, this combination of mucosal edema, thickened secretions, and impaired mucociliary clearance results in sinus obstruction.<br><br>Rhinosinusitis can manifest with nasal discharge, sinus fullness or pressure, headache, fever, ear pressure, and loss of smell. In viral rhinosinusitis, symptoms typically <strong>resolve in 7-10 days</strong>.

Diagnosis begins with head imaging (e.g. MRI) that typically demonstrates a solitary, <strong>ring-enhancing lesion</strong>. <strong>Lumbar puncture</strong> is recommended for all patients with suspected HIV-related PCNSL (unless contraindicated), as <strong>EBV DNA</strong> found in the cerebrospinal fluid has a near 100% specificity for PCNSL.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/rX2HN4KmTSChYliJ6tss-QoNSp2XJ_8a/_.png\"></div><br><sup><strong>Image credit \"&gt;Wikimedia commons&#160;</strong>&#160;</sup><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Virally-mediated neoplasm &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reactivation of a parasitic infection &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Cerebral toxoplasmosis occurs in AIDS patients secondary to reactivation of a prior infection with <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>.

The laboratory findings are consistent with <strong>chronic hepatitis B infection</strong>, and he is currently highly infectious given the positive HBeAg titer. Of the replicative mechanisms listed, <strong>reverse transcription of an RNA template into partially double-stranded DNA progeny</strong> describes the replicative mechanism of hepatitis B. &#160; <br><br>Hepatitis B is a <strong>partially double-stranded DNA virus</strong> of the hepadnavirus family. It is transmitted via multiple routes including <strong>parenteral transmission</strong>, <strong>sexual transmission</strong>, as well as <strong>vertical transmission</strong> from mother to fetus. Following inoculation, hepatitis B infects hepatocytes via a bile salt transporter and utilizes cellular DNA polymerase to complete replication of the partially double-stranded (ds) segment of the virus. After this step, the virus uses host RNA polymerase to transcribe a single-stranded RNA template from the dsDNA genome for translation of the viral capsid, DNA polymerase/reverse transcriptase, and associated proteins. Finally, the virus utilizes this DNA polymerase/reverse transcriptase to generate<strong>&#160;partially dsDNA progeny</strong>. &#160; <br><br>After infection, hepatitis B carries an incubation period of approximately 180 days, after which patients may experience a prodrome of symptoms such as malaise, arthralgias, fatigue, rash, or lymphadenopathy.

The first markers to rise in acute hepatitis B infection are HBsAg and HBeAg, which is called the incubation period.

Next, the <strong>window period</strong> occurs, which is when neither hepatitis B surface antigen nor its antibody can be detected in the serum of the patient due to the precipitation of antigen-antibody complexes and their removal from the circulation. During this period, the patient may be infected; however, viral titers are so low that the patient may have negative serological testing for HBsAg, HBcAg, or HBeAg. During this period, the only markers that are positive are either <strong>anti-HBc IgM or anti-HBe</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Recovery is then characterized by detectable levels of anti-HBc IgG, anti-HBs, and anti-HBe.

These findings are concerning for infection by <strong><em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae,</em></strong> which is a common cause of <strong>atypical pneumonia</strong> in children and young adults. The organism is transmitted primarily via respiratory droplets. Therefore, outbreaks frequently occur among individuals<strong>&#160;living in close quarters</strong> (e.g., college students, military recruits). &#160;<br><br>Atypical pneumonia describes an infection of the lung tissue caused by atypical pathogens that are characteristically difficult to isolate using traditional microbiological methods. The classic teaching is that the resulting pneumonia does not result in classic symptoms, such as a productive cough or pleuritic chest pain. Instead, the condition will more often take an<strong>&#160;indolent course</strong>, manifest with a <strong>non-productive cough,&#160;</strong>and can cause various <strong>extrapulmonary symptoms&#160;</strong>(e.g., headaches, arthralgia, confusion).

After infection by a beta-bacteriophage, <em>C. diphtheriae</em> strains become toxigenic and can produce DT. The beta-bacteriophage genome contains tox-genes, which code for diphtheria toxin production. DT has two main subunits, A and B, joined by a disulfide bond.<br><br>The <strong>B subunit helps bind to host cell membranes</strong>. After attaching to the host&#8217;s cells, the whole DT complex gets slowly engulfed by the cell membrane.

The <strong>A subunit</strong> then diffuses through the endosome membrane into the cytoplasm where it interferes with ribosomal protein synthesis. <br><br>This happens because the <strong>A subunit has an ADP-ribose group</strong>, which attaches to elongation factor 2 (EF2), an important ribosomal protein that joins amino acids together during protein synthesis.

The test is performed by injecting glycerol extract from Mycobacterium tuberculosis intradermally on the forearm and then monitoring for a cutaneous immune response 48-72 hours thereafter.

The Shiga/Shiga-like toxin inactivates the <strong>60S ribosomal subunit</strong>, which leads to inhibition of protein synthesis.

Approximately 200 cases occur yearly, and 95% of infections occur in children under the age of five. &#160; <br><br>Polio spreads by <strong>fecal oral transmission.&#160;</strong>After being ingested, the virus replicates in the oropharynx and intestinal mucosal cells. During this time, most patients are asymptomatic, although some may have non-specific symptoms including fever, vomiting, and headache. As viral load increases, the virus enters the blood-stream where it is thought to invade neurons and the central nervous system via retrograde axonal transport to the spinal cord. The virus then replicates in<strong>&#160;motor neurons&#160;</strong>of the<strong>&#160;anterior horn,&#160;</strong>resulting in neuronal death and muscle paralysis. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The disease causes <strong>asymmetric paralysis,</strong> more commonly affecting the lower extremities, and signs of <strong>lower motor neuron disease</strong> (e.g., fasciculations, hypotonia, absent reflexes).

It is a superantigen that results in <strong>major activation of T-cells and macrophages</strong>, thereby causing <strong>massive cytokine release</strong> (cytokine storm). <br><br>Patients with TSS present with <strong>rapid onset fever, hypotension, rash,&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;multiorgan failure</strong>. The rash is a diffuse erythematous rash that resembles sunburn and can lead to desquamation (involving the palms and soles) after one to two weeks. Patients can also have nonspecific signs and symptoms, including gastrointestinal disturbance (e.g., nausea, vomiting), headaches, and fatigue. In addition, organ failure can manifest as liver failure (elevated liver enzymes), coagulopathy (low platelets count), renal failure (elevated creatinine), and neurological manifestations (altered mental status).<br><br>The major risk factor of TSS includes the use of <strong>nasal packing&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;tampons</strong>.

Both <strong>candida and herpes simplex esophagitis</strong> are AIDS-defining illnesses--making a diagnosis of HIV and prompt initiation of antiretroviral therapy paramount to prevent further transmission and opportunistic infection(s). The initial diagnostic screening test for HIV consists of an RT-PCR <strong>antigen-antibody immunoassay</strong> followed by an <strong>HIV virologic load</strong> for confirmatory diagnosis or negative/indeterminate results.<br><br>In acute HIV infection, patients will test positive for antigen-antibody immunoassay with a subsequent negative antibody-only immunoassay and positive virologic load. This occurs because a window period exists between the acquisition of HIV (high viral load) and seroconversion (detection of antibodies against HIV). During this period, immunoassays test for the presence of the p24 antigen, a viral core protein.<br><br>If patients with suspected HIV present with a negative antigen-antibody test and negative viral load, the likelihood of underlying HIV infection is low. However, following high-risk exposures such as needle stick injuries, repeat immunoassays can be obtained six weeks and four months after exposure, along with initiation of antiretroviral therapy.<br><br>After an initial diagnosis, drug resistance testing is mandated and screening for other sexually transmitted coinfections.
