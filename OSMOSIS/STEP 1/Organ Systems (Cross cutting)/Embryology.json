Omphalocele is often associated with <strong>other anomalies</strong>, including chromosomal (e.g. trisomies 13 and 18), syndromic (e.g. Beckwith-Wiedemann) and other structural anomalies (e.g., cardiac, genitourinary, neural tube). This patient has low set ears, micrognathia and clenched fingers, and therefore most likely has <strong>Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18)</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Both gastroschisis and omphalocele are ventral abdominal wall defects, and they can often be confused with each other. However, these are distinct clinical entities, with different presentations, embryologic causes, and outcomes. During embryological development, the four body folds (rostral, caudal, and two lateral folds) fuse to form a normal abdominal wall. <strong>Omphalocele</strong> occurs when<strong>&#160;lateral folds</strong> fail to migrate and fuse at the umbilical ring. This failure causes the abdominal contents to remain <strong>persistently</strong>&#160;<strong>herniated</strong> into the umbilicus instead of returning to the abdominal cavity during the 10th week of embryological development. The abdominal contents are <strong>midline</strong> as they protrude through the umbilicus, and are <strong>covered with peritoneum.</strong>&#160; &#160; <br><br><strong>Gastroschisis</strong> occurs when the abdominal wall fails to close normally, and it is believed to be due to disrupted blood flow to the developing abdominal wall. The intestines are <strong>not covered with peritoneum&#160;</strong>and protrude typically to the <strong>right of the umbilicus.&#160;</strong>This condition is usually an<strong>&#160;isolated defect,&#160;</strong>with approximately 10% having an associated anomaly.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/9RCNIx5bQIq030fpMj6DEOVWSOeFL_oq/_.png\"></div><br><br>Both defects can be detected early in pregnancy via ultrasound, and an elevated <strong>maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein&#160;</strong>(MSAFP) can also be seen (higher in gastroschisis than omphalocele).

If recanalization fails in the region giving rise to the duodenum, the result is duodenal atresia. &#160; <br><br>A similar condition is <strong>jejunal/ileal atresia,</strong> which occurs when ischemia causes necrosis and reabsorption of portions of the gut tube.
