      "solution": "This patient is presenting with mild jaundice and low-grade fever three days after the patient had an operation and was given blood transfusion. One of the important differential diagnoses that should be suspected is a <strong>delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction.&#160;</strong><br><br>Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions are a complication of blood transfusions that result from antibodies that form against minor RBC antigens (e.g. Rh) transfused to patients. Before the transfusion, the titers of these antibodies are usually very low. However, after exposure to the antigens on transfused RBCs, more antibodies start forming, and within days, <strong>hemolysis&#160;</strong>occurs. This hemolysis mostly occurs <strong>extravascularly&#160;</strong>and is typically much more mild than acute hemolytic reactions (which are mostly due to ABO incompatibility). &#160;<br><br>Patients with delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction typically present between 24 hours and one month of a transfusion with <strong>low-grade fevers </strong>and <strong>jaundice</strong>. However, many patients are usually asymptomatic. The serum bilirubin will be mildly elevated, and the patient's hemoglobin might decrease. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions are rarely serious, and management is usually supportive. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Surgical site infection&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Although surgical site infections can lead to fever post-operatively, this complication is unlikely to be the cause in this patient as their incisions are without any pain, discharge, or erythema.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Postcholecystectomy syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) is defined as the persistence of biliary colic (right upper quadrant pain) along with other gastrointestinal symptoms after cholecystectomy.

TRALI is one of the causes of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, in which <strong>left ventricular function is normal</strong>. Although the pathophysiology of TRALI is not yet completely understood, it is believed that the condition develops <strong>secondary to the presence of anti-leukocyte antibodies</strong> (e.g. anti-HLA antibodies) in the donor&#8217;s plasma. These antibodies bind to recipient neutrophils and lead to their activation in the pulmonary capillaries. This activation then initiates an inflammatory response in the pulmonary capillaries, causing endothelial cell damage, massive cytokine release, and pulmonary edema. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients with TRALI develop severe <strong>shortness of breath&#160;</strong>within six hours of transfusion, commonly along with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension or hypertension. <strong>Hypoxemia&#160;</strong>develops and is characterized by oxygen saturation &lt;90% and a ratio of PaO2/FiO2 &lt;300. Chest radiography shows <strong>bilateral pulmonary infiltrates</strong> and pulmonary edema. Because left ventricular function is normal, pulmonary artery wedge pressure is normal at &#8804;18 mm Hg. Finally, leukopenia and neutropenia are commonly seen in patients with TRALI. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/fhvzaeYLSpKXQgBgOhFDeBofQfG8ouaI/_.png\"></div><br><br>It is important to differentiate TRALI from transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). TACO is also an acute transfusion complication that develops after transfusion of massive amounts of blood. It is characterized by <strong>hypervolemia</strong>. Like TRALI, TACO usually presents with acute dyspnea associated with bilateral pulmonary edema. However, TACO is associated with <strong>decreased left ventricular ejection fraction,&#160;</strong>which is normal in TRALI. In addition, because TACO is a volume overload state, it is associated with <strong>jugular venous distension</strong>, elevation of beta natriuretic peptide (BNP), and sometimes an S3 can be heard.

She recalls one episode of nausea and diaphoresis while she was lifting boxes at home approximately one month ago, but she does not recall any chest pain or shortness of breath at that time. She is a life-time non-smoker and reports drinking one glass of wine every night with dinner. Her temperature is 37.2&#176;C (98.9&#176; F), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 142/82 mmHg. Physical examination shows 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities and prominent jugular veins. An additional heart sound is heard just after S2, and faint bibasilar crackles are heard on auscultation of the lungs. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates a dilated left ventricle and increased end-diastolic volume, and wall motion abnormalities are noted along the anterolateral heart border.

The inability of the heart to effectively pump blood forward through circulation results in clinical features of left-sided heart failure causing pulmonary edema: <strong>fatigue, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea</strong>, as well as <strong>bibasilar crackles</strong> and an <strong>S3 heart sound (ventricular gallop)</strong> on examination. This often progresses to right-sided heart failure, resulting in <strong>jugular venous distention (JVD), pitting edema,</strong> and <strong>hepatic congestion</strong>. The patient in this question likely suffered an atypical or silent myocardial infarction while she was moving boxes several weeks ago, and without appropriate treatment, she has now developed systolic heart failure. Other causes of systolic heart failure include etiologies of dilated cardiomyopathy including alcohol, coxsackie B virus infection, chronic cocaine use, or Chagas disease.

      "solution": "This patient has <strong>diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma</strong>. Scleroderma starts with<strong>&#160;injury to endothelial cells</strong> that line the interior surface of small blood vessels, causing a non-inflammatory vasculitis. This prompts T-cell migration. The T-cells release cytokines, which attract other immune cells, and activate fibroblasts that produce and deposit collagen. In time, collagen accumulates and forms a highly stable matrix. This buildup of excess connective tissue is termed <strong>fibrosis</strong>. &#160;<br><br>In diffuse cutaneous systemic scleroderma, extensive fibrosis takes place in both the <strong>skin&#160;</strong>and <strong>visceral&#160;</strong><strong>organs</strong>. Thickening and tightening of skin throughout the patient&#8217;s body is expected. In the lungs, excess collagen deposition can result in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary fibrosis. This presents with dyspnea, restricted inhalation, and coughing. On auscultation, PAH can cause a loud pulmonic component (P2) of the S2 heart sound. In addition, since the right ventricle must pump against an increased afterload, right heart failure will eventually develop (a process known as cor <strong>pulmonale</strong>). &#160;<br><br>Three autoantibodies are often found in patients with scleroderma.

Normally, heparin acts by binding and inhibiting antithrombin III, thus preventing secondary hemostasis. However, in HIT, heparin molecules bind proteins on the surface of platelets called <strong>platelet-factor-4 (PF-4)</strong>, forming immunogenic heparin-PF4 complexes that are destroyed in the spleen. Activated platelets also release procoagulants, such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which cause more platelets to activate.

      "solution": "This patient, who is presenting with fatigue, dyspnea, hypotension, and tachycardia following an upper respiratory infection, raises concern for <strong>cardiac tamponade</strong> due to pericarditis. The ECG shows <strong>electrical alternans</strong>, which refers to the beat-to-beat variations in the amplitude of the QRS complex. These changes are thought to be caused by the anterior-posterior swinging of the heart with each contraction in the fluid-filled pericardial sac. As the heart swings posteriorly, the electrical signals detected by the electrodes travel over a greater distance through the fluid, resulting in reduced voltage at the electrodes. This finding is fairly specific but not very sensitive for cardiac tamponade. &#160; <br><br>Cardiac tamponade occurs when large amounts of fluid accumulate between the layers of the pericardium (pericardial effusion), resulting in compression of the heart. Common etiologies include infectious, trauma, metabolic, autoimmune, cancer or idiopathic. Presentation may be acute and develop over minutes (e.g. trauma) or subacute, which develops over hours to days (e.g., uremia, post-viral) when enough fluid accumulates. The <strong>classic triad&#160;</strong>of symptoms, known as the <strong>Beck triad,</strong> consists of <strong>hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds</strong>. Other signs and symptoms include syncope, chest pain, and <strong>pulsus paradoxus</strong>.

In patients with constrictive pericarditis, the increase in intra-abdominal pressure during inspiration contributes to the increase in CVP, although the exact mechanism is unclear.

He most likely has<strong>&#160;emphysema.</strong><br><br>Emphysema describes permanent <strong>alveoli enlargement&#160;</strong>and loss of alveolar wall elasticity. It is most commonly caused by an irritant, such as tobacco smoke, which triggers inflammation in the alveoli. Inflammatory cells (e.g. neutrophils) gather in the lungs and release destructive proteases, which degrade connective tissue in the alveolar walls. The alveoli become progressively weaker, lose their ability to stretch and recoil, and eventually collapse, resulting in air trapping. &#160; <br><br>To mitigate this symptom, patients learn to <strong>expire slowly with pursed lips</strong>, which raises airway pressure and prevents airway collapse. The classic emphysematous patient is described as a &#8220;<strong>pink puffer</strong>,&#8221; since in the early stages of the disease, the alveoli are still able to participate in gas exchange, and cyanosis is absent. Additionally, due to air-trapping and hyperinflation of the lungs, individuals tend to develop a<strong>&#160;barrel-shaped chest. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>In contrast, patients with <strong>chronic bronchitis</strong> are classically described as <strong>&#8220;blue bloaters&#8221;.</strong> This is because obstruction of airflow can get so severe that deoxygenated blood from the right heart reaches the left heart without participating in adequate gas exchange.

In contrast, the tremor that occurred during college was most likely physiologic tremor, exacerbated by sleep deprivation and excessive caffeine intake. &#160;<br><br>Tremor is defined as a rhythmic, involuntary, oscillatory movement of a body part caused by either alternating or synchronous antagonist muscle contractions. ET is the most common cause of action tremor in adults. Classically, ET involves the hands and becomes apparent by arm movement during an activity (intention tremor) or sustained antigravity postures. The tremor can be quite disabling, affecting daily activities such as writing, drinking from a glass, and using utensils. The tremor is typically slowly progressive, bilateral, slightly asymmetric, and with moderate to high frequency (6 to 12 Hz). ET may also affect the head, voice, and less commonly the face or trunk. A helpful clue often seen on USMLE exams is that ET is often <strong>relieved by small amounts of alcohol&#160;</strong>intake, and therefore, patients often self-medicate with alcoholic beverages. The neuropathologic basis of ET remains poorly understood, but involvement of the cerebellum and brainstem (locus coeruleus) has been suggested. ET has a strong genetic component, often referred to as \"familial tremor.\" The diagnosis of ET is based purely upon the clinical features, according to the following criteria: &#160; <br><br><ul><li>&#160;Isolated, bilateral upper limb action tremor, without other motor abnormalities&#160;</li><li>&#160;At least three years in duration&#160;</li><li>&#160;With/without a tremor in other locations (e.g., head, voice, or lower limbs)&#160;</li><li>&#160;Absence of other neurologic signs (e.g., parkinsonism, ataxia)&#160;</li></ul>First-line treatment consists of <strong>beta-blockers</strong> (e.g. propranolol) or certain <strong>barbiturates&#160;</strong>(e.g. primidone). &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/7U2-GSiNScmGxezQaNC4oluqTayijvc2/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Essential tremor&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Physiologic tremor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Physiologic tremor is a very low-amplitude, high-frequency (8 to 12 Hz) action tremor that can be seen in healthy individuals.

Cardinal risk factors for developing preeclampsia include past or family history of preeclampsia, nulliparity, preexisting diabetes, chronic hypertension, obesity, and multiple gestation. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/fZ6SiASVRa6mRtPWn5YiXxzARJ_ujSci/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Dilatation of the ureters and renal pelvis on ultrasound:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Hydroureter and hydronephrosis are physiologic changes of pregnancy that can be seen in up to 80% of pregnant women and are considered benign features.

A molar pregnancy can be categorized as a complete mole or partial mole, which differ by pathogenesis, gross morphology, histopathology, karyotype, and risk of malignancy. Complete moles are formed by the <strong>duplication of the haploid genes of a single sperm</strong> following fertilization of an empty ovum and therefore are <strong>diploid 46,XX</strong>. Less commonly, 46,XY karyotype may occur due to dispermic fertilization of an empty ovum. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Partial moles occur due to fertilization of a normal ovum by two sperm and therefore are triploid (69,XXX, 69,XXY, or 69,XYY). Compared to complete mole, hCG levels are typically far lower in partial moles, and uterine size is often normal. Additionally, hyperemesis gravidarum, hyperthyroidism, and theca lutein cysts are less common since these features are caused by severely elevated b-hCG levels. On ultrasound, both conditions are characterized by ultrasound appearance of cystic spaces (\"Swiss cheese pattern\"), but fetal parts may be seen in a partial mole. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Although benign, molar pregnancy increases the risk for invasive disease (e.g., choriocarcinoma, invasive mole). The risk is higher with a complete mole. Treatment is evacuation, which is both therapeutic and diagnostic. Monitoring hCG following treatment is required to detect signs of invasive disease. At the same time, contraceptives are used for several months during the monitoring phase to prevent confusion with normal pregnancies. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/eTnF1p3MQBue31-kKsSZIiIpQUKQ9-oX/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ 46, XX:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ 46, XO:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This karyotype is consistent with Turner syndrome, a genetic condition characterized by partly or completely missing an X chromosome in a female.

Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder resulting in autoantibodies, specifically<strong>&#160;thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins</strong> (TSH-receptor antibodies), that can also activate the T-cells in the retro-orbital space. This activation results in secretion of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, increasing <strong>fibroblast secretion of glycosaminoglycans</strong>, causing ocular muscle swelling, inflammation, and an increase in the number of adipocytes. Ultimately, this manifests as <strong>exophthalmos</strong>, an anterior bulging of the eyes. In addition, <strong>lid lag</strong> may also be observed, where sclera can be seen above the iris as the patient looks down due to the increased sympathetic stimulation of the levator palpebrae superioris and superior tarsal muscles. &#160; <br><br>Diagnosis is confirmed by histology of the thyroid, which will demonstrate tall and crowded follicular epithelial cells with scalloped colloid. Treatment of Graves ophthalmopathy includes <strong>glucocorticoids </strong>due to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Treatment of Graves disease itself involves antithyroid agents, such as propylthiouracil or methimazole. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Retro-orbital fibroblast secretion of glycosaminoglycans:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hormonal secretion from an underlying malignancy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Paraneoplastic syndrome from an underlying malignancy can result in hormonal derangements.

A commonly implicated gene is the carbonic anhydrase type II gene (CA2). Homozygous mutation in this gene can result in impaired functioning of osteoclasts, resulting in persistent bone growth. Patients may experience excessive skull bone growth, which can narrow the cranial foramina, an opening on the skull base through which many cranial nerves pass; this process can result in <strong>proptosis, blindness, deafness,&#160;</strong>and <strong>hydrocephalus</strong>. When bone tissue begins to replace bone marrow in the medullary cavity, it can cause severe bone marrow failure, resulting in <strong>pancytopenia</strong>. The body tries to compensate for bone marrow failure by stimulating extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen, resulting in <strong>hepatosplenomegaly.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br><strong><span>Autosomal-dominant</span><span>&#160;</span><span>osteopetrosis</span><span>&#160;type II</span></strong> presents with milder symptoms that manifest in early adulthood.

      "solution": "This patient with <strong>fatigue, claudication, brachiofemoral delay</strong> and <strong>hypotension</strong> in lower extremities most likely has <strong>coarctation of aorta (CoA).</strong> CoA occurs when there is a specific point of narrowing of the lumen of the aorta, and it can be divided into two types: preductal and postductal. &#160; <br><br>The<strong>&#160;preductal type&#160;</strong>(also termed the infantile type) presents early in life and is associated with a <strong>patent ductus arteriosus&#160;</strong>(PDA). In this type, aortic narrowing occurs before the ductus arteriosus. Blood pressure is elevated in the aorta before the narrowing and reduced after the narrowing. As a result, deoxygenated blood is shunted from the pulmonary artery, through the ductus arteriosus, into the aorta distal to the narrowing. Deoxygenated blood can travel to the lower extremities and result in <strong>differential</strong> cyanosis, which is when the lower extremities are cyanotic, but the upper extremities are not. &#160; <br><br>The <strong>postductal typ</strong>e (also termed the adult type) is not associated with a PDA. Narrowing occurs after the ductus arteriosus/ligamentum arteriosum. No shunting or differential cyanosis is present. However, blood pressure will still be elevated proximal to the narrowing and reduced distal to the narrowing. Of note, the patient in this vignette has the postductal type. &#160; <br><br>Both types can cause <strong>upper extremity hypertension</strong>. In addition, if too little blood reaches the legs, patients can develop <strong>claudication</strong> that is exacerbated by exercise, as seen in this patient. <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/lvafwnMqTmSwUiur2uWuQUYJSQqYyi5v/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Anterosuperior displacement of the interventricular septum&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This answer describes the pathophysiology of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).

The biopsy results show a <strong>villous adenomatous polyp,</strong> which is a <strong>premalignant</strong> lesion. Clinically, adenomatous polyps are usually asymptomatic, but some may cause occult bleeding, secretory diarrhea, or partial intestinal obstruction. &#160; <br><br>Adenomatous polyps can be classified into three categories: villous, tubulovillous, and tubular. Amongst them, villous polyps have the highest malignant potential. The transformation from normal epithelium to adenomatous polyp, and later carcinoma, is termed the <strong>adenoma-carcinoma sequence.</strong> It is characterized by a series of mutations: &#160; <br><br><strong>1) Normal mucosa to colon-at-risk:</strong> A change from normal mucosa to an at-risk colon occurs by acquiring a mutation in the <strong>adenomatous polyposis coli (</strong><em>APC</em>) <strong>gene</strong>, which is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 5. Loss of the <em>APC</em> gene leads to accumulation of the &#946;-catenin protein (transcription factor), which leads to constitutive transcription and unregulated cell proliferation. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>2) Colon-at-risk to adenomatous polyps</strong>: The <strong><em>KRAS</em></strong> proto-oncogene normally encodes for proteins that regulate cell-signal transduction. Mutations in <em>KRAS</em> lead to the formation of stabilized forms of these proteins, which makes them resistant to degradation. The presence of these stabilized proteins leads to constant transmission of extracellular growth signals. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>3) Adenomatous polyps to colorectal cancer:</strong> This final step is believed to be caused by a loss of tumor suppressor genes, such as <strong><em>TP53</em></strong> and <strong><em>DCC</em></strong>, which are normally responsible for negatively regulating the cell cycle. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ TP53:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: <em>TP53</em> is a tumor suppressor gene and often referred to as \"guardian of the genome\".

      "solution": "This patient with a presumed episode of binge drinking presents with <strong>severe hyponatremia</strong> and <strong>associated seizures</strong>. Given the patient&#8217;s history, <strong>beer potomania</strong> (a subset of <strong>euvolemic hyponatremia</strong>) is the most likely cause. The condition occurs secondary to overconsumption of electrolyte-poor liquid, such as beer, with little other sources of nutrition. Poor electrolyte intake limits the formation of a normal renal urea gradient, leading to an inability to excrete sufficient free water and subsequent development of hyponatremia. &#160;<br><br>Hyponatremia is classified based on the patient's volume status (e.g., hypovolemic, euvolemic, hypervolemic). It is important to not confuse true hyponatremia with <strong>pseudohyponatremia&#160;</strong>or <strong>false hyponatremia</strong>, which arises due to increased serum lipids and protein or instrumental error. &#160;<br><br>Hypervolemic hyponatremia occurs due to an enormous increase in total body water and less significant increase in total body sodium. Etiologies include <strong>congestive heart failure, cirrhosis</strong>, and <strong>nephrotic syndrome</strong>. In contrast, hypovolemic hyponatremia occurs when there is significant sodium loss in comparison to a smaller water volume loss. Etiologies include <strong>cerebral salt wasting, diarrhea</strong>, and <strong>vomiting</strong>. Euvolemic hyponatremia occurs when there is normal total body sodium but an increase in total body water. The condition is termed &#8220;euvolemic&#8221; since no edema is present. Etiologies include <strong>primary polydipsia, beer potomania</strong>, and<strong>&#160;SIADH.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Regardless of etiology, the symptoms of hyponatremia are primarily neurologic in nature. Mild symptoms including nausea and malaise may occur as serum levels fall below 120 mEq/L. As levels fall below 110 mEq/L, stupor, coma, and seizures may occur. At this level, correction of sodium levels should occur with hypertonic saline, though hyponatremia should not be corrected too quickly to avoid central pontine myelinolysis. &#160; <br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Normal extracellular fluid status&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pitting edema of the lower extremities&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The presence of pitting edema and hyponatremia is suggestive of volume overload or increased extracellular fluid.

Pure fibromas are benign solid tumors, usually unilateral, and are not hormonally active. They occur primarily in postmenopausal women. The fluid accumulation is thought to occur due to substances such as VEGF that increase capillary permeability. Removal of the fibroma results in resolution of the ascites and pleural effusion. Occasionally, the tumor can compress the round ligament of the uterus which produces a pulling sensation in the groin. Histology shows <strong>nests of spindle-shaped fibroblasts</strong>. On ultrasound examination, fibromas appear as a mass that may be hyper/hypoechoic, and they are often calcified and/or exhibit cystic degeneration.

They are usually seen in postmenopausal women. Thecomas may produce estrogen, and therefore often present with abnormal uterine bleeding; up to 20% of patients have concomitant endometrial cancer. Grossly, the tumors appear yellow from accumulated lipids. Histologically, they are primarily composed of theca cells. Thecomas are not associated with Meigs syndrome, as seen in this patient.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Choriocarcinoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Choriocarcinoma is an invasive trophoblastic neoplasia composed of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts without villi. The most common presentation is antepartum vaginal bleeding. Other signs and symptoms include respiratory symptoms due to lung metastases, neurologic symptoms due to brain metastases, and acute abdominal pain due to bleeding intra-abdominal metastases.

These tumors often produce estrogen and/or progesterone, leading to symptoms of hyperestrogenism (e.g., abnormal uterine bleeding, breast tenderness) and sexual precocity in children. Inhibin is the most common serum marker of these tumors. This patient, however, shows none of these features.</span></div>",

However, his lethargic state and laboratory results suggest a second process:<strong>&#160;hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)</strong>. This pathologic state happens in <strong>type 2 diabetes</strong> when glucose levels get high, usually from a trigger, such as an underlying infection, leading to profound dehydration. The mechanisms that cause hyperglycemia overlap between diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and HHS. Both result in increased lysosomal activity, leading to<strong>&#160;protein degradation</strong> (proteolysis) to create building blocks (amino acids) for <strong>gluconeogenesis</strong>. Without insulin, the glucose that is synthesized cannot be used by cells, causing a massive glucose elevation.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/cH8wAebfSeSyBB3Q1iVWumNnT92zGCnb/_.png\"></div><br>Glucose is a polar molecule that cannot passively diffuse across cell membranes, which means that it acts as a solute. Therefore, when levels of glucose become elevated in the blood, the patient is in a hyperosmolar state, which causes water to leave the body&#8217;s cells. This extravasation of intracellular fluid leads to polyuria and dehydration, ultimately causing neurologic symptoms like <strong>lethargy&#160;</strong>and <strong>seizures</strong>, which can progress to coma and death if left untreated. Laboratory results in these patients show hyperglycemia, often over 600 mg/dL, <strong>high serum osmolality</strong>, often over 320 mOsm/kg and, unlike DKA, there is no acidosis, because ketone production is limited by the endogenous insulin. Treatment relies on <strong>aggressive IV fluids and insulin therapy. &#160;</strong>&#160; &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Glycolysis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

HbC disease is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder caused by mutated genes that encode for an abnormal adult hemoglobin called hemoglobin C (HbC). This mutation leads to a substitution of glutamic acid in the sixth position of the beta globin chain with <strong>lysine</strong>, and a mutation in both copies of the gene is needed to get the disease. If the person has just one copy of the mutation and one normal hemoglobin A gene (HbA), then he or she has <strong>HbC trait</strong> and is said to be a carrier of the disease. HbC carriers are also <strong>protected against malaria</strong>, because infected erythrocytes are removed by the spleen. &#160; <br><br>HbC is less soluble than normal HbA, so it aggregates into crystals, which build up inside erythrocytes and make them more rigid. As a result of the decreased solubility of the hemoglobin, there is a relative membrane excess, and the erythrocytes start resembling a shooting target with a bullseye, seen as a dark center of hemoglobin, a ring of pallor, and an outer band of hemoglobin. These cells are known as <strong>target cells&#160;</strong>or <strong>codocytes</strong>. Erythrocytes do not appear sickled like in sickle cell disease, because unlike valine, lysine is positively charged. Therefore, there is no hydrophobic effect seen in HbC disease. Additionally, HbC, either in the homozygous state (HbCC) or in heterozygous states, induces red cell dehydration, resulting in red cells with an <strong>increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin</strong>&#160;<strong>concentration&#160;</strong>(MCHC). &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/dGoCxMIQR-6R7U8SVfCkVphcRYmZf8-N/_.jpg\"></div><br>Reproduced from:<br><br>Hemoglobin C disease leads to both <strong>intravascular</strong> and <strong>extravascular hemolysis</strong>, resulting in increased RBC breakdown, causing jaundice and <strong>gallstones</strong> (intermittent RUQ abdominal pain), as well as anemia.

Of the sequelae listed, patients with atrial fibrillation are at highest risk of<strong>&#160;thromboembolic events. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Patients with atrial fibrillation are at risk for several complications. Most notably, prolonged atrial fibrillation results in hemostasis, as blood is no longer pumped effectively throughout the body. Thrombi can then form (most commonly on the left atrial appendage), dislodge, and then travel to the brain resulting in <strong>embolic stroke</strong>. Prolonged atrial fibrillation also places patients at risk for <strong>high output cardiac failure&#160;</strong>and <strong>dilated cardiomyopathy</strong>. Additional complications include chronic kidney disease, myocardial infarction, and silent ischemia of other organ systems. <br><br>Management of atrial fibrillation is targeted at identifying the underlying etiology, achieving <strong>rate and rhythm control,</strong> and starting <strong>anticoagulation</strong>. Rate and rhythm control is achieved through the use of calcium channel blockers (e.g. diltiazem) or beta blockers (e.g. metoprolol). The need for anticoagulation is evaluated by calculating a patient's <strong>CHADs-VASc score</strong>, which takes into account a patient's history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes, stroke, as well as sex and age.

Her presentation warrants consideration for treatment with <strong>thrombolytic therapy</strong>, which will break down the thrombus. &#160; <br><br><strong>Obstructive shock</strong> described impaired end-organ perfusion due to physical obstruction of circulation either into or out of the heart. It falls under the umbrella of &#8220;cold shock&#8221;, which manifests with clammy and cool extremities due to decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance to shunt blood towards vital organs. &#160; <br><br>There are three primary causes of obstructive shock: <strong>pulmonary embolism</strong>, <strong>pericardial tamponade</strong>, and <strong>tension pneumothorax</strong>. A pulmonary embolism manifests with obstructive shock due to the right heart's inability to pump blood through the pulmonary vasculature, causing profound V/Q mismatch, jugular venous distension, hypoxemia, and compromised left ventricular cardiac output. Pericardial tamponade refers to accumulation of blood or fluid in the pericardial sac, of which there are numerous causes including trauma, uremia, and pericarditis. When the amount of pericardial fluid reaches a critical threshold, ventricular filling and outflow becomes compromised, warranting pericardiocentesis. Lastly, a tension pneumothorax results in compression of mediastinal structures and causes decreased venous return and stroke volume. Treatment involves rapid decompression with needle thoracostomy followed by chest tube placement.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/NkRMU33URP2Lg4nuWDA_Ld7TQGawJ_ZI/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ V/Q mismatch:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased venous return:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Hypovolemic shock is associated with decreased venous return to the heart.

      "solution": "<strong>Hepatocellular carcinoma</strong> (HCC) is a malignant, usually solitary, tumor of the liver that primarily occurs in patients with preexisting liver <strong>cirrhosis&#160;</strong>or chronic hepatitis. The most important underlying factors in HCC are viral infections (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus) and toxin-mediated injuries (e.g., aflatoxin, alcohol). These factors cause the liver to be in a constant cycle of damage and repair, which raise the chances of genetic mutations, potentially leading to carcinogenesis and development of HCC. Therefore, in regions where HBV and HCV (and therefore, cirrhosis) are common, there is a high incidence of HCC. &#160; <br><br>Clinical manifestations of HCC are typically due to underlying cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, pitting edema), but patients may also present with systemic signs such as <strong>weight loss</strong>, malaise, and <strong>fatigue</strong>. As the tumor grows, abdominal distension and <strong>anorexia&#160;</strong>(due to compression of the stomach) may occur. <strong>Alpha fetoprotein</strong> (AFP) is a tumor marker associated with HCC. AFP is a glycoprotein normally <strong>produced by the fetal yolk sac</strong>, and is therefore also elevated in yolk sac tumors.

They usually have hair growing out of them. On the other hand, <strong>acquired melanocytic nevi</strong> appear later in life. Patients with familial predisposition, sun exposure, and lightly pigmented skin are at increased risk of developing acquired nevi. &#160; <br><br>Acquired nevi can further be classified as common or atypical. <strong>Common nevi</strong> are benign tumors of melanocytes. They are symmetrical, evenly pigmented, have well-demarcated borders, and small (diameter &lt; 5 mm). Common nevi can then be divided into junctional and intradermal nevi. <strong>Junctional nevi,</strong> which are characterized by the proliferation of melanocytes at the <strong>dermal-epidermal junction,</strong> typically manifest as flat macules. <strong>Intradermal nevi,</strong> which are characterized by the proliferation of melanocytes within the dermis, typically manifest as elevated papules. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Lastly, there are <strong>atypical nevi,</strong> which are asymmetrical, inconsistently pigmented, and large (diameter &gt; 5 mm) with irregular borders.

The condition has a <strong>bimodal distribution</strong>, most commonly affecting women in their 20s and 30s and men in their 60s and 70s. It occurs due to the formation of autoantibodies against<strong>&#160;nicotinic acetylcholine receptors</strong> on muscle cells. &#160;<br><br>The hallmark symptom is muscle weakness that <strong>worsens after repeated activity</strong> and<strong>&#160;improves after rest</strong>. Patients may complain of <strong>ptosis&#160;</strong>and <strong>diplopia&#160;</strong>secondary to extraocular muscle weakness early in the course of the disease. Later on, <strong>bulbar&#160;</strong>muscles involvement can result in slurred speech, difficulty chewing, and choking. <strong>Neck&#160;</strong>muscles involvement can cause patients to feel that their head is heavy and difficult to keep upright.

This diagnosis is confirmed by radiographic findings. In this patient, the condition is most likely due to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is defined clinically as bone density that is less than <strong>2.5 standard deviations</strong> below peak bone mass. <br><br>Osteoporosis can be divided into type I and type II. <strong>Type I osteoporosis&#160;</strong>affects <strong>postmenopausal females</strong> who have reduced estrogen production. Estrogen normally inhibits osteoclast resorption of bone; therefore, decreased estrogen levels leave the patient vulnerable to increased osteoclast breakdown of bone. Although osteoblast activity does increase to compensate, it ultimately cannot keep up with the resorptive process. For this reason, type I osteoporosis is also termed &#8216;high-turnover&#8217; and &#8216;postmenopausal&#8217; osteoporosis. <br><br><strong>Type II osteoporosis&#160;</strong>affects <strong>both men and women</strong>. With age, osteoblasts lose their ability to proliferate and form new bone. Thus, after reaching a peak bone mass around age 30, decreased osteoblast activity will result in an overall decrease in bone density. This condition is also termed &#8216;low-turnover&#8217; osteoporosis, since osteoclast activity is normal, and &#8216;senile&#8217; osteoporosis, since it occurs universally with age in both genders.

The patient's age and history of blood transfusions as a child put him at increased risk for hepatitis C infection. An additional clue is this patient&#8217;s elevated liver enzymes, suggesting a chronic liver condition. &#160; <br><br><strong>Cryoglobulins</strong> are immunoglobulins that<strong>&#160;precipitate in the cold temperatures</strong> and dissolve on rewarming. Cryoglobulins that contain more than one type of immunoglobulin component are called <strong>mixed</strong> cryoglobulins (e.g., monoclonal/polyclonal IgM, IgG, IgA antibodies, monoclonal &#954; or &#955; free light chain portions of these antibodies, and proteins of the blood complement system). The pathogenesis of the condition is poorly understood and assumed to be related to higher production of immunoglobulin, increased precipitation of immune complexes, and insufficient clearance. In type I cryoglobulinemia, precipitates are often seen within 24 hours.

Herniation is the end result of a mass effect and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) subsequent to traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, brain tumor or abscess. When intracranial pressure increases past a defined threshold, the brain can deviate across rigid structures such as the foramen magnum, falx cerebri, and the tentorium cerebelli&#8211;resulting in predictable neurologic findings. In general, herniation syndromes are divided into those that occur above the tentorial notch (<strong>supratentorial</strong>) and those that occur below this structure (<strong>infratentorial</strong>).<br><br>In uncal herniation, the innermost portion of the temporal lobe known as the uncus compresses the tentorium.

Acute pancreatitis is characterized by sudden inflammation and hemorrhaging of the pancreas due to destruction by its own enzymes (<strong>autodigestion</strong>). The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are 1) gallstones and 2) chronic alcohol abuse; this patient&#8217;s long standing heavy drinking is the likely cause of his pancreatitis. &#160;<br><br>Alcohol consumption leads to decreased fluid and bicarbonate secretion by the pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. This causes <strong>thickened pancreatic juices</strong> that can plug and block the pancreatic ducts, and the increasing pressure and distention results in <strong>dysfunctional cellular membrane trafficking</strong>. In addition to fluid and bicarbonate secretion, pancreatic exocrine acinar cells also secrete digestive enzymes that help break down the proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids found in food. Alcohol independently causes<strong>&#160;increased secretion of acinar cell zymogen granules</strong> (vesicles filled with proto-enzymes, especially trypsinogen), which can fuse with lysosomes in the setting of altered membrane trafficking. The result is <strong>activation of trypsinogen</strong> into trypsin by the lysosomal proteases and subsequent breakdown of cellular structures by trypsin. A flood of <strong>inflammatory cytokines&#160;</strong>are released, in addition to those independently induced by alcohol itself, attracting neutrophils that produce <strong>superoxides&#160;</strong>and more proteases.

NTDs may be open (e.g., myelomeningocele, meningocele, encephalocele, and anencephaly) or closed (e.g., spina bifida occulta). Anencephaly occurs when the <strong>rostral neuropore fails to close</strong>, resulting in an absent calvarium and forebrain. Open NTDs result in a persistent connection between the amniotic cavity and spinal canal, and therefore <strong>AFP&#160;</strong>and <strong>acetylcholinesterase&#160;</strong>are often elevated.

The barium swallow test results show characteristic dilated esophagus with distal stenosis (<strong>&#8220;bird&#8217;s beak&#8221;</strong>). &#160; <br><br>Deglutition (swallowing) is a complex process that involves a series of synchronized voluntary and involuntary muscle contractions. It is divided into the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases. In short, the food is chewed into bolus and propagated by the tongue towards the pharynx. The bolus is then transited to the pharynx and pushed into the esophagus by sequential contraction of pharyngeal constrictor muscles. The bolus enters the esophagus and by waves of peristalsis moves downwards. The lower esophageal sphincter relaxes to allow food into the stomach. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Achalasia</strong> is a functional disorder of the esophagus resulting from inflammation and degeneration of neurons in the esophageal wall.

Given the medical history of <strong>&#8220;white eye,&#8221;</strong> the most likely mutated gene is the <strong>retinoblastoma&#160;</strong>(RB) <strong>gene. &#160;</strong><br><br>Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor. The tumor produces an osteoid matrix or mineralized bone. Osteosarcoma has a bimodal age distribution, with a first peak seen in persons younger than 20 years of age and a smaller peak in older adults. In adolescents, it often arises in the metaphyseal regions of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Radiographs usually show a destructive, mixed lytic and sclerotic mass with reactive subperiosteal bone formation. This bone formation leads to elevation of the periosteum and the characteristic imaging finding known as Codman&#8217;s triangle (not pathognomonic). Risk factors for developing osteosarcoma include <strong>RB gene mutation, TP53 mutations</strong> (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), <strong>prior irradiation or chemotherapy, Paget disease, fibrous dysplasia</strong>, and other benign bone lesions. &#160;<br><br>The RB gene, also known as the<strong>&#160;governor of the cell cycle</strong>, is a <strong>tumor suppressor gene&#160;</strong>and a key negative regulator of the cell cycle. The product of the RB gene is the RB protein, which regulates the G1/S checkpoint of the cell cycle before DNA replication commences. When RB protein is <strong>hypophosphorylated</strong>, it binds the E2F transcription factor to inhibit gene transcription. When RB is <strong>phosphorylated&#160;</strong>it releases E2F, which binds DNA and activates transcription of S-phase genes. Mutations in the RB gene result in abnormal progression through the cell cycle, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and division. RB gene germline (inherited) or somatic (acquired) mutations are associated with retinoblastoma eye cancer, osteosarcoma bone cancer, and other soft tissue tumors. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase receptor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This answer describes the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia.

While the age of onset, degree of penetrance, and susceptibility to develop other types of cancers differ among BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations, most carriers will develop breast cancer by the age of 70 years (vs. 12% of women with an average risk of breast cancer). &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ DNA repair:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cell cycle regulation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Tumor protein p53 (TP53) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes for the transcription factor p53, which is responsible for cell cycle regulation. Mutations in TP53 are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a hereditary condition that is characterized by multiple malignancies at an early age, including sarcomas, breast cancer, leukemias, and adrenal cancers.

Mutations in the gene that encodes for HER2 result in overexpression of this receptor, which is associated with highly proliferative tumors and poor prognosis. However, HER2-positive breast cancer is not inherited and is considered a somatic genetic mutation.

It is then used for fat emulsification (breaking fat droplets into smaller pieces to maximize surface area for digestion), which facilitates fat and cholesterol absorption in the form of micelles. The outline of bile acid synthesis and reabsorption is summarized in the following steps: &#160;<br><br><ul><li>&#160;The liver cells synthesize primary bile acids (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) by cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol in a multi-step process, involving the <strong>rate-limiting enzyme 7&#945;-hydroxylase</strong>; this process is one of the few methods the body has to excrete cholesterol from the body. &#160;</li><li>&#160;The liver cells then conjugate primary bile acids with the amino acids glycine or taurine to form conjugated bile acids, making them relatively insoluble in water and unable to be reabsorbed in the intestines.&#160;</li><li>&#160;Once secreted into the intestine, the gut microbiota remove the glycine and taurine groups, forming secondary bile acids.

The infection is a progressive disease with varying features dependent on the stage. The clinical manifestations of <strong>primary syphilis</strong> include a <strong>single painless ulcer</strong> with raised margins and indurated borders that manifests 1-3 weeks after initial infection. <strong>Secondary syphilis</strong> is characterized by fever, a <strong>diffuse, symmetric macular rash on the trunk and extremities involving the palms and soles</strong>, and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Additionally, <strong>condyloma lata</strong> is a typical clinical manifestation of secondary syphilis which presents as multiple, flat-topped, wart-like, painless mucosal growths in the genital region. These lesions hold a high concentration of spirochetes and are considered highly infectious.<br><br>At all stages of infection, the most appropriate treatment for syphilis involves antimicrobial therapy with <strong>penicillin</strong>. In some cases, a phenomenon known as the <strong>Jarisch Herxheimer reaction</strong> can occur in response to antibiotic initiation with syphilis. This self-limited condition involves symptoms that begin 6-48 hours after antibiotic initiation and includes fever, chills, headache, myalgias, and worsening of the maculopapular rash. The pathogenesis of this reaction involves the augmented release of spirochetal endotoxins and cytokine response to accelerated phagocytosis and spirochete lysis.

The bones are also broken down for calcium resorption, so fractures can occur due to <strong>osteoporosis</strong>.

This can manifest as <strong>truncal&#160;</strong><strong>obesity&#160;</strong>(accumulation of adipose at the abdomen).
