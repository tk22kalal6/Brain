It typically arises in the <strong>metaphysis&#160;</strong>of long tubular bones, especially near the knee. Osteochondromas can be sessile or pedunculated, ranging from 1 to 20 cm in size. The cap consists of benign hyaline cartilage which appears as a disorganized growth plate that eventually undergoes endochondral ossification, with new bone-forming at the inner part. It occurs in individuals at ages 10-30 and is more common in men. Clinically, it may cause pain if it impinges the surrounding tissue or nerve. It can occur as a single lesion or multiple as part of the multiple hereditary exostoses syndrome. Rarely, osteochondromas progress to <strong>chondrosarcoma</strong>.

Osteosarcoma has a bimodal age distribution, with a first peak seen in persons younger than 20 years of age and a smaller peak in older adults. Radiographs usually show a destructive, mixed lytic and sclerotic mass with reactive subperiosteal bone formation.

These findings occur since in patients with celiac disease or chronic inflammation, there is increased apoptosis of intestinal cells. In an attempt to replace the lost cells, the number of <strong>regenerative cells&#160;</strong>within the crypts of the small intestines increases, leading to crypt hyperplasia. Over time, there is an inability to keep up with the constant apoptosis, and villous atrophy ensues. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/WTO0xYyrQ06TfbR0CHcckU6LSBqoVjQ4/_.png\"></div><br>Image reproduced from Wikimedia Commons<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Atrophic mucosa with loss of villi and crypt hyperplasia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Periodic-acid Schiff positive macrophages in the small intestine mucosa:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Patients with Whipple disease will have periodic-acid Schiff (PAS) positive macrophages in the small intestine mucosa.

      "solution": "Colonic <strong>hyperplastic polyps</strong> are the most common epithelial proliferations seen on colonoscopy. They are usually located in the rectosigmoid region. The formation of these lesions is not completely understood, but they are thought to be the result of decreased epithelial cell turnover and delayed shedding of surface epithelial cells, which leads to a &#8220;pileup&#8221; of goblet cells. This excess of goblet cells ultimately causes the <strong>hyperproliferation</strong> seen in the basal portion of the crypts, while the luminal surface has a superficial <strong>serrated architecture</strong>. An image of a hyperplastic polyp is shown below. &#160; <br><br>Although hyperplastic polyps have <strong>little malignant potential</strong>, it is important to distinguish them from serrated polyps, which are histologically similar and have malignant potential. The most useful histologic feature that distinguishes serrated polyps from hyperplastic polyps is the presence of serrated architecture throughout the full length of the glands, including the crypt base. In contrast, hyperplastic polyps demonstrate serrated architecture confined to the epithelial surface. <br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/MUd49HcgS8yJVa6gfkjqEIEnSzOXY1CX/_.png\"></div><br>Image reproduced from Flickr<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/6QFjaCXPQteEeOSOcrrLor9wQWeaOcyR/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Hyperplastic:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Serrated:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although hyperplastic polyps and sessile serrated polyps are similar on microscopy, it is important to note that in serrated polyps, there is the presence of serrated architecture throughout the full length of the glands, including the crypt base.

These tumors (unlike Sertoli cell tumors) originate from <strong>outside of the seminiferous tubules</strong>.<br><br>Clinically, Leydig cell tumors can be hormonally active, meaning they can secrete both male and female sex hormones. Excess male sex hormones, like <strong>testosterone</strong>, can cause premature puberty in young males, while in adults they usually cause no symptoms. Excess female sex hormones, like<strong>&#160;estrogen</strong>, can cause feminization and delayed puberty in young males.

The timing of the hematuria is important, as it helps differentiate it from poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), a similarly presenting condition. The episodic hematuria in IgA nephropathy usually starts within a day or two of a nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection (hence <em>synpharyngitic</em>), as opposed to PSGN, in which the hematuria occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection (and is therefore termed <em>postpharyngitic</em> nephritis). &#160;<br><br>The inciting event is the formation of abnormal <strong>IgA</strong>&#160;<strong>antibodies&#160;</strong>(in response to a recent infection) which the body recognizes as foreign and makes IgG antibodies against them. The immune complexes (IC) that are formed become trapped in the mesangium, thereby activating the complement system and resulting in the release of cytokines and inflammation. Renal dysfunction (e.g. increased creatinine) and hypertension are common but not always present in early disease (as in this patient).

His evaluation reveals an increased FEV1/FVC ratio on pulmonary function testing, consistent with a restrictive lung physiology. Together, these findings warrant consideration for the pneumoconiosis, <strong>berylliosis&#8212;a noncaseating granulomatous&#160;</strong>disorder. &#160;<br><br><strong>Berylliosis</strong> is a form of metal poisoning caused by inhalation of beryllium dusts, vapors, or its compounds. It is most commonly related to occupational exposure, especially in those who work or worked in the<strong>&#160;aerospace industry, electronic manufacturing, and car manufacturing.&#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>Over time, inhaled beryllium particles become lodged in the small airways, which trigger a <strong>type IV hypersensitivity reaction and noncaseating granuloma formation</strong>. In some patients, they become sensitized to beryllium particles and are completely asymptomatic. In other patients, noncaseating granuloma formation progresses to lung fibrosis, causing shortness of breath, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and cor pulmonale. It is important to note that progressive disease can occur years after last exposure, with some cases noted to have exposures greater than thirty years ago. &#160;<br><br>Diagnosis of berylliosis rests on history, physiologic, radiographic, and histologic findings. Pulmonary function tests will typically demonstrate restrictive physiology, and radiographic findings often include <strong>nodular opacities in the mid and upper lung zones</strong>. Diagnosis can further be elucidated by the <strong>beryllium sensitivity test</strong>, where the patient's lymphocyte count is measured in response to exposure to beryllium sulfate. Cells are then counted, and those with elevated numbers of cells are considered abnormal. Treatment is usually supportive care and removal from the offending exposure; steroids can be considered on a case-by-case basis. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/VF-L7wOQSIyFJ2oyglhhwd4dTvSXb7ps/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/gvtlZZEQTuKBdAhWa-3l7mpSRNCR-PjN/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Non-caseating granulomas&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ferruginous bodies&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Ferruginous bodies are commonly associated with asbestosis.

      "solution": "This young, previously healthy patient is presenting with an incidental calcified mass on abdominal imaging; the subsequent histological results confirm the diagnosis of a <strong>mature ovarian teratoma</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Teratomas, a type of <strong>germ cell tumor</strong>, constitute up to 20% of ovarian tumors. They typically occur in the first 2 decades of life. The majority of teratomas are benign cystic teratomas while the immature, malignant subtype is rare. In general, the younger the patient, the greater the likelihood of the lesion being malignant. &#160; <br><br>Benign (mature) cystic teratomas are also known as dermoid cysts, a name derived from the presence of cysts within the tumor that are lined by epidermis. These tumors are typified by the presence of differentiated (mature) tissues from all three germ cell layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. The tumors are mostly unilateral and may be filled with <strong>sebaceous secretions</strong>, <strong>hair</strong>, <strong>teeth</strong>, <strong>bone&#160;</strong>and <strong>cartilage</strong>, as well as other tissues. Most teratomas are discovered incidentally on abdominal x-rays or scans due to the presence of tooth-like structures within the tumor that produces foci of calcification. These neoplasms (especially the larger variants) are prone to cause <strong>ovarian torsion</strong>, since they increase the likelihood for the ovary to rotate on the axis of the infundibulopelvic and utero-ovarian ligaments and become fixed in a torsed position. A rare paraneoplastic complication is hyperthyroidism, which develops in teratomas containing thyroid tissue, a condition known as <strong>struma ovarii</strong>. Rarely, mature teratomas may transform into <strong>squamous cell carcinoma</strong>. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/RVgNESemRsy9g7yppeNVafUVTLeqIAxN/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Mucinous cystadenoma&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Mucinous cystadenoma is a common type of benign ovarian tumor. Similar to serous cystadenoma, it is usually thin-walled, uni- or multilocular, ranging from 5-20 cm in size. Compared with serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas are less common, more likely to be multiloculated, are larger and are less likely to occur bilaterally.

Serous cystadenocarcinoma is the most common ovarian cancer. Macroscopically it appears as solid, hemorrhagic, and necrotic mass.

The transient mitral valve obstruction can mimic mitral stenosis. Symptoms include dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, chest pain, embolization, and sudden death. Systemic embolization occurs when fragments from the tumor enter the systemic circulation.

It is important to note that invasive carcinomas following a diagnosis of LCIS may arise in <strong>either breast</strong> (unlike DCIS, which predisposes to invasive carcinoma in the same breast). On histology, the tumor has a homogeneous appearance. The cells are monomorphic with round nuclei and are found in clusters within the lobules. The tumor is typically ER-positive and rarely shows overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).

      "solution": "This patient has fever, graft site tenderness, and abnormal kidney function test one month after kidney transplantation. This presentation is concerning for <strong>acute graft rejection</strong>. Although the incidence of acute renal graft rejection has decreased immensely after the introduction of immunosuppressant drugs, it is still one of the leading causes of rejection. &#160;<br>Acute rejection develops due to recognition of the graft antigens by the immune system, and it results from two immunological immune responses that act in combination or alone: the cellular and the humoral immune responses. The cellular response is mediated by <strong>T-cells</strong>, which directly recognize MHC antigens on the graft and cause damage to the graft (T-cell dependent process), while the humoral response develops when <strong>B cells</strong> are recruited (by T-helper cells) and generate antibodies that cause acute humoral rejection (B-cell dependent process). Therefore, acute rejection is considered a <strong>type II</strong> (antibody-mediated) and <strong>type IV</strong> (cellular-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction. &#160; <br><br>Acute rejection develops from one week to three months after transplantation, and patients usually complain of <strong>fever</strong> and <strong>graft site tenderness</strong>. Additionally, there is typically decreased function of the transplanted organ; for example, patients with acute renal graft rejection develop <strong>anuria, metabolic abnormalities</strong> (e.g. hyperkalemia), and<strong>&#160;elevated serum creatinine</strong>, as seen in this patient. &#160;<br><br>A biopsy is needed to diagnose acute graft rejection and differentiate it from other diagnoses (e.g. tacrolimus toxicity).

From the answers above, only choice D describes serous cystadenocarcinoma, the most common type of ovarian cancer. Of note, CA-125 can be undetectable in cases limited to the ovary and elevated in a variety of benign conditions and other cancers. Therefore, it is mainly used in monitoring response to therapy. &#160; <br><br>Ovarian cancers may arise from any of the 3 cell types found in normal ovary: the surface epithelium, the germ cells, and the sex cord&#8211;stromal cells. <strong>Surface epithelial tumors</strong> account for the majority of ovarian tumors, of which the serous subtype is the most common. Serous tumors are more commonly seen in women between 45 and 65 years of age. Risk factors for developing epithelial carcinomas of the ovary include older <strong>age</strong>, early menarche or late menopause, genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1 and BRCA2), Lynch syndrome, nulliparity, and endometriosis. On gross examination, the mass is cystic, multilocular with serous/bloody fluid, and contains soft friable papillary projections.

      "solution": "This African-American patient with anemia, recent history of malaria prophylaxis, and family history of a maternal uncle with similar symptoms, has <strong>glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency</strong>. G6PD deficiency is an <strong>X-linked recessive</strong> disorder characterized by decreased levels of the enzyme G6PD. Males are almost exclusively affected by the disease, and females are carriers of the disease. It is most common in individuals of <strong>African</strong>, <strong>Mediterranean</strong>, and <strong>Asian&#160;</strong>descent. &#160; <br><br>G6PD deficiency leads to hemolysis by making erythrocytes more susceptible to damage caused by free radicals. <strong>Free radicals</strong>, which are products of metabolism, can destroy erythrocytes but are normally neutralized in the body by a molecule called <strong>glutathione</strong>. For this to occur, glutathione must be in the reduced state where it can donate protons and electrons to the free radicals and convert them to H2O2. However, this reaction causes glutathione to become oxidized, and for it to be reused, it must be converted back to the reduced state. This is done by an enzyme called glutathione reductase, which uses <strong>NADPH&#160;</strong>to reduce oxidized glutathione and converts NADPH into NADP+. To replenish the NADPH and allow for more glutathione to be reduced, <strong>G6PD&#160;</strong>reduces NADP+ back to NADPH. Therefore, low levels of G6PD, as in this patient, would lead to low levels of NADPH, decreased activity of glutathione reductase, decreased levels of reduced glutathione, and increased susceptibility to hemolytic episodes caused by free radicals. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/peyzmGxgQo__yPnaXZdGwvX0R6msMzxV/_.png\"></div><br><br>Some common triggers of G6PD include <strong>oxidant stressors</strong>, such as infections, metabolic acidosis, fava beans, soy products, red wine, <strong>antimalarials&#160;</strong>(primaquine and chloroquine), anti-inflammatories (aspirin and ibuprofen), quinidine, and sulfonamides (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ucBfVrbpTMCdebPJWTvi4ZqWTOSL_wSC/_.png\"></div><br><br>Peripheral blood smear of patients with G6PD deficiency shows <strong>degmacytes</strong>, also known as <strong>bite cells</strong>.

It should be suspected in women of reproductive age with risk factors for a tubal pregnancy, including the previous history of tubal pregnancy, IUD use, sterilization, and history of tubal disease.
