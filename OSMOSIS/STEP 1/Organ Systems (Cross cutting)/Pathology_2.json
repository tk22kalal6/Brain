      "solution": "This patient in this vignette has concerning features for an <strong>aortic dissection</strong> given her risk factors of uncontrolled <strong>hypertension</strong>, in addition to the associated clinical features of a <strong>widened pulse pressure&#160;</strong>and characteristic <strong>neurologic deficits</strong>. Patients with aortic dissections classically present with sudden onset, sharp or<strong>&#160;tearing chest pain&#160;</strong>that <strong>radiates to the back</strong>, syncope, <strong>widened pulse pressure</strong>, and occasionally <strong>differing blood pressure</strong> in the upper extremities with associated<strong>&#160;neurologic deficits</strong>. &#160;<br><br>Aortic dissections are caused by prolonged hydrodynamic shear stress on the intima of the vessel, which eventually creates a tear in the intimal layer and a column of blood gains access into the aortic media. With repetitive hydrodynamic stress the column of blood longitudinally tears through the media either retrograde (towards the heart), anterograde (away from the heart), or both. Eventually, the hematoma compresses on adjacent structures depending on where the dissection travels. For example, it may compress the brachiocephalic trunk or carotid arteries causing a <strong>stroke</strong>, or if proximal it may compress the right coronary artery causing an <strong>inferior wall MI</strong>, as in this patient with changes consistent with an NSTEMI. The hematoma may progress into the pericardium, causing <strong>pericardial tamponade</strong>. &#160;<br><br>The most common risk factor aortic dissection is <strong>uncontrolled hypertension</strong>, likely precipitated by her chronic cocaine. Genetic risk factors include a history of connective tissue diseases likely <strong>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</strong> or <strong>Marfan syndrome</strong>, which predispose to an already weakened aorta from <strong>thoracic aortic aneurysms</strong>. Infectious or inflammatory risk factors include Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Beh&#231;et disease, and syphilis, which also weaken the aortic intima and predispose to intimal tearing. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/lB9uAJr9QtWbUsMVBfpQUjKRQ2SH8iKt/_.png\"></div><br><br>&#160;The diagnosis of aortic dissection is made by careful physical examination, history, in addition to imaging findings of a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray and a visible dissection flap on <strong>CT-angiography</strong> of the aorta.

A glomus body (or glomus apparatus) is an element of the dermis involved in <strong>body temperature regulation</strong>. Glomus bodies are prevalent in the fingers and toes. Patients with glomus tumors typically present with nail dystrophy and a subungual pink/purple vascular nodule associated with cold sensitivity, <strong>paroxysmal pain</strong> (i.e. sudden painful attacks), and tenderness. Subungual glomus tumors are particularly painful. Glomus tumors of the fingers and toes can be seen in approximately 5% of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or can arise sporadically. &#160;<br><br>The diagnosis is usually based upon the clinical appearance and symptoms, and treatment is surgical excision.

      "solution": "This patient with a history of chronic <strong>polyvinyl chloride exposure&#160;</strong>(PVC industry) and nonspecific abdominal pain likely has liver angiosarcoma. <strong>Angiosarcoma&#160;</strong>is a rare malignant vascular neoplasm of the endothelial-type cells that line vessel walls. &#160;<br><br>The pathogenesis of angiosarcoma is characterized by a rapid and extensively infiltrating overgrowth of vascular epithelial cells. Common angiosarcoma locations include the liver, kidney, lung, and breast. In the liver, the tumor cells tend to grow along sinusoids and branches of the portal and hepatic veins. Immunostaining typically shows positivity for vascular markers, including ERG transcription factor, <strong>CD31</strong>, CD34, and factor VIII antigen. The most common cause of liver angiosarcoma is the prolonged exposure to <strong>vinyl chloride</strong> monomers (i.e., weatherstripping material, plastic pipes) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Other less common causes include arsenic, anabolic steroids, radiation, and thorium dioxide. &#160;<br><br>The imaging modality of choice for diagnosing angiosarcoma will depend on the location. For liver angiosarcoma, the imaging modality of choice is <strong>MRI </strong>or enhanced<strong> CT scan</strong>. On CT scan, findings suggestive of angiosarcoma may include vascular invasion, nodular enhancement (common), and a hypoattenuating mass. &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cholangiocarcinoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Cholangiocarcinoma is an adenocarcinoma arising from biliary epithelium that lines the bile ducts. It is associated with Clonorchis sinensis infection and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Abdominal ultrasound may demonstrate biliary duct dilatation, but small lesions are difficult to visualize. Immunohistochemically, the majority of cholangiocarcinomas are positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hepatic adenoma &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Hepatic adenomas are rare, benign liver tumors arising from hepatocytes. Oral contraceptives and steroids are commonly associated with hepatic adenomas. These tumors are hormone-induced, and thus they tend to regress if the patient stops the medication. The most common symptom is pain due to compression of adjacent structures, but they may result in life-threatening intra-abdominal bleeding. On ultrasound, hepatic adenomas typically present as a solitary, well-demarcated, heterogeneous mass. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hepatocellular carcinoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer. HCC is strongly associated with chronic HBV/HCV infections and alcoholic cirrhosis. Increased alpha-fetoprotein (&gt;500 ng/mL) is seen in 70% of patients with HCC. In this case, the patient is negative for hepatitis B/C and has normal alpha-fetoprotein levels, making HCC unlikely. &#160; &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Liver angiosarcoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Liver metastasis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Liver metastasis is far more common than primary liver tumors. Primary tumors that tend to send metastasis to the liver include colon, stomach, and pancreas. Patients with liver metastases are either asymptomatic or present with abdominal pain and unintentional weight loss. On imaging, metastasis usually presents as multiple lesions rather than a solitary mass. In this case, the patient's medical history of polyvinyl chloride exposure favors liver angiosarcoma. &#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "<strong>Diverticulitis&#160;</strong>refers to an inflammation of outpouchings in the colon known as diverticula. Diverticulosis and diverticulitis are diseases primarily seen in Western nations, and they are thought to be due to <strong>diets low in fiber</strong>. The exact pathogenic mechanism for diverticula formation is unknown, but one theory suggests that diverticula form in response to increased intracolonic pressures generated when the colon is processing smaller, non&#8211;fiber-containing stools. This increased pressure eventually pushes out part of the colon, forming sac-like appendages at the weakest segments, at the point where the colon is fed by blood vessels called the <strong>vasa recta</strong>. &#160;<br><br>When a diverticulum becomes obstructed with a small amount of stool, this leads to stasis, inflammation, and infection. Most cases of diverticulitis classically present with focal left lower quadrant abdominal pain and the generalized symptoms of malaise, low grade fevers, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. Uncomplicated diverticulitis involving microperforations can be diagnosed clinically and responds well to outpatient oral antibiotic therapy. Patients with concern for complicated diverticulitis involving macro-perforations, failure of outpatient therapy, or diagnostic uncertainty should undergo <strong>CT of the abdomen and pelvis with both IV and oral contrast</strong>, and they should then be admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics. Risk factors for the development of complicated diverticulitis include <strong>older age, failure of outpatient therapy, and immunocompromised patients</strong>. If left untreated, diverticulitis can progress to <strong>fistula&#160;</strong>formation and the development of intra-abdominal <strong>abscesses</strong>, leading to sepsis. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/aIjfdFmaTm_hmRC8GZFfkGIZQkKXNsnx/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Rupture of vasa recta into the colonic lumen:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This answer choice describes the pathophysiology of diverticular bleeding, which usually presents with painless hematochezia.

Pulmonary embolism occurs when a distal thrombus, usually from the deep veins of the legs (DVT), dislodges and enters the pulmonary circulation through the right side of the heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Symptoms include sudden, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. If the PE is large enough, blood cannot pass through to the left side of the heart, and the decreased left ventricular preload reduces cardiac output, causing severe hypotension, as in this patient. Since the outflow of the right ventricle (RV) is blocked by a clot, the pressure in the RV suddenly increases (causing the murmur of tricuspid regurgitation) and the RV wall stretches, which stretches cardiac conduction fibers, delaying ventricular conduction in the right side of the heart. On ECG, this appears as a <strong>right bundle branch block (RBBB).&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>RBBB is recognized on ECG by a broad QRS ( &gt;120 msec), RSR&#8217; pattern in V1-3 (&#8216;M-shaped&#8217; QRS complex) and wide, slurred S wave in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5-V6): &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/FhU4r9iQTamAIkh2bjY8BGB-QGm5bf4_/_.png\"></div><br><br>Other causes of RBBB include pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), cor pulmonale (from COPD or interstitial lung disease), and, rarely, myocardial infarction (the right bundle branch is supplied from septal perforators of the LAD coronary artery). &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Left bundle branch block (LBBB)&#160;</strong>occurs on the left side of the heart, and usually develops over time in the setting of long standing hypertension and coronary artery disease.

Because of his hypotension and severe symptoms, synchronized cardioversion was indicated to revert his heart rate back to a normal sinus rhythm, though unfortunately it was unsuccessful. SMVT occurs most commonly in patients with <strong>coronary artery disease (CAD)</strong>, and it can happen with a heart attack. Among patients with diabetes (either type), cardiovascular disease (including CAD and stroke) is the leading cause of death. &#160; <br><br>Generally, the chronic complications of diabetes can be broken down into two distinct pathways: 1) non-enzymatic glycosylation, and 2) osmotic cellular damage. &#160;<br><br><ol><li><strong>&#160;Non-enzymatic glycosylation (NEG)&#160;</strong>occurs when glucose covalently attaches to cell proteins and lipids, without the help of an enzyme. &#160;These sugar coated molecules are pro-inflammatory and can cause damage to the cell. &#160;NEG in small blood vessels like arterioles causes hyaline arteriolosclerosis, in which the walls of arterioles develop protein deposits that make the vessels hard and inflexible. In addition, the basement membrane of blood vessels can thicken, making it hard for oxygen to easily move to the tissues, resulting in hypoxia. NEG causes retinopathy and nodular glomerulosclerosis (microvascular complications), as well as CAD, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease (macrovascular complications).</li></ol><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/8hCmdTGwQ1mZ0p-A76w-40pYQDCOGjz3/_.png\"></div><br><br>2. The next mechanism is <strong>osmotic cellular damage</strong>. Normally, when glucose enters cells, it can be converted to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase. Sorbitol is an osmotic agent, meaning it attracts water into the cells. As a protective mechanism, some cells are able to convert sorbitol to fructose with the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase; however, the cells of the lens, the pericytes in the retina, Schwann cells and renal epithelial cells lack this enzyme. &#160;<br><br><br><br>Therefore, in the lens, sorbitol build up causes cataracts, while damage to the Schwann cells causes diabetic neuropathy (microvascular complications). Autonomic neuropathy, caused by a mix of NEG and osmotic damage to autonomic ganglia, can lead to diabetic gastroparesis, which is weakness of the gastric peristalsis, resulting in nausea and vomiting after meals. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Alveolar wall destruction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Alveolar wall destruction occurs in the setting of emphysema and the inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Nipple pain, nipple retraction, bloody discharge and/or pruritus may also be present. Some patients can present without a mammogram or mass on a physical exam. Patients should be evaluated with imaging and biopsy. Nipple scrape cytology is sufficient for diagnosis, but full-thickness wedge or punch biopsy of the nipple is often performed to establish the diagnosis. Wedge biopsy, which includes the lactiferous ducts, can help identify underlying ductal carcinoma as the etiology.

Cardiac tamponade occurs when large amounts of fluid accumulates between the layers of the pericardium (pericardial effusion) resulting in external compression of the heart. Common etiologies include infectious, trauma, metabolic, autoimmune, cancer or idiopathic. The presentation may be acute and develop over minutes (e.g. trauma) or subacute, which develops over hours to days (e.g., uremia, post-viral) when enough fluid accumulates. &#160;<br><br><strong>Pulsus paradoxus&#160;</strong>is defined as a large decrease in systolic blood pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) on inspiration, a finding often observed in cardiac tamponade; it is the direct consequence of <strong>ventricular interdependence</strong>. During inspiration, the fall in intrathoracic pressure produces a &#8220;sucking effect&#8221; which increases the venous return to the right heart. Under normal conditions, the pericardium can accommodate minor changes in heart volume with little impact on the left side of the heart. However, in conditions that limit the ability of the heart to expand (e.g., tamponade, constrictive pericarditis), the increased volume during inspiration causes bowing of the interventricular septum towards the left ventricle. This results in <strong>decreased end-diastolic volume</strong> (diastolic dysfunction) and <strong>lower stroke volume</strong>, manifested by a drop in systolic blood pressure. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/iZcX2MRSR2eYlgY6Kk9XBHNCToaY3z4l/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/74On-WvCRXeWKGVYwAdTDbIlQ2m_hofZ/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Ventricular interdependence:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve can be observed in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), the most common cause of death in young athletes.

Asthma typically presents as an episodic disorder caused by inflammation and hyperresponsiveness of the bronchial smooth muscle, leading to <strong>reversible bronchoconstriction.</strong> Although the specific causes of asthma are ultimately unknown, it is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors (e.g., air pollution, cigarette smoke, allergens). &#160;<br><br>An asthma attack is characterized by severe dyspnea and wheezing due to bronchoconstriction and mucus plugging, which leads to trapping of air in distal airways with progressive hyperinflation of the lungs. Most cases of asthma exacerbations can be treated with bronchodilators (e.g. albuterol) and glucocorticoids. In rare cases, patients with attacks refractory to treatment may show signs of impending respiratory failure such as<strong>&#160;absence of breath sounds</strong> due to respiratory fatigue, inappropriately low respiratory rate, and depressed mental status (<strong>lethargy&#160;</strong>or agitation) due to <strong>increasing partial pressure of carbon dioxide</strong>.

During these chronic states of inflammation, there is increased production of cytokines, in particular hepcidin. Hepcidin causes reduced iron uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as decreased release of iron from macrophages.

The classic presentation is painless late-pregnancy vaginal bleeding. Normally, the placenta implants in the upper uterus, and although it is unclear why it implants in the lower uterus in placenta previa, one hypothesis suggests that areas of suboptimal vascularity in the upper uterine cavity from previous damage (e.g. surgery) promotes implantation in the lower part. Significant risk factors include <strong>previous cesarean deliveries</strong>, <strong>previous uterine surgery</strong>, <strong>multiple gestations</strong>, and <strong>previous placenta previa</strong>. It is important to note that the presence of pain and tender uterus makes the diagnosis of placenta previa unlikely. &#160; <br><br>The vast majority of placenta previas are identified on <strong>ultrasound&#160;</strong>examination before 20 weeks gestation and typically resolve spontaneously before delivery. In asymptomatic patients &lt; 37 weeks of gestation, management includes follow up with transvaginal ultrasound. If the previa resolves, routine prenatal care can resume. In unstable patients with severe bleeding or evidence of fetal distress, emergent cesarean surgery is indicated. In patients whose previa does not resolve, cesarean section is the preferred method of delivery to avoid postpartum hemorrhage. <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/1Sy1xJUeTLiIWYKk-UgPZumpTZ_ARuvB/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ False labor&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>\"False labor,\" also known as Braxton-Hicks contractions, refers to regular or irregular painful contractions without cervical dilation.

The main concern in postmenopausal women who present with an adnexal mass is to exclude malignancy. &#160; <br><br>Following a thorough history and physical exam, there are 4 steps that can assist in determining the management. First, an ultrasound should be obtained to determine if the mass is likely benign (simple cyst) or malignant (complex cyst). The differences in sonographic features are summarized in the table below. Complex cysts typically have<strong>&#160;internal vascularity</strong>, which can be seen on Doppler ultrasonography. As neoplastic cells proliferate and grow, their metabolic needs increase, resulting in increased blood vessel formation and growth. &#160; <br><br>The next step is to determine if there is a physiological process that can account for the mass (e.g. hemorrhagic physiologic cyst). The third step is to determine if there are characteristics of a specific entity (e.g. endometrioma usually demonstrates echoes in a cystic mass). The last step is to determine if there is a need for a follow-up ultrasound or additional testing. A repeat of pelvic ultrasound is useful when physiologic processes are still in the differential diagnosis. An MRI should be considered if the results on ultrasound are equivocal. &#160; <br><br>If the mass appears to be malignant, testing for <strong>serum CA-125</strong> has a higher specificity for ovarian malignancy when combined with imaging.

This &#8220;whorled&#8221; appearance of collagen fibers is characteristic of silicosis. &#160;<br><br><strong>Pneumoconiosis</strong> refers to a set of restrictive lung diseases and interstitial fibrosis induced by types of inhaled inorganic particulate matter. The major types of pneumoconiosis are<strong>&#160;asbestosis, silicosis, and coal workers pneumoconiosis</strong>. Berylliosis is often classified as a pneumoconiosis as well; however, its pathogenesis is mediated by a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Regardless of the type, the pathogenesis of disease is similar. Inhaled particulate matter becomes impacted at distal airway bifurcations, where alveolar macrophages attempt to phagocytose and digest the foreign material. More often than not, the alveolar macrophage is unable to effectively clear the foreign material, triggering an immune response. Secretion of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors results in <strong>collagen deposition by fibroblasts, scar tissue formation, and interstitial hardening</strong>. Over time, this process manifests with an impaired diffusion interface for gas exchange, decreased lung compliance, and a <strong>restrictive lung disease</strong> pattern. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Failure to phagocytose inhaled particles&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Alveolar insult and formation of hyaline membranes&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) results in the development of hyaline membranes and diffuse interstitial edema.

This weakness can present as difficult rising from a chair, lifting one&#8217;s arms, climbing stairs, or combing one&#8217;s hair. &#160; <br><br>Several skin findings may be present. A purplish rash on the upper eyelids, called a <strong>&#8220;heliotrope rash,&#8221;</strong> can often be observed.

Less commonly, the patient may have a <strong>malar rash</strong> (erythema of the cheeks and bridge of the nose with sparing of the nasolabial folds), classically in the shape of butterfly. Another classic finding is the <strong>Gottron sign&#160;</strong>which consists of flat, red, scaly papules over the back of the fingers, elbows, or knees. &#160;<br><br>Dermatomyositis occurs when the body produces <strong>self-antibodies&#160;</strong>against autoantigens in the muscle and skin. Many of the autoantibodies attach to endothelial cells lining the capillaries near the perimysium (connective tissue sheath surrounding groups of muscle fibers). This process <strong>activates the complement cascade&#160;</strong>and causes the targeted cells to lyse. Dermatomyositis can occur secondarily as a paraneoplastic syndrome of an underlying <strong>malignancy</strong>, such as Hodgkin lymphoma as well as lung, stomach, colorectal, and ovarian cancer; therefore, patients with additional constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss, night sweats) should be suspected of having an underlying malignancy. &#160; &#160;.<br><br><strong>Muscle biopsies&#160;</strong>are often performed in the work-up and reveal <strong>perimysial infiltration.</strong> Given the condition&#8217;s antibody-mediated pathogenesis, the infiltrate will consist of<strong>&#160;CD4+ T-cells</strong> (which regulate antibody production) and <strong>antibody-producing B-cells. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br><strong><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/N3aIwUh1Q8iELwASCfxoI9VbSEiL0Gv2/_.png\"></div></strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Muscle biopsy revealing perimysial CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Muscle biopsy revealing endomysial CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>&#160;Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Endomysial infiltration by CD8+ lymphocytes is consistent with the presentation of polymyositis.

These findings are consistent with <strong>Cushing syndrome</strong> secondary to a cortisol-producing <strong>adrenal tumor</strong>, which would manifest with <strong>elevated serum cortisol levels</strong>. The high cortisol levels suppress hypothalamic <strong>corticotropin-releasing hormone</strong> (CRH) production and anterior pituitary <strong>adrenocorticotropic hormone</strong> (ACTH) production.<br><br>The first step in the work-up of hypercortisolism is to measure<strong>&#160;free cortisol</strong> in a <strong>24-hour urine sample</strong>. Alternatively, <strong>blood&#160;</strong><strong>or saliva tests</strong> at midnight can help check if there is a normal daily rise and fall of cortisol levels. Another option is the<strong>&#160;low-dose dexamethasone suppression test.</strong> During the test, the individual is given a low dose of dexamethasone, an exogenous steroid that suppresses pituitary ACTH production. In healthy individuals, this would cause a decrease in serum cortisol levels.<br><br>If any of the aforementioned tests yield abnormal results, the next step is to determine the exact cause of excess cortisol production. This involves measuring<strong>&#160;plasma ACTH levels</strong>. Low ACTH levels are seen in adrenal adenomas, adrenal carcinomas, and exogenous glucocorticoid use. In contrast, high ACTH levels are seen in patients with Cushing disease (ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma) and ectopic ACTH production.

The patient often exhibits an abnormal <strong>waddling gait</strong> and<strong>&#160;pseudohypertrophy of the calf muscles</strong> (fibrofatty replacement of muscles). <strong>Gower sign</strong> is classic for DMD.<br><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/qTXdlSQnR6Cz8XkZ3RSRWBu0QlWkngK3/_.png\"></div><br><br>Later symptoms include <strong>wheelchair dependence</strong> by the age of 12, <strong>respiratory failure&#160;</strong>because of a weak diaphragm, scoliosis, and <strong>dilated cardiomyopathy</strong> and arrhythmias, since the dystrophin protein is also expressed in heart muscle. Respiratory failure was previously the most common cause of death, but because of improvements in respiratory and spinal care, heart failure has superseded it as the most common cause of death. Complications often lead to a shortened lifespan. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Missense mutation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Missense mutation refers to the base substitution code of one amino acid for a different amino acid one.

The <strong>transillumination test</strong>, which is performed by shining a light behind the scrotum, confirms the mass being solid, as light is blocked by the mass. If a firm mass is identified, a scrotal ultrasound should be performed, as <strong>ultrasound</strong> is the first-line imaging in patients that present with a testicular abnormality.

      "solution": "<strong>Asthma</strong> is characterized by <strong>reversible bronchoconstriction&#160;</strong>caused by inflammation and hyperresponsiveness of the bronchial smooth muscle. The condition arises due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors (e.g., air pollution, cigarette smoke, allergens), which predisposes patients with asthma to <strong>type I hypersensitivity reactions. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Asthma begins when a trigger (e.g. allergen) causes excessive activation of<strong>&#160;type 2 helper T cells</strong> (Th2 cells) and prompts them to produce cytokines (IL-4, IL-13). These cytokines stimulate plasma cells to produce IgE antibodies, which then coat the surface of<strong>&#160;mast cells.</strong> On reexposure to the allergen, the IgEs cross-link, and the mast cells release intracellular granules containing histamines, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. Mast cell-derived inflammatory mediators produce two waves of reaction, an early-phase and a late-phase: &#160;<br><br>- The <strong>early-phase reaction&#160;</strong>is characterized by bronchoconstriction, mucus production, and edema, leading to airway obstruction. &#160;<br>- The<strong>&#160;late-phase reaction</strong> is mainly inflammatory and is characterized by recruitment of leukocytes (<strong>eosinophils</strong>, basophils, lymphocytes) to the reaction site. These leukocytes release additional inflammatory mediators, such as major basic protein, which causes epithelial damage. &#160;<br><br>Initially, these inflammatory changes are reversible. However, over time, irreversible changes take place. These include scarring and fibrosis of the airways, as well as smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, which ultimately result in airway narrowing.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/sc58fCNrSl6wdyZgvH4tlt--RLe-uPzX/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Mast cells:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Eosinophils:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Eosinophils play an integral role in the pathophysiology of asthma and are involved in the late-phase reaction.

Symptoms typically present between ages 20 and 50 and include chorea, athetosis, aggression, depression, and dementia. Chorea is defined as a rapid, involuntary, arrhythmic, <strong>disorganized movement</strong> with variable speed, timing, and direction. Most commonly, it involves the distal extremities, but it also affects the trunk and face. Athetosis is a slow, continuous, involuntary writhing movement of the fingers, hands, toes, and less commonly, the arms, legs, neck, and tongue. The term \"choreoathetosis\" is used when chorea and athetosis coexist. &#160;<br><br>The structures that have been associated with chorea include the putamen, caudate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, and their interconnecting pathways. The basal ganglia system is important in regulating movement. Damage or malfunction of these structures disrupts the balance between the indirect and direct pathways in the basal ganglia circuitry, leading to excessive dopaminergic activity. Disruption to the indirect pathway results in loss of inhibition to the globus pallidus which in turn allows hyperkinetic movements to occur. Chorea, athetosis, and ballism often coexist in the same patient and are considered to be a part of the choreiform spectrum. &#160; &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/BzvbLmd3R9OkVCsn6n8J0bYuQeSZn1li/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Akathisia:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Akathisia refers to an inner sense of restlessness that manifests as an intense desire to move.

A molar pregnancy can be categorized as a complete mole or partial mole, which differ by pathogenesis, gross morphology, histopathology, karyotype, and risk of malignancy. Patients often present with vaginal bleeding and hyperemesis gravidarum. Although benign, molar pregnancy increases the risk for invasive disease (e.g., choriocarcinoma, invasive mole). The risk is higher with a complete mole. Treatment is evacuation, which is both therapeutic and diagnostic. Monitoring hCG following treatment is required to detect signs of invasive disease. At the same time, contraceptives are used to prevent confusion with normal pregnancies. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/pjkpUOGXT5G0Nou7g78KPNNuTUyk-6ly/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Choriocarcinoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Choriocarcinoma is an invasive trophoblastic neoplasia composed of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts without villi.

Factitious hypoglycemia refers to the surreptitious use of insulin or insulin secretagogues like sulfonylureas or meglitinides, often for secondary gain. This patient has a son with type 1 diabetes, therefore she has easy access to insulin, rather than insulin secretagogues, since the latter have no role in treating type 1 diabetes. &#160;<br><br>To test for the cause of hypoglycemia in any patient, the serum levels of <strong>insulin</strong>, <strong>proinsulin</strong>, and <strong>C-peptide</strong> must be measured. C-peptide is cleaved by from proinsulin to make insulin, so C-peptide is a byproduct of endogenous insulin production in the beta-cells. High insulin levels but relatively low (or normal) C-peptide means the hypoglycemia is caused by exogenous insulin. In contrast, high insulin and high C-peptide levels indicate that the problem is coming from an insulinoma, an insulin-producing beta cell tumor, or insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia, in the case of very high levels. Sulfonylureas and meglitinides also result in a similar biochemical profile (high insulin, high c-peptide), as the beta cells respond to them by increasing endogenous insulin release, and thus you need to specifically test for the presence of the drug or its metabolites. &#160; &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/YF2fcX8xSCybQ0zd3kv1YslhRcC_f4rC/_.png\"></div><br>Regardless of the cause, hypoglycemia can be extremely dangerous.

Sarcoidosis is a type of restrictive lung disease, of the <strong>diffuse parenchymal lung disease</strong> subtype. These patients present with usual parameters of restrictive lung disease (decreased TLC, increased FEV1/FVC, and decreased RV) in addition to a<strong>&#160;decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (D<span>LCO</span>) and increased arterial -alveolar gradient (A-a gradient).&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br><strong>Diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD)</strong> refers to a subtype of restrictive lung diseases characterized by fibrotic, rigid lungs with <strong>decreased compliance and increased elasticity</strong>. The causes of DPLD are numerous and include sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, vasculitis such as Goodpasture syndrome and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and drug toxicities (e.g. amiodarone). Regardless of the etiology, scarring and fibrosis of lung parenchyma results in stiff lungs that cannot adequately fill during inhalation. On pulmonary function testing, this restriction manifests with decreased TLC, decreased RV, and a decreased FEV1. Due to increased elasticity of lung tissue in this disease state, the FEV1 or volume of air exhaled over one second, increases in proportion to the forced vital capacity. &#160;<br><br>The distinguishing feature of DPLD from other forms of restrictive lung disease is a decreased DLCO and increased A-a gradient. The DLCO refers to how easily gases are transferred between the alveoli and the bloodstream using carbon monoxide as a surrogate marker. Fibrosis at the alveolar-capillary level impairs gas transfer and increases the A-a gradient, or difference between the amount of oxygen in the alveoli and the bloodstream. &#160;<br><br>During respiration, affected portions of the lung receive less oxygen, resulting in reflexive pulmonary vasoconstriction to shunt blood towards more adequately ventilated areas of the lung. Over time, this shunting results in <strong>pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy</strong>, and subsequent <strong>right heart failure or cor pulmonale. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;&#160;Total Lung Capacity (TLC)&#160;&#160;Forced expiratory volume in one second/Forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC)&#160;&#160;Residual volume (RV)&#160;&#160;Diffusing capacity for CO (DLCO)&#160;&#160;Arterial -alveolar gradient (A-a gradient)&#160;&#160;&#8595;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160;&#160;&#8595;&#160;&#160;&#8595;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;&#160;Total Lung Capacity (TLC)&#160;&#160;Forced expiratory volume in one second/Forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC)&#160;&#160;Residual volume (RV)&#160;&#160;Diffusing capacity for CO (DLCO)&#160;&#160;Arterial -alveolar gradient (A-a gradient)&#160;&#8593; &#160; &#8595;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160;&#160;normalnormal&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Obstructive lung diseases, not restrictive lung diseases, present with these parameters.

      "solution": "This patient, who works in a <strong>foundry</strong>, presents with increasing dyspnea on exertion. His chest x-ray demonstrates <strong>nodular opacities of the upper lobes</strong>, consistent with silicosis. This pneumoconiosis is known to increase the<strong>&#160;risk of pulmonary tuberculosis</strong> by three fold, due to silica&#8217;s ability to <strong>disrupt phagolysosome formation</strong>. Mycobacterial infection, particularly tuberculosis, is a well-established complication of silicosis and should be suspected when a patient with silicosis develops constitutional symptoms, worsening respiratory impairment, hemoptysis, or changes in the chest radiograph. &#160;<br><br><strong>Silicosis&#160;</strong>refers to a fibrotic pneumoconiosis caused by the inhalation of fine particles of crystalline silicon dioxide. Patients at increased susceptibility to inhalation of these particles include those who work in foundries, sandblasting, and silica mines. Development of silicosis occurs when these crystalline particles become lodged in small airways. Alveolar macrophages attempt to remove the particles and initiate a cascade of inflammation resulting in collagen deposition and fibrosis surrounding the silicate particles, forming <strong>silicotic nodules</strong>. As these nodules mature, the center becomes a dense fibrotic scar, giving rise to an &#8220;onion skin&#8221; appearance. Unless exposure is terminated, these nodules eventually merge, resulting in<strong>&#160;diffuse lung fibrosis. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Clinically, silicosis manifests most commonly with dyspnea or a non-productive cough. As fibrosis progresses, more severe complications may occur including hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale. Diagnosis of silicosis rests on history, physiologic, radiographic, and histologic findings. Patients will often have restrictive physiology on pulmonary function testing, as well as <strong>nodular opacities and hilar lymph node calcification of the upper lobes</strong>. Lung biopsy will typically demonstrate <strong>birefringent particles of silica surrounded by fibrosis</strong>. Treatment of silicosis involves removal from the exposure and supportive care. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Ek-2-sxrQsmgXx0DX2UMO31FRgu5xFI2/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Pulmonary tuberculosis&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Mesothelioma&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Asbestos exposure is associated with the development of mesothelioma&#8212;a malignancy of the arising from the pleura.

It is categorized into <strong>nephrogenic DI&#160;</strong>and <strong>central DI</strong>. Nephrogenic DI occurs when V2 receptors develop resistance to ADH. It is often caused by medications (e.g. lithium, demeclocycline) and electrolyte anomalies (e.g. hypokalemia, hypercalcemia). In contrast, central DI is caused by a lack of ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary. It can be idiopathic or secondary to brain malignancies, pituitary ischemia or CNS infections. &#160; <br><br>Individuals with DI present with <strong>mild hypernatremia, high-normal serum osmolality,</strong> and<strong> low urine osmolality</strong>. A trial of desmopressin (an ADH analog) administration helps in differentiating central from nephrogenic DI. In the former, the urine osmolality tends to rise after administering desmopressin, while there is no change in the latter. This patient&#8217;s persistently low urine osmolality and high serum osmolality after administration of desmopressin is consistent with <strong>nephrogenic DI.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Resistance of kidney V2 receptors to antidiuretic hormone (ADH):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inadequate ADH secretion from the pituitary gland:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This answer describes central diabetes insipidus (DI).

Adenomatous polyps are characterized by the presence of epithelial dysplasia. They are caused by a mutation in <strong>adenomatous polyposis coli&#160;</strong>(APC), a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 5 that is responsible for regulating cell growth and adhesion. The two predictors of a polyp&#8217;s likelihood of undergoing malignant transformation are: <strong>1)&#160;</strong>size and<strong>&#160;2)</strong> histological appearance. &#160; <br><br><strong>Increasing polyp size</strong> is the most important characteristic that correlates with malignancy risk. Adenomatous polyps less than 1-cm are less likely to acquire subsequent mutations and undergo malignant transformation. In contrast, adenomatous polyps greater than 4-cm are much more likely to progress to adenocarcinoma. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Furthermore, based on histological appearance, there are three types of adenomatous polyps: villous, tubular, and tubulovillous. <strong>Villous polyps,</strong> which have a cauliflower-like appearance, have the highest malignant potential. <strong>Tubular polyps,</strong> which are pedunculated polyps that protrude out into the intestinal lumen, have the lowest malignant potential. <strong>Tubulovillous polyps,&#160;</strong>which have characteristics of both tubular and villous polyps, have an intermediate malignant potential. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Clinically, adenomatous polyps are mostly asymptomatic.

Patients initially present with <strong>constitutional symptoms</strong> (e.g., night sweats, fatigue), followed by symptoms associated with vascular damage. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The pathogenesis is poorly understood but appears to occur in a similar pathogenetic mechanism to temporal arteritis. TA is characterized as an inflammatory <strong>granulomatous vasculitis</strong> of <strong>medium- and large-sized arteries</strong>, which leads to transmural fibrous thickening of the arterial walls, resulting in multiple vascular obstructions and eventual <strong>ischemic</strong> changes. Arterial wall inflammation is characterized by a predominance of CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages, which undergo granulomatous organization and formation of giant cells. The inflammation induces vascular remodeling that leads to intimal hyperplasia and lumen occlusion. &#160; <br><br>The following features may be seen: &#160;<ul><li>&#160;Constitutional symptoms: low-grade fever, weight loss, fatigue&#160;</li><li>&#160;Cardiovascular: <strong>Absent or weak peripheral pulses</strong>, limb claudication, <strong>blood pressure discrepancy between arms,</strong> hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction&#160;</li><li>&#160;Musculoskeletal: arthralgias, myalgias&#160;</li><li>&#160;Dermatological: skin lesions similar to erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum&#160;</li><li>&#160;Neurologic symptoms, caused by involvement of the carotid and vertebral arteries: lightheadedness, vertigo, syncope, headaches, and strokes&#160;</li><li>&#160;Laboratory findings: elevated ESR, CRP, anemia of chronic disease, thrombocytosis and leukocytosis&#160;</li></ul>Since TA is primarily an autoimmune condition, initial treatment of symptomatic TA begins with <strong>corticosteroids</strong>.

In addition, assessment of this patient&#8217;s acid-base status reveals an anion gap metabolic acidosis. However, further assessment is required to determine which major disorder is present and whether the degree of compensation is appropriate. If compensation is not appropriate, a second (i.e. mixed) acid-base disorder is likely present.<br><br>For our patient, we first look at the pH, which is 7.30 (low), which tells us the patient is acidotic. The direction of the pH and HCO<sub>3&#160;</sub>change tell us whether the primary disturbance is metabolic or respiratory. Because her pH is low and her HCO<sub>3</sub> low, we can tell that she has a metabolic acidosis. Now that we know she has metabolic acidosis, we check her anion gap (Na - Cl + HCO<sub>3</sub>), which is 20 (high). Therefore, her primary acid-base disturbance is a<strong>&#160;high anion gap metabolic acidosis</strong>. Now that we know the primary disturbance, we check for a concurrent disturbance (i.e. a second or mixed acid-base imbalance) by assessing the degree of compensation.<br><br>We can calculate if the <strong>respiratory compensation</strong> is adequate by using <strong>Winter&#8217;s formula</strong>, in which calculated pCO2 = (1.5 x HCO<sub>3&#160;</sub>+ 8) +/- 2.

Other findings include <strong>hirsutism</strong>, <strong>osteoporosis</strong>, <strong>hyperglycemia&#160;</strong>(insulin resistance), <strong>immunosuppression</strong>, and <strong>skin thinning</strong>. Cushing syndrome refers to the collection of symptoms that result from hypercortisolism. The most common cause is exogenous glucocorticoid intake, leading to iatrogenic Cushing syndrome. The most common endogenous cause of Cushing syndrome is an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor (as in this patient), which is called <strong>Cushing disease</strong>. &#160;<br><br>Initial screening tests for Cushing syndrome can be done by first demonstrating hypercortisolism, either from an elevated <strong>late night salivary cortisol&#160;</strong>or elevated free cortisol on <strong>24-hour urinalysis</strong>. A confirmatory screening step is an overnight <strong>low-dose dexamethasone suppression test</strong>, which, in Cushing syndrome, would demonstrate a cortisol level that is not suppressed. After high levels of cortisol has been confirmed, the next best step is to measure the <strong>ACTH levels</strong>, which determines whether the elevated cortisol is <strong>ACTH dependent&#160;</strong>or <strong>ACTH independent</strong>. If the ACTH levels are low, this is ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome, which could be either iatrogenic or caused by an adrenal mass. &#160;<br><br>If the ACTH is high, this is ACTH-dependant Cushing syndrome. In this case, a <strong>high-dose dexamethasone suppression test</strong> can determine whether the ACTH is coming from the pituitary gland or from an ectopic source (e.g. small cell lung cancer).

These symptoms suggest a diagnosis of <strong>type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)</strong>. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system targets and destroys the beta-cells (insulin-producing cells) of the pancreas. In children, type 1 diabetes occurs in a bimodal distribution, with the first peak between 4-6 years old and the second between 10-14 years old, and it equally affects males and females. &#160;<br><br>Compared to type 2 diabetes, patients with type 1 diabetes have no beta cells, and thus they cannot make any insulin. While treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes initially involves lifestyle modifications to reduce the factors that lead to insulin resistance (obesity, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet), initial treatment for type 1 diabetes is focused on replacing the insulin that the body cannot make. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/6sGHObtXSFyDV--tFn_KlldORpeQkHld/_.png\"></div><br><br>Without insulin, the cells of a patient with type 1 diabetes cannot absorb or utilize glucose, which is necessary for cellular energy metabolism and function. In lieu of glucose, the body creates ketones as a secondary energy source to make up for the glucose starvation. Eventually, these ketones build up and cause an anion gap metabolic acidosis, known as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). &#160;<br><br>This patient, who most likely has type 1 diabetes, requires a <strong>continuous supply of insulin</strong> to prevent the rapid development of DKA. The short-acting insulin prescribed will only last for a few hours a day after each meal. Without the <strong>addition of a long-acting insulin</strong> that is present at some level all the time (especially overnight), this patient will remain at high risk of developing DKA. Long-term effects of diabetes may occur years later (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy), but without a constant insulin supply, DKA is a life-threatening complication in this patient. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hyperglycemic hyperosmotic state:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Hyperglycemic hyperosmotic state (HHS) occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes who experience a stressor (like infection or acute illness), which causes excessive hyperglycemia leading to osmotic polyuria, dehydration, and mental status changes.

This occurs as a result of the production of cold agglutinins, which are autoantibodies that target erythrocyte membranes and mark them for destruction in the spleen. &#160;<br><br>Hemolytic anemias can be classified based on the location of erythrocyte destruction (i.e., <strong>intravascular or extravascular</strong>), as well the etiology of the hemolysis (i.e., intrinsic vs. extrinsic). Extravascular hemolysis is defined by erythrocyte destruction outside of blood vessels, typically in the reticuloendothelial system (i.e. macrophages in the spleen), and intravascular hemolysis is defined by erythrocyte destruction within blood vessels. Extrinsic anemia is defined as hemolysis resulting from a problem outside of the erythrocyte and is typically acquired (e.g., autoimmune, infections, microangiopathic), whereas intrinsic anemia is defined as hemolysis resulting from a problem with the erythrocyte itself and is typically caused by enzyme deficiencies, commonly seen in congenital conditions (e.g., sickle cell disease, G6PD, hereditary spherocytosis). &#160;<br><br>The type of hemolysis present can be determined based on laboratory findings.

Hemoglobinuria and hemosiderinuria can cause kidney damage, and patients may present with back pain. &#160; &#160;<br><br>In <strong>extravascular hemolysis</strong>, erythrocytes are destroyed outside of blood vessels, so <strong>haptoglobin levels are normal </strong>and there is no hemoglobin or hemosiderin in the urine.

Its primary function is to inhibit thrombin (factor IIa), factor Xa, and other factors in the coagulation cascade. <strong>&#160;</strong>Inherited deficiencies are caused by <strong>AT gene mutations</strong> (autosomal dominant). <strong>Acquired deficiencies</strong> are associated with impaired production of AT (e.g., liver disease, warfarin therapy), protein loss (e.g. nephrotic syndrome), or accelerated consumption (e.g. disseminated intravascular coagulation). &#160; <br><br>Patients with AT deficiency are at increased <strong>thrombotic risk&#160;</strong>and are therefore at risk of developing venous or arterial thrombosis, obstetric complications, and stroke. Another feature of the conditions is <strong>insensitivity to heparin</strong>. Normally, heparin enhances the activity of antithrombin, which in turn inhibits thrombin and factor Xa. In patients with AT deficiency <strong>aPTT cannot be adequately prolonged with heparin administration</strong>. Diagnosis is made via AT-heparin cofactor assay, which assesses plasma antithrombin activity. Genetic testing is used in laboratories but not used routinely for diagnosis.

Histopathological examination is required for definitive diagnosis. &#160;<br><br>Chondrosarcoma is a <strong>malignant cartilage-producing tumor</strong>. It usually affects individuals in their 40s or older and more commonly affects men. It usually arises in the axial skeleton, such as the pelvis, shoulder, and ribs. On imaging, chondrosarcoma presents with mixed radiolucent and sclerotic lesions, with a punctate or ring-and-arc pattern of calcifications due to mineralization of the chondroid matrix. Other radiological findings include flocculent densities that destroy the bone cortex and formation of a soft tissue mass. Moreover, while the cortex may be thickened, <strong>periosteal reaction is scant</strong> or absent. &#160;<br><br>It can arise as a primary lesion or secondary to preexisting enchondroma or osteochondroma. Macroscopically, chondrosarcomas are large and bulky, and consist of translucent cartilage with gelatinous areas. Histologically, it produces an abundant cartilage matrix and irregularly shaped lobules of cartilage that permeate the bony trabeculae. Cellularity, cytologic atypia, and mitotic activity vary depending on the grading. Treatment usually involves wide surgical excision with or without chemotherapy. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Osteosarcoma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the bone. The tumor produces an osteoid matrix or mineralized bone. Osteosarcoma follows a bimodal age distribution, with a first peak seen in persons younger than 20 years of age and a smaller peak in older adults. In adolescents, it often arises in the metaphyseal regions of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Radiographs usually show destructive, mixed lytic and sclerotic mass with reactive subperiosteal bone formation. This bone formation leads to the elevation of the periosteum and characteristic appearance known radiographically as Codman&#8217;s triangle.

Bone lesions may be single or multiple and can be lytic, mixed or blastic depending on the stage. Paget disease is mostly asymptomatic, but some patients may present with bone pain or pain due to deformity or compression.

It typically presents as a lytic lesion in the epiphyses of long bones. Clinically, the tumor may produce arthritis-like pain due to its proximity to the joints and occasionally pathologic fracture. On radiography, the tumor forms an expansile lytic lesion sometimes described as a &#8220;soap bubble&#8221; like lesion.

A distinguishing diagnostic feature of H. pylori gastritis when compared to chronic autoimmune gastritis is the location of the metaplasia and atrophy seen on histologic specimens. Most patients with chronic gastritis due to H. pylori will demonstrate these pathologic changes in the <strong>antrum&#160;</strong>of the stomach, whereas patients with chronic autoimmune gastritis will have these changes primarily in the body/fundus. &#160; <br><br>Clinically, chronic H. pylori gastritis presents with symptoms of dyspepsia over weeks to months but may go unrecognized entirely. H. pylori preferentially invades the <strong>antrum&#160;</strong>to avoid the acidic secretions by parietal cells in the fundus and body. In the antrum, colonization by the bacteria drives proliferation and increased secretion of gastrin by G-cells. Gastrin stimulates parietal cells to secrete additional hydrochloric acid, eroding the gastric mucosa and causing atrophy and loss of glandular cells with replacement by metaplastic epithelium. Colonization in the antrum also damages delta cells, involved in the secretion of somatostatin. With decreased somatostatin levels, gastrin becomes uninhibited, leading to increased secretion of acid by parietal cells. &#160;With continued inflammation, <strong>MALT lymphoma</strong>, a tumor of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue, can arise. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Fundus of the stomach:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The fundus is the most common area of the stomach affected by chronic autoimmune gastritis, which typically presents in patients with additional autoimmune disorders and pernicious anemia. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Gastroesophageal junction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>The gastroesophageal junction is implicated in Barrett esophagus.

The diagnosis is made when patients present with recurrent episodes of typical anginal pain and are found to have transient ST-segment elevation on ECG/Holter monitor followed by insignificant findings of atherosclerosis at coronary arteriography.

He most likely has <strong>acute disseminated encephalomyelitis</strong> (ADEM). &#160; <br><br>ADEM is a rare type IV (cell-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction. In this condition, T-cells are activated by myelin proteins and release cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha), which dilate blood vessels, allowing more immune cells (e.g., macrophages, B-cells) to infiltrate and damage oligodendrocytes. B-cells begin synthesizing antibodies that mark the myelin sheath proteins. Macrophages then use the antibody markers to engulf and destroy the oligodendrocytes, leading to <strong>diffuse demyelination</strong> at multiple locations throughout the brain and spinal cord. &#160;<br><br>The underlying trigger for ADEM is unclear, but since some pathogens have proteins similar to oligodendrocytes proteins, molecular mimicry may be an underlying etiology. A variety of <strong>viral infections</strong> are associated with ADEM, including influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, and various human herpes viruses. Although vaccines were previously thought to be a trigger for ADEM, this theory has largely been disproven. &#160;<br><br>Symptoms of ADEM have acute-onset, and usually begin 1-3 weeks after exposure to the trigger.

Hyperacute transplant rejection is a<strong>&#160;type II (antibody-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction</strong> and is a rare form of transplant rejection. &#160; <br><br>Hyperacute transplant rejection occurs due to <strong>preformed anti-donor antibodies&#160;</strong>(e.g. anti-donor HLA antibodies) that are present before transplantation, which most commonly formed from <strong>previous failed grafts</strong> (such as in this patient), <strong>previous transfusions,</strong> or <strong>previous pregnancies.</strong> Once the transplanted organ is perfused, these antibodies attack it, leading to activation of the complement system and coagulation system. This activation ultimately results in <strong>vessel thrombosis, organ ischemia and necrosis,</strong> and <strong>graft loss</strong>. The difference between hyperacute and acute rejection is the presence of preformed antibodies that cause rejection immediately in hyperacute rejections, while in acute rejection, antibodies are formed after transplantation and, therefore, the reaction takes more time (i.e. several months). &#160;<br><br>Hyperacute transplant rejection starts <strong>within minutes after transplantation</strong> and continues for up to 48 hours.

This presentation is consistent with a <strong>febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction</strong>, which is the <strong>most common transfusion reaction. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>A febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction is a common, mild condition. It develops due to two events: &#160;<br><br>1. The most common mechanism is that<strong>&#160;leukocytes in the donor&#8217;s blood produce cytokines when stored,</strong> and once transfused, these cytokines stimulate the <strong>hypothalamus</strong>, causing elevation of body temperature. <br>2. Another mechanism is that the recipient produces <strong>antibodies against the HLA antigen</strong> on the donor&#8217;s leukocytes, and these antibodies attack the donor&#8217;s leukocytes and lyse them, causing fevers.<br><br>Although these patients usually have isolated <strong>fevers</strong>, some patients may develop anxiety, <strong>chills</strong>, and <strong>headaches</strong>. The fever usually resolves shortly after the blood transfusion is stopped. Aside from the fever, the patient&#8217;s vitals are usually stable. &#160;<br><br>Although febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions are not life-threatening, if a patient develops this reaction, the patient should be given<strong>&#160;leukoreduced transfusions</strong> in the future. Leukoreduction is a process in which the leukocytes are removed from the donor&#8217;s blood.

With AChE blocked, acetylcholine subsequently accumulates and leads to <strong>hyperstimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors</strong>. Nicotinic stimulation leads to <strong>neuromuscular blockade</strong>, and muscarinic activation results in <strong>increased visceral and glandular secretions</strong>.

      "solution": "This patient presents with new-onset hypoxia and cyanosis after receiving topical anesthesia and sedatives. These findings are suggestive of <strong>methemoglobinemia&#160;</strong>secondary to <strong>topical benzocaine</strong> use. <br><br>Methemoglobin is an altered state of hemoglobin that results from the <strong>oxidation&#160;</strong>of ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) to ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) iron. As a result, the oxidized heme groups have a decreased ability to bind oxygen. To compensate, the remaining normal heme groups end up binding oxygen more tightly, which prevents them from releasing oxygen to the tissues. These changes ultimately cause <strong>tissue hypoxia</strong>. Medications associated with methemoglobinemia include <strong>topical/local anesthetics</strong> (benzocaine), <strong>dapsone</strong>, and <strong>nitrates</strong>. <br><br>Diagnosis is made by measuring <strong>elevated blood methemoglobin levels</strong>. Of note, pulse oximetry cannot be used to diagnose methemoglobinemia because methemoglobin absorbs light at the pulse oximetry&#8217;s two wavelengths, which leads to a reading of around 85% regardless of true oxygen saturation. Moreover, arterial blood gas studies analyze unbound oxygen and will show a falsely normal oxygen level.<br><br>Clinical symptoms of methemoglobinemia include <strong>cyanosis</strong>, <strong>dyspnea</strong>, confusion, and lightheadedness. In severe cases, patients may develop <strong>seizures</strong>, <strong>coma</strong>, and even <strong>death</strong>.

However, the zona fasciculata of the uninvolved, adrenal gland atrophies due to reduced ACTH stimulation.

While this patient has symptoms of hypercortisolism, the low ACTH measurement suggests that primary hypercortisolism (due to an adrenal gland pathology) is the most likely cause.
