These findings are suggestive of <strong>methemoglobinemia&#160;</strong>secondary to <strong>topical benzocaine</strong> use. <br><br>Methemoglobin is an altered state of hemoglobin that results from the <strong>oxidation&#160;</strong>of ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) to ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) iron. As a result, the oxidized heme groups have a decreased ability to bind oxygen. To compensate, the remaining normal heme groups end up binding oxygen more tightly, which prevents them from releasing oxygen to the tissues.

Medications associated with methemoglobinemia include <strong>topical/local anesthetics</strong> (benzocaine), <strong>dapsone</strong>, and <strong>nitrates</strong>. <br><br>Diagnosis is made by measuring <strong>elevated blood methemoglobin levels</strong>.

Together, these findings are suggestive of <strong>carbon monoxide toxicity</strong>. <br><br>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas that has a high affinity for <strong>cytochrome c oxidase</strong> in the electron transport chain. The binding of CO inhibits this enzyme, resulting in <strong>defective oxidative phosphorylation</strong>, ATP production, and aerobic metabolism. As a result, cells resort to anaerobic metabolism, resulting in <strong>lactic acidosis</strong> and eventual cell death. In addition, CO has a significantly higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen and causes a <strong>leftward shift</strong> of the oxygen dissociation curve. The end result is decreased oxygen binding capacity, increased hemoglobin affinity for oxygen, and subsequently <strong>decreased oxygen delivery to tissues</strong>. <br><br>Similarly, <strong>cyanide toxicity</strong> also inhibits cytochrome c oxidase and prevents oxidative phosphorylation.

By increasing systemic pH, salicylate converts to its charged (deprotonated form) and thus cannot rapidly diffuse into the central nervous system, as charged molecules do not easily diffuse across the blood-brain barrier. Alkalinization also results in the trapping of salicylate anions within the renal tubule, preventing back-diffusion across the renal epithelium into c circulation. &#160; &#160;<br><br>P.S.

Following treatment, she develops palpitations and ECG changes that include ST segment depression and T wave inversions (U-waves) indicative of <strong>amphotericin-induced hypokalemia. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>Amphotericin B can induce nephrotoxicity via tubular injury and vasoconstriction, which ultimately results in hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and the RTA (normal anion gap acidosis). In fungal cells, amphotericin B binds to ergosterol, a component of the fungal cell membrane, and creates micropores. Similarly, it binds to cholesterol in host cell membranes (with lesser affinity) and increases membrane permeability. As a result, membrane electrochemical gradients are reduced, particularly between the renal tubular cells and the lumen. Potassium subsequently moves down this concentration gradient, resulting in a loss of potassium and limitated hydrogen ion secretion. Renal magnesium loss can also occur secondary to amphotericin nephrotoxicity. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Acute kidney injury is typically the first sign of amphotericin B induced nephrotoxicity. Normally, as the sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule increases, more NaCl diffuses into the macula densa. Tubuloglomerular feedback is initiated and afferent arteriole vasoconstriction occurs to limit NaCl losses. With amphotericin B use, permeability of macula densa cells increases and results in profound afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, a fall in GFR, and a subsequent rise in creatinine. &#160;<br><br>In order to limit amphotericin B associated nephrotoxicity, <strong>lipid formulations (liposomal and lipid complex) are used. Salt loading or volume expansion</strong> has also been found to be effective in limiting the fall in GFR as it reduces the sensitivity of the tubuloglomerular feedback system. Preventive measures to reduce nephrotoxicity include <strong>administering lower doses</strong> and <strong>avoiding co-administration of other nephrotoxic agents </strong>such as aminoglycosides or cyclosporine. Other adverse effects include fever, chills, and body aches.

      "solution": "This patient is most likely suffering from <strong>Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).&#160;</strong>SJS is a life-threatening type<strong>&#160;IV hypersensitivity reaction</strong> mediated by cytotoxic T-cells (CD8+ T-cells). The condition is characterized by necrosis of the epithelium of the skin and mucosal membranes, resulting in blistering lesions and erosions, fever, and systemic illness. Involved areas typically include the skin of the face, trunk, and limbs and mucous membranes. &#160;<br><br>Many common medications can trigger SJS. Anticonvulsants associated with SJS include <strong>lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and ethosuximide.&#160;</strong><br><br><strong><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/1yI2JAlfSsma-ZniCMuDHaSoQ2SHxJ0Y/_.png\"></div></strong><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Stevens-Johnson syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Erythema multiforme&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This patient&#8217;s skin lesions, involvement of mucosal membranes, fever, and history of lamotrigine use suggest Stevens-Johnson syndrome.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome is associated with blistering lesions, skin tenderness, and fever; however, <strong>mucosal membranes are spared. </strong>This condition is more commonly seen in infants and children &lt;4 years of age.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pemphigus Vulgaris&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Pemphigus Vulgaris can present with blisters, mucosal lesions, and fever, but it is primarily seen in older patients.
