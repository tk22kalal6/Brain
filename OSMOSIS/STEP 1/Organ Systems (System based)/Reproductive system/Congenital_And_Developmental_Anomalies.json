After days 1-7 of the menstrual cycle, low levels of estradiol and progesterone allow GnRH pulses to induce secretion of increasing amounts of FSH, which then initiate the development of several ovarian follicles.

The estrogen receptors are members of the superfamily of steroid hormone receptors found primarily in the nucleus. &#160; <br><br><strong>Pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone</strong> (GnRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates the pulsatile pituitary release of<strong>&#160;luteinizing hormone</strong> (LH) and<strong>&#160;follicle-stimulating hormone&#160;</strong>(FSH). Both FSH and LH stimulate ovarian production of estradiol and progesterone. The variations in pulsatile release of the gonadotropins result in a cyclic response of ovarian function. Each cycle lasts 28 days and can be divided into two phases of 14 days each.

It also acts as a negative feedback signal, making the pituitary secrete less FSH as estrogen levels rise. &#160; <br><br>Right before ovulation, the markedly high estrogen levels make the pituitary much more sensitive to the actions of hypothalamic GnRH.

This phenotype is due to the production of anti-M&#252;llerian hormone from normally functioning testes which are often found in the labia majora.

      "solution": "This patient presents with known <strong>androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)</strong>, which refers to a condition where patients have a defective androgen receptor such that they do not appropriately respond to circulating androgens. Patients suffering from this disorder are often genetically male, but phenotypically female, and they present with subtle to severe symptoms of under-masculinization. For this reason, diagnosis of AIS is subdivided into partial AIS, complete AIS and mild AIS, depending on symptom severity (see table below). <br><br>It is important for patients with AIS who have undescended testes to undergo <strong>gonadectomy</strong>, due to the high risk of <strong>malignant transformation</strong> (approximately 30% increased likelihood of developing testicular cancer). These tumors tend to be <strong>germ cell tumor gonadoblastoma</strong>, which occur in approximately 2% of all patients with undescended testicles (regardless of AIS status). While the majority of these tumors tend to be in-situ cancers, they can result in metastatic disease. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/keDEbPTeRCuqz-IvySpBg8RyReWEI0NV/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Escalating phenotypic masculinization &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) refers to an inability for the body to masculinize &#8211; meaning that the body does not masculinize in response to production of male-specific hormones like testosterone. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Increased risk of testicular cancer:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Testicular torsion &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Testicular torsion occurs in phenotypic males; the spermatic cord twists upon itself, limiting circulation in the testicular artery and vein.

      "solution": "This vignette illustrates characteristic features of <strong>Kallman syndrome</strong> &#8211; a genetic disorder that prevents one from starting or finishing puberty. Kallmann syndrome falls under a subset of genetic disorders, termed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and patients with this disorder present with distinct reproductive and non-reproductive clinical features.<br><br>During the first 10 weeks of embryological development, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons migrate from their initial location in rostral nasopharynx, an area called the <strong>olfactory placode</strong>, through the cribriform plate and into the developing hypothalamus. Kallman syndrome is thought to arise from aberration of GnRH neuronal migration, which also affects neurons originating in the olfactory placode, leading to <strong>anosmia</strong>. The lack of GnRH in these patients ultimately leads to downstream absence of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), resulting in lack of <strong>secondary sexual characteristics and hair growth</strong>. Kallmann syndrome is significantly more common in males than females. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Gonadotropin-releasing hormone &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Follicle Stimulating Hormone &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> While FSH is greatly decreased in this disorder, it is the lack of upstream GnRH which accounts for the physical manifestations of Kallman syndrome. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Luteinizing hormone &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>While LH is greatly decreased in this disorder, it is the lack of upstream GnRH which accounts for the physical manifestations of Kallman syndrome. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Testosterone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> This patient&#8217;s lack of secondary sexual characteristics is due to a lack of GnRH, not testosterone.
