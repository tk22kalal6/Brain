These cells are mainly located on the <strong>basolateral</strong> side of the tubules.<br><br>First, during the intrauterine period, Sertoli cells secrete <strong>Mullerian inhibitory factor</strong> (MIF), which prevents the development of the female reproductive organs. Sertoli cells are also crucial in developing sperms by providing nutrients and regulating the environment in the seminiferous tubules. Additionally, Sertoli cells maintain a high amount of testosterone in the seminiferous tubules, which is needed to develop sperms. This is done by secreting <strong>androgen binding peptide</strong> (ABP), which captures the testosterone secreted by Leydig cells and allows more testosterone to enter the seminiferous tubules.<br><br>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the sertoli cells to secrete ABP. Sertoli cells regulate the secretion of FSH from the anterior pituitary by secreting a hormone called inhibin, which acts as a feedback inhibitor on FSH secretion.
