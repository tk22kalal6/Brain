It activates <strong>antithrombin III</strong>, which in turn <strong>inactivates factors IIa and Xa</strong>, accounting for heparin&#8217;s anticoagulant effects.<br><br>One toxicity is <strong>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</strong> (HIT), characterized by a fall in platelet count and a hypercoagulable state. The condition arises when platelet factor 4 (PF4), a substance released from the alpha granule of platelets, binds with heparin molecules.

The microthrombi can damage a variety of organ systems, including the heart, kidneys, and skin.

The reaction usually occurs <strong>5-10 days</strong> after heparin initiation and is often associated with a fall in platelet count of <strong>30% or more</strong>.<br><br>If a patient experiences HIT, heparin should be immediately discontinued.

Approximately half of this variability is known to be caused by clinical or lifestyle factors (e.g., a patient&#8217;s age, weight, BMI, gender, smoking status, existing conditions, and concomitant medications), as well as by <strong>genetic factors&#8211;including variants in the <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>or <em>CYP2C9&#160;</em>gene. &#160;</strong><br><br>The <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>and <em>CYP2C9&#160;</em>genotypes are the most critical genetic determinants of warfarin dosing. Warfarin targets the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme (VKORC1), catalyzing the rate-limiting step in vitamin K recycling (converting vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K). This, in turn, inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. &#160;<br><br>A common non-coding variant, <em>VKORC1</em>, c.-1639G&gt;A, is associated with increased sensitivity to warfarin. <strong>Patients with this variant require lower doses of warfarin, as standard doses may result in a supratherapeutic INR and subsequent bleeding complications.</strong> The polymorphism occurs in the promoter region of the VKORC1 gene and is thought to alter a transcription factor binding site, leading to lower protein expression. As a result, patients starting warfarin therapy who are carrying at least one &#8220;A&#8221; (mutated) allele at the -1639 locus require lower initial and maintenance doses compared with patients carrying a G/G (wild type) genotype at this locus. &#160;<br><br>Less commonly, <strong>missense mutations in <em>VKORC1&#160;</em>can lead to warfarin resistance&#160;</strong>and higher dose requirements. Lastly, The CYP2C9 enzyme metabolizes warfarin, and a dose reduction is recommended for individuals who are poor or intermediate metabolizers (variants<em>&#160;CYP2C9*2</em> and <em>*3</em>). &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/MnPaPDUEQjirVWWycHlipQIARkqartKE/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Supratherapeutic INR:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong><strong> </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Subtherapeutic INR:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Missense mutations in VKORC1 can lead to warfarin resistance and subtherapeutic INR, leading to higher dose requirements.

These cells are called granulocytes due to the fact that they contain granules in their cytoplasm. Finally, the fourth type is the monoblasts, which produce monocytes that can stay in the blood or go into tissues and become macrophages and dendritic cells. &#160; <br><br>On the other hand, the <strong>lymphoblasts&#160;</strong>or lymphoid progenitor cells produce 3 types of cells.

They also undergo <strong>VDJ recombination</strong> to produce a T-cell receptor. Afterward, each T-cell undergoes <strong>positive selection</strong> in the thymic cortex, which involves testing the ability of the T-cell to bind with MHC I and II receptors on the surface of thymic cortex cells. T-cells that have an MHC affinity and can serve useful functions in the body are allowed to survive and undergo negative selection. In contrast, T-cells that fail to bind with MHC receptors will undergo apoptosis. &#160; <br><br>The next step involves <strong>negative selection</strong>, which helps ensure the thymus is not producing self-reactive T-cells. This stage occurs in the thymic medulla, which expresses the <strong><em>AIRE&#160;</em>gene</strong> and enables the cells to express antigens generally found in other body organs (e.g., bones, ovaries, pancreas). It essentially allows the thymus to serve as a microcosm of the entire body. T-cells that bind self-antigens undergo apoptosis.

During the maturation process, B cells (and T cells) undergo VDJ rearrangement, randomly altering the variable (antibody-binding) region of the B cell and T cell receptors. Activated B cells within the spleen and lymph nodes also undergo <strong>somatic hypermutation</strong> and subsequent <strong>affinity maturation.</strong> When these activated B cells bind to an antigen, they express CD40, which binds to the CD40 ligand from nearby T cells. This binding causes the T cells to secrete cytokines which induce an enzyme in B cells called AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase). AID then replaces many cytidine nucleotides with uridine in single strands of DNA within the B cell receptor (BCR) variable region. These uridine nucleotides are then &#8220;repaired&#8221; via base excision or mismatch repair, eventually leading to a strand of DNA different from the original.

The most notable cytokines produced by macrophages are Interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). These cytokines help in the defense against bacterial and viral infections, as well as in destroying tumor cells. &#160; <br><br><ul><li>IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a are major proinflammatory cytokines. They target various immune cells but also act on the liver to produce acute phase reactants and on the brain to induce fever. Although their effects are important to the function of the immune system, these cytokines are also implicated in certain diseases, like the excessive secretion of IL-1 and TNF, leading to septic shock and multiorgan failure due to excessive generalized inflammation. &#160;</li><li>TNF is one of the most potent cytokines. &#160;As discussed earlier, it induces fever and increased acute phase reactants production and is also involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis. TNF also suppresses the appetite and is responsible for cachexia in cancer patients. Additionally, TNF causes vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, which allows immune cells to reach the inflammatory site. &#160;&#160;</li></ul><br><ul><li>IL-1 (especially IL-1B) is mainly produced by macrophages but also by lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and fibroblasts. IL-1 actions include inducing fever, increased acute phase reactants production, and increased expression of adhesion molecules on the leukocytes and endothelial cells, thereby facilitating the leukocytes to reach the inflammatory site and increasing the production of other proinflammatory cytokines. &#160;&#160;</li></ul><br><ul><li>IL-6 is mainly involved in stimulating fever and increasing the production of acute-phase reactants. &#160;&#160;</li></ul><br><ul><li>IL-8 is a major chemoattractant for neutrophils to the site of inflammation &#160;</li></ul><br><ul><li>IL-12 is mainly produced by macrophages and plays a crucial role in the defense against infections and cancers.

The CD4+ T cells bind to these molecules via TCR and a CD4 co-receptor. In addition, the CD4+ T cell also expresses a surface CD28 protein which binds to the B7 protein on the surface of the APC. Ultimately, this series of interactions results in the release of interleukin 12 from the APC, &#160;inducing differentiation of CD4+ naive T cells into type 1 helper T (TH1) cells. These cells release interleukin-2 (IL-2), which helps TH1 cells and other T cells proliferate, and interferon-gamma activates phagocytes to create more TH1 cells. Activated macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6, enhancing endothelial barrier permeability.

It is made up of 2 parts: the <strong>innate </strong>and the<strong> adaptive immune responses. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>The innate immune system is the first-line defense against pathogens invading the body. The innate immune system is made of immune cells, which are <strong>macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, </strong>and <strong>natural killer cells.</strong> In addition, it also includes other non-immune parts like the physical barrier of the <strong>skin</strong> and the secretions and enzymes in the body (e.g. gastric acid). The innate immune system is non-specific, which means that it responds in the same way to different pathogens. One of the features of this system is that it is fast and the immune cells can destroy the foreign body or pathogen within hours of entering the body. However, one of the drawbacks of the innate immune system is the lack of memory, and therefore will not be able to recognize an antigen or a foreign body if encountered again and will respond exactly the same as the first encounter of such antigen. &#160; <br><br>Innate immunity against pathogens relies on the<strong> pattern recognition receptors</strong> (PRR) which recognizes and detects a wide range of pathogens that share common structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Once they recognize PAMPs, the innate immune cells are able to destroy the pathogens immediately. Examples of PAMPs include lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the surface of gram-negative bacteria as well as flagellin on the surface of bacteria. These PAMPs are found on the cell surface of the pathogen and therefore surface PRR will be able to recognize them. Additionally, intracellular PRR are able to recognize intracellular PAMPs like viral DNA or RNA. &#160; <br><br>On the other hand, the <strong>adaptive immune response</strong> is made of <strong>lymphocytes </strong>and <strong>antibodies</strong>. It is specific against every single pathogen and this leads to a slower reaction than that of innate immunity. However, adaptive immune cells (lymphocytes) are able to form <strong>memory cells</strong>, and once a pathogen is encountered again, a much <strong>stronger and faster response occurs. </strong>The adaptive immune cells are capable of secreting immunoglobulins (i.e. antibodies) and cytokines that help modulate the immune response. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ The complement system is part of the innate immune system &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The adaptive immune system cells have receptors that recognize surface structures shared between different pathogens but not found on the surface of their own body cells &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Unlike the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system is specific and recognizes each different pathogen by its specific antigens. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ All the cells of the lymphoid lineage are part of the adaptive immune system &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Natural killer cells originate from the lymphoid lineage, but they are part of the innate immune system. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The innate immune system is able to mount a stronger immune response when encountering a pathogen for the second time. &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Unlike the adaptive immune system, the innate immune system does not have memory cells.

C1 has 3 components: C1q, C1r, and C1s. C1q has no enzymatic activity but has a site that binds the Fc portion of the antibody when it is bound to an antigen. On the other hand, C1r and C1s both have serine protease activity but are inactive in normal states. The classical pathway starts when C1q binds to the Fc portion of an antibody bound to an antigen causing conformational changes in the structure of C1, exposing the C1s and C1r, where they can now function. Next, the activated C1 cleaves C2 into C2a and C2b; and C4 into C4a and C4b. C2b and C4b join together and bind to the surface of the pathogen, forming a complex called C4bC2b, or C3 convertase. C3 convertase then cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b where C3b functions as an opsonin. However, a small amount of C3b formed join the C4bC2b on the surface of the antigen forming a new complex called C4bC2bC3b, which is also known C5 convertase, which then cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. Finally, C5b activates C6 to C9 and this complex (C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9) forms what is known as the <strong>membrane attack complex</strong> and causes lysis of the cell membrane of the pathogen. &#160; <br><br>The lectin-binding pathway starts with a protein called mannose-binding lectin protein, which binds mannose on the surface of microbes (e.g. bacteria) and gets activated. Once activated, mannose-binding lectin protein functions like the activated C1 by cleaving C4 and C2 forming C4b2b complexes (C3 convertase). The rest of the pathway is similar to the classical pathway. &#160; <br><br>Finally, there is the alternative pathway. Normally, there is a small amount of C3 that gets cleaved spontaneously into C3a and C3b without the need for C3 convertase. In case a pathogen was present, this C3b binds to the surface of the pathogen. Once it does, a protein called factor B joins C3b on the surface of the pathogen and gets cleaved (by a factor called factor D) into 2 subunits Aa and Bb. Bb remains attached to C3b and together they function as C3 convertase, thus amplifying the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Cleavage of C2 and C4 to form C3 convertase &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cleavage of C3 to form C3a and C3b &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Mannose-binding lectin protein, activated by binding mannose, functions like activated C1 and cleaves C2 and C4.
