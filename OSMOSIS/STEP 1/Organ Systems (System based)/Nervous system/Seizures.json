      "solution": "This patient has bilateral lower extremity weakness and autonomic dysfunction (e.g. failure to void) in the setting of recent diarrheal illness. He likely has <strong>Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome&#160;</strong>(GBS), and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) would show elevated protein levels and a normal cell count. &#160;<br><br>GBS typically presents after a preceding upper respiratory or <strong>gastrointestinal infection,</strong> with <strong><em>Campylobacter enteritis</em></strong> being the most common cause. As antibodies are generated against the bacteria (or virus), there is production of cross-reactive antibodies (molecular mimicry) that attacks peripheral Schwann cells, resulting in immune-mediated <strong>segmental demyelination</strong>. Clinical features of GBS include &#8220;pins-and-needle&#8221; sensation of the extremities and <strong>bilateral ascending flaccid paralysis</strong>. Autonomic dysfunction (e.g., difficulty voiding, <strong>bradycardia</strong>, tachycardia) may also be present. Severe cases of GBS can cause paralysis of diaphragmatic muscles and eventual respiratory failure requiring intubation. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Diagnosis involves CSF <strong>analysis</strong>, which classically shows elevated protein levels with normal cell counts. This phenomenon is termed <strong>albuminocytologic dissociation</strong>. The elevated protein is likely due to increased permeability of the blood-nerve-barrier. Further diagnostic tests can include nerve conduction studies, which will demonstrate <strong>reduced nerve conduction velocity</strong> due to demyelination. Treatment involves <strong>plasmapheresis&#160;</strong>(to remove circulating autoantibodies) as well as<strong>&#160;intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG)</strong> (which interferes with activation of complement and production of cytokines). &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/--THoV0NSS_yWYa4FtHgKDxWRA_U85Dp/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;&#160;Protein&#160;&#160;Glucose&#160;&#160;Cells&#160;&#160;175 mg/dL&#160;&#160;45 mg/dL&#160;&#160;3/mm3&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;&#160;Protein&#160;&#160;Glucose&#160;&#160;Cells&#160;&#160;255 mg/dL&#160;10 mg/dL&#160;1870/mm3 (neutrophils):</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) finding is seen in bacterial meningitis.

      "solution": "This child has acute-onset altered mental status and pain on extraocular movement in the setting of an MRI revealing multiple subcortical demyelinating lesions. He most likely has <strong>acute disseminated encephalomyelitis</strong> (ADEM). &#160; <br><br>ADEM is a rare type IV (cell-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction. In this condition, T-cells are activated by myelin proteins and release cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha), which dilate blood vessels, allowing more immune cells (e.g., macrophages, B-cells) to infiltrate and damage oligodendrocytes. B-cells begin synthesizing antibodies that mark the myelin sheath proteins. Macrophages then use the antibody markers to engulf and destroy the oligodendrocytes, leading to <strong>diffuse demyelination</strong> at multiple locations throughout the brain and spinal cord. &#160;<br><br>The underlying trigger for ADEM is unclear, but since some pathogens have proteins similar to oligodendrocytes proteins, molecular mimicry may be an underlying etiology. A variety of <strong>viral infections</strong> are associated with ADEM, including influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, and various human herpes viruses. Although vaccines were previously thought to be a trigger for ADEM, this theory has largely been disproven. &#160;<br><br>Symptoms of ADEM have acute-onset, and usually begin 1-3 weeks after exposure to the trigger. Since ADEM is associated with systemic inflammation, most individuals have <strong>fever</strong>, <strong>headache</strong>, nausea, and vomiting. Eventually, demyelination breaks down communication between neurons, leading to visual <strong>problems&#160;</strong>(e.g. optic neuritis), seizures, weakness, irritability, confusion, lethargy, and even coma.

Most are inherited in an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> fashion, and therefore, a family history of the disorder is usually present. CMT affects the <strong>peripheral nervous system</strong> and is characterized by defective protein production in Schwann cells or the peripheral neuron&#8217;s axon. The most common form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is CMT1. CMT1 is caused by mutations in the <strong>PMP22</strong> and <strong>MPZ&#160;</strong>genes, which encode proteins that are part of the myelin sheath. &#160;<br><br>Individuals with CMT typically have <strong>distal lower extremity weakness</strong>, which is similar to Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome. The difference is that CMT also causes<strong>&#160;sensory symptoms&#160;</strong>such as pain or numbness. Early physical exam findings include distal calf muscle atrophy and <strong>loss of reflexes</strong>.

First-line treatment of multiple sclerosis is steroids during acute attacks; however, natalizumab is another approved treatment shown to have a significant benefit in patients with relapsing-remitting MS.<br><br>Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that can be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease. In multiple sclerosis patients, natalizumab has been shown to slow the progression of symptoms and decrease the rate of relapse in patients with relapsing-remitting courses.<br><br>Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against alpha-4-integrin receptors on endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Integrins are a class of selective adhesion molecules that are involved in the chemotaxis of leukocytes to the site of inflammation. Normally, leukocytes bind the integrins and then migrate from blood vessels to the site of inflammation. By blocking the integrins, natalizumab causes anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the leukocytes from migrating to the site of inflammation and inducing a proinflammatory response. In the brain, natalizumab blocks alpha4-beta1 integrins, preventing leukocytes from crossing the blood-brain barrier and entering the CNS, which is how it decreases inflammation in multiple sclerosis patients. <br><br>One of the major limitations of the use of natalizumab is the increased risk of reactivation of JC virus. JC virus is an opportunistic pathogen that resides in the oligodendrocytes in the brain. When the immune system is suppressed, such as in HIV or with natalizumab use, JC virus can get reactivated, leading to a disease known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is characterized by demyelination in the CNS due to the destruction of oligodendrocytes and is rapidly progressive and fatal. Therefore, patients taking natalizumab should be tested for anti-JC virus antibodies before starting treatment and continue to be tested periodically while on natalizumab, even if the initial anti-JC antibodies were negative.<br><br>Other side effects of natalizumab include headaches and nausea. In some patients, nucleated erythrocytes can appear in the peripheral blood, which has no clinical significance and usually disappear after stopping the treatment. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Osmotic demyelination syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a fatal condition that results from rapid correction of hyponatremia.

In rare cases, hemiplegia may last up to 4 weeks. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Like other types of migraines, hemiplegic migraines are more common in <strong>women </strong>than men. Management is similar to typical migraine headaches, including abortive medications during the acute phase as well as prophylactic treatment to prevent future episodes. In severe cases, patients may require hospitalization due to fever, altered consciousness, or seizures. &#160; <br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Transient ischemic attack&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Both migraines and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) can include reversible symptoms such as weakness, paraesthesia, and visual changes, and imaging in both cases shows no abnormalities. However, the symptoms of TIA are acute, not progressive as seen in this patient. Also, patients usually have additional risk factors (e.g., hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, advanced age), unlike this young healthy woman. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Simple seizure:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Simple seizures may be preceded by visual or motor auras, however it is usually associated with &#8220;positive&#8221; symptoms (e.g., shaking, jerking, flashing lights, or visual distortion) rather than &#8220;negative&#8221; symptoms (e.g., weakness, paraesthesias). Additionally, the throbbing headache and history of migraine favors another diagnosis. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Subarachnoid hemorrhage:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The classic presentation of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is sudden onset of a severe headache, often described as the &#8220;worst headache of my life,&#8221; brief loss of consciousness, vomiting, and neck pain or stiffness. Although this patient has an acute onset of severe headache, her computed tomography shows no abnormalities, whereas SAH should show signs of hemorrhage. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cluster headache:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Cluster headaches manifest as unilateral excruciating periorbital pain with lacrimation and rhinorrhea. It is more common in men than women and usually is short in duration (15 minutes&#8211;3 hours). This patient has a progressive motor aura, throbbing headache, and lacks the autonomic signs seen in cluster headaches (e.g. lacrimation, rhinorrhea), which favors another diagnosis. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Migraine headache:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Temporal arteritis &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Temporal arteritis (TA) or giant cell arteritis should be considered in patients over 50 years with the following symptoms: new headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, abrupt onset of visual disturbances/transient monocular visual loss, and constitutional symptoms. This patient's young age and lack of classic TA findings favors another diagnosis.&#160;</span></div>",
