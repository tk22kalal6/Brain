These thrombi can form anywhere atherosclerosis develops but particularly in the large cerebral blood vessels such as the middle cerebral artery, areas of vessel bifurcation, and the lenticulostriate arteries that supply the striatum and internal capsule. When strokes occur in these deep brain structures, they are termed <strong>lacunar strokes. </strong></li><li><span>Hypoxic strokes, </span>aka hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, or global cerebral ischemia, develop secondary to<strong> systemic hypoperfusion or hypoxia</strong>. This type of stroke commonly occurs during cardiac arrest, shock states, or during invasive procedures with significant blood loss. The pattern of injury observed with this type of stroke often includes watershed infarctions, since the areas of the brain most susceptible to ischemic injury exist at the border of blood supply between two separate cerebral arteries. The three primary watershed areas include the vascular territories between the anterior cerebral and the middle cerebral arteries,the posterior cerebral and the middle cerebral arteries, and the external and internal branches of the middle cerebral arteries.</li></ul>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Popliteal vein:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The popliteal vein is often implicated in patients with a deep vein thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism.

This type of stroke commonly occurs during cardiac arrest, shock states, prolonged hypoventilation due to drug overdose, drowning, or during invasive procedures with significant blood loss. The pattern of injury observed with this type of stroke often includes watershed infarctions, since the areas of the brain most susceptible to ischemic injury exist at the border of blood supply between two separate cerebral arteries.

Given his positive RPR test, the most likely etiology is<strong>&#160;tabes dorsalis</strong> secondary to a tertiary syphilis infection. &#160; <br><br>Tabes dorsalis arises due to infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by <em>Treponema pallidum</em>, the spirochete that causes syphilis. The condition takes nearly 20 years to develop after initial infection. Infection of the spinal cord leads to demyelination and degeneration of the <strong>dorsal column and roots</strong>, resulting in findings of gait ataxia and incoordination. &#160; <br><br>The most specific finding for tabes dorsalis is the <strong>Argyll-Robertson pupil</strong>, which is characterized by small bilateral pupils that do not constrict when exposed to bright light, but do constrict when focused on a nearby object. This finding is also termed <strong>light-near dissociation.</strong> Other common symptoms include <strong>lancinating pains, neurogenic urinary incontinence,&#160;</strong>and signs of <strong>dementia</strong>.

Normally, after exposure to bright light, a pupil constricts. A MGP, on the other hand, has a relative afferent pupillary defect. As a result, when light is rapidly transferred from the normal eye to the eye with MGP, the MGP dilates instead of constricting. However, MGP is not typically associated with tertiary syphilis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cranial nerve III palsy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Cranial nerve (CN) III nerve palsy refers to a &#8220;down and out pupil,&#8221; wherein the pupil is enlarged and shifted inferolaterally. Etiologies include uncal herniation and microvascular disease. In contrast, this patient has a positive Romberg sign, dysmetria, and absent deep tendon reflexes, which is more consistent with neurosyphilis. Neurosyphillis would not typically cause a CN III palsy.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Loss of pain and temperature sensation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Tabes dorsalis rarely affects the spinothalamic tract, which is an afferent pathway in the anterior spinal cord that relays pain and temperature sensation.

In contrast, this patient has painful muscle spasms, lockjaw, as well as backward arching of the head and neck. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Adenylate cyclase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: <em>Vibrio cholera</em> releases a toxin that activates adenylate cyclase, thereby increasing cAMP levels. Infection by this pathogen would present with watery diarrhea, not spastic paralysis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Superoxide dismutase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s symptoms are concerning for tetanus, which is caused by <strong><em>Clostridium tetani</em></strong>. This bacterium produces a toxin that disrupts the function of SNARE proteins, not superoxide dismutase. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Neuron specific enolase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Detection of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) can be used to identify cells of neuroendocrine origin. However, NSE does not play a role in the pathogenesis of tetanus. &#160;</span></div>",

      "solution": "<strong><em>Clostridium botulinum</em></strong> is a Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium that causes a rare but potentially devastating peripheral neurological disease known as botulism. The bacteria are primarily found in soil and have been well known to contaminate canned food products. This disease results from a heat-labile <strong>exotoxin</strong> produced by the bacteria, known as botulinum-neurotoxin.<br><br>This infant presents with clinical signs of <strong>botulism</strong> including a weak cry, drooling, constipation, and diffuse hypotonia. In infants, the most common means of acquiring this condition is <strong>ingestion of products contaminated with bacterial spores</strong> (e.g., honey). Infants lack a robust immune system and have poorly developed gut flora; this allows for the proliferation of toxin-producing <em>C. botulinum</em> colonies in the digestive tract. In contrast, adults largely acquire the infection by means of ingestion of the <strong>pre-formed toxin only</strong>, due to their more developed immune system and gastrointestinal tract.<br><br>Once ingested, this toxin prevents intracellular vesicles containing acetylcholine from fusing with the cellular membrane, thus preventing acetylcholine release into the neuromuscular junction. Ultimately, this results in the clinical features of flaccid paralysis.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Honey contaminated with bacterial spores:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Canned peaches contaminated with exotoxin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The adult form of botulism occurs secondary to ingestion of contaminated canned goods with preformed exotoxin. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Contaminated drinking water:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: <em>Clostridium botulinum</em> is not routinely transmitted via contaminated drinking water.
