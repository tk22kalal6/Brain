The symptoms worsen throughout the day and improve with rest. The patient works as a teacher and has had a great deal of stress lately. She does not smoke and drinks a glass of wine occasionally. She takes no medications. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg. Physical examination reveals bilateral ptosis. Muscle strength is decreased in both lower extremities. A lateral chest x-ray shows an anterior mediastinal mass. Electromyography shows a decremental response following repetitive nerve stimulation. Which of the following types of receptors is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient&#8217;s condition?",

In patients with hyponatremia, water moves from the blood into the brain, causing brain cells (primarily astrocytes) to swell. The brain cells are able to adapt to hyponatremia by <strong>losing inorganic</strong> (e.g., electrolytes) and <strong>organic&#160;</strong>(e.g., myoinositol, taurine, glutamine) <strong>osmolytes&#160;</strong>to reestablish normal cell volume. &#160;<br><br>When patients are treated<strong>&#160;rapidly with hypertonic saline</strong>, the hyperosmolar environment causes reversal of the initial adaptation, with water flowing from cells into the intravascular space to achieve isotonicity.

MS is a chronic, degenerative disease of the central nervous system that results from an <strong>autoimmune-mediated</strong> attack against <strong>oligodendrocytes</strong>. The exact etiology of MS is unclear; however, there is a genetic predisposition to the condition (HLA-DR2), as well as identifiable triggers, such as<strong>&#160;vitamin D deficiency</strong> and <strong>cigarette smoking</strong>. Vitamin D deficiency can explain why the rate of MS is higher among people who live further from the equator, where there is less sunlight. &#160;<br><br>The lesions in MS are caused by a<strong>&#160;type IV hypersensitivity</strong> (cell-mediated reaction) in which Th1 and Th17 T-cells react against myelin antigens and secrete cytokines, which dilate the blood vessels, allowing more immune cells to extravasate from the bloodstream, as well as directly cause damage to oligodendrocytes. The cytokines attract B-cells, which begin to make antibodies that target the myelin. <strong>Macrophages&#160;</strong>are able to identify these antibodies and attack the marked oligodendrocytes.

      "solution": "This woman is presenting with various neurologic symptoms (e.g., urgency incontinence, optic neuritis, positive Babinski sign) and has an MRI scan showing <strong>periventricular lesions</strong>. She most likely has<strong>&#160;multiple sclerosis</strong> (MS). <br><br>Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that results in oligodendrocyte damage and depletion. The previous episode of <strong>optic neuritis</strong> was likely caused by plaque formation around the optic nerve. The current urgency incontinence occurs due to<strong>&#160;detrusor overactivity</strong> secondary to cortical demyelinating lesions that impair the detrusor reflex at the level of the frontal cortex. &#160;<br><br>There are various clinical courses that MS can follow, with<strong>&#160;relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS)</strong> the most common; it is the clinical course of 90% of patients at the time of diagnosis. RR-MS describes a disease course characterized by clearly defined <strong>attacks&#160;</strong>(also called exacerbations or relapses) with full or <strong>near-full recovery in between</strong>. This patient had a prior episode of optic neuritis that resolved spontaneously and is now presenting with urgency incontinence that will also likely resolve spontaneously. As the plaques worsen, so too will the neurologic dysfunctions, and eventually RR-MS will become secondary progressive MS in 50% of patients, wherein there is continuous worsening of symptoms between exacerbations. &#160; &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/1OSq-LcbTR6UIUbxhEMzNdoIShyTgEdU/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Symptom exacerbations with near complete recovery between episodes:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Continuous worsening from the onset of the disease:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS) describes a clinical course with no acute exacerbations but with continuous worsening of symptoms from the very onset of the disease.

However, this is not the most common clinical course of MS. Moreover, although relapsing-remitting MS eventually becomes secondary progressive MS, this transition usually occurs 10 to 20 years after disease onset.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Rapidly progressive disease course with neurologic disability in 5 years:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Malignant multiple sclerosis (MS), also known as aggressive MS, describes a rapidly progressive disease course that leads to debilitating neurologic dysfunction within 5 to 10 years.
