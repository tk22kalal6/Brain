This clinical presentation is most consistent with <strong>trigger finger</strong>, also termed <strong>stenosing tenosynovitis</strong>. <br><br><strong>Trigger finger</strong> is a flexor tendon that catches when it attempts to glide through a stenotic sheath, resulting in an inability to flex or extend the finger smoothly. The underlying pathology of this disease remains unclear but is thought to be due to <strong>fibrocartilaginous metaplasia</strong> of the ligamentous layer of the tendon sheath. The majority of cases are idiopathic, although some are associated with repetitive hand motions, often from occupational activities.<br><br>Clinically, patients experience a <strong>catching and locking sensation</strong> of the finger that progressively worsens over time. Patients may also experience <strong>pain</strong> localized over the volar aspect of the metacarpophalangeal joint. &#160;<br><br>Treatment is primarily conservative and involves <strong>splinting, analgesia, </strong>and<strong> rest</strong>. Local <strong>glucocorticoid injection</strong> can also be administered.

In the Phalen test, the patient fully flexes the palms at the wrist with the elbow in full extension to provide extra pressure on the median nerve.

Further diagnostic tests include nerve conduction studies and electromyography to rule out other polyneuropathies, plexopathies, and radiculopathies. <br><br>Treatment is primarily conservative, with <strong>physical therapy</strong> and <strong>wrist splinting</strong> as mainstays for mild or moderate disease.

These findings are consistent with <strong>prepatellar bursitis</strong>.<br><br>Knee bursitis is a common condition that arises secondary to inflammation of bursa sacs surrounding the knee joint. Within the knee there are multiple bursal or fluid-filled synovial sacs that help to lubricate and cushion the skin, tendons, and bones. The commonly inflamed or injured bursa includes the <strong>prepatellar, infrapatellar, suprapatellar, </strong>and <strong>pes anserine bursa</strong>. Prepatellar and infrapatellar bursitis commonly occur in patients with chronic trauma to the anterior knee, such as those involved in professions who spend most of their day on their knees (e.g. plumbers). Suprapatellar bursitis is less common and often arises due to regression failure of the transverse septum formed in embryonic life between the suprapatellar plica and knee joint. The pes anserine bursa is located medially and commonly presents as swelling and pain at the medial aspect of the knee.<br><br>Clinically, knee bursitis presents as pain and swelling of the affected bursa <strong>without significant restrictions in the passive or active range of motion</strong>. The bursae are located extra-articularly, meaning the joint space itself remains unaffected when bursitis ensues. As a result, mobility within the joint itself remains unchanged.

CT imaging demonstrates a fracture through the base of the odontoid process, which is consistent with a <strong>type II odontoid fracture</strong>. &#160; <br><br><strong>Odontoid fractures</strong> are the most common type of cervical spine injury seen in older patients and refer to fractures of the odontoid process (dens of C2 vertebra). They often occur in older patients as a result of <strong>low-energy falls</strong>. This injury pattern most commonly occurs secondary to <strong>forced hyperextension of the neck</strong>. Less commonly, it can arise via forced hyperflexion of the neck. These fractures can be recognized by bone discontinuation in the dens on an open mouth radiograph or CT scan. &#160; <br><br>Odontoid fractures are classified into three distinct injury patterns. A <strong>type I odontoid fracture</strong> refers to an avulsion fracture of the tip of the odontoid process and represents a <strong>stable cervical spine injury</strong>. <strong>Type II and type III odontoid fractures</strong> represent <strong>unstable cervical spine injuries</strong> and refer to a fracture through the base of the odontoid process and a fracture through the C2 vertebral body, respectively. In particular, <strong>type II injuries</strong> are at risk of <strong>avascular necrosis</strong> and nonunion due to poor blood supply. Type III injuries may heal faster due to adequate blood supply to the cervical body but are at higher risk of causing neurologic injury secondary to mechanical instability.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Type II odontoid injury:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Type I odontoid fracture:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> A type I odontoid fracture occurs when only the rostral tip of the odontoid process is avulsed.

The glossopharyngeal nerve carries afferent impulses from the carotid sinus, whereas the vagus nerve carries afferent signals from the aortic arch. Signals from these receptors are relayed to the <strong>nucleus tractus solitarius</strong> (NTS) in the medulla.

Efferent sympathetic fibers then relay signals from the NTS to the rest of the body, causing alterations in vasoconstriction, heart rate, and cardiac contractility. For instance, in cases of hypotension, there is diminished arterial stretch, which is noted by the baroreceptors, prompting a sympathetic response. &#160;<br><br>In contrast, <strong>hypertension&#160;</strong>causes increased stretching of the arterial walls and baroreceptors.
