      "text": "A 46-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after an episode of hematemesis. The patient was at home watching television when she suddenly felt nauseous and subsequently vomited bright red blood. Past medical history is notable for atrial fibrillation diagnosed two years ago. She has been taking metoprolol and warfarin. In addition, she was diagnosed with HIV four months ago, for which she has been prescribed ritonavir. She does not use alcohol, tobacco, or recreational drugs. She had been sexually active with multiple partners before her HIV diagnosis. Temperature is 37.5&#176;C (99.5&#176;F), blood pressure is 115/63 mmHg, and pulse is 107/min. Physical examination reveals dried blood in the oropharynx. Multiple bruises are present over the upper and lower extremities. Abdominal examination reveals no focal tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory testing is compared with results from a prior visit four months earlier. The results are shown below. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient&#8217;s current symptoms? &#160;<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Laboratory Value</strong>&#160; &#160;<br></td><td><strong>Results (today&#8217;s visit)</strong>&#160; &#160;<br></td><td><strong>Results (4 months ago)</strong>&#160; &#160;<br></td></tr><tr><td>Hemoglobin<br></td><td>12.5 g/dL (1.88 mmol/L) &#160; <br></td><td>10.8 g/dL (1.63 mmol/L) &#160; <br></td></tr><tr><td>Platelet Count<br></td><td>250,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (250*10<sup>9</sup>/L)<br></td><td>220,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (220*10<sup>9</sup>/L)<br></td></tr><tr><td>Prothrombin Time (PT)<br></td><td>48 seconds &#160; <br></td><td>28 seconds &#160; <br></td></tr><tr><td>International Normalized Ratio (INR) &#160; <br></td><td>4.5 &#160; <br></td><td>2.3 &#160; <br></td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"table-expand-wrapper\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"table-expand-btn glass-light\">Expand Table</button></div><br>",

      "solution": "This patient presents with <strong>hematemesis</strong>, skin <strong>bruising</strong>, and a markedly <strong>elevated PT/INR</strong> following initiation of <strong>ritonavir</strong> therapy. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that can be used to treat HIV infection. The drug binds and inhibits HIV-1 protease, thereby preventing the virus from processing Gag-Pol polyproteins into its functional parts and thus impeding viral replication.<br><br>One notable side effect of ritonavir is that it inhibits <strong>cytochrome P450</strong>. Cytochrome P450 is an enzyme found in the liver responsible for the metabolism of many medications, including <strong>warfarin</strong>, antiepileptics, statins, and oral contraceptives. As a result, ritonavir can lead to <strong>impaired clearance</strong> and <strong>increased serum concentration</strong> of the medications mentioned above. In the case of warfarin, elevated plasma levels can lead to elevated coagulation parameters and an increased risk for bleeding.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/XtYJkAjWTX6aR1VaNowFiM_XSEaqUMuV/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Rupture of dilated veins within the esophagus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: An esophageal variceal bleed can manifest with hematemesis. Esophageal varices typically develop in the setting of portal hypertension, which leads to the formation of collateral venous circulation and esophageal vein dilation. In contrast, this patient lacks findings suggestive of underlying portal hypertension or liver disease (e.g., jaundice, ascites, hepatosplenomegaly). &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Impaired hepatic metabolism of medications:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Invasion of the esophageal wall by opportunistic pathogens:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Esophagitis caused by opportunistic pathogens (e.g., <em>Candida albicans</em>, cytomegalovirus) can cause dysphagia, odynophagia, and chest pain. In rare cases, these conditions can also cause hematemesis. However, esophagitis would not account for the elevation in PT/INR between the patient&#8217;s prior and current visit. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Poor compliance with prescribed medication regimen:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s INR was initially within the target range (2.0-3.0) but became markedly elevated after initiating ritonavir. Ritonavir can inhibit cytochrome P450 and impair warfarin metabolism. As a result, drug-drug interaction, as opposed to medication noncompliance, is the most likely cause of this patient&#8217;s elevated PT/INR and bleeding episode. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reduced renal clearance of anticoagulants:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: This patient&#8217;s INR was initially within the target range (2.0-3.0) but became markedly elevated after initiating ritonavir. Ritonavir can inhibit cytochrome P450 and impair warfarin metabolism. As a result, a decrease in hepatic metabolism, as opposed to a decrease in renal clearance, is most likely responsible for this patient&#8217;s elevated PT/INR and bleeding episode. &#160;</span></div>",
