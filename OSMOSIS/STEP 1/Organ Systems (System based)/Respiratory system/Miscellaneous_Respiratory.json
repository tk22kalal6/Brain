The offending agent is most likely <strong>ethambutol. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Ethambutol blocks the enzyme <strong>arabinosyltransferase</strong> and prevents the synthesis of arabinogalactan, which is an essential component of the mycobacterial cell wall. The medication is used to treat active tuberculosis infections. &#160; <br><br>The main side effect of ethambutol is <strong>optic neuritis,</strong> which can manifest with<strong>&#160;decreased visual acuity</strong> and <strong>red-green color blindness.</strong> Due to these potential complications, regular vision checks are necessary while taking ethambutol. The associated color blindness typically resolves once the medication is discontinued. In addition, ethambutol can decrease renal excretion of uric acid, causing <strong>hyperuricemia and</strong> increasing the risk of developing gout. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/zadL6moXRDCp4FWl4QzuTZWBQTOMmFSJ/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Blockade of bacterial topoisomerase enzymes:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Fluoroquinolones work by inhibiting bacterial topoisomerase.

      "solution": "This asymptomatic patient works in a healthcare setting and has a positive tuberculin skin test. She likely has <strong>latent tuberculosis&#160;</strong>and was initiated on isoniazid, which can cause hepatotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and drug-induced lupus. &#160; <br><br><strong>Isoniazid&#160;</strong>can be used as monotherapy for prophylaxis or treatment of latent tuberculosis. It can be used in combination with other medications to treat active tuberculosis. Isoniazid is converted by the mycobacterial enzyme <strong>catalase-peroxidase</strong> into its active metabolite iproniazid, inhibiting <strong>mycolic acid</strong>&#160;<strong>synthesis</strong>. The medication also<strong>&#160;inhibits mycobacterial peroxidase</strong> and prevents the bacteria from metabolizing hydrogen peroxide, which accumulates intracellularly, causing damage to the cell. Mycobacteria can develop resistance if mutations form in the catalase-peroxidase gene. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Side effects of isoniazid include rash, fever, and <strong>drug-induced lupus.</strong> It can also cause vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency, which leads to sideroblastic anemia. Pyridoxine deficiency also leads to neurological symptoms, including dizziness, ataxia, or encephalopathy, but the most common is<strong>&#160;peripheral neuropathy.</strong> Fortunately, these side effects can be prevented with the concurrent administration of pyridoxine. Isoniazid can also cause <strong>hepatotoxicity&#160;</strong>and <strong>inhibit cytochrome P450.</strong> Finally, in overdose cases, the drug can cause seizures, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and coma. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/uE_WgfKPSzGavQ51n0hiLOvnSgC7Bk0e/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Blockade of arabinogalactan synthesis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Ethambutol inhibits the enzyme arabinosyltransferase, thereby preventing the synthesis of arabinogalactan&#8211;a component of the mycobacterial cell wall.

      "solution": "Pharmacodynamics (the action of a medication on the body) and pharmacokinetics (the action of the body on a medication) are critical concepts in pharmacology. <strong>Bioavailability&#160;</strong>refers to the proportion of a medication that reaches circulation. Since intravenous (IV) medications are delivered directly into the bloodstream, their bioavailability is said to be 1, or 100%. Ingested medications have varying amounts of bioavailability, thus making IV medications more effective in many cases. However, some oral medications have such high bioavailability that they are almost equivalent to IV doses. As a medication passes through the GI tract, some of it may be delivered to the liver and partially metabolized, leaving less medication available for later delivery to the target tissue. This is referred to as the<strong>&#160;first-pass effect.</strong> In addition, the medication also needs to diffuse across cellular membranes to eventually be delivered to the target tissue, further potentially lowering the bioavailability. &#160; <br><br>The <strong>pKA&#160;</strong>of a medication is used to measure the relative acid strength; medications with a weaker pKA (more positive) are weaker acids and tend to be absorbed better in acidic environments (e.g. the proximal duodenum). Weak base medicines are absorbed better in basic environments (e.g. the distal ileum). &#160; The <strong>volume of distribution</strong> of a medication refers to how much a medication distributes through the body compartments. A medication with a low volume of distribution (e.g. 5 liters) is mostly found in the plasma. A medication with a high volume of distribution (e.g. 60 liters) will be found throughout all body compartments. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Weak acid:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> pKA is a measure of an acid&#8217;s strength &#8211; the higher (more positive) the pKA the number, the weaker an acid is.
