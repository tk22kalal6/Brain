The condition is characterized by upper airway disease (e.g., cough, runny nose) followed by lower airway involvement (e.g., wheezing, rales) several days later, and it is a generally benign condition.

      "solution": "This patient&#8217;s presentation is consistent with <strong>ventilator-associated pneumonia,</strong> which is a type of <strong>nosocomial pneumonia</strong> that develops <strong>&#8807; 48 hours after endotracheal intubation.</strong> The most commonly implicated organisms include <strong>Gram-negative bacilli&#160;</strong>(e.g., <strong><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em></strong>, Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive cocci (e.g. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). This patient is infected with <strong>Gram-negative rods</strong> that are <strong>oxidase-positive and lactose non-fermenting, </strong>making <strong><em>P. aeruginosa</em></strong> the most likely pathogen. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Certain bacterial strains, such as P. aeruginosa, produce the <strong>beta-lactamase enzymes</strong> that <strong>hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring of the penicillins, </strong>resulting in the loss of its antibacterial activity. The addition of a <strong>&#946;-lactamase inhibitor</strong> (e.g., clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam) can protect hydrolyzable penicillins from inactivation by these enzymes. An inhibitor <strong>extends the spectrum</strong> of its companion &#946;-lactam provided that the inactivity against a particular organism is due to destruction by a &#946;-lactamase and that the inhibitor is active against the &#946;-lactamase that is produced. They are available only in fixed combinations with specific penicillins and cephalosporins, for example, <strong>ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Facilitate piperacillin binding to the bacterial cells:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Penicillin-binding proteins in bacterial cells are responsible for bacterial binding of the antibiotic.
