The more hydrophobic (lipophilic) a medication, the more easily it can diffuse through the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and distribute throughout the body, especially in adipose tissue. Medications that are very hydrophobic (lipophilic) tend to have high volumes of distribution. For example, propofol is very lipophilic and its volume of distribution can approach 60 L/kg in adults. This explains why propranolol, unlike many other beta-blockers, can be used to treat essential tremor and performance anxiety &#8211; it is much more lipophilic than other beta-blockers and easily diffuses across the blood-brain barrier. &#160; <br><br>On the other hand, medications that are very hydrophilic (lipophobic) tend to stay in the bloodstream, as they do not readily cross cell membranes.

She most likely has<strong>&#160;emphysema.</strong><br><br>Emphysema is one of the<strong>&#160;obstructive lung diseases,</strong> which are a group of conditions characterized by obstruction of airflow and air trapping within the lungs. The underlying cause of <strong>air trapping</strong> varies based on etiology. Asthma, for example, causes air trapping due to bronchoconstriction, whereas emphysema causes air trapping due to destruction of alveolar and bronchial tissue. &#160; <br><br>&#160;Lung function testing in patients with obstructive lung diseases typically shows a small <strong>reduction in forced vital capacity</strong> (FVC) and <strong>significant reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second</strong> (FEV1) because these individuals have narrow airways, which hinder how fast air can leave the lungs.

      "solution": "This patient has shortness of breath and wheezing in the setting of aspirin use and bilateral nasal polyps. She most likely has <strong>aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease</strong> (AERD). &#160;<br><br>AERD is caused by abnormalities in the arachidonic acid biosynthesis pathway. Arachidonic acid can be metabolized via two different pathways: the<strong>&#160;5-lipoxygenase</strong> (5-LO) <strong>pathway&#160;</strong>and the<strong>&#160;cyclooxygenase-1</strong> (COX-1) <strong>pathway</strong>. The 5-LO pathway produces leukotrienes from arachidonic acid (e.g., leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4), whereas the COX-1 pathway produces prostacyclins, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid. Normally, COX-1 pathway products counterbalance the effects of leukotrienes. Most notably, <strong>prostaglandin E2</strong> (PGE2) has potent bronchodilatory properties and can inhibit eosinophils and mast cells, thereby preventing leukotriene release. &#160;<br><br>Patients with AERD have an underlying defect resulting in <strong>constitutive overproduction of leukotrienes</strong> and concomitant <strong>underproduction of COX-1 pathway products</strong>.
