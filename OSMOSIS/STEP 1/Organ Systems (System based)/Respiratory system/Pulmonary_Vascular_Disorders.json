      "solution": "Soon after the initiation of aspirin, this patient's respiratory symptoms most likely resulted from aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). In addition to discontinuing aspirin, the patient should be started on a leukotriene receptor antagonist (e.g., montelukast or zafirlukast). &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Leukotriene receptor antagonists&#160;</strong>are oral medications that prevent leukotrienes from binding to their receptors in the smooth muscles of the respiratory airways, thereby weakening smooth muscle contraction, decreasing mucus secretion, and reducing inflammation. They are especially effective in preventing exercise or aspirin-induced asthma. They have a slower onset of action than inhaled bronchodilators, which is why they are used for asthma prophylaxis and not during an acute asthma attack. &#160; <br><br>Since leukotriene receptor antagonists have mild, nonspecific side effects like headache and rash, they are given in combination with other asthma medications with more significant side effects like corticosteroids, which can cause immunosuppression, and long-acting beta-agonists, which can cause arrhythmias. Adding them to the regimen lowers the necessary dose of these more dangerous medications, which make montelukast and zafirlukast great supportive medications. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/-mWVIhUgQOagV9le2b7eeS3tQMuDf5NY/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Zileuton:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Although zileuton effectively manages aspirin-induced bronchospasms, it acts by inhibiting the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme rather than inhibiting leukotriene receptors.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Zafirlukast:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cromolyn sodium:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Cromolyn sodium stabilizes the membrane of mast cells and prevents its degranulation (release of histamine and leukotrienes).

In other patients, noncaseating granuloma formation progresses to lung fibrosis, causing shortness of breath, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and cor pulmonale. It is important to note that progressive disease can occur years after last exposure, with some cases noted to have exposures greater than thirty years ago. &#160;<br><br>Diagnosis of berylliosis rests on history, physiologic, radiographic, and histologic findings. Pulmonary function tests will typically demonstrate restrictive physiology, and radiographic findings often include <strong>nodular opacities in the mid and upper lung zones</strong>. Diagnosis can further be elucidated by the <strong>beryllium sensitivity test</strong>, where the patient's lymphocyte count is measured in response to exposure to beryllium sulfate. Cells are then counted, and those with elevated numbers of cells are considered abnormal.

Given that these symptoms tend to <strong>worsen while he is in contact with the suspected antigen(s</strong>), his condition is most consistent with<strong>&#160;hypersensitivity pneumonitis. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immune system disorder in which the lungs become inflamed in an allergic reaction to inhaled microorganisms, plant and animal proteins, or chemicals. Common triggers include <strong>coffee bean dust, moldy sugarcane,&#160;</strong>or <strong>bacterial spores from hot tubs</strong>. Additional triggers include <strong><em>Actinomyces&#160;</em>spores from farm animals, <em>Aspergillus&#160;</em>spores from moldy barley, and pigeon or bird droppings. &#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>The disease gets classified into two distinct forms: the acute form and the chronic form. In the acute form of disease, <strong>a type III hypersensitivity</strong> reaction is initiated that results in immune complex deposition in the basement membrane of pulmonary capillaries and localized inflammation. If the acute response is unsuccessful, or if there is repeated exposure to the antigen, <strong>a type IV hypersensitivity&#160;</strong>ensues, resulting in noncaseating granuloma formation in the lungs. &#160;<br><br>Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis often presents with fevers, cough, shortness of breath, and headache within hours of exposure and then subsequently resolves after removal of the exposure. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis presents similarly, but with a more insidious onset over years of exposure.
