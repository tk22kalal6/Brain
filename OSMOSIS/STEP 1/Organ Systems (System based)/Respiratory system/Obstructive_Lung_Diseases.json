Examination of the right lower lobe raises concerns for <strong>obstructive atelectasis</strong>, as ingested foreign objects can obstruct bronchi and cause collapse of the distal alveoli. &#160; <br><br><strong>Atelectasis&#160;</strong>refers to the loss of lung volume secondary to alveolar collapse. It is classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism. The fours main types are: 1) obstructive, 2) <strong>compressive</strong>, 3) <strong>contraction</strong>, and 4) <strong>adhesive</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Compressive atelectasis is when alveoli collapse occurs due to a pressure source (e.g., pleural effusion, hemothorax) pressing on the lungs. Contraction atelectasis occurs in diseases such as sarcoidosis and pulmonary fibrosis, wherein scarring of the lung parenchyma prevents adequate reexpansion. Adhesive atelectasis results from diminished surfactant function or synthesis (e.g. neonatal respiratory distress system), which causes alveoli to stick to one another. &#160; <br><br>Clinically, the most common symptom of atelectasis is <strong>cough</strong>. Physical examination will demonstrate <strong>tachypnea&#160;</strong>as well as <strong>diminished breath sounds</strong> or rales over the affected portion of the lung.

The chest wall muscles and diaphragm exert an outward tension on the lungs. Elastic recoil arises secondary to connective tissue within the lungs and exerts an inward tension. In between the chest wall and lungs is the <strong>pleural space</strong>, which contains around 10-20 ml of <strong>pleural fluid</strong>. The muscle tension and elastic recoil pulling in opposite directions creates a slight vacuum in the pleural space with a pressure of -5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, relative to 0 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in both the thoracic cavity and the lungs.

The list of conditions is numerous, but the most common ones include COPD (57% of cases), asthma, cystic fibrosis, malignancies, tuberculosis, and interstitial lung disease. In general, secondary pneumothorax occurs when a <strong>bullae ruptures</strong> in the diseased lung tissue.

The etiology of this condition is unknown, but it is thought to be associated with endometriosis. &#160; <br><br>Symptoms of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax include dyspnea, unilateral pleuritic chest pain, and reduced breath sounds in the affected lung.

It is more common after major surgeries (e.g., pelvic, intra-abdominal, cardiothoracic) resulting in prolonged periods of immobility.

ARDS most commonly occurs due to sepsis but can also occur as a complication of <strong>acute pancreatitis,</strong> major trauma, shock, drug overdose, severe burns, pneumonia and massive hemorrhage. Patients with severe acute pancreatitis have systemic circulation of activated pancreatic enzymes and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, platelet activating factor). ARDS can then be the result of microvascular thrombosis (a result of the inflammatory environment) and systemic active phospholipase A (lecithinase) digesting lecithin, a major component of surfactant, which then results in alveolar capillary damage. The injury to the alveolar epithelium and endothelium results in pulmonary edema and a protein-rich infiltrate, leading to acute respiratory failure. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The diagnostic criteria for ARDS follows the Berlin criteria, which entails <strong>ruling out a cardiac etiology</strong> causing volume overload.
