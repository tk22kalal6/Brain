ECG findings typically include ST-depression and/or T-wave inversion, but cardiac biomarkers are negative. Although unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are treated the same, they differ primarily based on whether the ischemia is severe enough to cause the irreversible cellular injury (infarction) which causes cardiac biomarker release from myocytes.

Stable angina most commonly occurs secondary to <strong>atherosclerosis</strong>.

Atherosclerosis leads to mismatch between oxygen demand and consumption, which becomes more pronounced during exertion. &#160;<br><br><strong>Nitrates (nitroglycerin)&#160;</strong>work by increasing <strong>nitric oxide (NO)</strong> release in vascular smooth muscle cells, which causes elevation of cGMP and smooth muscle relaxation.

When blood pools in the venous system, less blood flows back to the heart (<strong>decreased preload</strong>), which reduces myocardial wall stress and oxygen consumption. This mechanism is believed to be responsible for the antianginal effects of nitrates. The reduction in SVR also decreases cardiac wall stress, since the heart has to overcome less resistance to pump blood out (<strong>decreased afterload</strong>). In addition, nitrates also mildly vasodilate the coronary arteries, leading to increased oxygen delivery to the myocardium. However, the vasodilation of arteries only has a minor contribution, because nitrates affect veins more than arteries.

These medications are most commonly used to treat hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, and angina pectoris (also called stable angina), pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Of note, this patient has chest pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest as well as a normal resting EKG, which is consistent with angina pectoris. &#160; &#160;<br><br>As its name suggests, CCBs work by<strong>&#160;blocking voltage-gated calcium channels.</strong> This decreases the frequency with which calcium channels open, hence reducing calcium influx and intracellular calcium concentrations. In the sinoatrial node, CCBs are able to slow down cellular depolarization, which in turn decreases heart rate. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Moreover, by reducing calcium influx, CCBs reduce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, ultimately impairing muscle contractions. In the heart, this phenomenon causes decreased myocardial contractility as well as vasodilation of the coronary vessels. &#160; <br><br>Ultimately, CCBs treat angina via two mechanisms: <strong>1) decreasing the heart&#8217;s oxygen demand</strong> by reducing heart rate and contractility, and <strong>2) increasing its oxygen supply</strong> via coronary artery vasodilation.
