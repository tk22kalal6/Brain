Pulmonary embolism occurs when a distal thrombus, usually from the deep veins of the legs (DVT), dislodges and enters the pulmonary circulation through the right side of the heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Symptoms include sudden, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. If the PE is large enough, blood cannot pass through to the left side of the heart, and the decreased left ventricular preload reduces cardiac output, causing severe hypotension, as in this patient. Since the outflow of the right ventricle (RV) is blocked by a clot, the pressure in the RV suddenly increases (causing the murmur of tricuspid regurgitation) and the RV wall stretches, which stretches cardiac conduction fibers, delaying ventricular conduction in the right side of the heart.

The most common accessory pathway in this disorder is the <strong>bundle of Kent,</strong> which rests on the infero-lateral aspect of the right atrium. Ventricular pre-excitation via this pathway can result in reentrant tachycardias, since it does not have the same physiologic brakes as the AV node. If these reentrant tachycardias are sustained, they can result in <strong>ventricular fibrillation</strong> or <strong>sudden cardiac death</strong>. Definitive treatment involves catheter directed ablation of the bypass tract to facilitate normal conduction through the AV node. &#160; <br><br>On electrocardiogram, the disease is characterized by three distinct features: 1) a slurred upstroke of the <strong>QRS complex</strong> (delta wave), 2) <strong>wide QRS complexes&#160;</strong>(&gt;120 ms), and 3) <strong>a short PR interval</strong> (&lt;120 ms). &#160;<br><br>However, one must take care when diagnosing this condition, since electrocardiographically it may not always present at regular rates, but rather with sustained reentrant tachycardias.

In pacemaker cells, class II antiarrhythmics prevent epinephrine and norepinephrine from binding to beta receptors, which indirectly decreases the number of open L-type calcium channels. Ultimately, this decreases the amount of calcium that enters the cell at the end of phase four, leading to a <strong>slower pacemaker potential.&#160;</strong>This can be observed as a<strong>&#160;decrease in the slope during phase four</strong> and a decreased heart rate. &#160;<br><br>&#946;-blockers also indirectly prevent the opening of L-type calcium channels at<strong>&#160;the end of phase 2 in non-pacemaker cells (e.g. cardiac myocytes).</strong> This effect decreases the amount of intracellular calcium available to the muscle fibers, weakening the force generated during systole. Beta-blockers ultimately reduce myocardial oxygen demand by reducing heart rate and contractility via these pharmacologic effects. <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/m5qEYlFIT52sUEXVaD5mfRTNQAaVuzu1/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/eWsurbXsT4O1Km9OBvBe2SPfRt6hlevM/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decrease the slope of phase 0 depolarization:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Class I antiarrhythmic medications block sodium entry into the cell during depolarization.

Multifocal atrial tachycardia is characterized by an irregular R-R interval and rapid rate (&gt;100) &#160;with <strong>&gt;3 different P wave morphologies</strong>. The most appropriate initial treatment for patients presenting with MAT involves addressing the underlying cause. Calcium channel blockers such as <strong>verapamil or diltiazem</strong> can also be added to the treatment regimen should rates remain uncontrolled.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/armp8XYmQgm7OD7CZdVSKft-Q7CvOA_y/_.png\"></div><br>Verapamil and diltiazem are dihydropyridine channel blockers that target the L-type calcium channels of the heart. Specifically, L-type channels are concentrated in the pacemaker tissues (AV and SA nodes). The primary action of these medications is to <strong>reduce the phase 4 and phase 0 depolarisation in SA nodes</strong> resulting in bradycardia.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/rX1UjI7NSX_XxZu-p9oEzzmiQPKXYps0/_.png\"></div><br>These medications also <strong>prolong the effective refractory period of the AV node</strong>. As a result, AV conduction is markedly slowed, and re-entry through the AV node terminates, thus aborting the associated arrhythmia.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/BxD4icTURqOpd-TaX3ZA1SpcQBaffAr2/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hyperpolarization reduces AV nodal conduction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Adenosine slows AV nodal conduction by activating K+ channels and causing membrane hyperpolarizations through interaction with A1 GPCRs at the AV node. Verapamil prolongs the AV nodal effective refractory period and slows AV nodal conduction. It does so by blocking L-type calcium channels and delaying phase four of the pacemaker action potential. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reduction of action potential duration in ischemic ventricular tissue:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Lidocaine is a type Ib antiarrhythmic that reduces action potential duration in ischemic ventricular tissue by blocking inactivated sodium channels. It is relatively selective for partially depolarized ventricular cells and those with longer action potential duration. The brevity of the atrial potential may explain its inefficiency in terminating atrial arrhythmias. Verapamil or diltiazem can reduce inotropy of ventricular tissues but does not affect the action potential duration of ventricular tissue. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Suppress adrenergic mediated ectopy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Class II antiarrhythmics (Beta-blockers) suppress adrenergically mediated ectopic activity. The most important action of this class of medications is to prolong the effective refractory period of the AV node (an antiadrenergic action). Verapamil or diltiazem prolongs the AV node's effective refractory period; however, it does not exhibit adrenergic blockade. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Prolongation of AV nodal refractory period:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Reduced chronotropy due to vagal stimulation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that exhibits antiarrhythmic effects via vagal nerve stimulation, thus prolonging the effective refractory period of the AV node. Verapamil and diltiazem do not exert vagomimetic properties. &#160;</span></div>",

These medications work primarily via <strong>selective blockade of fast sodium channels. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br></strong><br>Class I antiarrhythmics are divided into three major classes: A, B, and C. However, all of them work via the same mechanism of action. Sodium channel blockade <strong>slows the upstroke of the sodium-dependent action potential&#160;</strong>(phase 0) and prolongs the QRS duration. However, each group has a different affinity for the fast sodium channel, resulting in group 1A prolonging the action potential duration, 1B shortening the actional potential duration, and 1C having no effect on the action potential duration. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <br><br>These medications have a predilection to slow conduction in ischemic and depolarized cells.
