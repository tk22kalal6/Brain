      "solution": "This patient with chronic, uncontrolled hypertension is presenting with <strong>decreased vision</strong>, <strong>lower extremity edema</strong>, and <strong>fatigue</strong>; in conjunction with the laboratory results and eye examination findings, he most likely has <strong>chronic kidney disease</strong> and coexisting <strong>hypertensive retinopathy</strong>. The laboratory results show high creatinine, high BUN and anemia, which support the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely secondary to chronic hypertension. &#160; <br><br>Hypertension is defined as persistent systolic BP <span>&#8805;</span> 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP <span>&#8805;</span> 80 mm Hg, which can be primary (essential) or secondary to other causes (e.g., hyperaldosteronism, fibromuscular dysplasia). Hypertension increases the risk for various complications, including: <br><br><ul><li>&#160;Neurologic: Stroke, retinopathy&#160;</li><li>&#160;Cardiopulmonary: Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy&#160;</li><li>&#160;Vascular: Aortic dissection&#160;</li><li>&#160;Renal: Chronic kidney disease&#160;</li></ul>In the kidneys, chronic hypertension causes <strong>hypertensive nephrosclerosis</strong>, which is characterized by damage to various components of the kidneys, including small blood vessels, glomeruli, renal tubules, and interstitial tissues. Chronic hypertension causes <strong>medial and intimal hypertrophy</strong> of blood vessels, resulting in narrowed vessels and ischemic damage to the kidneys. Additionally, vessel walls are further damaged by hyaline-like material deposition. Patients with nephrosclerosis typically present with a history of hypertension, progressive elevations of BUN and plasma creatinine concentration, and mild proteinuria. &#160;<br><br>Chronic hypertension also damages the eyes, leading to <strong>retinal damage</strong>. Eye examination may show <strong>flame-shaped retinal hemorrhages</strong>, <strong>arteriovenous nicking</strong>, microaneurysms and a macular star (exudate). Depending on the severity and chronicity of the hypertension, these findings typically vary.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diabetes mellitus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Retinal damage can occur in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus due to chronic hyperglycemia. It can present in two forms, proliferative and nonproliferative retinopathy. Nonproliferative retinopathy is characterized by damage to the capillaries and leaking of lipids and fluids into the retina. Eye examination will show hemorrhages and macular edema. Proliferative retinopathy, on the other hand, is caused by chronic hypoxia, which results in new blood vessel formation (neovascularization) that can lead to vitreous hemorrhage, fibrosis, and subsequent retinal detachment. However, this patient&#8217;s diabetes is likely well-controlled, as indicated by a normal HbA1c level. Additionally, the eye examination findings favor another diagnosis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Atherosclerosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Atherosclerotic disease of the ipsilateral carotid artery is the most common overall cause of central retinal artery occlusion in elderly individuals; it presents with acute, painless monocular vision loss. Fundoscopic examination, however, would reveal a pale retina due to ischemia, as opposed to this patient&#8217;s exam, which revealed retinal arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, and flame-shaped hemorrhages.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Multiple myeloma:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell cancer that arises in the bone marrow and produces large amounts of monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgG or IgA). It typically presents with hypercalcemia, renal involvement, anemia and back pain from lytic bone lesions. The massive amounts of circulating immunoglobulins can result in hyperviscosity of the patient&#8217;s blood. This hyperviscosity can affect the retinal vessels, resulting in dilated, segmented, and tortuous retinal veins, giving a \"sausage link\" appearance. However, this patient&#8217;s calcium level is normal, and the eye examination and laboratory results favor another diagnosis.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Hypertension:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Thromboembolism:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Thromboembolism is a potential cause of central retinal artery occlusion, which presents as acute, painless monocular vision loss. Embolic sources include carotid artery atherosclerosis, cardiac vegetations, and patent foramen ovale. Eye examination will show retinal cloudiness with attenuated vessels and &#8220;cherry-red&#8221; spot at the fovea. This patient&#8217;s eye examination and laboratory results favor another diagnosis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Age-related macular degeneration:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Age-related macular degeneration usually presents with distortion of straight lines (metamorphopsia) and eventual loss of central vision (scotomas). It can be further divided into dry (nonexudative) or wet (exudative). Dry macular degeneration is characterized by deposition of yellow material (drusen) in the retina, while wet causes neovascularization.

      "solution": "This young woman, who is presenting with overt hypertension, subauricular and abdominal bruits as well as pulsatile tinnitus, most likely has <strong>fibromuscular dysplasia</strong> (FMD). FMD is a <strong>nonatherosclerotic</strong>, <strong>noninflammatory&#160;</strong>disorder that results in arterial occlusion, stenosis, aneurysm, dissection, and arterial tortuosity. The exact etiology of FMD remains unknown, but a genetic origin is highly suspected. The findings are widely spread throughout the body but most frequently involve the <strong>renal&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;internal carotid arteries</strong>, followed by the vertebral, visceral, and external iliac arteries. A <strong>subauricular bruit</strong> is highly suggestive of FMD, since young patients should not have symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis until much older. Approximately 90% of the cases are seen in women. Symptoms of FMD are variable and depend on the location, severity, and type of FMD. Common signs and symptoms are: <br><br><ul><li>&#160;<strong>Hypertension</strong> (typically caused by renal artery FMD)&#160;</li><li>&#160;<strong>Headache</strong>, especially migraines (more common in carotid or vertebral artery FMD)&#160;</li><li>&#160;<strong>Pulsatile tinnitus</strong>, which patients describe as hearing a &#8216;swishing&#8217; or &#8216;whooshing&#8217; sound in their ears that matches the timing of their own heartbeat (more common in carotid or vertebral artery FMD)&#160;</li></ul><strong>Secondary hypertension</strong> is the most common manifestation of FMD. The renal artery stenosis results in decreased renal perfusion which activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, resulting in <strong>elevated renin</strong>. This has direct effects on sodium excretion, sympathetic nerve activity, intrarenal prostaglandin concentrations, and nitric oxide production, which ultimately lead to renovascular hypertension.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/W9mD_1jySOahAhP-VbdvTHLrTyuk9azu/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Elevated CO2&#160;on pulse oximetry:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Elevated CO2 level on pulse oximetry can be seen in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). This condition can occur in obese individuals with body mass index [BMI] &gt;30 kg/m2. The excess weight leads to reduced mobility of the diaphragm, as well as reduced relative inspiratory muscle strength. OHS can cause pulmonary hypertension and subsequently right ventricular failure. Although this patient&#8217;s BMI meets the criteria for obesity, the bruits and overt hypertension favors another diagnosis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Elevated plasma metanephrines level:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: &#160;</strong>Elevated plasma metanephrines level can be seen in pheochromocytoma, the most common tumor of the adrenal medulla in adults. The tumor is derived from chromaffin cells (neural crest) and can secrete epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Symptoms occur in &#8220;spells&#8221; characterized by elevated blood pressure, headache, diaphoresis, palpitations and pallor.

These tumors are derived from neuroendocrine cells and can arise in the lung or intestines. They secrete serotonin (5-HT) and present as recurrent diarrhea, cutaneous flushing, asthmatic wheezing, and right sided valvular heart disease. This patient&#8217;s presentation favors another diagnosis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Elevated free cortisol on 24-hour urinalysis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Elevated free cortisol on 24-hour urinalysis can be seen in Cushing syndrome, a condition associated with multiple entities (e.g., external steroid use, primary adrenal adenoma, ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma, small cell lung cancer). Cushing syndrome is characterized by hypertension, weight gain, changes in physical appearance (e.g., moon facies, truncal obesity, buffalo hump), and hirsutism. Cushing syndrome is more common in the setting of chronic oral corticosteroid usage, but it would be highly unlikely with this patient&#8217;s use of a corticosteroid inhaler. Additionally, this patient&#8217;s bruits on physical examination favor another diagnosis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Elevated renin levels&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.&#160;</span></div>",

In response to an increase in intravascular pressure, the myogenic response is vascular vasoconstriction. The relative peripheral hypoperfusion causes an increase in vasoactive hormones, such as angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and antidiuretic hormone; this maladaptive response worsens the peripheral resistance and leads to a vicious cycle of worsening hypertension and <strong>damage to organs</strong>. In this case of hypertensive emergency, the patient&#8217;s <strong>pulmonary edema</strong> is most likely caused by left ventricular dysfunction due to elevated high blood pressure, resulting in backup of blood into the pulmonary vasculature. &#160; <br><br>Hypertensive urgency is defined as <strong>systolic and diastolic blood pressures &#8805;180/&#8805;120 mmHg</strong> respectively without acute end-organ damage.

This can lead to volume expansion, sodium retention, and subsequent hypertension. &#160; <br><br>Patients with <strong>bilateral RAS</strong> are<strong>&#160;dependent upon angiotensin II&#160;</strong>for maintaining adequate GFR. <strong>The use of angiotensinogen-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs),&#160;</strong>such as lisinopril, blocks the angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction, which can reduce systemic blood pressure and reduce RBF. In addition, it also causes renal efferent arteriole dilation and a reduction in GFR and renal filtration fraction. Therefore, ACEIs can precipitate renal failure and are <strong>relatively contraindicated in patients with bilateral RAS.</strong>&#160; The medication, however, can be continued if the rise in serum creatinine remains acceptable (i.e. &lt;30 %). On the other hand, in unilateral renal artery stenosis, the unaffected kidney compensates for the reduced GFR in the stenosed kidney.

Guanethidine blocks the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, preventing norepinephrine release into the synaptic cleft. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Metyrosine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Metyrosine prevents the synthesis of norepinephrine by inhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase, which is involved in the first step of catecholamine synthesis. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Reserpine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Amphetamine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines that promote the release of catecholamines (primarily dopamine and norepinephrine) from their storage sites in the presynaptic nerve terminals. Less commonly, amphetamines can block the reuptake of catecholamines through competitive inhibition. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cocaine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Cocaine is a central nervous system stimulant and a local anesthetic. Central nervous system effects are mediated primarily through presynaptic norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin reuptake blockade. &#160;</span></div>",
