She is now presenting with some of the classic signs of <strong>aortic regurgitation</strong><strong>&#160;(AR)</strong>, which is most likely due to untreated<strong>&#160;rheumatic fever</strong>. In developed countries, AR is most often due to<strong>&#160;congenital bicuspid aortic valve</strong>, <strong>aortic root dilation</strong>, and<strong>&#160;endocarditis</strong>. Symptoms of AR include exertional dyspnea, angina, and palpitations, and the condition can eventually lead to <strong>left heart failure.</strong><br><br>Aortic insufficiency leads to blood return to the left ventricle during diastole and an increase in the <strong>end diastolic volume</strong>. In an attempt to compensate for the increase in wall stress, the left ventricle undergoes <strong>eccentric hypertrophy</strong>, leading to an increased stroke volume. This increased stroke volume increases the systolic pressure, while the regurgitation leads to a rapid fall in diastolic pressure and collapse of the arteries -- which, in combination, results in a <strong>wide pulse pressure</strong> (systolic pressure minus diastolic blood pressure). The resulting wide pulse pressure is responsible for a number of characteristic physical findings including: <strong>head bobbing</strong> (de Musset sign),<strong>&#160;capillary pulsations</strong> of the fingertips or lips, and abrupt <strong>distention&#160;</strong>and <strong>collapse</strong> of the arterial pulse (water hammer sign).

Family history is unremarkable. He traveled to South America one year ago but does not recall any subsequent illnesses. Temperature is 37.0 &#176;C (98.6 &#176;F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 131/80 mmHg. On physical examination, the patient appears visibly dyspneic.

Cardiac biopsy demonstrates an<strong>&#160;Aschoff body</strong> (giant cell granuloma) and<strong>&#160;Anitschkow cells</strong> (macrophages with a wavy nucleus), favoring the diagnosis of <strong>rheumatic heart disease</strong>.<br><br>Acute rheumatic fever is an early sequela of untreated group A streptococcal throat infection that usually occurs two weeks following untreated group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis. Clinical manifestations include arthritis, carditis, chorea, erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules. Cardiac involvement typically involves all layers of the heart (<strong>pancarditis</strong>).<br><br>Damage to cardiac valves often becomes chronic and progressive, leading to mitral (most common), aortic, and, rarely, tricuspid valve damage. Rheumatic heart disease may manifest years after the initial episode of GAS pharyngitis. Regurgitation is the most common complication, but it may progress to stenosis. Pathogenesis involves antibody production and subsequent T cell response against myosin that shares similar epitopes with the <strong>M protein virulence factor&#160;</strong>of the bacteria (type II hypersensitivity). &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Parasitic infection:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Chagas disease is caused by the protozoa <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em>, which is transmitted to humans via the triatomine insect (kissing bug).

      "solution": "<em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, known as group A strep (GAS), is a Gram-positive catalase-negative coccus that forms chains and pairs. It causes skin infections (e.g., impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis) and pharyngitis. GAS also causes many diseases due to its toxins and sequelae of immunological reactions to the bacteria and its toxins (e.g., rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis).<br><br>GAS is an <strong>encapsulated bacterium</strong>, and the capsule helps in evading phagocytosis. In addition, a structural protein found on the capsule of GAS called <strong>M protein</strong> helps prevent phagocytosis by binding to complement regulators and fibrinogen. M protein also helps in the attachment of the bacteria to host cells. Antibodies against M protein help in defense against the bacteria. <strong>These antibodies are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever</strong> because the M protein structurally resembles specific structures in the human body, specifically myosin and glycogen in the heart and smooth muscles. This autoimmune attack of the antibodies against M protein on the heart and human tissues leads to rheumatic fever.
