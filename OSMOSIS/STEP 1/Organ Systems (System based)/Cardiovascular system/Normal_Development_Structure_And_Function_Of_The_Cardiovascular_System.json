The body responds to short-term changes in blood pressure via the arterial baroreflex to maintain mean arterial pressure between 85 and 100 mm Hg. The decreased pressure causes the walls of the <strong>aortic arch</strong> and <strong>carotid sinus</strong> to become less stretched, and the baroreceptors start firing less frequently. The <strong>glossopharyngeal</strong> and <strong>vagus nerve</strong> carries that decreased signal to the cardiovascular centers of the brainstem (nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla). These centers <strong>stimulate the sympathetic</strong> and <strong>inhibit the parasympathetic nervous systems from bringing the pressure back up to normal</strong>. Specifically, the vasomotor center increases the vasoconstrictive effect of the sympathetic nervous system, causing the arterioles to narrow, increasing the total peripheral arterial resistance and constriction of veins. This increases more blood return to the heart. <strong>Increased venous return</strong> means more preload, which also increases cardiac output. &#160;Meanwhile, the cardiac accelerator center in the medulla is also stimulated, increasing the heart rate and contractility. In contrast, the cardiac decelerator center is deactivated, reducing the parasympathetic effects on the heart, which speeds up the heart rate. Combined, these effects result in an <strong>increased cardiac output</strong> (CO) and an <strong>increase in total peripheral resistance</strong> (TPR) which raises the blood pressure (BP) back to normal. In this case, these changes are essential in responding to severe hemorrhage. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/q3M5qYM7Qv6n1afoMlEFAaVZQ7yCdSwG/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ The aortic arch transmits via the vagus nerve to the midbrain:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: There are minor contributors to the arterial baroreflex in the aortic arch that transmit via the vagus nerve, but they synapse at the nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla, not the midbrain.

In the heart, two distinct types of action potentials occur in 2 different types of cells, the pacemaker cells, and the cardiac myocytes. <br><br>The myocytes are the contractile units of the heart and make up the myocardium. Their action potential is characterized by 5 different phases: <br><br><strong>Phase 4</strong>: Also known as the <strong>resting phase</strong>. It is the initial phase where the ion channels are mainly closed and the membrane potential is resting at -90 mV. Because of the presence of gap junctions between the myocytes, some positive ions leak from neighboring cells that are depolarized (mainly calcium ions) bringing the membrane potential up to -70 mV, which is the threshold potential for depolarization.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Heu5sSXxSpaRLYftHRLfEfJdTTi3QiOS/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><strong>Phase 0</strong>: This is known as the <strong>depolarization phase</strong>. When the membrane potential reaches the threshold (-70 mV), the <strong>voltage-gated sodium channels</strong> open and the rapid influx of sodium into the cells brings the membrane potential up to +20 mV.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/F-nhk1IPQ3KwFThNnBRs0WowTTCvkb0S/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><strong>Phase 1</strong>: the <strong>initial repolarization phase</strong>. After the membrane potential of myocytes reaches +20 mV, depolarization ends and the sodium channels close. This is followed by the opening of the <strong>voltage-gated potassium channels</strong>. The efflux of potassium towards the outside of the cell causes the membrane potential to drop until phase 2 starts. The initial repolarization is responsible for the notch seen in the myocytes action potential.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/rjLvSlzITd6tdUGLgwEQVb9cQD2OzDhl/_.png\"></div><br><strong>Phase 2</strong>: the <strong>plateau phase</strong>. Shortly after the opening of the voltage-gated potassium channels in phase 1, <strong>voltage-gated calcium channels</strong> open and allow calcium ions to influx into the cells. In this phase, the inward current by calcium ions balances the outward current of potassium channels, and the membrane potential stabilizes, thus called the plateau phase. This phase is important in the myocyte action potential because it is responsible for the length of the action potential and the calcium influx is what actually causes the myocytes to <strong>contract</strong>. <br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/5F8EpLwuTNOmoDy5uSVTpoXFS1a-fGFT/_.png\"></div><br><strong>Phase 3</strong>: the <strong>repolarization phase</strong>.

Pulse pressure is directly proportional to <strong>stroke volume</strong> and inversely proportional to <strong>arterial compliance</strong>. An increase in stroke volume means more blood is ejected from the heart, which would result in an increased SBP and pulse pressure. Similarly, a decrease in vascular compliance means the ejected blood is pushing against a stiff vascular wall, which would also increase SBP and pulse pressure. <br><br>These physiological parameters can be illustrated via some clinical scenarios. One example is aortic <strong>stiffening</strong>, which can be due to natural aging or secondary to arteriosclerosis. The condition will lead to <strong>decreased arterial compliance</strong>.

After the pacemaker cells in the SA node initiate an action potential, it travels through the conduction system to the myocytes of the atria and the ventricles causing them to contract. <br><br>First, the wave spreads to the atria through the fast conducting system called the atrial internodal tract, which ensures that the action potential spreads to the right and left atria, and to all cells within each atria at almost the same time, and therefore, the atria contracts at the same time ejecting blood into the ventricles.<br><br>At the same time, the action potential is also sent to the atrioventricular node (AV node) to reach the heart. In the AV node there is a notable slowing in the propagation of the action potential into the ventricles. This delay is due to two reasons: 1.

This change promotes downstream phosphorylation of proteins like <strong>sarcolemmal calcium channels</strong> on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane, increasing SR&#8217;s ability to release calcium. Furthermore, sympathetic stimulation promotes phospholamban phosphorylation, a protein found on the SR membrane that regulates calcium ATPase.

      "solution": "Pacemaker cells are where the action potential of the heart starts; therefore, they are responsible for setting the rhythm and the rate of the heart. These cells continuously generate action potentials that are then conducted to the rest of the heart. The most important pacemaker cells are the <strong>sinoatrial (SA) nodes located in the right atrium</strong> near the opening of the superior vena cava. Additionally, the atrioventricular (AV) node is a small structure in the heart, near the coronary sinus on the interatrial septum, which also contains pacemaker cells. Other pacemaker cells are also found in the internodal tract, the Bundle of His, and the Purkinje fibers.<br><br>The action potential in the pacemaker cells is different from the rest of the heart, and is divided into 3 main phases: phase 4, phase 0, and phase 3.<br><br><strong>Phase 4, also known as the pacemaker phase</strong>, is unique to the pacemaker cells. In this phase, there is a <strong>gradual depolarization</strong> due to the <strong>slow influx of sodium ions</strong> into the cells through the &#160;hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN channel); these may sometimes be referred to as the &#8220;funny&#8221; current (If). This slow influx of sodium brings the membrane potential from -65 mV to the threshold of the pacemaker cells -40 mV. <strong>The slope of this phase determines the heart rate</strong>.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/q1GCnBVoShWDIRz7kXoY0jroT8mTtUxN/_.png\"></div><br><strong>Phase 0, is the depolarization phase</strong>. Once the action potential of the pacemaker reaches the threshold of -40 mV, <strong>voltage-gated calcium channels</strong> open and the influx of calcium ions into the cells causes depolarization and brings the membrane potential up to +10 mV. Note that the <strong>depolarization of the pacemaker cells is due to the influx of calcium ions, and not sodium ions unlike the myocardial cells</strong>.<br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/2DgE7q__RdyV3rTp6VWkjgGpQv6_VmrW/_.png\"></div>&#160;<br><strong>Phase 3, is the repolarization phase</strong>. Finally, once depolarization is complete, the voltage-gated calcium channels close and the <strong>potassium channels open</strong>. This results in a rapid efflux of potassium ions outside the cells bringing the membrane potential back to -65 mV or even lower. During this phase, both the HCN channels bringing sodium ions in and the potassium channels bringing potassium ions out of the cell are open; however, because much more potassium ions leave than sodium enters the cell, the membrane potential drops. After phase 3 is done, the action potential is complete, and the cell enters phase 4 again to start a new action potential. <br>&#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/kD1fddyNQfC6orEZ3m0vT_ROQw_xwP-M/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Influx of sodium ions into the cell &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Influx of calcium ions into the cell &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Depolarization of the pacemaker cells (phase 0) is due to the influx of calcium ions into the cells.

Changes in contractility, preload, and afterload can all affect the shape of the pressure-volume loop. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Increased <strong>contractility&#160;</strong>(e.g., catecholamine release, dobutamine use) will cause the heart to contract more forcefully and increase ventricular pressure during systole.

      "solution": "In a healthy heart, the depolarization wave starts at the sinoatrial (SA) node in the right atrium from where it travels to the cardiac apex, which aligns with the lead II vector. It quickly travels through the intranodal tracts to the left atrium, causing a positive deflection on the electrocardiogram (ECG), called the <strong>P-wave</strong>. The wave is then carried to the AV node, where it gets delayed for a bit to allow the atria enough time to get fully emptied. It appears as a flat line on the ECG called the <strong>PR interval</strong>. From there, the signal goes through the pacemaker cells of the Bundle of His, and the bundle branches down into the Purkinje fibers. The apex of the heart depolarizes, followed by depolarization of the base, creating a <strong>QRS complex</strong> on the ECG. &#160; <br><br>After tissue depolarizes, there is a brief absence of electrical activity, making an isoelectric line called the <strong>ST segment</strong>. After that, the ventricles repolarize, the wave of which travels in an overall upward direction.

      "solution": "This patient was diagnosed with <strong>aortic stenosis</strong>. The condition will increase cardiac <strong>afterload</strong> and manifest with changes to the pressure-volume loop, including an increase in systolic blood pressure and a decrease in stroke volume. &#160; <br><br><strong>Pressure-volume loops</strong> characterize changes in left ventricular pressure and volume throughout the cardiac cycle. The loop can be divided into four phases: isovolumetric contraction, systolic ejection, isovolumetric relaxation, and ventricular filling. The loop&#8217;s width corresponds to the stroke volume, which is the difference between the end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. &#160; &#160;<br><br>An increase in afterload (e.g., aortic stenosis, system hypertension) will lead to <strong>impaired ventricular emptying</strong>. In aortic stenosis, aortic resistance increases, and the <strong>ventricular pressure</strong> during systole has to rise higher than usual for blood to be pushed out into the aorta. Hence, the height of the pressure-volume loop will increase. Furthermore, an increase in afterload means less blood can be pumped out of the heart during each beat. As a result, the <strong>end-systolic volume</strong> will be higher than that of a healthy individual, and <strong>stroke volume</strong> will decrease, which manifests as a narrowing of the pressure-volume loop. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ :</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> These changes may occur in individuals with systolic heart failure. The condition is characterized by a loss of inotropy, which prevents blood from being squeezed out of the heart and results in an increased end-systolic volume.
