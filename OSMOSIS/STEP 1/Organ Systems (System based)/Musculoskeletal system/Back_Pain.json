This weakness can present with difficulty rising from a chair, <strong>lifting one&#8217;s arms</strong>, climbing stairs, or combing one&#8217;s hair. Sometimes, the patient&#8217;s muscles may be<strong>&#160;tender or painful.</strong> In severe cases, the muscles of the pharynx and esophagus are involved, resulting in dysphagia. <strong>Skin findings are absent&#160;</strong>in patients with polymyositis. &#160;<br><br>Polymyositis is an <strong>autoimmune condition</strong> which occurs when <strong>cytotoxic (CD8+) T-cells</strong> are inappropriately activated by normal muscle proteins. The cytotoxic T-cells attack muscle cells, resulting in their apoptosis. The specific antigenic targets in polymyositis include<strong>&#160;tRNA synthetases</strong>, also called Jo-1, a <strong>nuclear protein known as Mi-2</strong>, and components of the<strong>&#160;signal-recognition particle (SRP)&#160;</strong>which helps with proteins trafficking within the cell.

The condition has a <strong>bimodal distribution</strong>, most commonly affecting women in their 20s and 30s and men in their 60s and 70s. It occurs due to the formation of autoantibodies against<strong>&#160;nicotinic acetylcholine receptors</strong> on muscle cells. &#160;<br><br>The hallmark symptom is muscle weakness that <strong>worsens after repeated activity</strong> and<strong>&#160;improves after rest</strong>. Patients may complain of <strong>ptosis&#160;</strong>and <strong>diplopia&#160;</strong>secondary to extraocular muscle weakness early in the course of the disease. Later on, <strong>bulbar&#160;</strong>muscles involvement can result in slurred speech, difficulty chewing, and choking. <strong>Neck&#160;</strong>muscles involvement can cause patients to feel that their head is heavy and difficult to keep upright. Lastly, involvement of the proximal limb muscles can result in difficulty climbing stairs, combing hair, or brushing teeth. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Approximately 75% of patients with MG have associated thymic abnormalities (e.g., thymic hyperplasia, thymoma), and mediastinal imaging should be performed in every patient to actively rule them out.

Less commonly, the patient may have a <strong>malar rash</strong> (erythema of the cheeks and bridge of the nose with sparing of the nasolabial folds), classically in the shape of butterfly. Another classic finding is the <strong>Gottron sign&#160;</strong>which consists of flat, red, scaly papules over the back of the fingers, elbows, or knees. &#160;<br><br>Dermatomyositis occurs when the body produces <strong>self-antibodies&#160;</strong>against autoantigens in the muscle and skin.

      "solution": "This patient has <strong>polymyalgia rheumatica</strong> (PMR). It is an inflammatory disease that often affects patients (women&gt;men) over<strong>&#160;50 years of age.</strong> The condition causes symptoms like <strong>pain and stiffness of the shoulder and hip</strong>, which often starts on one side, but typically progresses to both sides within weeks. The symptoms are usually more severe in the morning and at night, often lasting for more than an hour, and they typically improve after activity. Morning stiffness in PMR is always present, and its absence excludes the diagnosis of PMR. The pain can make it hard to get out of bed or up from a chair, and lifting the arms above shoulder height can be difficult. It can also cause a <strong>low-grade fever, fatigue,</strong> and<strong>&#160;loss of appetite&#160;</strong>which can lead to weight loss. &#160;<br><br>Many patients with PMR can develop <strong>temporal arteritis</strong>. Temporal arteritis causes inflammation of the body&#8217;s large- and medium-sized arteries, including the carotid arteries, its major branches, and the aorta. The condition can present with symptoms including <strong>headaches, jaw claudication </strong>and <strong>visual disturbances</strong>. Jaw claudication is a very common symptom and can be seen in over 50% of patients with temporal arteritis. Since temporal arteritis affects the internal carotid artery, it can affect the branches, including the ophthalmic artery; therefore, the most feared complication of GCA is <strong>permanent loss of vision</strong>, which commonly is painless and sudden, can be partial or complete, and can be unilateral or bilateral. In contrast to other symptoms, vision loss only occurs in 10% of patients. &#160; &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ulnar deviation of the bilateral wrists:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Ulnar deviation would be observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune condition characterized by joint pain, swelling, and synovial destruction.

It can be triggered by infections, surgery/anesthesia, pregnancy, and medications such as beta-blockers. The condition manifests with <strong>dyspnea&#160;</strong>and <strong>respiratory insufficiency,</strong> which can quickly progress to respiratory failure. &#160;<br><br>It is important to distinguish a myasthenic crisis from a <strong>cholinergic crisis</strong>, which occurs due to overtreatment of MG by acetylcholinerase inhibitors (e.g. pyridostigmine). In a cholinergic crisis, too much acetylcholine is present at the neuromuscular junction. Both cholinergic crisis and myasthenic crisis manifest with similar symptoms, so an <strong>edrophonium test</strong> is needed to distinguish the two. Administration of edrophonium briefly blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine, temporarily increasing its levels at the neuromuscular junction. In myasthenic crisis, the increased acetylcholine levels are enough to overcome the symptoms caused by the decreased number of available receptors, so muscle weakness improves.

      "solution": "<strong>Disc herniation</strong> is one of the most common causes of <strong>lumbosacral radiculopathy</strong>. The disc is composed of the inner nucleus pulposus and outer annulus fibrosus. In disc herniation, the nucleus pulposus extrudes through the annulus fibrosus into the vertebral canal, causing <strong>mechanical compression</strong> of the spinal cord and <strong>inflammation</strong>. &#160; <br><br>The lumbosacral spine is especially susceptible to disc herniations because of its mobility. Up to 95% of injuries occur at the <strong>L4-L5</strong> and <strong>L5-S1</strong> levels. The lumbar and sacral spinal nerve roots exit the spinal cord at the T12-L1 vertebral level, where the spinal cord tapers as the conus medullaris. The nerves then travel down the canal as the cauda equina and exit at their respective neural foramina. The nerves can be compressed anywhere along their course depending on the type of herniation, size, and location. The most common type of herniation is <strong>posterolateral&#160;</strong>(paracentral), less common <strong>central</strong>, and rare <strong>far lateral</strong>. With the exception of C1-7 nerves, which exit above the corresponding vertebrae, and C8, which exit below C7, the rest of the spinal nerves exit below their corresponding vertebrae. Due to these reasons, a posterolateral disc herniation at the level of L4-5 vertebrae will compress the L5 nerve.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/DPkgiU58QkqWLBw1b0tr8121QRGGSPN1/_.png\"></div><br><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ L3:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The L3 nerve root exits the spinal canal below the L3 vertebrae and therefore is spared.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ L4:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The L4 nerve root exits below L4 vertebrae and can be injured in far lateral disc protrusion but these are rare, and this patient has a posterolateral disc herniation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ L5:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ S1:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The S1 nerve root exits the spinal canal below the L5 vertebrae at the sacral foramina.
