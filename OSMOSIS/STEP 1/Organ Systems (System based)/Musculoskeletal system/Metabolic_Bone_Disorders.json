The physical examination is negative for findings of cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, or other sources of infection. Together, these clinical findings are concerning for a <strong>psoas abscess</strong>, which can lead to <strong>femoral nerve damage</strong> if untreated. <br><br>A psoas abscess is a collection of pus in the iliopsoas compartment; it may result from an infection's contiguous, hematogenous, or postoperative spread. While rare, it more commonly presents in patients with underlying <strong>immunosuppression, diabetes,&#160;</strong>or<strong>&#160;intravenous drug use</strong>. <br><br>Clinically, this disease presents with fever and <strong>subacute, poorly localized back or flank pain</strong> radiating to the knee, in addition to gait disturbance or neuropathy if the femoral nerve is implicated. If the abscess becomes large enough, it may be palpable in the inguinal region and mistaken for an inguinal hernia, lymphadenopathy, or saphenous vein varix. <br><br>The femoral nerve courses anteriorly along with the iliopsoas and thus may become damaged as the disease progresses. Damage to this nerve may ultimately result in <strong>femoral neuropathy</strong>, manifesting with quadriceps weakness, decreased patellar reflexes, as well as sensory loss along the medial thigh and leg. Diagnosis is best achieved via a <strong>contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis</strong>.

      "solution": "This patient is presenting with acute onset of low back pain after heavy lifting. The presence of pain radiating from the back to the foot and weakness in dorsiflexion is consistent with <strong>lumbosacral radiculopathy of L5 spinal nerve root</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Radiculopathy refers to any disease process that affects the function of one or more lumbosacral nerve roots as they exit the spinal cord. Lumbosacral radiculopathy is often caused by nerve root compression due to <strong>disc herniation</strong> or <strong>spondylosis&#160;</strong>(degenerative changes). The compressed nerve carries both sensory and motor fibers. The specific sensory distribution of a single nerve root is termed <strong>dermatome</strong>, while the muscles served by a single spinal nerve root are termed <strong>myotome</strong>. Due to these features, a neurological exam that includes sensory, strength, and reflex evaluation can assist in the localization of the injury. &#160; <br><br>It is important to note, however, that if an injury occurs to the peripheral nerves which are formed by integration of multiple nerve roots, the distribution will be according to the peripheral nerve innervation rather than myotomes and dermatomes. &#8220;Sciatica&#8221; is a non-specific term often applied to various conditions of low back pain with/without radiation to the leg regardless of the cause. The use of this term is often confusing and should be avoided when describing radiculopathy. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/wWC154IKQhy6Uv9sXciQtVmMQL_dGN_C/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ L1:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Lumbar disc herniation at the L1 level is rare, and therefore L1 radiculopathy is unlikely.

Furthermore, radiography demonstrates <strong>excessive lumbar lordosis</strong> or an increase in inward curvature of the lumbar vertebrae. &#160; <br><br>The spine's normal curvature typically follows four normal curvatures, which can be seen on a lateral view radiograph. These include thoracic and sacral kyphosis. Kyphosis is an increased front to back curve of the spine giving a convex curve in the spine (i.e., convexity towards the back of the spine). in those areas. There is also a normal cervical and lumbar lordosis giving a gently concave curve in those areas (i.e, concavity towards the back of the spine). Two common spinal abnormalities include <strong>excessive thoracic or thoracolumbar kyphosis </strong>and <strong>excessive lumbar lordosis</strong>. &#160; <br><br><strong>Excessive kyphosis</strong> typically occurs in the thoracic region and leads to a hunchback appearance. This process can be postural or due to vertebral compression fractures from osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, or spondylolisthesis. Additional etiologies include genetic disorders such as Scheuermann kyphosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, or metabolic or congenital disabilities like spina bifida. &#160; <br><br><strong>Excessive lumbar lordosis</strong> results in the presence of an anterior pelvic tilt or swayback posture on physical examination. It is most often due to poor posture, obesity, weak hamstrings, tight hip flexors, or osteoporosis. Like excessive kyphosis, excessive lumbar lordosis is also associated with several genetic disorders, including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and achondroplasia. It can lead to lumbar pain and if untreated, excessive lumbar lordosis may result in slippage of intervertebral discs, radiculopathy, and spondylolisthesis.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Excessive lumbar lordosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Excessive thoracolumbar kyphosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Thoracolumbar kyphosis refers to excessive thoracic/lumbar convexity seen in the sagittal plane..

Osteoporosis is defined clinically as bone density that is less than <strong>2.5 standard deviations</strong> below peak bone mass. <br><br>Osteoporosis can be divided into type I and type II. <strong>Type I osteoporosis&#160;</strong>affects <strong>postmenopausal females</strong> who have reduced estrogen production. Estrogen normally inhibits osteoclast resorption of bone; therefore, decreased estrogen levels leave the patient vulnerable to increased osteoclast breakdown of bone. Although osteoblast activity does increase to compensate, it ultimately cannot keep up with the resorptive process.

With age, osteoblasts lose their ability to proliferate and form new bone.

The condition most often involves the skull, lumbar vertebrae, pelvis, and femur. &#160;<br><br>&#160;The disease has four phases:&#160;<ol><li>&#160;Phase 1 is the <strong>lytic phase</strong>, wherein osteoclasts start to aggressively demineralize the bone up to 20 times more than normal. &#160;</li><li>&#160;Phase 2 is the <strong>mixed phase,</strong> wherein there is rapid breakdown of existing bone and rapid deposition of new bone. &#160;</li><li>&#160;Phase 3 is the<strong>&#160;sclerotic phase</strong>, which is when new bone formation exceeds bone resorption. &#160;</li><li>&#160;Phase 4 is the <strong>quiescent phase</strong>, wherein both osteoblast and osteoclast activity is reduced. The net result is production of disorganized bone that is weaker than normal bone. &#160;</li></ol>Patients present with <strong>bone pain</strong> due to microfractures, <strong>erythema/warmth</strong> over affected areas, and increased shoe/hat size after puberty. In addition, changes in the shape of the skull can cause <strong>facial changes</strong> and<strong>&#160;cranial nerve impingement,</strong> which can present with sensorineural hearing loss. Laboratory findings, which reflect increased bone turnover, include <strong>elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase</strong> (ALP). In contrast, serum calcium and phosphorus are normal in most patients. &#160;<br>&#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/s_8sHXwbR8C6tWQZEZBblVA0T_yN6Wsl/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;&#160;Calcium &#160;Phosphate  Alkaline Phosphatase&#160; &#8595;&#160;&#160;Normal&#160;&#160;Normal&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>These findings can be seen in patients with osteopetrosis.

Bone turnover due to high parathyroid hormone levels will result in an elevated alkaline phosphatase. Although hyperparathyroidism can cause bony pain, the condition presents with cortical thinning on radiographic imaging. In contrast, this patient has cortical thickening.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;&#160;Calcium&#160;&#160;Phosphate&#160;&#160;Alkaline Phosphatase&#160;&#160;&#8595;&#160;&#160;&#8595;&#160;&#160;&#8593;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Osteomalacia will present with these findings. In these patients, osteoblasts will deposit significant quantities of osteoid seam, explaining the elevated alkaline phosphatase level. However, not enough calcium or phosphate is available for the osteoid to mineralize and form mature bone.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;&#160;Calcium &#160;Phosphate  Alkaline Phosphatase&#160;Normal &#160;Normal&#160;&#160;Normal&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>These findings are seen in patients with osteoporosis.
