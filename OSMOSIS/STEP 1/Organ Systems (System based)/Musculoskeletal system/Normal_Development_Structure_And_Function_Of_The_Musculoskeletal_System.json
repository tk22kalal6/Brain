Together, these findings are concerning for <strong>serotonin syndrome.&#160;</strong>The new medication was most likely <strong>dextromethorphan</strong>, which works primarily by<strong>&#160;antagonizing NMDA receptors but also exerts serotonergic effects. &#160; &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br><strong>Dextromethorphan&#160;</strong>is an antitussive that can be used to relieve cough caused by minor viral upper respiratory tract infections or inhaled irritants. It acts primarily by <strong>antagonizing NMDA glutamate receptors.</strong> This medication is a codeine-analog and has mild opioid effects when used in excess. As a result, the medication carries mild abuse potential. Moreover, dextromethorphan can<strong>&#160;inhibit serotonin reuptake</strong> and can precipitate serotonin syndrome, especially when taken in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Side effects, particularly with overdose, include hallucinations, <strong>confusion, euphoria,</strong> nausea, vomiting, and <strong>nystagmus</strong>.

Guaifenesin is an expectorant, not an antitussive.

Antihistamines would not trigger serotonin syndrome when used in combination with fluoxetine. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. phenelzine, tranylcypromine) are antidepressants that increase serotonin levels and can precipitate serotonin syndrome.

The ACE inhibitor should be stopped immediately and/or <strong>replaced with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs),</strong> which does not affect bradykinin metabolism. &#160; <br><br>Lastly, ACE inhibitors can precipitate angioedema in patients with an underlying C1 inhibitor deficiency and should be avoided in these patients. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ IgE-mediated mast cell activation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>IgE-mediated mast cell activation results in type I hypersensitivity reaction.

Cytochrome p450 is an enzyme that&#160;contains&#160;heme. In patients taking p450 inducers (e.g.&#160;barbiturates), circulating levels of heme are reduced as more p450 enzymes are produced. Lack of circulating heme reduces the negative feedback of ALA synthase-1, promoting the production of more heme (see image below). The underlying etiology of acute intermittent porphyria is an impairment in the activity of porphobilinogen deaminase, which leads to an&#160;accumulation of porphobilinogen (PBG).

Of patients that do experience a&#160;porphyric&#160;attack, they are usually precipitated by three main factors &#8211; cytochrome p450 inducers, prolonged fasting, or acute infection (see image below).&#160;Porphyric&#160;attacks occur with varying symptomatology and usually include some combination of abdominal pain, back pain, neuropathic limb&#160;pain, and&#160;nausea and vomiting.
