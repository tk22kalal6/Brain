Clinically and radiographically, valgus deformity will present as &#8220;knock knees,&#8221; whereas varus deformity will present as &#8220;bow legs&#8221;. Genu valgum can be a <strong>normal finding</strong> in patients <strong>between the ages of 2-5 years</strong>. In the majority of toddlers with physiologic genu valgum, the condition will resolve with age as the long bones of the legs continue to ossify. While genu valgum may be a standard variant in toddlers, it can also represent a pathologic disturbance in the development of long bones.<br><br>Measurement of the <strong>Q-angle</strong> can be used to assess the alignment of the knee joint This angle is found by measuring the angle formed between the quadriceps muscles and the patella tendon. The normal Q angle falls between 12 and 20 degrees when the knee is extended, with males normally falling at the low end of this range and females in the high end.<br><br>Large Q-angles outside of the normal range are associated with varus deformities that can be caused by underlying nutritional deficiencies, skeletal dysplasias, growth disorders, or persistence of severe physiologic genu varus after the age of 2 years. Small Q-angles outside of the normal range are indicative of valgus deformity, which may be physiologic in toddlers, or the result of rickets or an underlying skeletal dysplasia.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/4KHAra2VRDKFwJlTFz9DclJiRH2_Lx-4/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Physiologic genu valgum:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cozen fracture:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Cozen fractures are fractures of the proximal tibial metaphysis that can occur in children.

      "solution": "<strong>Parathyroid hormone (PTH)</strong> is a significant hormone in controlling calcium homeostasis and bone resorption and formation. PTH stimulates osteoblasts to increase the production of RANK ligand (RANKL), which then activates osteoclasts and thus bone resorption. In addition, PTH enhances bone formation by increasing osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and decreasing osteoblast apoptosis. Therefore, the effects of parathyroid hormone on the bones can be <strong>anabolic or catabolic</strong>, depending on the periodicity and duration of PTH secretion. &#160; <br><br>When there are continuous <strong>PTH serum elevations, there will be primarily catabolic effects on the bones. </strong>On the other hand,<strong> low intermittent exposure to PTH leads to anabolic effects on the bone,</strong> increasing bone formation.
