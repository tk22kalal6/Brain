Examples include secukinumab, brodalumab, and ixekizumab. &#160;These medications were introduced after the discovery of the role of Th-17 cells in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory disorders. Th-17 produces IL-17, which is a proinflammatory cytokine that once produced, stimulates the recruitment of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells and induces sustained chronic inflammation. IL-17A has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many immune-mediated disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, crohn&#8217;s disease, and multiple sclerosis.<br><br>IL-17A inhibitors are currently under investigation and their uses are promising. One of the indications of Il-17A inhibitors is moderate to severe psoriasis, with or without arthritis.

      "solution": "The medication tested in this study is methotrexate, which is a folate antagonist that inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. It is the first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis as it moderates joint damage. In addition, methotrexate is often used for other connective tissue disorders (e.g., psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus) and some cancers (e.g., leukemia/lymphoma and some solid tumors). Although the medication is generally well-tolerated and effective, it is contraindicated in some patients.<br><br>Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnant women because of its severe teratogenic effects. Due to its folate antagonist properties, methotrexate can cause neural tube defects. In addition, methotrexate use is associated with many congenital disabilities, including cleft lip and palate, diaphragmatic hernia, and hypospadias. Finally, methotrexate can also lead to congenital heart defects (e.g., ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects). Methotrexate should also be avoided in breastfeeding women as it is excreted in milk. Other contraindications include chronic liver disease (or patients with severe alcohol use disorder), severe chronic kidney disease, and pre-existing pancytopenia.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/0lKeZOnjSna0sp29o8tX-7yJQ5qU5dRv/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Congestive heart failure:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Congestive heart failure is not a contraindication for methotrexate use. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diabetes mellitus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Diabetes mellitus is not a contraindication for methotrexate use. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Hypertension:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Hypertension is not a contraindication for methotrexate use. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Pregnancy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Smoking:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The medication used in the study is most likely methotrexate.

Leflunomide is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) frequently used in treating rheumatoid arthritis because it can slow down joint damage. It can also be used to treat psoriatic arthritis and some cancers.<br><br>The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of leflunomide are due to its inhibition of the <strong>mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase</strong>, which mediates the synthesis of the ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate, the rate-limiting step in de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Leflunomide, therefore, prevents the synthesis of pyrimidines, halting cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle. This results in the inhibition of proliferation and progression of activated lymphocytes, blocking an autoimmune reaction. <br><br>Leflunomide can cause diarrhea, rash, and hypersensitivity reactions. The most critical side effect of leflunomide is hepatotoxicity, so liver enzymes must be monitored. Finally, leflunomide can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, it is contraindicated in patients with chronic liver disease or interstitial lung disease. &#160;Finally, leflunomide is teratogenic and should be avoided in pregnancy.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/xyLYYYVeSmG79i_oD5D092YnSnKIPXB3/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cardiotoxicity:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: &#160;Cardiotoxicity can be seen with multiple medications, including doxorubicin and trastuzumab.
