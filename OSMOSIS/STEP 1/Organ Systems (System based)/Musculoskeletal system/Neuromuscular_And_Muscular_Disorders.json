Clinically, gout presents with arthritis (gouty arthritis) or tophi (chronic tophaceous gout) and the most common area of the body to be affected is the first toe. <strong>Thiazide diuretics</strong> are secreted by the same secretory system that secretes uric acid into the proximal tubule. Here they <strong>compete with the secretion of uric acid</strong>, therefore increasing uric acid levels in the blood and increasing risk of a <strong>gout attack</strong>.<br><br>Other adverse effects associated with thiazide diuretics include <strong>hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperlipidemia</strong>. Chronic therapy is often associated with potassium wasting since an increased sodium load is presented to the collecting tubules; the cortical collecting tubules compensate by reabsorbing sodium and excreting potassium.<br><br>Thiazide diuretics can also induce <strong>hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis</strong>. It happens because an increased concentration of sodium ions in the collecting duct makes the collecting duct secrete more potassium and hydrogen ions from the blood and into the urine.

The infection involves infarcted bone, which arises due to sickling of red blood cells in the bone marrow that causes stasis of blood and sequestration of cells. Children are more commonly affected than adults due to increased bone vascularity (especially in the metaphysis), which is conducive to the hematogenous spread of pathogens.<br><br>Moreover, patients with SCD develop <strong>functional hyposplenia</strong> because of autoinfarction, which generally occurs before the age of 5. Without the spleen, the immune system has a harder time fighting encapsulated organisms. Therefore, the <strong>most common organism</strong> to cause osteomyelitis in patients with SCD is the <strong><em>Salmonella </em>species</strong>. In contrast, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, which is the most common organism in the general population, accounts for less than a quarter of cases in patients with SCD.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Staphylococcus aureus:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in the general population, it is not the most common cause in patients with sickle cell disease. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Pseudomonas aeruginosa:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> can cause osteomyelitis, it is not the most common cause in patients with sickle cell disease. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Streptococcus pneumoniae:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> can cause osteomyelitis, it is not the most common cause in patients with sickle cell disease. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Salmonella spp.:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Escherichia coli:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Although <em>Escherichia coli</em> is a common cause of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease, it is not the most common cause. &#160;</span></div>",

Medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease stage two and myelodysplastic syndrome. On admission, the patient was started on an antibiotic that directly inhibits peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis. While rounding on the patient on hospital day seven, he mentioned tinnitus and hearing loss which began over the last 24 hours. Temperature is 37.0&#176;C (98.6&#176;F), pulse 90/min, respirations 23/min, blood pressure 125/85 mmHg, and SpO<sub>2</sub> 96% on room air. Physical examination shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Cardiopulmonary auscultation is normal. Which of the following additional adverse effects is this patient at risk for if this antibiotic is continued long-term? &#160;",

This presentation is suggestive of vancomycin-induced ototoxicity.<br><br>Vancomycin is a bactericidal agent that inhibits bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan formation by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala portion of cell wall precursors. It is indicated in the empiric treatment of osteomyelitis and third-generation cephalosporin. Treatment with this combination covers methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (by vancomycin) and most gram-negative organisms (by ceftriaxone).<br><br>Vancomycin is associated with adverse effects, which include nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, thrombophlebitis and red man syndrome (flushing and pruritus due to the infusion of vancomycin) and DRESS syndrome (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms). Significant renal injury &#8211; as evidenced by an acute drop in urine output or a significant rise in serum creatinine &#8211; is an indication to reduce the dose of vancomycin or switch to a different antibiotic. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Neuromuscular blockade:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Aminoglycosides can cause neuromuscular blockade, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity.
