It then enters the foot through the tarsal tunnel inferior and posterior to the medial malleolus where it innervates the plantar surface of the foot. Injury or compression of the tibial nerve at the<strong>&#160;tarsal tunnel</strong> results in<strong>&#160;sensory loss over the sole of the foot.&#160;</strong>Plantarflexion and inversion of the foot remains intact, as fibers innervating these muscles branch proximally to the tarsal tunnel. Common risk factors for tarsal tunnel syndrome include benign tumors/cysts, bone spurs, overuse injury, inflammation of the tendon sheath or swelling from a broken or sprained ankle. &#160; <br><br>In contrast, injury to the nerve at the <strong>popliteal fossa</strong> (e.g., deep penetrating trauma or knee surgery) results in loss of plantar flexion, <strong>loss of flexion of toes and weakened inversion.</strong> Consequently, patients often present with feet held in the calcaneovalgus position (everted at rest with loss of inversion and plantar flexion). &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/gLu9tD9UQqaGhr1mOEZTQVvnT76ahhgO/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Femoral:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>The femoral nerve can be compressed during prolonged maintenance in the dorsal lithotomy position or from pelvic fractures or hip dislocations.

Femoral neck fractures are common in older patients, especially those with underlying osteoporosis. They can occur with low energy falls and have a high morbidity and mortality rate. &#160; <br><br>Hip fractures get divided into <strong>intracapsular&#160;</strong>(femoral head and neck) or <strong>extracapsular&#160;</strong>(intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric). Specifically, a femoral neck or head fracture is an intracapsular, displaced fracture that typically occurs following a fall onto the lateral hip. Patients with a displaced femoral neck fracture are generally <strong>unable to bear weight&#160;</strong>on the affected side and present with a<strong>&#160;shortened leg with external rotation</strong> of the affected hip (due to the psoas and iliacus muscle contraction without acetabular counterforce). Notably, intracapsular fractures can be associated with disruption of the blood supply from the <strong>medial circumflex artery</strong>, resulting in <strong>avascular necrosis.</strong> Femoral head fractures are often associated with posterior dislocation of the hip and are at increased risk of sciatic nerve injury. Because of the potential for avascular necrosis with intracapsular fractures arthroplasty with hip replacement is typically the procedure of choice. &#160; <br><br>In contrast, an<strong>&#160;intertrochanteric fracture</strong> is an <strong>extracapsular fracture</strong> that occurs between the greater and lesser trochanters. A subtrochanteric fracture which is defined as a fracture within 5 cm distal to the lesser trochanter is also considered an extracapsular fracture. Clinical presentation is similar to femoral neck fractures. Both fracture patterns require surgical correction (e.g. open reduction with internal fixation) unless the patient is not a good surgical candidate. With extracapsular fractures the blood supply is usually intact and fixation is the procedure of choice. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/aa5TwEsMSjyJ9s9GQwLw-Sb-Rg_OXc5p/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Posterior dislocation of the femoral head:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Posterior dislocation of the femoral head occurs secondary to high-velocity motor vehicle collisions.

Together, these findings suggest <strong>adhesive capsulitis</strong> (also termed <strong>frozen shoulder syndrome</strong>). <br><br>Adhesive capsulitis is a poorly understood condition that results in global stiffness and pain of the glenohumeral joint. Current research postulates the condition results from spontaneous inflammation of the joint capsule, followed by the development of adhesions and fibrosis of the synovial lining. Clinically, patients present with subacute symptoms including deep, nagging shoulder pain and associated <strong>limitations in passive and active range of motion</strong> (particularly external rotation and abduction). The condition is often idiopathic but has been associated with a history of shoulder injury, diabetes, dyslipidemia, Parkinson disease, immobilization, and antiretroviral therapy. <br><br>The disease progresses through three distinct phases. First, patients experience an acute phase characterized by severe disabling shoulder pain that worsens at night, with some associated stiffness. This phase lasts 2-9 months. Next, an intermediate phase occurs wherein pain decreases but stiffness and severe loss of shoulder motion ensues. This phase lasts 4-12 months. Finally, a recovery phase occurs, wherein patients regain shoulder mobility.<br><br>Diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis is primarily clinical, as imaging findings are generally noncontributory, and <strong>radiographs are often normal</strong>.

Rather, neonatal lupus is characterized by <strong>placental transfer</strong> of <strong>anti-Ro/SSA&#160;</strong><strong>antibodies&#160;</strong>from a mother to her fetus. Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, most commonly associated with Sjogren syndrome (in 80% of patients), are also present in patients with SLE (in 40% of patients). They are also found in 0.5% of the healthy female population. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/_2az_aD4Sx2Peu2RpTqHf38qT8u-Tclo/_.png\"></div><br><br>Neonatal lupus is characterized by a periorbital or diffuse rash, heart block, and hepatic or hematologic manifestations caused by these auto-antibodies. A rash may be present at birth, but most commonly it is observed a few weeks later, appearing as erythematous annular lesions or arcuate macules with slight central atrophy found mostly around the eyes and scalp. First-, second-, or <strong>third-degree heart block&#160;</strong>may occur, usually between 18 to 24 weeks gestation. Atrioventricular block causes bradycardia with a ventricular rate between 50 and 80 beats per minute, as seen in this patient. A minority of newborns with neonatal lupus will show transient, mild liver enzyme abnormalities and cytopenias. &#160;<br><br>Mothers with known anti-Ro/SSA antibody positivity should receive weekly fetal echocardiography from the 18th through 26th weeks of pregnancy to monitor for heart block. Identification of a complete heart block may require pacemaker placement after birth. The rash of neonatal lupus resolves spontaneously after six to eight months, as maternal antibodies are cleared from circulation. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Antinuclear antibody:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Antinuclear antibody (ANA) is sensitive for detecting systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but does not play a role in the development of neonatal lupus. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Anti-dsDNA antibody:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Anti-dsDNA antibody is specific for diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but does not play a role in the development of neonatal lupus. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Lupus anticoagulant:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Lupus anticoagulant is a pro-thrombotic immunoglobulin that binds to phospholipids and cell surface proteins.

The malar (butterfly) rash, the most common skin lesion that characterizes acute SLE, was likely triggered by ultraviolet light exposure at the park. Combined with the inflammatory arthritis and laboratory abnormalities (leukopenia), SLE should be suspected. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/nlYI3j6QRAuscFaAAkyHV17iTmub1kGv/_.png\"></div><br>SLE is caused by a combination of factors that predispose to an abnormal immune response leading to autoantibody immune complex deposition, inflammation, and end-organ damage. Pathogenesis begins when environmental triggers cause cell damage and apoptosis, exposing nuclear material to the immune system. Genetic susceptibility can lead to poor clearance of these <strong>nuclear antigens</strong> and to recognition of their moieties as foreign. Dendritic cells present these antigens to B-cells, which then start producing autoimmune antibodies, known as <strong>antinuclear antibodies (ANA)</strong>. These antibodies spread through the bloodstream, forming<strong>&#160;immune complexes&#160;</strong>with antigens encountered in the blood, and deposit within various organs. &#160;<br><br>These deposited immune complexes activate the complement cascade, leading to enzyme-mediated cell damage, referred to as a <strong>type III hypersensitivity reaction</strong>. End-organ damage (e.g., rash, nephritis, synovitis) occurs as a result. When complement is activated and used up, <strong>serum complement levels (C3 and C4) fall</strong>. Another high-yield fact is that because early complement proteins like C1q, C2 and C4 are all involved in removing immune complexes, individuals that lack any of these proteins are predisposed to developing SLE. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Patients can also develop antibodies to antigens found on hematologic cells, including erythrocytes and leukocytes, and certain molecules, like phospholipids. Binding of these antibodies triggers complement activation via the classical complement pathway, leading to cell lysis and death. This process represents a type II hypersensitivity reaction and can cause hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) refers to the speed at which red blood cells drop to the bottom of a test tube.

It is hypothesized that environmental risk factors modify normal articular proteins in the synovial joints. The modified proteins are targeted by the immune system, since it fails to recognize them as part of the normal body, causing the proteins to become self-antigens. Antigen presenting cells then pick up the self-antigens and activate CD4+ T-cells. T-helper cells then stimulate nearby B-cells to produce autoantibodies.<br><br>T-cells eventually enter the joints and secrete inflammatory cytokines. Likewise, autoantibodies bind to their targets and trigger the complement cascade. The inflammation causes synovial cells to proliferate. This increase in synovial and immune cells creates a <strong>pannus</strong>, a layer of granulation tissue and inflammatory cells. Over time, cytokines released in the pannus start to break down the articular cartilage, exposing the underlying bones, leading to bone erosion.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/YYts3liGQJ_eiP5Dsa85Inn4RCWltwB_/_.png\"></div><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/Uq7a7N9tRDqPMzQCGHXYZT4zTtmt-I4t/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Autoimmune inflammation and destruction of the joints:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:&#160;</strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Infection by tick-transmitted spirochete:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This answer describes Lyme disease, which is prevalent in the Northeastern and upper Midwestern United States.

Treatment mainly consists of long-term medications called<strong>&#160;disease modifying antirheumatic drugs</strong> (DMARDs), which can be non-biological or biological. Since persistent inflammation in affected joints can cause permanent, irreversible damage, prompt diagnosis and early recognition of active disease are important. <strong>DMARDs should be used in all RA patients</strong> to maintain control of inflammation and the underlying disease process, with the goal of remission or low disease activity in order to improve disease outcome. &#160;<br><br>Most individuals are started on <strong>non-biological DMARDs</strong>. The most common is <strong>methotrexate</strong>, a folic acid analog that <strong>inhibits dihydrofolate reductase</strong>. The enzyme participates in tetrahydrofolate synthesis, so its inhibition reduces DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Its use in the treatment of RA is that it inhibits proliferation of the lymphocytes and other cells responsible for inflammation in the joints. Side effects include <strong>pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, stomatitis/mouth ulcers,</strong> and nephrotoxicity. Moreover, methotrexate can cause folate deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, and myelosuppression. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/S-WrrsEkSv2c4SoXBeeAiksLRnaEvPiO/_.png\"></div><br>Another DMARD is <strong>leflunomide</strong>, which reversibly inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, preventing pyrimidine synthesis and suppressing T-cell proliferation. Side effects include hypertension, hepatotoxicity, and teratogenicity. There is also <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong>, which is considered to be the safest DMARD and can be used in pregnancy. It increases lysosomal pH in antigen-presenting cells and blocks toll-like receptors on dendritic cells. Side effects include eye toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and excessive coloring of the skin. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/FvL3ie_lQn_vMdO2abazE-3-RwS9Q_Iu/_.png\"></div><br>There are also <strong>biological DMARDs</strong>, which suppress portions of the immune system. <strong>Abatacept&#160;</strong>suppresses T-cells, <strong>rituximab&#160;</strong>suppresses B-cells, while others block specific cytokines. <strong>Infliximab&#160;</strong>and <strong>adalimumab&#160;</strong>are two anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibodies.

      "text": "A 60-year-old woman comes to the office because of intermittent knee pain for three months. The pain is worse at the end of the day and is associated with swelling at the knee following strenuous exertion. The pain is not associated with fever, rash or malaise. Past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include atorvastatin and metformin. BMI is 35.3 kg/m2. Vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination demonstrates a small effusion, tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the left knee. A plain x-ray of the left knee joint shows narrowing of the joint space with osteophytes. The patient is advised to follow a weight loss, supervised exercise program, and treatment with diclofenac is initiated to help relieve the associated knee pain. Which of the following steps in the pathway below will be inhibited by the medication used to treat this patient&#8217;s condition? &#160;<br><br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/fdbKzhCRTCaG3imSk1DhTwOwTLeMj20U/_.png\"></div><br>",

The patient is started on diclofenac, a <strong>non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs),</strong> which<strong>&#160;inhibits cyclooxygenase</strong> via the arachidonic acid pathway. &#160; <br><br>During inflammation, cleavage of membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2, leads to the formation of arachidonic acid&#8211;a substrate for cyclooxygenase (COX). Cyclooxygenase exists in two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 remains constitutively active, whereas COX-2 serves as an inducible enzyme. Arachidonic acid gets converted by these enzymes into prostaglandins and leukotrienes. &#160;<br><br><strong>NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin and nonselective NSAIDs)</strong> inhibit <strong>cyclooxygenase isoforms</strong> (COX-1 and COX-2); &#160;thereby, decreasing prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis.
