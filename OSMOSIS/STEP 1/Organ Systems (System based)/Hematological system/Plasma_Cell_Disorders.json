Flow cytometry shows a significant cluster of cells with CD5, CD19, dim CD20, and CD23 positivity. Fludarabine and rituximab are prescribed.

      "solution": "This older patient initially presented with symptoms of fatigue. His laboratory tests reveal anemia, with a profound lymphocytic leukocytosis and a positive Coombs test indicative of leukemia. Furthermore, flow cytometry showed positivity for CD5, CD19, dim CD20 (why this patient was also treated with rituximab), and CD23, differentiating this as <strong>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</strong> (CLL). CLL often occurs in elderly patients over the age of 60 and has an overall median survival rate of 10 years following diagnosis. The patient&#8217;s treatment with rituximab (a monoclonal CD20 antibody) and fludarabine (a purine analog) are often first-line treatments for CLL. Despite being on fludarabine and rituximab (a treatment known as FR), this patient&#8217;s CLL did not go into remission and required further therapy. Rather than restarting another cycle of FR, a better treatment strategy would include starting a therapy with a different mechanism of action. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>CD52 </strong>is a glycoprotein widely expressed on all immune cells' surfaces. &#160;Activation of CD52 was shown to offer costimulatory signals for T cell activation. <strong>Alemtuzumab </strong>is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD52. Alemtuzumab binds to lymphocytes, causing complement-mediated cell lysis, apoptosis, and antibody-dependent cellular toxicity of lymphocytes in circulation, making it ideal for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ VEGF:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key physiologic mediator of blood vessel development in the body (1). Aberrant expression of VEGF is a hallmark feature of several different solid tumor types, namely renal cell carcinoma. To date, there are 11 anti-angiogenic drugs directed against VEGF. It is not relevant in the treatment of leukemias.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ EGFR:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Physiologically, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a primary regulator of epithelial growth and maturation in tissues. Some cancers such as glioblastomas, breast and lung cancer aberrantly express EGFR, making it a driver of tumorigenesis.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ HER2:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a member of the EGFR growth factor receptor family, involved in regulating the growth and maturation of epidermal tissues. Recently HER2 has become an important biomarker and therapy for approximately 30% of breast cancer patients. Patients who exhibit amplification of the <em>ERBB2 </em>gene, which is what codes HER2, receive trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits the extracellular segment of the HER2/neu receptor.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ CD20:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>CD20 is a specific B cell marker. Anti-CD20 therapies, namely rituximab, &#160;are one of the hallmarks of chemotherapy for patients with CLL. Since this patient received rituximab and still did not achieve remission, another therapy is more appropriate (See main explanation).&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ CD52:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div>",

The most commonly reported side effect is bone pain, which results from the high production of new neutrophils in the bone marrow. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/9DPWrhOqT9qDPdxHzwsXZa8oSlmjHCeN/_.png\"></div><br><br><strong>Sargramostim,</strong> on the other hand, is a synthetic version of<strong>&#160;granulocyte-monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF).&#160;</strong>It is often used to <strong>boost myeloid precursor production</strong> and maturation after bone marrow transplant. Other uses include increasing the myelocyte derived white blood cell count following chemotherapy or radiation therapy. These therapies target rapidly dividing cells like cancer cells, but hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow are also dividing rapidly, so they almost always get affected too. This is called bone marrow suppression. Side effects include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), capillary leak syndrome, fever and arthralgias pain. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/m9uVit-NTOCp1Kql9S7g74FYR0uSS0gW/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, is used to treat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and would increase the leukocyte count.
