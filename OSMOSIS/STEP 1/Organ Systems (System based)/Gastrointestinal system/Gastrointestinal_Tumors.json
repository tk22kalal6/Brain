      "solution": "This patient with obstructive jaundice and a mass of the head of pancreas, most likely has <strong>pancreatic cancer. &#160; &#160;</strong><br><br>The most common type is the <strong>cancer of the pancreatic head,</strong> which accounts for the most cases of <strong>hepatobiliary obstruction</strong>. Because of the posterior relationships of the pancreas, cancer of the head often compresses and obstructs the bile duct and/or the hepatopancreatic ampulla. This causes obstruction, resulting in the retention of bile pigments, <strong>painless enlargement of the gallbladder</strong> (Courvoisier sign), and obstructive jaundice. <strong>Courvoisier&#8217;s law</strong> states that an enlarged and non-tender gallbladder accompanied by mild jaundice is unlikely caused by gallstones and rather caused by pancreatic or gallstone cancer. Weight loss can occur due to high tumor metabolism or to pancreatic insufficiency. &#160; <br><br>Among others, pancreatic cancer can invade major arteries, like the <strong>superior mesenteric artery,</strong> which lies posterior to the neck of the pancreas. When the superior mesenteric artery is invaded, it usually means that the cancer cannot be surgically resected. On the other hand, cancer of the neck and body of the pancreas may cause hepatic portal or inferior vena caval obstruction because the pancreas overlies these large veins. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/XyxjaSH_SD_Q_UxPe7NnR7n6ScKHanbA/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Renal artery bruit:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Renal artery bruit can be heard in patients with renal artery stenosis, which is characterized by resistant hypertension.

This patient&#8217;s tumor is likely of neuroendocrine origin based on histological analysis. &#160; <br><br><strong>Neuroendocrine tumors</strong> are a rare type of cancer. They arise from neuroendocrine cells, which have characteristics of both nerve and endocrine cells and can produce hormones in response to nerve stimuli. &#160; &#160; <br><br>Neuroendocrine tumors can be divided into functional and nonfunctional tumors. <strong>Functional&#160;</strong>tumors produce hormones, which are responsible for the majority of their symptoms. On the other hand, <strong>nonfunctional&#160;</strong>tumors are often asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Most neuroendocrine tumors are found within the gastrointestinal tract. <strong>Carcinoid tumors</strong> can develop in organs such as the small intestines (most commonly), large intestine, and appendix. <strong>Insulinomas, glucagonomas,</strong> and <strong>VIPomas&#160;</strong>arise in the pancreas. Furthermore, tumors such as <strong>pheochromocytoma&#160;</strong>can arise from the adrenal medulla. &#160; <br><br>Histologically, neuroendocrine tumors can be divided into well-differentiated and poorly-differentiated neoplasms.<strong>&#160;Well-differentiated&#160;</strong>tumors are likely benign and characterized by small round cells with round to oval nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and cytoplasmic granules staining positive for <strong>synaptophysin&#160;</strong>or <strong>chromogranin</strong>. In contrast, <strong>poorly-differentiated&#160;</strong>neuroendocrine neoplasms (also termed neuroendocrine carcinomas) are more likely to be malignant.

Furthermore, her serum insulin and C-peptide levels are elevated. In combination, these findings are concerning for <strong>insulinoma</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Insulinomas are rare <strong>pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors</strong> that arise from &#42933;-cells within the islets of Langerhans. Most cases are sporadic, although the condition can sometimes be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Insulinomas secrete insulin inappropriately and irrespective of serum glucose levels. As a result, patients with insulinomas are at risk of developing <strong>Whipple triad</strong>, which consists of hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic symptoms, and resolution of symptoms with glucose administration. Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include <strong>blurry vision, confusion,</strong> and in severe cases, <strong>seizures&#160;</strong>and <strong>coma</strong>. Moreover, patients may develop symptoms of adrenergic activation such as <strong>palpitations, sweating</strong>, and <strong>tremulousness</strong>. &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>Insulinomas must be differentiated from excess exogenous insulin administration. While both conditions present with similar symptoms, a <strong>C-peptide level</strong> can be used to differentiate the two.

Gastrinomas can arise sporadically, with a median age between 20-50, or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. &#160; <br><br>The pathophysiology of gastrinomas is related to the <strong>oversecretion of gastrin</strong>, which stimulates gastric parietal cells to produce excess acid. The acid causes <strong>gastric and duodenal ulcers</strong> that are usually multiple, recurrent, and refractory to treatment. Since so much acid is produced, ulcers can even form in areas of the gastrointestinal tract far from the stomach (e.g. jejunum). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Moreover, the increase in duodenal acidity deactivates pancreatic enzymes and damages epithelial cells.

Most serotonin is transported to the liver via portal circulation and broken down by first-pass hepatic metabolism. Therefore, the serotonin does not reach the systemic circulation to cause symptoms.

Serotonin stimulates gut motility in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in secretory <strong>diarrhea</strong>. In the skin, serotonin&#8217;s vasodilatory effects cause <strong>skin flushing</strong>, lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes. The flushing can be precipitated by emotional or physical stress and alcohol use. In the lungs, serotonin causes bronchoconstriction, leading to <strong>wheezing&#160;</strong>and <strong>dyspnea</strong>.

Before starting either of these chemotherapy regimens, it is now common to &#8220;prime&#8221; the patient&#8217;s immune system with targeted monoclonal antibodies, which help the patient&#8217;s immune system increase the immune visibility of tumor cells. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Approximately 60-80% of cancer cells in colorectal tumors overexpress the EGFR receptor. Both &#160;Cetuximab and Panitumumab are monoclonal antibody therapies targeted against the EGFR receptor used in the treatment of stage IV colorectal cancer and some head and neck tumors. Panitumumab is a human monoclonal antibody, whereas Cetuximab is a chimeric mouse monoclonal antibody. Both Cetuximab and Panitumumab have similar side effects, including rash, elevated LFTs, and diarrhea. Neither therapy is more efficacious in the treatment of colorectal cancer. A key difference between the two drugs is the role that cetuximab plays in immunological priming. Cetuximab has been shown to increase ADCC and other immunostimulatory activities such as cell maturation, T-cell recruitment to the tumor, increased antigen presentation, and cytotoxic NK T-cell priming. On the other hand, Panitumumab notably does not engage in cytotoxic NK T-cell priming. It does, however, engage in immune cytotoxicity at a much lower extent via neutrophil-driven ADCC. While it remains to be seen which of these drugs are superior in clinical efficacy, it&#8217;s clear that cetuximab has robust effects in modulating immune cytotoxic effects in cancer cells. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ VEGF:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> This patient initially received cetuximab, which targets EGFR.
