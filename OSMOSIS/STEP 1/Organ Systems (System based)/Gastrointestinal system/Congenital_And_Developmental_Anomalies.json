Hepatocytes use an enzyme called <strong>7-alpha-hydroxylase</strong> to convert cholesterol into two primary bile acids, cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. Some of these primary bile acids get dehydroxylated in the intestines, giving rise to secondary bile acids&#8211;specifically, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. The liver can conjugate or attach the amino acids glycine or taurine to all four of these bile acids, which ultimately gives rise to 8 different forms of bile salts. These bile salts are the main component of bile. Therefore, bile is made in the liver and flows into the intestines.<br><br>&#160;Bile helps with <strong>digestion and absorption of lipids&#160;</strong>and fat-soluble vitamins (e.g., vitamins A, D, E, and K) as well as <strong>bilirubin and cholesterol excretion&#160;</strong>and has antimicrobial activity (via membrane disruption). It is important to note that bile production is the primary mechanism by which the body can excrete cholesterol and bilirubin. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acetyl-CoA carboxylase:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>This answer choice is incorrect.

Since these babies have difficulty swallowing, they can present with excess <strong>drooling</strong> and <strong>vomiting</strong> after eating. In addition, this patient has coughing, which raises concerns for a fistula between the esophagus and trachea. The presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula allows food to enter the respiratory tract, causing choking, cyanosis, and aspiration pneumonia. Lastly, the patient&#8217;s heart murmur is concerning for a ventral septal defect (VSD). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Taking into account the aforementioned symptoms, the patient likely has the <strong>VACTERL</strong> association. This acronym stands for: <u>V</u>ertebral abnormalities, <u>A</u>nal atresia, <u>C</u>ardiac defects, <u>T</u>racheoesophageal fistula, <u>E</u>sophageal atresia, <u>R</u>enal abnormalities, and <u>L</u>imb defects. Among the answer choices, only hypoplasia of the upper extremities (Option D) is part of the VACTERL association. &#160; <br><br>A diagnosis of esophageal atresia can be made by attempting to <strong>pass a catheter</strong> (e.g. nasogastric tube) into the stomach.

It occurs most often due to <strong>lipoprotein lipase</strong> deficiency. A rarer cause is a defect in<strong>&#160;apolipoprotein C-II</strong>, a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase. Without a functional lipoprotein lipase, the breakdown of chylomicrons and their triglyceride content is prevented, resulting in massive triglyceride accumulation within the blood. &#160;<br><br>The massive triglyceride content in the blood results in cutaneous deposition and rapid development of xanthomas on the back and buttocks that can be pruritic. Due to the rapid nature of their development, they are called <strong>eruptive xanthomas</strong>. In addition, the high concentration of serum triglycerides can lead to <strong>acute pancreatitis</strong>. This is because when pancreatic cells encounter triglycerides, they release lipase to break the triglycerides down into free fatty acids; excess free fatty acids can injure the pancreas. Lastly, patients can develop <strong>hepatosplenomegaly.&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>Of note, patients with type I hyperlipidemia are not at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This is because the development of atherosclerotic plaques is related to the elevation of other lipoproteins such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and not related to the elevation of chylomicrons. &#160;<br><br>Laboratory testing will show markedly <strong>elevated triglyceride levels</strong> and <strong>normal/mildly elevated cholesterol levels</strong>.

It occurs when the<strong>&#160;processus vaginalis</strong>, an embryonic outpouching of the peritoneum, fails to obliterate, and a portion of the intestines is able to herniate into the inguinal canal. Indirect inguinal hernias manifest as a bulge that is <strong>lateral</strong> to the lower epigastric vessels.
