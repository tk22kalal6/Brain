      "solution": "This patient presents with abdominal cramps and diarrhea. She is diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and started on loperamide.<br><br><strong>Loperamide</strong> is an opioid agonist that exerts its antidiarrheal effects by binding to and <strong>activating &#956;-opiate receptors</strong> in the enteric nervous system. Activation of the &#956;-receptors in the colon <strong>inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters</strong> (acetylcholine) from the myenteric nerve plexus, which in turn decreases peristalsis, slows colonic motility, and allows more water to be absorbed. Ultimately, loperamide reduces stool volume, increases viscosity, and diminishes fluid loss.<br><br>Loperamide is used to treat <strong>IBS-diarrhea</strong> and <strong>chemotherapy-associated diarrhea</strong> as well as <strong>decrease ileostomy output</strong>. It undergoes significant first-pass hepatic metabolism, resulting in very low plasma levels. Furthermore, loperamide has poor blood-brain barrier penetration and as a result, has <strong>negligible central nervous system manifestations</strong> and <strong>low potential for addiction or tolerance</strong>. It may cause <strong>mild cramps</strong> and, when taken in high doses, <strong>rebound constipation</strong>.<br><br><strong>Diphenoxylate </strong>is another opioid agonist that is sometimes used to treat IBS diarrhea. At low doses, diphenoxylate does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, it does at higher doses. To reduce the likelihood of abuse, it is frequently <strong>mixed with atropine</strong>, which exerts unpleasant anticholinergic symptoms (e.g., dry mouth, dry eyes) when taken in higher amounts. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Reduction of colonic peristalsis by inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the myenteric plexus &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inhibition of colonic migrating motor complex with resultant slowing of colonic contraction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil) are sometimes associated with constipation due to inhibition of colonic migrating motor complexes and slowing of colonic contraction. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inhibition of cytokine release and reduction of colonic wall inflammation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Steroids are used in inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. ulcerative colitis) to reduce inflammation of the intestinal walls and decrease inflammatory cytokines release.

The physical examination features suggest a <strong>bowel obstruction</strong> (e.g. abdominal distension, hyperactive high-pitched bowel sounds). Finally, the abdominal radiograph shows <strong>dilated loops of small bowel</strong> associated with <strong>pneumobilia&#160;</strong>(air in the biliary tree), which indicates a small bowel obstruction due to a<strong>&#160;gallstone lodged in the ileocecal valve</strong>, known as gallstone ileus. The term &#8220;ileus&#8221; is a misnomer because the obstruction is a true mechanical phenomenon. This condition is often seen in elderly individuals who have significant comorbidities. &#160;<br><br>The pathogenesis begins with <strong>cholelithiasis complicated by cholecystitis.</strong> The impacted gallstone causes inflammation and pressure buildup within the gallbladder, which leads to the inflamed gallbladder&#8217;s adhesion to surrounding structures. This adhesion leads to the formation of a <strong>fistula between the gallbladder and intestine</strong> (biliary-enteric or cholecystoenteric fistula). Once fistulization has occurred, a large enough stone can enter the intestine and lodge at the ileocecal valve, leading to a small bowel obstruction. Transient gallstone impaction produces abdominal pain and vomiting, which subside when the gallstone is dislodged. &#160; &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ejpmCgF2RyOtMVWwEKimESsnRE2W8LQ5/_.png\"></div><br>Gallstone ileus should be suspected in patients with the above presentation in addition to radiologic evaluation. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) is most often used, but a <strong>plain radiograph</strong> can be used when CT is unavailable. The<strong>&#160;Rigler triad&#160;</strong>describes the presentation of gallstone ileus on plain radiograph and includes<strong>&#160;pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction</strong>, and an obstructing <strong>gallstone</strong>.

Similar to acute cholecystitis, patients with emphysematous cholecystitis present with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever. It can also cause air in the biliary tree; however, dilated loops of small bowel would not be consistent with this diagnosis. &#160;&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Superior mesenteric artery syndrome:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is an unusual cause of proximal intestinal obstruction. This condition involves the compression of the third portion of the duodenum due to narrowing of the space between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta. It is most often caused by significant weight loss leading to loss of the mesenteric fat. However, this patient has pneumobilia on the abdominal radiograph, which would not be present in SMA syndrome. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Colonic pseudo-obstruction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Colonic pseudo-obstruction, also known as Ogilvie syndrome, is characterized by acute dilation of the colon in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It is often seen in acutely sick patients or with the use of certain medications (e.g., opioids). Patients present with signs of large bowel obstruction. This patient has a small bowel obstruction with air present in the biliary tree, making this diagnosis unlikely. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diverticulitis&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Diverticulitis is often seen in elderly patients, but it usually presents with left lower quadrant pain, fever, and hematochezia. Air seen under the diaphragm on a chest X-ray would be concerning for a perforation; however, air in the biliary tree would not be expected. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acute hepatitis&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Acute hepatitis infection presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise, and anorexia. Within a few days, dark urine and pale stools appear, followed by jaundice and pruritus.

Functional A1AT inhibits proteolytic enzymes such as neutrophil elastase, which is found within <strong>macrophages&#160;</strong>and the primary granules of <strong>neutrophils</strong>. Normally, elastase helps combat infections by degrading bacterial virulence factors. However, patients with A1AT deficiency produce misfolded copies of the protein that are unable to inhibit elastase.

Furthermore, the <strong>misfolded A1AT proteins accumulate</strong> in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, leading to cell engorgement, release of lysosomal enzymes, and ultimately causing apoptosis and inflammation.

The most important underlying factors in HCC are viral infections (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus) and toxin-mediated injuries (e.g., aflatoxin, alcohol). These factors cause the liver to be in a constant cycle of damage and repair, which raise the chances of genetic mutations, potentially leading to carcinogenesis and development of HCC. Therefore, in regions where HBV and HCV (and therefore, cirrhosis) are common, there is a high incidence of HCC. &#160; <br><br>Clinical manifestations of HCC are typically due to underlying cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, pitting edema), but patients may also present with systemic signs such as <strong>weight loss</strong>, malaise, and <strong>fatigue</strong>.

It is then used for fat emulsification (breaking fat droplets into smaller pieces to maximize surface area for digestion), which facilitates fat and cholesterol absorption in the form of micelles. The outline of bile acid synthesis and reabsorption is summarized in the following steps: &#160;<br><br><ul><li>&#160;The liver cells synthesize primary bile acids (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) by cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol in a multi-step process, involving the <strong>rate-limiting enzyme 7&#945;-hydroxylase</strong>; this process is one of the few methods the body has to excrete cholesterol from the body. &#160;</li><li>&#160;The liver cells then conjugate primary bile acids with the amino acids glycine or taurine to form conjugated bile acids, making them relatively insoluble in water and unable to be reabsorbed in the intestines.&#160;</li><li>&#160;Once secreted into the intestine, the gut microbiota remove the glycine and taurine groups, forming secondary bile acids.

Their etiology is incompletely understood, but they are thought to arise from vascular malformations or hamartomas of congenital origin. A hemangioma can be diagnosed at any age but occurs most commonly in women between 30-50 years of age. Similar to adenomas, they tend to increase in size in response to estrogen exposure, but they can also occur in its absence. In contrast to hepatic adenoma, a cavernous hemangioma is <strong>unlikely to regress with estrogen withdrawal</strong>. Most tumors are asymptomatic and are often found as an incidental mass on imaging. When symptoms are present, right upper quadrant pain and abdominal fullness are common. Additional symptoms may include nausea, anorexia, and early satiety, due to compression of adjacent structures. &#160;<br><br>Diagnosis is typically based on imaging, clinical presentation, and patient history.

As ammonia accumulates, it is able to cross the blood-brain-barrier, resulting in astrocyte swelling, dysfunction, and <strong>impaired neurotransmitter synthesis</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Anything that increases ammonia production or reabsorption in the gut can trigger HE. These include <strong>gastrointestinal bleeding</strong>, constipation, or infections. Decreased ammonia elimination via the kidneys can also be a trigger. Finally, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) used to treat portal hypertension can also be a trigger since ammonia-rich blood from the intestines bypasses the liver completely. &#160; <br><br>Hepatic encephalopathy presents with symptoms like insomnia or hypersomnia, mood changes, along with confusion, and even coma in some cases. <strong>Asterixis</strong>, a flapping tremor of the hand that appears when the wrist is extended, is commonly seen. &#160; <br><br>Treatment typically involves administering <strong>antibiotics&#160;</strong>(e.g. rifaximin) to kill ammonia-producing bacteria and <strong>lactulose&#160;</strong>to decrease ammonia absorption in the bowel. Lactulose is converted to lactic acid by colonic bacteria resulting in acidification of the intestinal environment, leading to <strong>increased conversion of ammonia</strong> (NH<sub>3</sub>) <strong>to ammonium</strong> (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>).

The typical presentation of cholecystitis includes <strong>right upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,&#160;</strong>and occasionally <strong>fever</strong>. On physical examination, patients may demonstrate a positive Murphy sign, which is sudden inspiratory pause upon palpation of the RUQ. Similarly, a positive sonographic Murphy sign can be elicited with an ultrasound probe. Risk factors for cholesterol gallstones include female sex, pregnancy and oral contraceptive pills, obesity, and age, especially after 40. These can be remembered by the 4 F&#8217;s: female, fertile, fat, and forty. &#160; <br><br>Bile production is the main pathway for elimination of excess cholesterol from the body, either as &#160;bile salts or as free cholesterol. Cholesterol is secreted by the liver into the gallbladder and is rendered water-soluble within the bile by lecithins and bile salts. When cholesterol concentrations exceed the capacity of bile to solubilize it (supersaturation), cholesterol crystallizes and forms stones. Any condition that increases cholesterol and/or bilirubin, decreases bile salts, or promotes gallbladder stasis can cause gallstone formation. The enzyme <strong>7&#945;-hydroxylase</strong> converts cholesterol to 7-alpha-hydroxycholesterol, the rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme (e.g. by <strong>fibrates&#160;</strong>medication) can lead to the building up of cholesterol, its supersaturation, and stone formation. &#160;<br><br>There are 2 types of stones, cholesterol stones (80% of cases) and pigment stones (black and brown). Cholesterol stones are associated with obesity, Crohn disease, advanced age, estrogen therapy, multiparity, and rapid weight loss. The characteristics of each stone type are depicted in the table below. &#160;<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/2NFtkttgTxmmDXjmvU1AI9GnQgOy8-WJ/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Decreased activity of HMG-CoA reductase enzyme:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>HMG-CoA reductase is the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis.

The first markers to rise in acute hepatitis B infection are HBsAg and HBeAg, which is called the incubation period. Next, anti-HBc IgM antibodies rise along with continually rising HBeAg and HBsAg, termed the prodromal or acute infectious phase. Next, the <strong>window period</strong> occurs, which is when neither hepatitis B surface antigen nor its antibody can be detected in the serum of the patient due to the precipitation of antigen-antibody complexes and their removal from the circulation. During this period, the patient may be infected; however, viral titers are so low that the patient may have negative serological testing for HBsAg, HBcAg, or HBeAg. During this period, the only markers that are positive are either <strong>anti-HBc IgM or anti-HBe</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Recovery is then characterized by detectable levels of anti-HBc IgG, anti-HBs, and anti-HBe.

      "solution": "This patient presents after recent travel to Thailand with associated malaise, jaundice, nausea and vomiting. The evaluation is notable for low-grade fever and a positive anti-HAV (IgM) antibody, consistent with acute infection due to <strong>hepatitis A</strong>, which is spread via <strong>fecal-oral</strong> transmission. &#160; <br><br><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> is an <strong>RNA picornavirus</strong> that is transmitted via contaminated food or water&#8212;often raw oysters or crab meat&#8212;and is the most common form of <strong>acute hepatitis</strong>. At-risk individuals include those who travel frequently and daycare workers. After inoculation, symptoms develop within anywhere from one week to thirty days and include malaise, fevers, jaundice, nausea, vomiting and right upper quadrant pain. For unknown reasons, patients with hepatitis A also develop an <strong>aversion to smoking tobacco&#160;</strong>products. &#160; <br><br>Hepatitis A carries an excellent prognosis, with most patients only requiring supportive care at home. In contrast to other hepatitis viruses, hepatitis A <strong>does not carry an increased risk of developing cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma</strong> and <strong>does not have a carrier state</strong>. Patients that test positive for anti-HAV (IgM) are said to have active infection, while anti-HAV (IgG) indicates prior infection or immunity.<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Fecal-oral:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Unprotected sexual intercourse:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Hepatitis B and hepatitis C can be transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse, although they are more commonly transmitted via contaminated blood or blood products.
