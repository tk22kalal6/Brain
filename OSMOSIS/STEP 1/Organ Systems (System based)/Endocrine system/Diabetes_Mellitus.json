Laboratory findings of decreased serum levels of morning cortisol increased serum ACTH, and the minimal response of cortisol to cosyntropin stimulation makes primary adrenal insufficiency the most likely diagnosis. It might be secondary tuberculous adrenalitis (given her history of tuberculosis) or autoimmune adrenalitis (the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency).<br><br><strong>Metyrapone&#160;</strong>is an <strong>adrenal hormone synthesis inhibitor&#160;</strong>that <strong>blocks the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol&#160;</strong>by<strong>&#160;inhibiting</strong> the enzyme <strong>11-beta hydroxylase</strong> in the zona fasciculata. <strong>The metyrapone stimulation test</strong> is based on the idea that its administration will decrease <strong>serum cortisol</strong> levels and <strong>increase serum ACTH levels</strong> due to the cortisol loss of negative feedback to the hypothalamus. An immediate increase follows <strong>in serum 11-deoxycortisol</strong>, a cortisol precursor devoid of glucocorticoid activity.

Glucocorticoids are pharmacologically similar to endogenous <strong>cortisol</strong>. They are used for their <strong>anti-inflammatory</strong> and <strong>immunosuppressive&#160;</strong>effects. They can be administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or via inhalation. &#160; &#160;<br><br>The secretion of cortisol is regulated by the<strong>&#160;hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal</strong> (HPA) <strong>axis</strong>. The hypothalamus secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (<strong>CRH</strong>), which acts on the pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (<strong>ACTH</strong>). ACTH travels to the adrenal glands, which bind to ACTH on adrenocortical cells. Glucocorticoids are then released from the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland. Glucocorticoids exert a <strong>negative feedback effect on the HPA axis</strong> and decrease the release of CRH and ACTH. Chronic use of exogenous glucocorticoids exerts a similar effect on the HPA axis and thus leads to decreased ACTH levels. &#160; &#160;<br><br><strong>Corticosteroids should never be discontinued abruptly </strong>as this can <strong>precipitate acute adrenal insufficiency</strong>, a medical emergency.

This pathologic state happens in <strong>type 2 diabetes</strong> when glucose levels get high, usually from a trigger, such as an underlying infection, leading to profound dehydration. The mechanisms that cause hyperglycemia overlap between diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and HHS. Both result in increased lysosomal activity, leading to<strong>&#160;protein degradation</strong> (proteolysis) to create building blocks (amino acids) for <strong>gluconeogenesis</strong>. Without insulin, the glucose that is synthesized cannot be used by cells, causing a massive glucose elevation.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/cH8wAebfSeSyBB3Q1iVWumNnT92zGCnb/_.png\"></div><br>Glucose is a polar molecule that cannot passively diffuse across cell membranes, which means that it acts as a solute. Therefore, when levels of glucose become elevated in the blood, the patient is in a hyperosmolar state, which causes water to leave the body&#8217;s cells. This extravasation of intracellular fluid leads to polyuria and dehydration, ultimately causing neurologic symptoms like <strong>lethargy&#160;</strong>and <strong>seizures</strong>, which can progress to coma and death if left untreated. Laboratory results in these patients show hyperglycemia, often over 600 mg/dL, <strong>high serum osmolality</strong>, often over 320 mOsm/kg and, unlike DKA, there is no acidosis, because ketone production is limited by the endogenous insulin.

Because of his hypotension and severe symptoms, synchronized cardioversion was indicated to revert his heart rate back to a normal sinus rhythm, though unfortunately it was unsuccessful. SMVT occurs most commonly in patients with <strong>coronary artery disease (CAD)</strong>, and it can happen with a heart attack. Among patients with diabetes (either type), cardiovascular disease (including CAD and stroke) is the leading cause of death. &#160; <br><br>Generally, the chronic complications of diabetes can be broken down into two distinct pathways: 1) non-enzymatic glycosylation, and 2) osmotic cellular damage. &#160;<br><br><ol><li><strong>&#160;Non-enzymatic glycosylation (NEG)&#160;</strong>occurs when glucose covalently attaches to cell proteins and lipids, without the help of an enzyme. &#160;These sugar coated molecules are pro-inflammatory and can cause damage to the cell. &#160;NEG in small blood vessels like arterioles causes hyaline arteriolosclerosis, in which the walls of arterioles develop protein deposits that make the vessels hard and inflexible. In addition, the basement membrane of blood vessels can thicken, making it hard for oxygen to easily move to the tissues, resulting in hypoxia. NEG causes retinopathy and nodular glomerulosclerosis (microvascular complications), as well as CAD, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease (macrovascular complications).</li></ol><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/8hCmdTGwQ1mZ0p-A76w-40pYQDCOGjz3/_.png\"></div><br><br>2. The next mechanism is <strong>osmotic cellular damage</strong>. Normally, when glucose enters cells, it can be converted to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase. Sorbitol is an osmotic agent, meaning it attracts water into the cells. As a protective mechanism, some cells are able to convert sorbitol to fructose with the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase; however, the cells of the lens, the pericytes in the retina, Schwann cells and renal epithelial cells lack this enzyme. &#160;<br><br><br><br>Therefore, in the lens, sorbitol build up causes cataracts, while damage to the Schwann cells causes diabetic neuropathy (microvascular complications). Autonomic neuropathy, caused by a mix of NEG and osmotic damage to autonomic ganglia, can lead to diabetic gastroparesis, which is weakness of the gastric peristalsis, resulting in nausea and vomiting after meals. &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Alveolar wall destruction:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Alveolar wall destruction occurs in the setting of emphysema and the inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

High insulin levels but relatively low (or normal) C-peptide means the hypoglycemia is caused by exogenous insulin. In contrast, high insulin and high C-peptide levels indicate that the problem is coming from an insulinoma, an insulin-producing beta cell tumor, or insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia, in the case of very high levels. Sulfonylureas and meglitinides also result in a similar biochemical profile (high insulin, high c-peptide), as the beta cells respond to them by increasing endogenous insulin release, and thus you need to specifically test for the presence of the drug or its metabolites. &#160; &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/YF2fcX8xSCybQ0zd3kv1YslhRcC_f4rC/_.png\"></div><br>Regardless of the cause, hypoglycemia can be extremely dangerous.

Along with her mother&#8217;s history of vitiligo, which suggests a possible inherited autoimmune-associated gene, this patient most likely has <strong>type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).&#160;</strong>&#160;<br><br>In T1DM, the immune system targets and destroys the beta-cells of the pancreas. A common target is an enzyme inside beta cells called <strong>glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)</strong>, which helps make gamma aminobutyric acid or GABA. GABA increases insulin release and also has a protective effect on the beta-cells. Without the protective effect of GABA, the number of beta cells progressively decreases, leading to the loss of endogenous insulin and the elevation of blood sugar levels. &#160;<br><br>The gene complex involved in the regulation of the immune response, and which is often associated with various autoimmune conditions, is called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system. These genes code for the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, which is a protein that helps the immune system recognize foreign molecules and maintain self-tolerance.

Risk factors for T2DM include obesity, environmental factors, and a multitude of heritable genetic factors. Insulin levels are increased at the start, but as the islet cells tire out and die, the level drops.

Diabetes is diagnosed by quantifying the amount of glucose present in the blood at various points in time. In the clinic, a common screening test for diabetes is the fasting glucose level; this blood work is done after the patient has had no calories to eat or drink for at least eight hours. A level of <strong>126 mg/dL or higher</strong>, in the presence of symptoms (including polyuria), is diagnostic of diabetes. &#160;<br><br>A <strong>non-fasting (random) glucose test&#160;</strong>can be done at any time, with 200 mg/dL or higher being diagnostic of diabetes if the individual has symptoms. Another test is called an <strong>oral glucose tolerance test</strong>, where a person is given a glucose tab (usually 75 mg), and then blood samples are taken at timed intervals to determine how well the glucose is being cleared from the blood. A glucose level over 200 mg/dL after 2 hours indicates diabetes. &#160;<br><br>When blood glucose levels get high, the glucose molecules can also attach to proteins that are present in the blood or in cells. <strong>Hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c)</strong> values indicate the proportion of hemoglobin in red blood cells that has glucose attached to it; HbA1c levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes, while levels from 5.7% to 6.4% indicate pre-diabetes.

Diabetic neuropathy refers to the gradual loss of function of large and small myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers, starting distally, leading to symptoms of numbness, weakness, tinging, and pain. The process starts in the feet first, and typically once it reaches halfway up the calves, it begins in the fingers, leading to a &#8220;stocking-glove&#8221; distribution. Diabetic neuropathy should be suspected in patients with type 1 diabetes 5 years after diagnosis and in all patients with type 2 diabetes, and it is screened for by monofilament testing. &#160;<br><br>The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes damages nerves through multiple mechanisms, but an especially important mechanism is through <strong>osmotic cellular damage</strong>. Normally, when glucose enters cells, it can be converted to sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase. Sorbitol is an osmotic agent, meaning it attracts water into the cells. As a protective mechanism, cells are able to convert sorbitol to fructose with the enzyme<strong>&#160;sorbitol dehydrogenase</strong>; however, the cells of the <strong>lens</strong>, the<strong>&#160;pericytes in the retina, Schwann cells</strong> and <strong>renal epithelial cells lack this enzyme</strong>.

He most likely has<strong>&#160;type I diabetes mellitus,</strong> which is caused by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. As a result, individuals with this condition cannot produce endogenous insulin. Administration of <strong>exogenous insulin</strong> is needed to treat type I diabetes, as well as late-stage type II diabetes. &#160; <br><br>Insulin reduces blood glucose levels via two main mechanisms. First, it <strong>upregulates the GLUT4 transporter</strong> protein, allowing more glucose to enter and be stored in cells. Second, insulin<strong>&#160;prevents the breakdown of existing glycogen</strong> into glucose (glycogenolysis), thereby preventing new glucose from being released into the blood. In addition to its effect on glucose, insulin also promotes lipogenesis (synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides) and protein synthesis. &#160;<br><br>Insulin is typically administered <strong>subcutaneously&#160;</strong>via <strong>syringes or pens</strong> because it can be broken down in the GI tract. When injected into the abdominal region, absorption is the quickest, followed by arms, thighs, and buttocks. Some diabetics prefer the i<strong>nsulin pump</strong> since insulin dosages are programed into the device and will be delivered subcutaneously throughout the day, thus preventing the need for multiple daily injections. <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/0UH4dIOaTz6KgBdOxfQK-0MfTFa8Fs8y/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Upregulation of GLUT4 protein:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Biguanides, such as metformin, work by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis.
