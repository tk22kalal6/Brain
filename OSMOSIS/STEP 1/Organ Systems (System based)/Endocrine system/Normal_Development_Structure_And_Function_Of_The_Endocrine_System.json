They are then incorporated into chylomicrons, which travel through the lymphatic system to enter the blood. In the blood, they bind vitamin D-binding proteins, which take them to the liver. In the <strong>hepatic endoplasmic reticulum</strong>, vitamin D2 and D3 are converted to <strong>25-hydroxy ergocalciferol</strong> and <strong>25-hydroxycholecalciferol</strong>, respectively, by the enzyme <strong>25-hydroxylase</strong>. These re enter the blood and travel to the<strong>&#160;proximal tubules of the kidneys</strong>, where the enzyme<strong>&#160;1-alpha-hydroxylase&#160;</strong>converts 25-hydroxy ergocalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to <strong>1,25-dihydroxy ergocalciferol</strong> and<strong>&#160;1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol</strong>, respectively, which are the active forms of vitamin D. &#160; <br><br>In the skin, keratinocytes produce 7-dehydrocholesterol, a precursor molecule for cholecalciferol. When the skin is exposed to sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol absorbs ultraviolet B radiation and is converted to previtamin D3 via photolysis. Then, heat generated by cellular metabolic activities causes the previtamin D3 molecule to isomerize (change its shape) to form vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol. The vitamin D3 molecules then enter the blood, and follow the same path as dietary cholecalciferol to the liver, and then to the kidneys. &#160;<br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/2a3H1NukQvytG324ahHC9aszRna0NYMO/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cholecalciferol &#8594; 25-hydroxycholecalciferol &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The conversion of cholecalciferol to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol by 25-hydroxylase takes place in the liver. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ 25-hydroxycholecalciferol &#8594; 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Ergocalciferol &#8594; 25-hydroxyergocalciferol &#160;&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: The conversion of ergocalciferol to 25-hydroxyergocalciferol by 25-hydroxylase takes place in the liver.

The apical side of follicular cells surrounds a central cavity filled with colloids containing <strong>thyroglobulin</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Thyroglobulin is a large glycoprotein synthesized by the follicular cells and then secreted into the follicle's lumen to be stored in the colloid.

Additionally, increased prolactin in turn <strong>inhibits its own</strong> <strong>secretion</strong> by <strong>increasing dopamine synthesis</strong> and secretion from the hypothalamus. It is important to note that <strong>thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) increases</strong><strong>&#160;prolactin secretion</strong>, and therefore, the elevation of TRH (such as in 1&#176; or 2&#176; hypothyroidism) can result in hyperprolactinemia. &#160; <br><br>During pregnancy, high circulating concentrations of estrogen and progesterone increase prolactin levels by 10- to 20-fold. Estrogen and progesterone inhibit the stimulatory effects of prolactin on milk production. The abrupt drop in estrogen and progesterone levels following delivery allows prolactin&#8212;which temporarily remains high&#8212;to induce lactation. Other prolactin-releasing stimuli include the nursing stimulus, as well as stress. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/3Gcf91EVR3S1QMb5F2htR2qnSfiUYYvW/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Prolactin secretion from the posterior pituitary is constantly inhibited by dopamine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Prolactin is secreted by lactotrophs located in the anterior pituitary and is tonically inhibited by dopamine from the tuberoinfundibular pathway of the hypothalamus.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Metoclopramide inhibits the release of prolactin:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist and it stimulates the release of prolactin. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Thyrotropin-releasing hormone can stimulate prolactin release &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct:</strong> See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Prolactin release from the anterior pituitary stimulates GnRH:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Prolactin release from the anterior pituitary inhibits GnRH synthesis and release.

      "solution": "<strong>Growth hormone (GH)</strong> acts on a number of target tissues and organs, including bones and muscles, adipose tissue, and the liver. Stimulation of GH production and secretion occurs through hypothalamic neurosecretory nuclei production of <strong>growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)</strong> in response to stress, hypoglycemia, deep sleep, or during exercise. Positive feedback for GH secretion is also known to occur from a hormone produced in the stomach, called ghrelin, which induces additional food intake. GH acts by binding to specific receptors, located mostly in the liver, and induces intracellular signaling by a phosphorylation cascade involving the JAK/STAT (signal-transducing activators of transcription) pathway. Its predominant action is to stimulate hepatic synthesis and secretion of <strong>insulin-like growth factor 1; IGF-1 mediates most of the peripheral actions of GH</strong>. &#160; <br><br><strong>IGF-1</strong>, which is produced by the liver, provides negative feedback to the pituitary and hypothalamus to limit GH and GHRH secretion, respectively. Other sources of <strong>negative feedback</strong> and GH suppression occur through <strong>somatostatin</strong>, also called <strong>growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH)</strong>, which is produced by both the pancreas and the hypothalamus.
