      "solution": "This patient, with a history of Hashimoto thyroiditis treated with levothyroxine, presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Laboratory testing reveals a largely unchanged total T4 but markedly increased free (biologically active) T<sub>4</sub>. Amongst the answer choices, <strong>dexamethasone&#160;</strong>is the medication most likely responsible for these changes.<br><br>Patients starting new medications may require adjustments in their levothyroxine dose due to drug-drug interactions. &#160;The first group includes medications that <strong>decrease levothyroxine absorption</strong>, such as iron, aluminum hydroxide, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), sucralfate, and cholestyramine. Since they are associated with decreased absorption, individuals taking these medications require higher doses of levothyroxine to achieve therapeutic effects. The next group covers medications that <strong>increase thyroid hormone metabolisms</strong>, such as rifampin, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. These patients also require higher doses of levothyroxine.<br><br>Next, some medications increase <strong>the concentration of thyroxine-binding globulins</strong> (TBGs), such as estrogen, raloxifene, tamoxifen, heroin, and methadone. More TBGs mean less free T<sub>4</sub>; therefore, these individuals require more levothyroxine. In contrast, medications such as androgens, glucocorticoids, and anabolic steroids <strong>decrease TBG concentration</strong>. In other words, fewer TBGs in the blood means more free T<sub>4</sub>, so these individuals require lower doses of levothyroxine.<br><br>Finally, it is important to note that <strong>propranolol&#160;</strong>inhibits 5&#8217;- deiodinase and reduces the conversion of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub>. Since propranolol favors the less active form of thyroid hormones, T<sub>4</sub>, individuals on propranolol also require higher doses of levothyroxine.<br>&#160; <div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/eu1Zx7FbQHuPW9UsiDYeyyQOT3ejFmHN/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Propranolol:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Propranolol inhibits 5&#8217;-deiodinase and reduces the peripheral conversion of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub>. As a result, propranolol would more likely cause symptoms of hypothyroidism (e.g., fatigue, dry skin, delayed deep tendon reflexes) rather than hyperthyroidism. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Methadone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Methadone increases the plasma concentration of thyroxine-binding globulins (TBG). This effect would reduce the amount of free T<sub>4</sub> available. In contrast, this patient has higher levels of T<sub>4</sub> after starting the new medication. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Dexamethasone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Omeprazole:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and lansoprazole are known to reduce levothyroxine absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Reduced levothyroxine bioavailability would result in increased TSH levels, decreased total and free T<sub>4</sub> levels, and symptoms of hypothyroidism. In contrast, this patient has decreased TSH levels and increased total and free T<sub>4</sub> levels. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Carbamazepine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant that increases thyroid hormone metabolism. If the patient had been started on carbamazepine, her laboratory results from the current visit would likely demonstrate a reduced total and free T<sub>4</sub> levels, which would subsequently lead to an increase in TSH levels. &#160;</span></div>",

It can be treated via a partial thyroidectomy, and Lugol&#8217;s solution is administered preoperatively.<br><br><strong>Lugol&#8217;s solution</strong> consists of <strong>potassium iodide</strong> (chemical formula: KI) and <strong>iodine </strong>(chemical formula: I2). Although iodine is needed for thyroid hormone synthesis, at higher concentrations, it inhibits the synthesis and release of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub>. This phenomenon is termed the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. <br><br>Lugol&#8217;s solution is used to decrease the vascularity and size of the thyroid gland. It helps <strong>reduce intraoperative bleeding</strong> and improves the visualization of essential structures during thyroid surgery. In addition, given the solution&#8217;s rapid onset of action, it can be used to treat <strong>thyroid storms</strong>. However, Lugol&#8217;s solution is not used to treat hyperthyroidism long-term since the thyroid gland can adapt and resume hormone synthesis after the initial few weeks of treatment.<br><br>Side effects include skin rash, drug fever, metallic taste, and gastric mucosa irritation. On rare occasions, it can also cause anaphylactic reactions. To avoid mucosal irritation, individuals should take it with food or diluted with fluids. Also, it is essential to note that these medications should be <strong>avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding</strong> because they can cause fetal goiter (abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland) and hypothyroidism (since the immature thyroid gland cannot adapt to high iodine levels and resume thyroid hormones synthesis). &#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Postoperative wound infection:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Proper use of sterile techniques during surgery and appropriate post-operative care are useful in reducing the risk of wound infection.

Apoplexy, in addition to sudden <strong>headaches</strong>, vomiting, diplopia and rapidly worsening <strong>visual loss</strong>, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus which control the eye muscles. MRI of the brain shows an enlarged and <strong>hyperintense pituitary gland</strong> with<strong>&#160;bright white areas</strong> indicative of active <strong>hemorrhage</strong>.
