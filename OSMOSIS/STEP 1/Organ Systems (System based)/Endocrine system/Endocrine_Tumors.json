It lowers plasma glucose concentrations by <strong>decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis.&#160;</strong>The exact mechanism remains unknown but is thought to result from the activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), which inhibits<strong>&#160;phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase</strong> (via the inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase). AMPK also causes the glucose transporter protein<strong>&#160;(GLUT4)&#160;</strong>within adipose and muscle tissues to embed into the plasma membrane, allowing glucose to enter.

VIP is a neuropeptide that functions as a neuromodulator and neurotransmitter, and a VIPoma is a rare endocrine tumor that usually originates from the non-&#946; islet cells of the pancreas. VIP&#8217;s effects include vasodilation, smooth muscle relaxation, and bicarbonate secretion from bile duct cholangiocytes. In excess, VIP binds to intestinal epithelial cells, increasing cAMP and causing fluid and electrolyte secretion into the lumen, which results in <strong>profuse secretory diarrhea with hypokalemia</strong> and metabolic acidosis. Electrolyte derangements and dehydration cause symptoms of fatigue, muscle cramps, flushing, and weakness. &#160;.<br><br>VIPomas are associated with <strong>multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 (MEN type 1)</strong>. MEN1 is a gene that is found on chromosome 11 and codes for a tumor suppressor protein called menin, which &#160;normally stops cells from dividing uncontrollably. MEN1 mutations cause MEN type 1, which is an <strong>autosomal dominant</strong> genetic disorder.

      "solution": "In this vignette, the patient&#8217;s history of <strong>epigastric pain</strong>, <strong>elevated gastrin levels</strong>, and endoscopic findings of <strong>multiple ulcers</strong> in the gastric and <strong>duodenal</strong> regions raise concerns for a <strong>gastrinoma</strong>. When inherited, gastrinomas are usually associated with <strong>multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1</strong> (MEN1), an autosomal dominant genetic condition which predisposes patients to develop<strong>&#160;pituitary adenomas</strong>, <strong>parathyroid adenomas</strong>, and <strong>pancreatic endocrine tumors&#160;</strong>(e.g., gastronomas, insulinomas, etc.). Pituitary adenomas are seen in up to 30-40% patients with MEN1.<br><br>Pituitary adenomas are classified based on size and hormone-secreting status. When a pituitary adenomas is under one-centimeter in diameter, it is termed a <strong>microadenoma</strong>. Most microadenomas are asymptomatic. If the tumor is greater than one-centimeter in diameter, it is termed a<strong>&#160;macroadenoma</strong>. Macroadenomas can cause symptoms of mass effect (i.e. headaches, visual field deficits, and hypopituitarism), since the tumor compresses and impairs the function of the normal pituitary gland.<br><br>Adenomas are further classified as non-functional, which do not secrete hormones, and functional, which do secrete hormones. Most <strong>non-functional adenomas</strong> only present with mass effect symptoms. <strong>Functional adenomas</strong>, on the other hand, can present with varying symptoms depending on the hormone produced. The most common of them is prolactinoma, which secretes prolactin.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/KnGyzXR2TFOzoKFyyadx_vwsR62cQZ2m/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Colorectal cancer:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Colorectal cancer is a long term complication of inflammatory bowel disease, which can present with watery diarrhea and abdominal pain.

When combined with the abdominal CT results, these findings are concerning for <strong>Cushing syndrome</strong> secondary to an autonomous cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma.<br><br>An <strong>adrenal adenoma</strong> is a benign tumor of the adrenal gland that most commonly is non-functioning and therefore does not cause excess hormone production.
