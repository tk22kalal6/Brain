      "solution": "This patient presents with an <strong>asthma exacerbation</strong> likely secondary to pneumonia (note the consolidation in the apical segments of the left lower lobe). In the early stages of asthma exacerbation, patients develop a respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation (blowing off CO<sub>2</sub>). Over time, and without treatment, these patients develop signs of respiratory fatigue (e.g., reduced respiratory rate, accessory muscle muscle) and<strong>&#160;respiratory acidosis</strong> secondary to hypoventilation.<br><br>The primary driver of respiratory acidosis is<strong>&#160;CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation</strong>. Specific causes include <strong>airway obstruction</strong> (e.g. obstruction by a foreign object),<strong>&#160;respiratory muscle weakness</strong> (e.g., trauma, obesity, fatigue), and <strong>alveoli damage</strong> (e.g., chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, pulmonary edema). In certain circumstances, hypoventilation occurs secondary to damage or action on the respiratory centers of the brain stem--such as after a <strong>stroke</strong> or <strong>medication overdose</strong> (e.g., opioids, sedatives).<br><br>Overtime, the body compensates for respiratory acidosis by increasing bicarbonate levels. This phenomenon is termed &#8220;respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation&#8221; and is mediated via the kidneys via<strong>&#160;increasing HCO<sub>3</sub>&#8722; reabsorption</strong>. This effect, however, takes 24 hours of persistent respiratory acidosis before compensation takes effect. Thus in an acute respiratory acidosis, the pH is low while the HCO<sub>3</sub>&#8722; is normal or slightly elevated. In patients with chronic respiratory acidosis (e.g. COPD or obesity hypoventilation syndrome), the kidneys have time to compensate, resulting in a pH that is closer to normal but with a markedly elevated HCO<sub>3</sub>&#8722;.<br><br>&#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/We9kpSblTcmViT7EYxquCPlMRVGCFBrv/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ &#160;Serum pH&#160;&#160;Arterial PaCO2&#160; (mEq/L)&#160;&#160;Arterial PaO2&#160; (mEq/L)&#160;&#160;HCO3-&#160; (mEq/L)&#160;&#160;7.30&#160;&#160;52&#160;&#160;70&#160;&#160;25&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See Main Explanation</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ &#160;Serum pH&#160;&#160;Arterial PaCO2&#160; (mEq/L)&#160;&#160;Arterial PaO2&#160; (mEq/L)&#160;&#160;HCO3-&#160; (mEq/L)&#160;&#160;7.30&#160;&#160;52&#160;&#160;70&#160;35:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>This answer choice describes a respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation.

The patient develops seizures and congestive heart failure after her nutritional intake is increased during the hospitalization, which raises concerns for <strong>refeeding syndrome</strong>.

The nutrition causes electrolyte and fluid shifts that may precipitate disabling or fatal medical complications including hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, congestive heart failure, peripheral edema, seizures, and hemolysis. &#160; <br><br>Hypophosphatemia arises since in the starved state, cellular metabolism slows and blood glucose is low. When feeding is reinstituted, blood glucose increases, driving insulin upwards and shifting phosphate into cells for ATP synthesis, thus leading to hypophosphatemia. &#160;<br><br>Other causes of hypophosphatemia include <strong>decreased intestinal absorption</strong> and <strong>increased urinary excretion</strong> of phosphate.
