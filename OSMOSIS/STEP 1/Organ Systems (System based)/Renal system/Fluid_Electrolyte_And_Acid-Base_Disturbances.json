      "solution": "Sodium is a major component of the extracellular fluid and accounts for a major part of blood osmolality. <strong>Sodium homeostasis</strong> is the process of regulating the amount of sodium in the extracellular fluid and is mainly achieved by the kidneys.<br><br>The two major factors that affect sodium homeostasis are blood volume and pressure.<br><br>In the setting of a <strong>drop in blood volume and pressure</strong> (e.g. hemorrhage), mechanisms are activated to <strong>increase sodium and water reabsorption</strong> from the kidneys to restore blood volume and pressure. One such system is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS). <strong>Renin</strong> converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin, and angiotensin II increases sodium reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules. Additionally, <strong>angiotensin II</strong> stimulates the release of <strong>aldosterone</strong>, which acts on the collecting ducts and tubules to increase sodium reabsorption. Moreover, <strong>sympathetic activation</strong> increases the reabsorption of sodium both indirectly (through stimulation of renin release) and directly by acting on the proximal convoluted tubules to increase sodium reabsorption. Finally, <strong>antidiuretic hormone</strong> (ADH) released from the posterior pituitary in response to low blood volume increases sodium reabsorption in the thick limb of the loop of Henle.<br><br>In contrast, <strong>increased blood pressure and volume</strong> stimulates <strong>sodium excretion</strong> (and eventually water) in the kidneys. This effect is achieved not only through the aforementioned mechanisms but also by certain hormones such as <strong>atrial natriuretic peptide</strong>, which is secreted by the atria in response to increased blood volume. <br><br>Other factors that also influence sodium homeostasis include <strong>serum osmolarity</strong>, wherein increased osmolarity of blood causes increased sodium excretion and vice versa. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Increased circulating blood volume:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct</strong>: See Main Explanation. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Sympathetic activation:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Sympathetic activation decreases the excretion of sodium into the urine and increases sodium reabsorption.

This diagnosis is supported by the fact that treatment with <strong>furosemide</strong> improves his condition. However, laboratory results a few days later show a<strong>&#160;rising creatinine</strong>, a low fractional excretion of sodium <strong>(FE<span>Na</span>) &lt;1%</strong> and a <strong>high urine osmolality</strong> of 600 mOsm/kg, which is consistent with <strong>prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI)</strong> from volume depletion from the furosemide therapy. &#160; &#160; &#160;<br><br>AKI can be divided into categories based on where the problem has occurred: <strong>prerenal AKI</strong> (e.g., bleeding, volume depletion, sepsis),<strong>&#160;intrarenal AKI&#160;</strong>(e.g., acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, or interstitial nephritis) or<strong>&#160;post-renal AKI</strong> (e.g., BPH, stones, malignancy). To establish the cause of renal injury, it is essential to assess the <strong>urine osmolality, urine sodium, FE<span>Na</span>, and the serum BUN/Cr</strong>. &#160; &#160; <br><br>In <strong>prerenal AKI,</strong> the kidney detects reduced blood flow. In an attempt to conserve the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the kidney reabsorbs more sodium (leading to a Fe<span>Na</span>&lt;1%) and urea. Creatinine, however, is not reabsorbed, and thus BUN/Cr ratio is &gt;20. Because the kidney is absorbing fluids to maintain GFR, the urine is highly concentrated and usually &gt;500 mOsm/kg. <br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/voaMN-TOT9OdFMKBq_Tv5uOCQHuG058S/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Acute tubular necrosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a cause of intrarenal acute kidney injury due to ischemic (e.g., hypotension, shock) or cytotoxic causes (e.g., aminoglycosides, radiocontrast agents, lead, cisplatin). In ATN, the urine osmolality is usually &lt;350 (mOsm/kg) and the FE<span>Na</span>&gt; 2%. Granular muddy brown casts are also seen in the urine.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Diabetic nephropathy:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive chronic condition that causes a gradual decline in renal function. This patient's drastic change in renal function favors another diagnosis.

This patient is not taking any of these nephrotoxic medications, and the laboratory findings favor a different diagnosis.

In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, urine osmolality is expected to be &lt;300 mOsm/kg.&#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Renal artery stenosis:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Renal artery stenosis is a possible cause of prerenal acute kidney injury.
