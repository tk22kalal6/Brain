The presence of <strong>constitutional symptoms</strong> (fatigue, loss of appetite, fever and weight loss), together with <strong>hemoptysis</strong>, <strong>nodular densities on chest x-ray</strong>, and <strong>crescent formation on renal biopsy</strong>, confirms the diagnosis of <strong>granulomatosis with polyangiitis</strong> (GPA). &#160;<br><br>GPA, formerly called <strong>Wegener granulomatosis</strong>, is an <strong>immune-mediated vasculitis</strong> associated with the formation of <strong>proteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies</strong> (PR3-ANCA/c-ANCA). These autoantibodies against neutrophil granule proteins are the hallmark of GPA, though their exact role in causing disease remains unclear. The condition usually manifests in older adults with constitutional symptoms, <strong>recurrent sinusitis</strong>, cough, hemoptysis and nephritic syndrome. Laboratory findings include normocytic anemia, leukocytosis and <strong>positive c-ANCA</strong> on serology. Chest x-ray reveals <strong>nodular densities</strong> suggestive of necrosis and <strong>cavitation</strong>. &#160;<br><br>Definitive diagnosis requires <strong>biopsy&#160;</strong>of the involved organs.

Together, these findings are consistent with <strong>ethylene glycol poisoning</strong>--a toxic alcohol found in antifreeze that is often ingested as a substitute for alcohol. &#160; <br><br>Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic acid, which causes <strong>direct tubular damage,</strong> and oxalic acid, which crystallizes and obstructs the renal tubules. Together, these effects result in <strong>acute tubular necrosis&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;intrarenal azotemia</strong>. Intrarenal azotemia is characterized by tubular dysfunction, impaired reabsorption of sodium, <strong>increased urinary sodium (&gt;40 mEq/L)&#160;</strong>and<strong>&#160;increased FE<span>Na</span>(&gt;2%)</strong>. Urea reabsorption is also impaired, causing <strong>BUN:Cr&#160;</strong>to<strong>&#160;fall below 15.&#160;</strong>Failure of water reabsorption dilutes the urine, <strong>decreasing osmolality to &lt;350 mOsm/kg. &#160;<div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/zAs9OVrzQ3uCA9Vz8f0L75NVQKiSFMai/_.png\"></div></strong><br>Urinalysis demonstrates<strong> granular &#8220;muddy brown&#8221; casts </strong>of sloughed tubular cells, which are <strong>pathognomonic</strong> for ATN.

Causes of aldosterone deficiency include Addison disease, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone receptor blockers (ARBs), diabetic nephropathy, and NSAIDs. Causes of aldosterone resistance include potassium sparing diuretics and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). &#160; &#160;<br><br>Aldosterone deficiency or resistance decreases Na+/K+ ATPase activity in <strong>principal cells</strong>, leading to hyponatremia and <strong>hyperkalemia</strong>. Likewise, reduced H+ ATPase activity in <strong>&#945;-intercalated cells</strong> decreases hydrogen excretion and causes a normal anion gap <strong>metabolic acidosis</strong>. &#160; <br><br>Normally, the urine is buffered by ammonia (NH3). Ammonia needs to bind with hydrogen ions in order to become trapped in the collecting tubules as ammonium (NH4+). In type 4 RTA, impaired hydrogen secretion leads to less trapping. As a result, the small amounts of hydrogen that do enter the urine are able to significantly affect pH. This explains why urine pH is generally <strong>below 5.5</strong> in patients with type 4 RTA.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/TZgDQbbKSZyDTrfEUkwqQlN_STyAh4Oo/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Probenecid:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Probenecid can prevent gout by inhibiting resorption of uric acid in the proximal convoluted tubule.

These include Proteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter. Urease-producing bacteria break down urinary urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia makes the urine more alkaline, thereby reducing the solubility of magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate. These substances then precipitate and form stones. &#160; <br><br>Treatment involves eradicating the underlying infection and surgical removal of the stone.

Calcium containing stones are radiopaque and can be visualized on plain radiograph. However, they would rarely take the shape of a staghorn calculi.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Calcium oxalate:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Calcium oxalate accounts for about 80% of renal stones. Many conditions can predispose patients to developing calcium oxalate stones. These include ethylene glycol (antifreeze) ingestion, vitamin C overconsumption, hypocitraturia, and malabsorption (e.g. Crohn disease). Calcium oxalate stones are radio-opaque and can be visualized on plain radiograph.

Uric acid stones account for 5-10% of all stones. Dehydration, acidic urine, and increased uric acid levels promote their formation. Additionally, chronic diarrhea, which leads to loss of bicarbonate via feces and lowered urine pH, also facilitates uric acid stone formation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Cystine:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Cystine stones are seen in patients with hereditary cystinuria, a genetic condition in which the cystine-reabsorbing proximal convoluted tubule transporter loses function. This defect causes increased urinary cystine excretion and cystine nephrolithiasis. Although cystinuria can also cause staghorn calculi, it usually manifests with symptoms in childhood, as well as a positive family history.</span></div>",

Other symptoms of nephrolithiasis include hematuria, dysuria, and urinary urgency. The urinalysis shows <strong>wedge-shaped crystals</strong>, favoring the diagnosis of <strong>calcium phosphate stones</strong>. &#160; <br><br>The most common type of kidney stone is calcium oxalate, which accounts for approximately 80% of cases. Most risk factors are common to both types of calcium stones (see table below), However, high urinary oxalate levels favor the formation of calcium oxalate stones, whereas <strong>high urine pH</strong> (pH &gt; 6.5) favors the formation of calcium phosphate stones. In contrast, calcium oxalate stone formation is not affected by urine pH. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/ZUJvp4FBT-egImRsRw9gJ7HrTrSFX0ll/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Low urine volume:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:&#160;</strong>Low urine volume is a risk factor for all kinds of renal stones including calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, uric acid, and cysteine.
