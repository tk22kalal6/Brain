It plays a crucial role in <strong>conjugate horizontal gaze</strong> and <strong>saccades&#160;</strong>(fast eye movements). &#160; <br><br>In order to look to the right, the left frontal eye field synapses to the contralateral paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) via the superior colliculus. The efferent pathway from the PPRF passes to the right lateral rectus motor neurons (via the CN VI nucleus), resulting in abduction of the right eye. Excitatory signals are also sent to the contralateral medial rectus motor neurons (CN III) via the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), resulting in adduction of the contralateral (left) eye. &#160;<br><br><strong>Horizontal gaze palsy&#160;</strong>is typically caused by either a <strong>contralateral frontal eye field lesion</strong> or an<strong>&#160;ipsilateral PPRF lesion. &#160;</strong>&#160; <br><br>The middle cerebral artery supplies the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere. Strokes involving the middle cerebral artery (MCA) can lead to lesions that also involve the frontal eye field. Clinically, the eyes will deviate towards the side of the lesion (left-sided MCA stroke with right-sided hemiplegia means that eyes will be deviated to the left).

The intracellular potassium is subsequently pushed out of the cells into the tubules and urine.<br><br>The movement of potassium into the urine is further augmented by the insertion of more potassium channels in the apical membranes of these cells, allowing greater amounts of potassium to move out of the cells into the urine.<br><br>Finally, aldosterone indirectly increases the secretion of potassium into urine by augmenting the urine&#8217;s electrical gradient. Since sodium ions are reabsorbed from the urine, there is a negative environment in the urine that pulls in more potassium ions.<br><br>Through a combination of these three effects, <strong>aldosterone increases the excretion of potassium into the urine</strong>. &#160; <br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/SWYJTWAsS5CYE6MsQd7DsG0JRSmNZU5E/_.png\"></div><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased reabsorption of H+ by &#945;-intercalated cells of the collecting ducts back into the blood:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Aldosterone increases the excretion of H<sup>+</sup> ions from the blood into the urine through &#945;-intercalated cells. &#160;</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Increased excretion of H+ into the urine by principal cells of the collecting ducts &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect</strong>: Aldosterone increases the secretion of H<sup>+</sup> ions into the urine.
