The openings (or ostia) to the maxillary sinuses are small and can be easily obstructed when the surrounding nasal mucosa becomes congested. Also, because of the orientation of the maxillary sinuses in the skull, it is difficult for them to drain properly when the head is <strong>upright or lying on one side</strong>; the ostia are directed towards one another, so when lying on the side, only the top sinus can actually drain. &#160;<br><br><div><img src=\"https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/LlhMEToFRfOcjFRA9xplo7cXRZuL_Uz6/_.png\"></div><br><br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Frontal sinus &#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The frontal sinus is located in the frontal bone and opens into the anterior part of the middle meatus via the frontonasal duct.
