      "solution": "This patient presents for evaluation of <strong>nasal&#160;</strong>discharge and <strong>congestion&#160;</strong>and is noted to be hypertensive, agitated, and nervous on examination. The patient also endorses frequent use of nasal spray. Together, these findings are consistent with <strong>phenylephrine&#160;</strong>overuse, causing<strong>&#160;rebound nasal congestion. &#160;&#160;</strong><br><br>Phenylephrine is a <strong>selective &#945;<span>1</span> agonist</strong> without beta effects. This sympathomimetic is used to treat shock states (e.g. distributive shock), <strong>nasal congestion,</strong> epistaxis, hemorrhoids, and intraocular bleeding. Phenylephrine&#8217;s wide use owes to the fact that it is a potent systemic and local <strong>vasoconstrictor</strong>. In patients with nasal congestion, administration of phenylephrine vasoconstricts tortuous capillary beds, resulting in improvement in symptoms. &#160; &#160;<br><br>Adverse side effects of phenylephrine include hypertension with possible concomitant reflex bradycardia. Additional side effects include headache, excitability, cardiac arrhythmias, and restlessness. Excessive use of intranasal phenylephrine can result in rebound nasal congestion. &#160;&#160;<br><hr><h4 style='color: var(--accent-blue); margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:8px;'>Option Analysis</h4><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>✅ Phenylephrine&#160;:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Correct: </strong>See main explanation.</span></div><div style='margin-bottom: 12px;'><strong>❌ Fluticasone:</strong><br><span style='opacity:0.9'><strong>Incorrect: </strong>Fluticasone is a common intranasal medication used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.
