They are classified into several types including orbital rim fractures, orbital roof fractures, and <strong>orbital floor fractures</strong>, which are also known as <strong>blowout fractures</strong>. Patients with orbital floor fractures almost always have a history of blunt trauma to the orbit (e.g., assault, motor vehicle accident, sports-related trauma). &#160; <br><br>Symptoms of an orbital floor fracture include unilateral periorbital pain, edema and ecchymoses, <strong>enophthalmos&#160;</strong>(a posterior displacement of the eyeball), or <strong>proptosis&#160;</strong>(anterior displacement of the eyeball). If eye movement is restricted due to <strong>entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle, diplopia&#160;</strong>and pain may occur during eye movements. An entrapped inferior rectus keeps the affected eye in a downward position, leading to diplopia with attempted upward gaze. In severe fractures, the infraorbital or supraorbital nerves can be involved, resulting in numbness below the eye or forehead respectively.

The former is present in the outer region of the nerve, while the latter is found in the center of the nerve. A helpful way to remember this distinction is the alliteration that the Parasympathetic fibers are Peripheral. Clinical findings of CN III palsy depend on the components that are affected by the pathology. Loss of parasympathetic function leads to <strong>mydriasis</strong> and <strong>inability to accommodate</strong> to near objects, while loss of the somatic function causes <strong>ptosis</strong> and deviation of the eye <strong>down and out&#160;</strong>(due to unopposed action of superior oblique and lateral rectus muscles, innervated by CN IV and VI, respectively).<br><br>Isolated CN III palsy is most commonly due to <strong>ischemia&#160;</strong>or <strong>compression</strong>. Ischemia is mostly caused by hypertension or diabetes mellitus and preferentially affects somatic fibers.

Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder resulting in autoantibodies, specifically<strong>&#160;thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins</strong> (TSH-receptor antibodies), that can also activate the T-cells in the retro-orbital space. This activation results in secretion of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, increasing <strong>fibroblast secretion of glycosaminoglycans</strong>, causing ocular muscle swelling, inflammation, and an increase in the number of adipocytes. Ultimately, this manifests as <strong>exophthalmos</strong>, an anterior bulging of the eyes. In addition, <strong>lid lag</strong> may also be observed, where sclera can be seen above the iris as the patient looks down due to the increased sympathetic stimulation of the levator palpebrae superioris and superior tarsal muscles. &#160; <br><br>Diagnosis is confirmed by histology of the thyroid, which will demonstrate tall and crowded follicular epithelial cells with scalloped colloid. Treatment of Graves ophthalmopathy includes <strong>glucocorticoids </strong>due to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties.

The most common etiology of this condition is retinal breaks, which often occur secondary to <strong>head trauma </strong>or <strong>vitreous degeneration</strong>. &#160;Significant vitreous degeneration increases traction on the retina and potentially a retinal tear.

As the retina detaches, it may create a mechanical depolarization of the axons running through the nerve fiber layer of the retina, resulting in the sensation of flashing bright lights. Vision loss typically begins in the periphery and progresses toward the central visual axis over hours to weeks like a &#8220;<strong>curtain drawn down</strong>.&#8221; Diagnosis is based on a fundoscopic examination, which may visualize <strong>crinkling of retinal tissue </strong>or <strong>changes in blood vessel direction</strong>.

This retinal tumor of childhood is caused by a mutation in both alleles of the retinoblastoma or<strong>&#160;<em>RB1&#160;</em>gene</strong> on chromosome 13. Retinoblastomas can be hereditary, in which case the individual inherits a mutation in one of the alleles of the RB1 gene; however, random mutations in this gene may also lead to the development of retinoblastoma. Hereditary retinoblastomas are typically bilateral and are associated with an increased risk of developing additional malignancies, including osteosarcoma, sarcomas, and melanoma.

Other common symptoms include <strong>strabismus</strong> (misalignment of the eyes), nystagmus, or ocular inflammation. Metastases to the brain are common, presenting with findings of vomiting, headaches, or neurologic deficits. Diagnosis of retinoblastoma begins with a red reflex testing, followed by a fundoscopic examination. Characteristic findings on fundoscopy include the presence of a chalky, off-white retinal mass with a soft, friable consistency. A biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
