      "solution": "<p><strong>Correct Choice A</strong>: Battered baby syndrome refers to a pattern of injuries seen in infants and young children who have been physically abused. The correct statement states that skin lesions and bruises of various ages are seen on the body in cases of battered baby syndrome. This is an accurate description of the syndrome. Abused children often present with multiple injuries in different stages of healing, indicating repeated episodes of abuse over time. These injuries can include bruises, burns, fractures, and other signs of physical trauma.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Option B</strong>: It occurs due to the tendency of a child to fall repeatedly (Incorrect) This statement is incorrect. Battered baby syndrome is not caused by the child's tendency to fall repeatedly. It is a result of <span class=\"customMeta\" data-dictid=\"f36790af861692777194c85355c06d\">physical abuse</span> inflicted by a caregiver or other individuals responsible for the child's care.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option C</strong>: Multiple stab wounds are seen (Incorrect) This statement is incorrect. Battered baby syndrome does not involve multiple stab wounds. The term \"battered\" refers to physical abuse, which typically involves acts such as hitting, shaking, or throwing the child, rather than stabbing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Option D</strong>: The syndrome is a result of firearm injuries (Incorrect) This statement is incorrect. Battered baby syndrome is not specifically associated with firearm injuries. It refers to a pattern of <span class=\"customMeta\" data-dictid=\"f36790af861692777194c85355c06d\">physical abuse</span> and injuries inflicted on an infant or young child by a caregiver or another individual.</p>",
