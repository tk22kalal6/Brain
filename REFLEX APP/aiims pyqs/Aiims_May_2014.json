      "solution": "The muscular system is made up of skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle, with the exception of a few types of smooth muscle tissue which are derived from the ectoderm. Certain types of smooth muscle - pupillary, mammary gland, and sweat gland muscles - derive from ectoderm (i.e., sphincter and dilator pupillae, myoepithelial cells). Skeletal muscle originates from the paraxial mesoderm which forms somites from the occipital to the sacral regions and somitomeres in the head. As precursor cells, known as myoblasts, fuse and form long, multinucleated muscle fibers, myofibrils soon appear in the cytoplasm, and by the end of the third month, cross striations can be observed. Tendons which attach muscles to bones stem from the sclerotome components of these somites. Smooth muscle arises from the splanchnic layer of the lateral plate mesoderm surrounding the gut, while cardiac muscle is formed from the splanchnic layer of lateral plate mesoderm surrounding the heart tube<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p><i>Reference: Langman&#39; Medical Embryology Edition 14 th page no 163,164</i></p>",

Decrease in movements and loss of sensation</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explanation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During hip replacement surgery, the removal of certain ligaments and joint receptors (like those involved in proprioception) can lead to a decrease in the ability to sense the position and movement of the hip joint. This loss of joint receptors can impair proprioception, which is the body&#39;s sense of the position and movement of the joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the joint may still function mechanically after the surgery, the person might experience a decrease in certain movements and a reduction in sensory feedback from the joint. While the prosthetic joint itself may not have the same sensory feedback as the natural joint, sensory abilities and joint movement can improve with rehabilitation.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<i>Reference:&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">Ganong&#39;s Review Of Medical physiology 26th Edition&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\">Page no 165</span></i><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\"></span><br />\r\n&nbsp;",

Irritation of both eyes with copious amounts of normal saline</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Immediate Phase:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Initial treatment of any chemical burn should begin immediately at the time and place of the injury. Because the area and duration of contact determines the extent of subsequent injury and prognosis, <b>immediate copious irrigation with any available noncaustic fluid</b> upon exposure is of paramount importance. Irrigation should be continued for <b>at least 15 minutes</b> with <b>at least 1 L of</b> <b>irrigant</b>, until the pH of the ocular surface reaches neutrality i.e. between 7.0 and 7.2.</li>\r\n\t<li>Some evidence has shown a benefit when a borate buffer (Cederroth Eye Wash) is used for irrigation, compared with saline or tap water.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Acute and Reparative phase:</b>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The pH should be rechecked with narrow-range pH test strips (between 6 and 8) at 15- to 30-minute intervals after stabilization to confirm that there has not been a change outside normal range. Such a change can signify the presence of a hidden particle in the eye that continues to elute chemicals onto the ocular surface.</li>\r\n\t<li>A Morgan lens may be used with topical anesthesia to facilitate the irrigation process in a patient who is uncomfortable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Ophthalmic examination:&nbsp;</b>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Once pH has been neutralized reliably, a complete ophthalmic examination is required to characterize the extent of the injury and plan further treatment. The initial screen should include a thorough sweep of fornices with eyelid eversion to detect and remove occult particles such as lime and plaster.</li>\r\n\t<li>As discussed above, it is important to thoroughly assess the presence and degree of limbal ischemia as well as the degree of corneal epithelial defect and opacification. In eyes with chemosis, it is necessary to gently push aside chemotic conjunctiva from the limbus with a sterile ophthalmic sponge to gain good access to the limbus.</li>\r\n\t<li>Fluorescein should be used to assess the status of the corneal and conjunctival epithelium, with the knowledge that fluorescein staining may be difficult to appreciate in the presence of a complete epithelial defect. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be checked, as serious chemical burns can greatly increase or lower the pressure.</li>\r\n\t<li>Examination of the rest of the eye should be attempted, although the initial exam may be limited due to the view through the cornea and patient discomfort. Finally, even in cases of purported unilateral chemical injury, the contralateral eye must still be examined carefully (including a check of the pH) in order to confirm that both eyes are not involved.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em><b>Reference</b>: Ophthalmology by Yanoff and Duker, 5th edition, Page no 295, 296</em>.<br />\r\n<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\r\n</style>",
