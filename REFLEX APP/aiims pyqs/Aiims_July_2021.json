These plots visualize various parameters measured for individual cells or particles as they pass through the flow cytometer.Scatter plots: These plots typically display two parameters against each other, such as forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC). FSC measures the size of the cell or particle, while SSC provides information about its granularity or internal complexity. Scatter plots are useful for identifying different cell populations based on their size and internal characteristics.Histograms: Histograms represent the distribution of a single parameter measured by the flow cytometer, such as fluorescence intensity. Each bar in the histogram represents the number of cells or particles that fall within a specific range of values for that parameter. Histograms are commonly used to analyze the expression levels of specific proteins or markers within a cell population.These visual representations allow researchers to analyze the characteristics of individual cells or particles within a heterogeneous sample and identify different cell populations based on their properties.<br />\r\n<img alt=\"Analyzing Flow Cytometry Results | VWR\" src=\"https://it.vwr.com/responsive/css/Flow_Cytometry11.jpg\" /><br />\r\n<em><strong>Reference:&nbsp;</strong>Robbins and Cotran Pathology,10th edition, page no 332.</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;",
