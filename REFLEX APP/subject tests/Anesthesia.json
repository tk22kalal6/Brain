It is the intravenous agent of choice for patients with shock, low cardiac output states, and reactive airway diseases<br/>And is also used in patients with congenital heart diseases, especially with right-to-left shunts or as Perioperative analgesia.<br/> Propofol facilitates the inhibitory neurotransmission by action on<br/>GABA-A receptors. Propofol is formulated as a lipid emulsion and appears as a milky white liquid. It has antiemetic properties which help reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting.<br/> Midazolam is a benzodiazepine that facilitates GABA-A receptors' action by increasing the frequency of opening of GABA-mediated chloride channels. It is used in treating seizures and is used in daycare surgeries.<br/> Thiopentone sodium belongs to the barbiturate group which acts on the GABA-A receptors.<br/> They potentiate the action of GABA in increasing the duration of openings of chloride-specific ion channels.<br/> Morgan and Mikhail's Clinical Anesthesiology, 6th edition &bull; Page no: 183, 386",
