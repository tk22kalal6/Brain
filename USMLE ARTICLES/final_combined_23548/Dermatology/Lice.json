They have \"crab-like\" claws (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L20305.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) that help them attach to human hair and specialized mouthparts that pierce human skin.&nbsp; Lice infestation occurs when adult female lice lay eggs, known as nits (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L46164.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), on either hair shafts (head and pubic lice) or clothing and bedding (body lice).&nbsp; The nits remain firmly attached until they hatch into nymphs in about a week.&nbsp; Nymphs mature into adult lice and live for about a month, feeding on human blood daily.&nbsp; Without a host, lice die in 2-3 days.<p></p>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Head and pubic lice</strong> are transmitted through direct contact.&nbsp; Lice do not jump, fly, or have nonhuman hosts.&nbsp; Pubic lice are not transmitted through genital secretions; therefore, condoms are not effective prophylaxis for pubic lice.&nbsp; Transmission through shared fomites (eg, hairbrushes, towels) can also occur but is less common.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Body lice</strong> live on clothing and visit the host's skin only to feed.&nbsp; Therefore, body lice transmission most commonly occurs through shared contact with fomites (eg, clothing, bedding).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t\n\t<p>Lice infestation occurs worldwide, most commonly in children.&nbsp; Risk factors that may increase the risk for lice infestation include:</p>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Close contact with an individual with lice infestation (eg, in schools/daycares, among sports teams)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Poor personal hygiene or living in crowded/unsanitary conditions (particularly for body lice)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<h1>Clinical presentation</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>The clinical presentation of lice infestation varies depending on the type of lice and the affected area.&nbsp; Common signs and symptoms include:</p>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Pruritus, erythema, excoriation, and lichenification, especially around the scalp, neck, and shoulders (head lice); pubic and perianal areas (pubic lice); or trunk (body lice).&nbsp; Pruritus occurs due to an allergic reaction to lice saliva.&nbsp; Patients typically do not develop pruritus until sensitization occurs, up to 6 weeks after infestation.</li>\n\t\t<li>Visible nits or adult lice can be found on the hair or clothing.</li>\n\t\t<li>Blue-gray macules may be present on the trunk and extremities due to anticoagulant effects of lice saliva.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t\n\t<p>Excess scratching can lead to secondary bacterial infections, such as impetigo.&nbsp; In addition, body lice can serve as vectors for zoonotic infectious diseases (eg, <em>Rickettsia prowazekii</em> [epidemic typhus], <em>Bartonella quintana</em> [trench fever]).</p>\n\t<h1>Diagnosis</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>Visualization of lice or nits (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11092.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) on the hair shaft or clothing (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12032.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) confirms the diagnosis.&nbsp; A magnifying glass or handheld light may be used to aid in the identification of lice and nits.&nbsp; In addition, wet combing (using a fine-tooth comb to systematically brush wet hair) can aid in visualization of head lice.<p></p>\n\t\n\t<p>Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies are not typically indicated.</p>\n\t<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>The differential diagnosis of lice infestation includes other conditions that cause pruritus:</p>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Scabies</strong>:&nbsp; a skin infestation caused by the <em>Sarcoptes scabiei</em> mite and typically presents with intense pruritus, especially at night, and erythematous papules with linear burrows (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99108.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) at the site of infestation.&nbsp; Unlike lice infestations, scabies infestations typically occur in interdigital spaces and flexural areas.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Seborrheic dermatitis</strong>:&nbsp; a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythema, scaling, and pruritus, particularly in areas rich in sebaceous glands (eg, scalp, face, trunk).&nbsp; It often presents with greasy, yellow scales (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108854.png\" alt=\"image 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and may be associated with dandruff.&nbsp; Unlike nits, which are firmly attached to the hair shafts, dandruff is easily removed.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Tinea capitis</strong>:&nbsp; an infection caused by the dermatophyte <em>Trichophyton tonsurans</em> that presents as a scaly, pruritic, erythematous patch of hair loss (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L111383.jpg\" alt=\"image 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Small black dots representing broken hair shafts are typical.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<h1>Management</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>First-line treatment of head and pubic lice includes topical pediculicides (eg, <strong>permethrin</strong>, <strong>ivermectin</strong>) on the affected area.&nbsp; Most pediculicides are neurotoxins (eg, permethrin blocks parasite sodium ion conduction in nerve cell membrane channels) that cause louse paralysis and death.&nbsp; Treatment should be repeated after 7-10 days to ensure the eradication of newly hatched lice.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Manual lice removal via wet combing is an alternate treatment for patients with head lice for whom standard pediculicides are not feasible (eg, young infants, resource-limited populations).&nbsp; This must be repeated a few times weekly for several weeks to fully eradicate the infestation.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Prior to treatment, the presence of live lice should be confirmed.&nbsp; Nits far from the skin surface likely represent old egg casings that have already hatched and generally do not require treatment.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Because body lice live on clothing (not hair), the primary method of eradication involves laundering recently used clothing, bedding, and personal items in hot water (&gt;54 C [130 F]).&nbsp; Items that cannot be washed should be isolated from any potential host for 2 weeks.&nbsp; This practice is also reasonable for items recently used by patients with head and pubic lice.</p>\n\t\n\t<p>Patients should be advised to avoid direct contact of the affected area with others while undergoing treatment.&nbsp; Children with head lice may continue to go to school but should avoid direct head-to-head contact.</p>\n\t<h1>Prognosis</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>With appropriate treatment and preventive measures, the prognosis for lice infestation is excellent.&nbsp; Most cases can be successfully treated, and complications are uncommon.&nbsp; However, reinfestation can occur if preventive measures are not followed or if there is continued exposure to infested individuals.</p>\n\t<h1>Summary</h1>\n\t\n\t<p>Lice infestation, or pediculosis, is a condition in which parasitic insects feed on human blood.&nbsp; Lice infestation occurs worldwide, and patients present with pruritus and skin irritation.&nbsp; Treatment involves eradication with pediculicides while avoiding reexposure.</p>\n\t</div>\n\t\n            "
