The virus can be shed from respiratory secretions, oral secretions, fecal material, or vesicular fluid.&nbsp; After it enters the body, the incubation period is 3-5 days.&nbsp; During this period, the virus replicates in the gastrointestinal tract and lymphoid tissues before disseminating through the reticuloendothelial system and bloodstream to other organs (eg, heart, liver, brain, skin).&nbsp; The characteristic clinical manifestations result from viral replication and immune-mediated inflammation at these distant sites.</p><br><br><p>Risk factors for HFMD include:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Young age (most commonly affects children age &lt;7)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Close contact with infected individuals (eg, day care centers, schools)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Poor hygiene practices</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Warm and humid climate</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with HFMD typically present with:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Oral enanthem</strong>:&nbsp;

In addition, hospitalization is indicated in those who develop severe complications (eg, myocarditis, meningitis).&nbsp; Because patients can continue shedding the virus for &gt;6 weeks after recovery, measures to prevent infection spread (eg, strict hand hygiene, particularly when changing diapers) should be reinforced.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/36146.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a viral illness affecting infants and young children;
