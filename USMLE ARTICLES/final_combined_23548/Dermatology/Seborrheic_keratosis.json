However, a sudden eruption of multiple SKs may be a sign of occult internal malignancy.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Factors that increase the risk of developing SKs include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Older age (age &gt;50)</li><br><br><li> Positive family history</li><br><br><li> Light skin</li><br><br><li> Pregnancy, estrogen replacement therapy</li><br><br><li> Underlying malignancy, which can cause sudden onset of multiple SKs (Leser-Trélat sign)</li></ul>\n<h1>Etiology</h1><br><br><p>The etiology of SK is not fully understood; however, it is frequently associated with activating mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>SKs classically develop in older adults and present as brown, hyperkeratotic papules or plaques with a warty and \"<strong>stuck-on\" appearance</strong>.&nbsp; These lesions typically remain stable over time and are minimally symptomatic (asymptomatic or mildly pruritic).&nbsp; The range of their clinical presentation is highlighted below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Color:&nbsp;

few millimeters to centimeters</li><br><br><li> Texture:&nbsp; homogeneously greasy/velvety or hyperkeratotic/rough</li><br><br><li> Distribution:&nbsp; typically trunk (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45929.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), face, and extremities with sparing of the palms and soles</li></ul><br><br><p>A <strong>red flag</strong> presentation is the explosive onset (&lt;3-6 months) of numerous SKs (often in a Christmas tree pattern on the trunk), known as the Leser-Trélat sign (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12515.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This sign has been associated with <strong>internal malignancy</strong> (especially lung and gastrointestinal tumors) and warrants further investigation (eg, laboratory, endoscopic studies).&nbsp; It is thought to occur in response to increased tumor production of cytokines or growth factors (eg, IGF-1, fibroblast growth factor).<p></p>\n<h1>Histology</h1><br><br><p>Histological examination of SKs shows small cells resembling basal cells, with variable pigmentation, hyperkeratosis (thickening of the stratum corneum), and keratin-containing cysts (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L3929.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>In most cases, the diagnosis of SK is obvious based on clinical appearance; no further evaluation is needed and the patient can be reassured.&nbsp; If further confirmation is desired, an examination with a dermatoscope may be performed, which would show whitish milia, irregular fissures and crypts, keratin plugs, and linear or fingerprint-like pigmentation.&nbsp; When the diagnosis is unclear, especially when pigmented malignancies are considered (eg, melanoma), a skin biopsy should be performed for definitive diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis of SKs consists of benign and malignant skin lesions that present with pigmented macules or papules.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>Melanoma</strong> presents as an asymmetric, pigmented macule or papule with an irregular border and color variation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L33798.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The lesion grows in size and changes appearance over time (eg, weeks to months).&nbsp; In contrast, SKs are generally symmetric and homogenous in color with minimal change over time.&nbsp; SKs are also hyperkeratotic (giving them a rough texture), a feature not present in melanoma.</li><br><br><li> <strong>Viral warts</strong> present as hyperpigmented or skin-colored cauliflower-like papules or plaques, affecting body areas typically spared by SKs (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85022.png\" alt=\"image 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; For example, condyloma acuminata (genital wart) affects the genitalia, perineum, or perianal skin; verruca vulgaris (common wart) mostly affects the fingers, palms, and soles.&nbsp; Furthermore, thrombosed capillaries (not present in SK) are present in warts (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L62968.jpg\" alt=\"image 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><br><br><li> <strong>Basal cell carcinoma</strong> (BCC) classically presents as a pearly papule or nodule with a rolled border (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L95825.png\" alt=\"image 9\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 9</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and overlying telangiectasia, features not present in SK.&nbsp; BCCs are typically skin-colored or pink but can also be pigmented (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97932.png\" alt=\"image 10\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 10</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Unlike SKs, BCCs are not hyperkeratotic.</li><br><br><li> <strong>Common melanocytic nevi</strong> (moles) are caused by the benign proliferation of nevus cells, a type of melanocyte that forms clusters instead of single units evenly dispersed throughout the skin.&nbsp; They first appear during childhood or adolescence, not during older adulthood as with SKs.&nbsp; Presentation varies and ranges from brown macules (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19727.png\" alt=\"image 11\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 11</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) to skin-colored papules (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11624.png\" alt=\"image 12\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 12</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), depending on the location of nevus cell clusters (eg, epidermal/dermal junction, dermis).&nbsp; Unlike SKs, moles are not hyperkeratotic.</li><br><br><li> <strong>Actinic keratosis</strong> is a precursor of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.&nbsp; Despite the similarities in name, actinic keratosis is very different from SK.&nbsp; It typically presents as a rough, scaly papule with an erythematous base in sun-exposed areas (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L96398.png\" alt=\"image 13\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 13</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; When it is pigmented, it can resemble SK but typically lacks the \"stuck-on\" appearance of SKs.</li></ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>No therapy is required unless the lesions are causing discomfort (eg, catching on clothing, cosmetic concerns).&nbsp; Treatment options include removal by snip/shave excision, cryotherapy&nbsp; (eg, liquid nitrogen) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28922.png\" alt=\"image 14\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 14</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), and electrodessication.<p></p>\n<h1>Prognosis </h1><br><br><p>SKs are <strong>benign</strong> and do not progress to malignancy.&nbsp; They may remain stable or grow slowly over time (eg, years).&nbsp; Rarely, they may spontaneously resolve.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Seborrheic keratoses are classically brown hyperkeratotic papules or plaques with a warty, \"stuck-on\" appearance.&nbsp; They generally develop in older patients (age &gt;50) and most commonly affect the face, trunk, and extremities.&nbsp; They are benign and are often asymptomatic.&nbsp; Treatment (eg, shave excision, cryosurgery) is not necessary unless lesions become bothersome (eg, catching on clothing, cosmetically concerning).&nbsp; When numerous seborrheic keratoses develop abruptly (Leser-Trélat sign), an evaluation for internal malignancies (eg, lung, gastrointestinal) should be considered.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
