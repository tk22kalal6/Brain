The extent of injury is influenced by factors such as force, angle, and mechanism (eg, sharp vs blunt trauma).&nbsp; Wound healing follows a well-defined sequence of phases:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hemostasis</strong>:&nbsp; Vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and clot formation to control bleeding.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inflammation</strong>:&nbsp; Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, cytokine release, and removal of necrotic debris.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Proliferation</strong>:&nbsp; Fibroblast activity, granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and neovascularization.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Remodeling</strong>:&nbsp; Collagen cross-linking, extracellular matrix reorganization, and restoration of tensile strength over weeks to months.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>This process is described in greater detail in the article on wound healing.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Lacerations are associated with various intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors that influence both the likelihood of occurrence and the risk for complications.&nbsp; These include patient-related risk factors, environmental and occupational risk factors, wound characteristics, and mechanism of injury.</p>\n<h2>Patient-related risk factors</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Advanced age</strong>:&nbsp; Aging skin has reduced elasticity, dermal thinning, and diminished tensile strength, making it more prone to tearing.&nbsp; In addition, slower fibroblast proliferation and decreased collagen synthesis can impair healing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong>:&nbsp; Chronic hyperglycemia leads to microvascular disease, neuropathy, and impaired immune function, increasing the risk for both injury and infection.&nbsp; Diabetic patients may not feel minor trauma due to peripheral neuropathy, allowing wounds to worsen before detection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Immunosuppression</strong>:&nbsp; Certain conditions (eg, HIV/AIDS, malignancy) and immunosuppressive medications (eg, corticosteroids, chemotherapy) reduce the body's ability to fight infection and delay wound healing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Coagulation disorders/anticoagulant use</strong>:&nbsp; Patients who have clotting disorders (eg, hemophilia, thrombocytopenia) or who take anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants) have an increased risk for excessive bleeding and hematoma formation, which can complicate laceration repair.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Malnutrition</strong>:&nbsp; Deficiencies in protein, vitamin C, and zinc impair collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and immune function, leading to poor wound healing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Smoking</strong>:&nbsp; Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, reducing oxygen and nutrient delivery to tissues.&nbsp; Carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke also decreases oxygen availability, impairing fibroblast function and collagen deposition.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Heavy alcohol use</strong>:&nbsp; Chronic alcohol use contributes to malnutrition, immune dysfunction, and neuropathy, which can increase the risk for injury and delay healing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Environmental and occupational risk factors</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>High-risk occupations</strong>:&nbsp; Professions that involve manual labor, sharp tools, or machinery (eg, construction workers, butchers, factory workers) have an increased risk for traumatic lacerations.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Athletics</strong>:&nbsp; Sports-related trauma (eg, from falls, collisions, or equipment) commonly results in lacerations.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Violence</strong>:&nbsp; Stab wounds, cuts from sharp weapons, or blunt trauma leading to skin tearing are commonly seen in assault-related injuries.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wound-related risk factors</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Contamination</strong>:&nbsp; Lacerations occurring in environments with dirt, saliva, feces, or stagnant water are at increased risk for bacterial colonization and infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Foreign bodies</strong>:&nbsp; Retained objects (eg, glass, wood, metal) introduce infection risk and can impede healing.&nbsp; Organic materials (eg, wood, plant matter) are especially problematic due to their inflammatory and infectious potential.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Depth and location</strong>:&nbsp; Deep lacerations involving tendons, nerves, or blood vessels require specialized management to restore function and prevent complications.&nbsp; Lacerations over joints raise concern for open joint injuries.</li>\n\t<li><strong>High-tension areas</strong>:&nbsp; Wounds in areas of high movement (eg, over joints, on the hands) are prone to dehiscence and may require immobilization or layered closure for optimal healing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ischemia</strong>:&nbsp; Wounds in poorly perfused areas (eg, distal extremities, pressure points) are at higher risk for necrosis and delayed healing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mechanism of injury</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Blunt trauma</strong>:&nbsp; Irregular, jagged wounds with crush injury to surrounding tissue lead to increased tissue necrosis and higher infection rates.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sharp trauma</strong>:&nbsp; Cleaner, more linear lacerations often have less tissue destruction and improved healing potential.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bite wounds</strong>:&nbsp; Human and animal bites introduce polymicrobial flora requiring careful assessment and, often, prophylactic antibiotics.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Crush injuries</strong>:&nbsp; Significant tissue damage and compromised blood flow increase the risk for compartment syndrome and secondary infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Puncture wounds</strong>:&nbsp; These injuries are deeper than they are wide and often carry a high risk for infection due to poor oxygenation and difficulty with thorough irrigation.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Recognizing these risk factors helps predict complications and guides initial assessment and management.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with lacerations typically have:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hemorrhage</strong>:&nbsp; The degree of bleeding depends on vessel involvement; arterial injuries may produce pulsatile bleeding, whereas venous injuries tend to cause steady oozing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Disruption of skin integrity</strong>:&nbsp; Lacerations range from superficial epidermal defects to full-thickness wounds exposing underlying structures (eg, muscles, tendons, bones).&nbsp; Wound edges may appear clean, jagged, or avulsed, depending on the mechanism of injury.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Associated injuries</strong>:&nbsp; Deeper lacerations may involve muscle, tendons, nerves, or bone.&nbsp; Tendon involvement requires careful assessment of function; nerve injury may present with sensory or motor deficits in the affected distribution.&nbsp; Fractures or open joints can also occur and require careful assessment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Retained foreign bodies</strong>:&nbsp; Contaminated wounds or injuries involving glass, metal, or organic material may harbor retained foreign bodies.&nbsp; Clinical suspicion warrants thorough wound exploration, imaging (eg, x-ray, ultrasonography), and potential surgical removal to prevent infection and delayed healing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of laceration relies primarily on history and physical examination.&nbsp; Imaging may be required if a foreign body is suspected or the laceration involves structures other than the skin.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>History</strong>:&nbsp; Important elements include mechanism of injury, time elapsed since injury, presence of contamination, and tetanus immunization status.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Physical examination</strong>:&nbsp; The wound should be evaluated for location, depth, length, signs of infection, tendon involvement, possible underlying fracture or open joint involvement, and neurovascular integrity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Imaging</strong>:&nbsp; Imaging is typically not required but may be performed depending on the mechanism of injury and the risk for a retained foreign body.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>X-ray</strong>:&nbsp; First-line for detecting radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, metal, glass, gravel) and evaluating underlying fractures.&nbsp; However, it is limited in the detection of radiolucent materials (eg, wood, organic debris).&nbsp; X-ray can help assess for gas within soft tissues (which may indicate anaerobic infection or necrotizing fasciitis).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Ultrasonography</strong>:&nbsp; Preferred for detecting radiolucent foreign bodies (eg, wood, plastic, organic material) that may not be visible on x-ray.&nbsp; Ultrasonography is also useful in soft tissue assessment (eg, can identify abscess formation, hematomas, deep tissue disruption).&nbsp; It can also guide foreign body removal by providing real-time visualization during bedside procedures.&nbsp; Drawbacks to ultrasonography include that it is operator-dependent and may be less effective in the detection of small or deep foreign bodies.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>CT scan</strong>:&nbsp; Preferred for deep or complex soft tissue injuries, especially in cases of suspected vascular injury, open fractures, or deep foreign bodies that are not clearly visible on x-ray.&nbsp; CT scan can detect small gas pockets in soft tissue, aiding in the diagnosis of infections such as necrotizing fasciitis.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>MRI</strong>:&nbsp; Superior for evaluating tendon, ligament, or muscle involvement, particularly when assessing for deep space infections.&nbsp; However, MRI is more expensive and time-consuming than CT scan or x-ray and is therefore reserved for cases requiring detailed soft tissue assessment.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Seemingly minor lacerations can harbor deep structural injuries (eg, tendon lacerations, joint capsule violations), which, if missed, can lead to significant functional impairment.&nbsp; Careful examination and appropriate use of imaging can prevent overlooking these injuries.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><h2>Timing of repair:&nbsp; Primary and secondary closure</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Primary closure</strong>:&nbsp; The laceration is closed on presentation.&nbsp; This technique is typically appropriate in clean wounds with minimal tissue loss where the edges can be easily approximated with sutures, staples, or adhesive strips (eg, most surgical incisions, clean lacerations).&nbsp; Wounds on the trunk or proximal extremity may undergo primary closure up to 6-12 hours from the time of injury (maximum of 18 hr).&nbsp; Wounds on the head and neck may be closed up to 24 hours after injury.&nbsp; Contraindications to primary closure include the following:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Contaminated or infected wounds</strong> (eg, severe contamination, lacerations through infected skin, deep puncture wounds) where closure with sutures would increase the risk for infection.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Most human, dog, and cat bites</strong> (bites with cosmetic concerns [eg, on the face] may be exceptions).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Old lacerations</strong> (6-8 hr is appropriate for most extremity wounds; facial wounds can be repaired up to 24 hr).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Severe tissue loss</strong> (wound cannot be closed without creating excessive tension on the tissue).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Delayed primary closure</strong>:&nbsp; The laceration is initially left open and then closed surgically (eg, typically after 4-7 days) once the risk for infection has diminished.&nbsp; This approach allows for initial wound decontamination and monitoring for infection before definitive closure, balancing the need for wound closure with infection control.&nbsp; Indications for delayed primary closure include:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Heavily contaminated wounds</strong> (eg, farm injuries, bite wounds):&nbsp; Primary closure increases the risk for infection.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Crush injuries or wounds with significant devitalized tissue</strong>:&nbsp; Debridement may be necessary before closure.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Missed or late-presenting lacerations</strong> (eg, &gt;24 hr old):&nbsp; These are often outside the window of opportunity for primary closure.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Complex soft tissue injuries</strong>:&nbsp; Delayed primary closure is indicated when there is concern for swelling, ischemia, or tissue viability.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Secondary closure</strong> (healing by secondary intention):&nbsp; The laceration is left open without surgical closure, healing naturally from the bottom up through the formation of granulation tissue, contraction, and epithelialization.&nbsp; Secondary closure can be effective in the management of complex wounds but often results in a longer healing time and more prominent scarring compared to primary closure.&nbsp; Indications for secondary closure include:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Heavily contaminated or infected wounds</strong>:&nbsp; Primary closure of such wounds can trap bacteria, leading to abscess formation or systemic infection.&nbsp; Allowing the wound to heal by secondary intention facilitates drainage and reduces infection risk.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Significant tissue loss</strong>:&nbsp; When the wound edges cannot be approximated without undue tension due to extensive tissue damage, secondary closure allows the body to fill the defect naturally over time.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Animal or human bites</strong>:&nbsp; These wounds are at a higher risk for infection due to bacterial inoculation.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Abscess cavities</strong>:&nbsp; After drainage, leaving the cavity open to heal by secondary intention helps ensure that any residual infection is cleared and prevents premature closure over an unhealed space.​</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><span>Wound preparation</span></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hemostasis</strong>:&nbsp; Effective hemostasis should be obtained for proper wound evaluation and management.&nbsp; This may be achieved by applying direct pressure (eg, with a gauze pad for 10-15 min); inducing vasoconstriction with lidocaine and epinephrine (avoided in the digits and nose due to the risk for ischemic necrosis); administering topic hemostatic agents such as gelatin sponges (avoided in infected wounds); and, if bleeding persists, tourniquets (for extremity wounds) or, in severe cases with bleeding from arterial vessels, arterial ligation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cleansing</strong>:&nbsp; Wounds should be thoroughly cleansed.&nbsp; Sterile saline is commonly used, but studies show no significant difference in infection rates between saline and tap water; antiseptic additives are generally unnecessary.&nbsp; Low-pressure irrigation (eg, using a standard syringe or bulb syringe) is typically sufficient for most wounds.&nbsp; Higher-pressure methods (eg, pulse sprayer) in the operating room may be indicated for heavily contaminated wounds.&nbsp; The volume of irrigation is dependent on the location and level of the wound contamination.&nbsp; Deep, contaminated wounds on extremities require more irrigation than small, clean wounds on the face.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Debridement</strong>:&nbsp; Devitalized, contaminated, or necrotic tissue should be removed to reduce infection risk and promote optimal healing.&nbsp; Indications for debridement include the following:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Necrotic or devitalized tissue that impairs healing and increases infection risk.</li>\n\t\t<li>Heavily contaminated wounds (eg, soil, feces) that require removal of foreign matter.</li>\n\t\t<li>Crush injuries with compromised tissue viability.</li>\n\t\t<li>Infected wounds where debridement can help control bacterial load.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Proper debridement optimizes healing by converting contaminated wounds into clean, viable tissue, improving the success of primary or delayed closure.&nbsp; Care must be taken to avoid excessive removal of healthy tissue.</p>\n<h2>Foreign body removal</h2><br><br><p>Foreign bodies are a common concern in lacerations and can increase the risk for infection, delayed healing, and chronic irritation.&nbsp; Indications for removal include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Foreign bodies that are superficially located, accessible, or causing symptoms.</li>\n\t<li>Organic materials (eg, wood, plant matter).</li>\n\t<li>Metallic and glass fragments that are large, sharp, or mobile or that are in a location where they could result in complications.</li>\n\t<li>Foreign bodies that impede function cause pain or are in proximity to vital structures (eg, nerves, vessels, joints).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Foreign bodies may be left in place in the following circumstances:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The foreign body is deeply embedded and asymptomatic and is made of inert materials (eg, small metallic fragments).&nbsp; Small inert foreign bodies (eg, pieces of glass, metal) that are asymptomatic and do not cause functional impairment may be left in place, especially if removal poses a higher risk for complications or requires extensive surgical intervention.</li>\n\t<li>The foreign body is located in a surgically challenging location (eg, near major nerves or blood vessels, within joint spaces).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Aggressive attempts at foreign body removal can cause additional tissue damage; however, retained foreign bodies may lead to complications such as infection or foreign body reactions.&nbsp; Referral to a surgical specialist should be considered if removal poses a risk.&nbsp; Patients should always be informed if a foreign body is known to be retained or if there is a high risk for a missed foreign body.</p>\n<h2>Anesthesia techniques</h2><br><br><p>The most common anesthesia techniques for wound repair are local infiltration and regional nerve blocks:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Local infiltration</strong>:&nbsp; Anesthetic (eg, lidocaine 1% or 2%) is injected directly around a wound to provide rapid, localized pain control.&nbsp; Epinephrine can be added to achieve vasoconstriction and a prolonged effect.&nbsp; It is the ideal method for small, simple lacerations.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Regional nerve blocks</strong>:&nbsp; Nerve blocks target specific nerves to anesthetize a larger area with less distortion.&nbsp; It is preferred for large areas, sensitive regions where local infiltration may cause tissue swelling, and obscure landmarks (eg, vermilion border of the lip).&nbsp; The following nerve blocks are commonly used for lacerations:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Face</strong>:&nbsp; Infraorbital, mental, and supraorbital nerve blocks for upper lip, lower lip, and forehead lacerations, respectively.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Tongue</strong>:&nbsp; Inferior alveolar nerve block.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Finger and toes</strong>:&nbsp; Digital nerve blocks.&nbsp; Epinephrine should not be used in digital blocks to avoid the risk for ischemia to the digit (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73451.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Auricle</strong>:&nbsp; Auricular field block, which blocks the great auricular, lesser occipital, auriculotemporal, and vagus nerve branches.&nbsp; This can be used for ear lacerations to prevent anatomic distortion (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26019.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Sole</strong>:&nbsp; Tibial nerve block.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>If local or regional anesthetic is inadequate, minimal sedation is often an effective adjunctive technique.&nbsp; Moderate sedation may be necessary for certain cases (eg, young children with complex lacerations).</p>\n<h1>Methods of wound closure</h1><br><br><p>The selection of suture material, placement (dermal vs percutaneous), and technique depends on factors such as the wound's location, tensile strength, and cosmetic considerations.</p>\n<h2>Suture material</h2><br><br><p><strong>Nonabsorbable sutures (eg, nylon, polypropylene)</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Indications</strong>:&nbsp; Skin closure, particularly in areas requiring high tensile strength and minimal tissue reactivity (eg, face, scalp, extremities).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Advantages/disadvantages</strong>:&nbsp; Provide excellent tensile strength and low tissue reactivity but must be removed after healing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Common sizes</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Face</strong>:&nbsp; 6-0 or 5-0 (thinner suture material) for better cosmetic outcomes.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Scalp, trunk, extremities</strong>:&nbsp; 4-0 or 3-0 (thicker suture material) for durability and wound stability.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Absorbable sutures (eg, Vicryl, chromic gut, Monocryl)</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Indications</strong>:&nbsp; Deep wound closure, mucosal lacerations (eg, intraoral wounds), and areas where suture removal is difficult.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Advantages/disadvantages</strong>:&nbsp; Do not require removal but have reduced strength over time and cause an increased inflammatory response.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Common sizes</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Oral mucosa, tongue</strong>:&nbsp; 5-0 or 4-0 chromic gut or Vicryl.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Deep wounds or high-tension areas</strong>:&nbsp; 4-0 or 3-0 absorbable sutures for layered closure.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Staples</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Indications</strong>:&nbsp; Large, linear lacerations on the scalp, trunk, or proximal extremities where efficiency is a priority and cosmetic concerns are minimal.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Advantages/disadvantages</strong>:&nbsp; Offer rapid wound closure, high tensile strength, and reduced infection risk.&nbsp; However, staples can cause more discomfort during removal, leave visible scarring, and are unsuitable for irregular or delicate areas such as the face or hands.&nbsp; A staple remover is required to remove them.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Tissue adhesives (eg, Dermabond)</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Indications</strong>:&nbsp; Small, superficial wounds under low tension, particularly on the face or areas with minimal movement.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Advantages/disadvantages</strong>:&nbsp; Provide quick, painless closure with acceptable cosmetic outcomes, making them ideal for small, superficial wounds under low tension.&nbsp; Tissue adhesives are unsuitable for high-tension areas, moist regions (eg, the mouth), or infected wounds.&nbsp; Dehiscence may result if not properly applied.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Suture location</h2><br><br><p>The choice between dermal and percutaneous sutures is determined by the depth of the wound and the goal of supporting deeper tissue versus approximating the skin surface.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Dermal sutures</strong>:&nbsp; These are placed in the dermis and are intended to hold the deeper tissues together.&nbsp; They are important for wounds that have deep or significant tissue damage and help provide structural integrity, especially when deeper layers need to be approximated to reduce tension on the skin surface.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Percutaneous sutures</strong>:&nbsp; These are placed through the epidermis and superficial dermis and are designed primarily to hold the outer layers of skin together.&nbsp; They are used when there is no significant damage to deeper tissues and when the goal is primarily to approximate the skin edges.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Some wounds require both dermal and percutaneous sutures.</p>\n<h2>Suture technique</h2><br><br><p>The selection of suture technique is determined by the wound's depth, tension, and location, as well as cosmetic considerations.&nbsp; The following suture techniques are commonly used in laceration repair:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Simple interrupted suture</strong>:&nbsp; Involves the placement of individual sutures across the wound and the tying of each one separately.&nbsp; This is the most commonly used method, offering strong wound approximation and easy tension adjustment.&nbsp; Indicated for straightforward, linear lacerations.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Continuous suture</strong>:&nbsp; A single continuous stitch runs along the wound, offering faster closure with less scarring than interrupted sutures.&nbsp; Indicated for simple, straight lacerations or areas with low tension.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vertical mattress suture</strong>:&nbsp; Sutures are placed deep into the dermis to approximate tissue layers and reduce tension.&nbsp; Indicated for wounds over high-tension areas (eg, joints) or when deeper tissue support is required.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Horizontal mattress suture</strong>:&nbsp; Similar to the vertical mattress, this suture is placed horizontally and is useful for moderate tension or when eversion of wound edges is needed.&nbsp; Indicated for wounds requiring stability or edge eversion.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Subcuticular suture</strong>:&nbsp; Sutures are placed just beneath the surface of the skin.&nbsp; This technique provides excellent cosmetic outcomes with minimal visible scarring.&nbsp; Indicated for facial lacerations or other areas requiring minimal scarring.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Each technique has its advantages and is chosen based on the clinical scenario, the location of the wound, and the desired cosmetic result.</p>\n<h2>Indications for surgical referral</h2><br><br><p>Consultation with a plastic surgeon or other surgical specialist is warranted in the following cases:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Large or complex lacerations</strong>:&nbsp; Wounds that require prolonged repair, grafting, or advanced reconstructive techniques.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Severe contamination</strong>:&nbsp; Extensive contamination that cannot be adequately managed with bedside irrigation and local anesthesia.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neurovascular compromise</strong>:&nbsp; Lacerations that involve major nerves or vessels requiring specialized repair.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Associated fractures, amputations, or joint involvement</strong>:&nbsp; Open fractures, amputations, or lacerations penetrating joint capsules (eg, through the knee joint).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Certain specialized anatomic sites require expertise for optimal cosmetic and functional outcomes.&nbsp; These sites include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Nasal cartilage, ala, or columella</strong>:&nbsp; The nasal cartilage supports the nasal framework; improper repair can cause collapse, asymmetry, or airway obstruction.&nbsp; The ala maintains external nasal valve patency, with damage risking nostril narrowing and airflow compromise.&nbsp; The columella shapes the nasal tip; poor healing may lead to notching, retraction, or deformity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Eyelid</strong>:&nbsp; Lacerations involving the eyelid margin, tarsal plate, lacrimal duct, or exposed orbital fat can result in functional impairment (eg, disrupted eyelid integrity, tear drainage abnormalities,&nbsp; potential vision complications).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Auricle</strong>:&nbsp; Lacerations involving cartilage can result in structural deformity, necrosis, and compromised wound healing due to the auricle's limited blood supply.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Any area with high cosmetic or functional concern</strong>:&nbsp; Lacerations in highly visible areas or in patients with strong cosmetic concerns may warrant referral to a surgical specialist to optimize cosmetic and/or functional outcomes.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>If provider experience or feasibility of long-term follow-up is limited, referral to a surgical specialist may be appropriate to ensure optimal healing.</p>\n<h1>Tetanus prophylaxis</h1><br><br><p>Tetanus prophylaxis is an essential component of wound management.&nbsp; Prophylaxis involves the administration of either a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine or tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG), depending on the patient's vaccination history and the nature of the wound.</p>\n<h2>Patients with a history of at least 3 doses of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Clean, minor wound:&nbsp; No tetanus prophylaxis is required if the last dose was administered within the past 10 years.&nbsp; Otherwise, a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine should be administered.</li>\n\t<li>Dirty/severely contaminated wound:&nbsp;

Typically, an infraorbital nerve block is performed for an upper lip laceration; a mental nerve block is performed for a lower lip laceration.</li>\n\t<li>The first stitch should always be placed at the vermilion border because laceration repair begun elsewhere can result in border misalignment and/or the need to redo the repair.</li>\n\t<li>Because the mouth is an area of motion and tension (eg, opening the mouth wide to eat), multilayer closure is performed.&nbsp; The deeper layer of buried intradermal sutures decreases tension on the superficial layer of sutures, thereby decreasing the risk of dehiscence or scar widening.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Intraoral lacerations</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Most smaller, nongaping lacerations may heal without suturing.</li>\n\t<li>Larger (eg, &gt;1-2 cm) or gaping wounds benefit from closure with absorbable sutures.</li>\n\t<li>Closure with 4-0 chromic gut or Vicryl sutures minimizes infection risk and avoids the need for suture removal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Extremity lacerations</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Lacerations over joints raise concern for open joint involvement, requiring further evaluation (eg, saline load test or joint aspiration for suspected penetration).</li>\n\t<li>High-risk areas include the hands, feet, and knees, where deeper structures such as tendons, ligaments, and neurovascular bundles may be compromised.</li>\n\t<li>Prompt closure within a shorter time frame is recommended due to the extremities' lower vascular supply and higher infection risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Suture/staple removal</h2><br><br><p>The timing of suture and staple removal depends on the location and nature of the wound.&nbsp; For facial wounds, sutures are typically removed in 4 or 5 days, whereas sutures in other areas are usually removed in 7-10 days.&nbsp; Staples are generally removed within 10-14 days.&nbsp; The removal technique involves gently pulling the suture or staple out using forceps or a staple remover, being careful not to disrupt the wound edges.&nbsp; For sutures, every other stitch should be removed first to assess wound integrity before fully removing all of them (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/116667.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>Acute lacerations, although often treatable with proper wound care, can lead to a variety of complications that may impair healing, increase the risk of infection, and result in functional or cosmetic issues.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Infection</strong>:&nbsp; Infection is one of the most common complications of lacerations.&nbsp; Factors that increase the risk include contamination from animal bites, soil, or other environmental factors; immunocompromised states; delayed wound closure; or improper care.&nbsp; If untreated, infections can lead to cellulitis, abscess formation, or more severe complications such as necrotizing fasciitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dehiscence</strong>:&nbsp; The partial or complete separation of wound edges after closure typically occurs when the wound is under tension or the healing process is compromised.&nbsp; Lacerations over joints or areas of high tension are particularly prone to separation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Scarring</strong>:&nbsp; Excessive or hypertrophic scarring can lead to cosmetic or functional issues.&nbsp; Keloid and hypertrophic scars can form if there is excessive collagen deposition during wound healing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nerve injury</strong>:&nbsp; Sensory loss, numbness, or loss of feeling may occur in the area supplied by the affected nerve.&nbsp; Motor dysfunction can also occur in muscles controlled by the injured nerve.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vascular injury</strong>:&nbsp; Lacerations that damage blood vessels can lead to significant bleeding, hematoma formation, or compromised perfusion to the tissue.&nbsp; If blood flow is disrupted, ischemia can occur, leading to tissue necrosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tendon injury</strong>:&nbsp; Tendon injury can impair movement and function and typically requires surgical intervention for proper repair and rehabilitation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Foreign bodies</strong>:&nbsp; Retained foreign bodies often complicate wound healing by introducing bacteria, causing chronic inflammation, or preventing proper tissue healing.&nbsp; Delayed or inadequate removal of foreign objects can lead to persistent infection, inflammation, and fibrosis, complicating the wound-healing process.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Open joint injury</strong>:&nbsp; These injuries occur when a laceration penetrates the joint capsule, exposing the synovial space to the external environment, which significantly increases the risk for infection and septic arthritis.&nbsp; Saline load testing can help confirm joint capsule violation via the injection of sterile fluid into the joint and assessment of extravasation from the wound.&nbsp; A CT scan of the knee can be used to diagnose intraarticular air, which indicates that the joint capsule has likely been violated.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tetanus</strong>:&nbsp; This potentially fatal infection, caused by the entry of <em>Clostridium tetani</em> through open wounds, is characterized by muscle spasms, often starting in the jaw (lockjaw).&nbsp; Spasms are followed by progressive stiffness in the neck, back, and extremities.&nbsp; The risk is higher in wounds contaminated with soil, animal feces, or other sources of the bacteria.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Effective management of these complications is essential for optimizing recovery and minimizing long-term consequences.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for lacerations depends largely on factors such as wound size, depth, and location and the presence of complications (eg, infection, nerve damage).&nbsp; Most uncomplicated lacerations heal well with appropriate treatment (eg, proper wound cleaning, timely closure).&nbsp; The cosmetic outcome is generally favorable if the wound is well-closed, especially in low-tension areas.&nbsp; However, wounds in high-tension areas or over joints or those involving vital structures may have a higher risk for poor cosmetic outcomes, dehiscence, or functional impairments.&nbsp; The presence of comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression, can further complicate healing, potentially extending the recovery period.&nbsp; Early intervention, appropriate wound care, and avoidance of complications typically lead to favorable outcomes.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Effective laceration repair requires accurate wound assessment, appropriate cleansing, and meticulous closure techniques.&nbsp; Special considerations apply to intraoral, tongue, and scalp lacerations.&nbsp; Imaging may be necessary for foreign body detection and associated fractures.&nbsp; Timely intervention reduces complications and enhances cosmetic outcomes.</p>\n\n            "
