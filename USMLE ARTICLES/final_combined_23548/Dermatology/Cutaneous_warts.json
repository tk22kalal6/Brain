Spontaneous resolution can occur, but topical treatment (eg, salicylic acid, cryotherapy) is often administered.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Cutaneous warts are caused by <strong>human papillomavirus</strong> (HPV), which has many subtypes that have a tendency to infect specific areas of the body and cause distinct disease (eg, HPV 16 and 18 in cervical cancer, HPV 6 and 11 in anogenital warts).&nbsp; In the case of cutaneous warts, which are located anywhere other than the anogenital area, subtypes 1, 2, and 4 are most commonly implicated.</p><br><br><p>HPV is usually <strong>transmitted via direct contact</strong>, although fomite transmission may occur.&nbsp; The virus enters through small cuts or abrasions and infects basal keratinocytes.&nbsp; The resulting keratinocyte proliferation leads to the characteristic finding of hyperkeratotic papules.&nbsp; Lesions can develop weeks to months after initial infection, and malignant transformation is rare.</p><br><br><p>Histopathologic findings include (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L30019.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis) with eosinophilic inclusions and keratohyaline granules.</li>\n\t<li>Thickened stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis).</li>\n\t<li>Dermal papillae enlargement (<strong>papillomatosis</strong>).</li>\n\t<li>Perinuclear cytoplasmic vacuolization (<strong>koilocytosis</strong>) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L6084.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Epidemiology</h1><br><br><p>Infection is most prevalent in children, adolescents, and young adults.&nbsp; More extensive disease occurs in patients with compromised skin barriers (eg, atopic dermatitis) and cellular immunity (eg, HIV).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Cutaneous warts manifest as <strong>firm, flesh-colored papules</strong> that are rough and hyperkeratotic, often with a <strong>cauliflower-like appearance</strong> (ie, verrucous) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L101456.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Cutaneous warts can occur anywhere on the body, except for the anogenital area since warts in this area are caused by different HPV strains.<p></p><br><br><p>Warts on the soles of the feet are referred to as <strong>plantar warts</strong>, which are usually on pressure points (eg, heel, ball of the foot), whereas those located elsewhere on the body (often hands, fingers, and nailfolds) are called common warts (verrucae vulgaris).&nbsp; Warts affecting the palms and soles disrupt the normal skin striae, and shaving of the hyperkeratotic area frequently reveals pinpoint bleeding from thrombosed capillaries (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L93794.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Although most cutaneous warts manifest as verrucous lesions, a less common subtype is <strong>flat warts</strong>, which are small (1-3 mm), smooth, flesh-colored papules that are most commonly clustered on the face or hands (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19845.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; <strong>Filiform warts</strong> are also an uncommon subtype and present as small, narrow, pedunculated lesions (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12963.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Callus</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11327.png\" alt=\"image 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

After paring superficial hyperkeratotic debris, dermatoscopy evaluation revealing small black dots representing thrombosed capillaries supports the diagnosis.</p><br><br><p>Biopsy is reserved for atypical or refractory cases.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis and management</h1><br><br><p>Cutaneous warts may resolve spontaneously within 1-2 years in children due to immune clearance; resolution usually takes longer in adults.&nbsp; Treatment is therefore often initiated due to cosmesis, discomfort, or persistence as well as for those who are immunosuppressed.</p><br><br><p>First-line treatment of cutaneous warts includes the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Salicylic acid</strong>:&nbsp; Exfoliates and stimulates local immune response against HPV.&nbsp; The initial response to treatment may take 2-3 weeks, and complete resolution of the wart may take several months.&nbsp; Increased effectiveness can be achieved by paring (eg, via pumice stone or nail file) hyperkeratotic lesions prior to medication application and/or applying duct tape over salicylic acid-containing treatment pads.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cryotherapy</strong> (eg, liquid nitrogen):&nbsp; Causes cell damage and leads to an inflammatory response.&nbsp; Treatment can be painful, and multiple sessions are often required, so this regimen is generally avoided in young children.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Alternative therapies (eg, canthardin, fluorouracil, imiquimod) can be considered for refractory warts.</p><br><br><p>Despite treatment, <strong>recurrence is common</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Prevention is primarily achieved by reducing the risk of transmission, such as using protective footwear in public showers.&nbsp; Limiting avoidable abrasions (eg, due to nail biting) and fomite exposure (eg, others' nail files or towels) can also reduce risk.</p><br><br><p>Immunization with the HPV vaccine does not reduce risk of cutaneous warts since the strains contained in the vaccine are primarily involved in the development of anogenital warts/cancers as well as head and neck cancers.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Cutaneous warts (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/99457.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are caused by human papillomavirus and typically manifest with verrucous papules on the skin, palms, or soles.&nbsp;
