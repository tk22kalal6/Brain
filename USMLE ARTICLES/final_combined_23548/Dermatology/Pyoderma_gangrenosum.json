The etiology of PG is not fully understood, but it is commonly associated with systemic disease, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and malignancies (eg, solid organ, hematologic).</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The exact pathogenesis of PG remains unclear, although it is believed to result from proinflammatory immune dysregulation (eg, increased expression of certain interleukins) and genetic susceptibilities (eg, inflammasome mutations).</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The risk for PG is higher in patients with the following conditions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis)</li>\n\t<li>Inflammatory arthritis (eg, RA)</li>\n\t<li>Malignancy (solid organ or hematologic)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition, PG occurs at higher rates in young/middle-aged women.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>PG starts as an inflammatory papule, pustule, bulla, or nodule (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108514.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) that rapidly progresses to form an expanding ulcer with a purulent base and an irregular, violaceous border (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L95631.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; PG can present with a single lesion or multiple lesions, usually on the trunk or lower extremities.&nbsp; Nearly 30% of cases are triggered by local trauma (pathergy).&nbsp; Patients often report pain that seems out of proportion to the lesion.<p></p><br><br><p>Most patients with PG have an associated systemic disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis (eg, RA), or a malignancy (hematologic or solid organ).</p>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Histologic features of PG are nonspecific; nevertheless, biopsy of the lesion is recommended to rule out other conditions that may present similarly (see Differential Diagnosis section).&nbsp; Features that PG may exhibit include perifollicular inflammation, intradermal abscess, and epidermal and dermal necrosis.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis and evaluation</h1><br><br><p>PG is a clinical diagnosis because biopsy findings are nonspecific, and no other definitive diagnostic testing exists.&nbsp; A panel of tests should be performed when PG is suspected to exclude other similar conditions and to screen for systemic diseases that often accompany PG.&nbsp; Therefore, the following tests are recommended in the evaluation process:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Incisional lesion biopsy for histological examination and microbial stains/cultures</li>\n\t<li>Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies and antiphospholipid screen to check for small vessel vasculitis and antiphospholipid syndrome as causes of cutaneous ulceration</li>\n\t<li>Colonoscopy to evaluate for associated inflammatory bowel disease</li>\n\t<li>Complete blood count and serum immunofixation electrophoresis to evaluate for associated hematologic malignancies/disorders</li>\n\t<li>Antinuclear antibody titer and rheumatoid factor to check for associated inflammatory arthritis</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Venous insufficiency ulcers:</strong>&nbsp; typically found at the medial malleoli.&nbsp; Unlike PG, these ulcers are mildly painful and usually accompanied by chronic stasis changes (eg, brawny discoloration, dermal atrophy, varicose veins) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L115676.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Basal cell carcinoma:</strong>&nbsp; can ulcerate in advanced disease but typically presents initially as a painless, slowly growing, pearly papule with telangiectasias and a rolled border in a sun-exposed area (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L95825.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Histologic examination reveals nests of basaloid cells (resembling the stratum basale) with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, which is not present in PG.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma:</strong>&nbsp; starts as a scaly papule in a sun-exposed area.&nbsp; As the lesion enlarges, ulceration may occur (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16712.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Histologic examination reveals nests of dysplastic keratinocytes, not seen in PG.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Erythema nodosum:</strong>&nbsp; is an acute panniculitis that presents with tender, erythematous nodules/plaques on the lower extremities (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L104171.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Like PG, erythema nodosum is also associated with systemic disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, internal or hematologic malignancies); however, the lesions do not ulcerate but instead resolve without scarring after 2-8 weeks.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome:</strong>&nbsp; is an autoimmune disorder characterized by systemic hypercoagulability (eg, deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke).&nbsp; Thrombosis of small cutaneous vessels causes painful cutaneous ulcerations, necrosis, and infarction (eg, digital gangrene).&nbsp; Antiphospholipid screen (recommended in the evaluation of suspected PG) is positive.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Small vessel vasculitis</strong> (eg, microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis):&nbsp; can affect the skin and typically presents with purpura in the lower extremities (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L47822.png\" alt=\"image 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Scattered bullae and small ulcers may form, but large, isolated ulcers and pathergy are not typical and are more suggestive of PG.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ecthyma gangrenosum:</strong>&nbsp; is a skin infection most frequently due to <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>.&nbsp; It presents with hemorrhagic pustules with surrounding erythema that evolve into necrotic ulcers and occurs most commonly in the setting of profound neutropenia and bacteremia (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L8631.png\" alt=\"image 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Unlike in PG, patients typically have signs of systemic infection (eg, fever), and pain is significantly less prominent.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Necrobiosis lipoidica:</strong>&nbsp; presents with asymptomatic, yellow or pink-brown plaques usually in the pretibial areas of patients with diabetes mellitus (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28749.png\" alt=\"image 9\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 9</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Over time, the plaques become atrophic, and some may ulcerate.&nbsp; Histologic examination reveals granulomatous dermatitis, a feature not seen in PG.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sporotrichosis:</strong>&nbsp; is a fungal skin infection acquired through breaks in the skin, typically from rose bushes or other plant materials.&nbsp; It presents as a small papule or nodule (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L86228.png\" alt=\"image 10\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 10</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) at the inoculation site (usually hands or arms), which then may enlarge, ulcerate, and lead to additional lesions along draining lymphatics, a feature not seen in PG.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fixed drug eruptions:</strong>&nbsp; typically present as sharply demarcated, red-brown round/oval patches or plaques that are pruritic or mildly painful (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28693.png\" alt=\"image 11\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 11</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The lesions usually recur in the same location each time an offending drug (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tetracyclines) is taken.&nbsp; Unlike PG, the lesions typically do not ulcerate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><h2>Pharmacological therapy</h2><br><br><p>Topical and systemic therapies are available, with the choice dependent on the severity/extent of the disease.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Limited disease (lesions &lt;3 cm, one or few in number) is treated with high-potency topical corticosteroid therapy (eg, betamethasone, clobetasol, fluocinonide) until the lesion heals.</li>\n\t<li>In contrast, extensive disease requires systemic corticosteroid therapy (eg, prednisone) because application of topical therapy becomes impractical.&nbsp; Cyclosporin can be used when systemic corticosteroid therapy is contraindicated (eg, diabetes mellitus).&nbsp; Severe cases often require the addition of another immunosuppressive therapy, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor (eg, infliximab, adalimumab) or mycophenolate mofetil (which blocks DNA synthesis of T/B lymphocytes).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wound care</h2><br><br><p>Wound care measures to optimize healing include cleansing the wound daily with a mild antiseptic, using nonadherent dressings that create a moist environment (to promote wound healing), and using a barrier cream (eg, petrolatum, zinc oxide) to protect the skin around the ulcer edges.</p><br><br><p>In addition, trauma to and around the wound should be avoided because it can delay healing or induce new PG lesions (pathergy).&nbsp; For the same reason, surgical debridement of the wound generally should be avoided.</p>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Secondary bacterial infection (which presents with worsening pain, malodorous discharge, warmth, and fever)</li>\n\t<li>Scarring (which can be extensive, especially after large ulcers heal)</li>\n\t<li>Disability (caused by chronic pain and impaired mobility when wounds are large or extensive)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the disease, the presence of underlying conditions, and the timeliness of treatment.&nbsp; With treatment, 50% of patients achieve wound healing within a year.&nbsp; However, lesions can recur, even after long periods of remission.</p><br><br><p>PG may increase the risk for death, likely due to a combination of treatment complications (eg, chronic immunosuppression), associated underlying disorders (eg, malignancy), and health consequences of chronic inflammation.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, inflammatory skin disorder that is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis, and malignancies (hematologic and solid organ).&nbsp; Pyoderma gangrenosum starts as an inflammatory papule, pustule, vesicle, or nodule that rapidly progresses to form an expanding ulcer with a purulent base and an irregular, violaceous border.&nbsp; The diagnosis is made clinically after other causes have been ruled out by lesion biopsy and laboratory evaluation.&nbsp; Management of local lesions includes topical high-potency corticosteroid therapy.&nbsp; Oral corticosteroid therapy, with or without additional immunosuppressive therapy (eg, tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor therapy), is recommended for severe, extensive disease.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
