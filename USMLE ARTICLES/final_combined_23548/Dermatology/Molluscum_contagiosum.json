Healthy children are most commonly affected, but molluscum contagiosum can also occur in adults, especially those who are immunocompromised or sexually active.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p> Molluscum contagiosum is a common, benign skin infection caused by a <strong>poxvirus</strong>.&nbsp; Transmission occurs through skin-to-skin contact or via contaminated fomites (eg, towels), with subsequent autoinoculation to additional sites.&nbsp; The pathophysiology involves viral infection of epidermal cells, with subsequent replication within the cytoplasm.&nbsp; This results in the enlargement of basal keratinocytes and the formation of characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies.</p><br><br><p> Risk factors include young age (1-10), participation in contact sports, sexual activity, and cellular immunodeficiency (eg, HIV infection).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p> The lesions of molluscum contagiosum appear as firm, <strong>dome-shaped, flesh-colored papules</strong> with <strong>central umbilication</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L6670.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Papules are small (2-5 mm in diameter), shiny, and usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic with mild surrounding inflammation.&nbsp; Dermoscopy may reveal a white/yellow amorphous center.<p></p><br><br><p> Distribution of the lesions is dependent on age and immune status, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Children:&nbsp; extremities, trunk, face (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99905.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
