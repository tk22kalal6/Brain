The disease occurs globally and can lead to complications in up to 30% of patients.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The measles virus is an enveloped, nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family.</p><br><br><p>Measles is spread by very small infectious respiratory particles (&lt;5 µm), in contrast to the larger respiratory particles (≥5 µm) associated with other infections (eg, group A <em>Streptococcus</em>).&nbsp; Due to their miniscule particle size, measles can remain suspended in the air for up to 2 hours.&nbsp; As a result, patients can contract measles by entering a room long after an infected person has already exited (eg, waiting room, day care center).</p><br><br><p>Measles typically infects the host via inhalation of the virus but can also enter through direct contact with a mucosal surface (eg, mouth, eyes).&nbsp; Within the respiratory tract, it invades resident immune cells (eg, dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages) and respiratory epithelial cells, allowing for measles to be easily spread when the patient coughs.</p><br><br><p>As the infection continues, the measles virus spreads to regional lymphatic tissue and disseminates systemically (contributing to fever).&nbsp; During the illness, there appears to be an increase in vitamin A utilization (likely related to vitamin A's role in humoral and cellular immune processes), resulting in a decrease in vitamin A stores.&nbsp; As a result, patients with pre-existing vitamin A deficiency are more likely to have complications (eg, delayed recovery) from the illness.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Patients with the greatest risk for measles are those lacking prior immunity (eg, unvaccinated infants) with exposure risk (eg, travel to a measles-endemic area).&nbsp; Measles is highly contagious, with an attack rate of 90% to susceptible patients.&nbsp; Although patients lacking measles immunity are the most susceptible to infection, those with pre-existing immunity (eg, prior vaccination) exposed to measles virus may still develop an attenuated infection with mild symptoms.&nbsp; However, these individuals are not highly contagious.</p><br><br><p>Complications from measles (eg, pneumonia, diarrhea, encephalitis) may occur in up to 30% of patients.&nbsp; Risk factors for developing complications include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Age (eg, children age &lt;5, adults age &gt;20)</li>\n\t<li>Pregnancy (increased risk to both fetus and mother)</li>\n\t<li>Defects in cell-mediated immunity (eg, AIDS, T-cell suppressive medications)</li>\n\t<li>Poor nutritional status (eg, baseline vitamin A deficiency)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Measles infection is divided into several clinical stages (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108833.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Incubation</strong>:&nbsp;

About 2-4 days after the onset of the prodrome, a characteristic maculopapular rash appears (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10904.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), starting from the face and gradually spreading to the trunk and centrifugally to the extremities.&nbsp; The rash is initially erythematous and blanching but may later coalesce and appear nonblanching, hemorrhagic, or dark brown (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10903.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Recovery</strong>:&nbsp; Fever typically subsides by the fourth day, and the rash typically lasts about 1 week.&nbsp; The cough may persist for a few weeks.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with measles are most contagious during the end of the incubation period through the exanthem stage (usually about 5 days before and after onset of the rash).</p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Clinical suspicion of measles is often based on characteristic symptoms and rash appearance, especially in regions with outbreaks.&nbsp; The diagnosis can be confirmed via laboratory testing, which may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Positive serologic test for measles\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>IgM (detectable 3 days after onset of rash)</li>\n\t\t<li>≥4-fold rise in IgG between acute and convalescent titers (drawn 10-14 days apart)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Isolation of measles virus in culture</li>\n\t<li>Detection of viral RNA by PCR (present for about 3 days after rash onset)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other laboratory findings observed during a measles infection may include leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, but these are nonspecific.&nbsp; Biopsy is rarely performed, but shows multinucleated giant cells that contain both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (which are a hallmark feature).&nbsp; Imaging studies are not routinely required for the diagnosis of measles unless complications (eg, pneumonia) are suspected.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Patients with known or suspected measles should be isolated and placed on airborne precautions (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31441.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Treatment for measles generally involves supportive care (eg, fluids, antipyretics).&nbsp; However, increased risk of morbidity (eg, prolonged illness, hospitalization, blindness) and mortality are associated with concomitant vitamin A deficiency (particularly in children age &lt;5).&nbsp; Because measles can also precipitate vitamin A deficiency, <strong>vitamin A administration</strong> is recommended for children with measles, particularly those with severe disease (eg, requiring hospitalization).</p><br><br><p>In certain high-risk patients (eg, immunosuppression, those requiring ventilatory support), ribavirin may also be considered.</p>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>Many cell types (eg, endothelial, epithelial) within multiple organ systems can be affected in measles.&nbsp; This causes various clinical findings and potential complications in patients at risk (eg, young children, pregnancy, immunosuppression):</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Gastrointestinal:&nbsp;

Myocarditis, pericarditis</li>\n\t<li>Ocular:&nbsp; Keratitis</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Neurologic complications are the most concerning in measles and include the following (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108834.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Encephalitis</strong>:&nbsp; Occurs within a few days of the rash and presents with fever, seizures, focal neurologic deficits (eg, weakness), and irritability.&nbsp; It is fatal in up to 15% of patients, and those who survive may have neurodevelopmental complications.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis</strong> (ADEM):&nbsp; Thought to be an autoimmune response following the infection and occurs during the recovery period, typically within 2 weeks of the exanthem.&nbsp; Patients may have fever, altered mental status, and signs of myelitis (eg, extremity weakness, ataxia).&nbsp; Mortality is up to 20%.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis</strong> (SSPE):&nbsp; A rare but fatal condition that develops 7-10 years following the original infection.&nbsp; SSPE is thought to be caused by a form of measles virus with a mutated or absent matrix protein that prevents mature (enveloped) virion particles from forming.&nbsp; As a result, measles virus continues to replicate intracellularly within neurons and oligodendrocytes, leading to a persistent, nonproductive infection that evades eradication by the immune system.&nbsp; Over time, accumulation of viral nucleocapsids results in the formation of intranuclear inclusions and eventually leads to inflammation, demyelination, and gliosis in many cerebral areas. Symptoms may begin with behavior changes that progressively worsen, followed by myoclonus and progressive neurologic deterioration (eg, coma, death).&nbsp; EEG shows&nbsp;characteristic periodic, generalized high-amplitude slow-wave discharges at regular intervals and CSF analysis shows elevated anti-measles antibody titers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>A significant complication of measles is that it can lead to immunosuppression against other pathogens, lasting up to several years.&nbsp; The mechanism appears to be related to the natural immune response against measles (ie, induction of measles-specific lymphocytes producing IgG antibodies, which usually results in lifelong immunity).&nbsp; As these measles-specific lymphocytes proliferate, they appear to replace other memory lymphocytes, a phenomenon known as immune amnesia.&nbsp; As a result, patients develop immunity against measles but are now more susceptible to infections from pathogens to which they were previously immune.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Measles-related complications (eg, diarrhea, pneumonia, encephalitis) occur in about 30% of patients, but the overall fatality rate is about 0.2% with adequate supportive care in resource-rich settings (about 10% in resource-limited settings).&nbsp; In uncomplicated cases, the rash generally resolves by the sixth day, and the cough may persist for a few weeks.</p><br><br><p>Although the prognosis of measles-related mortality is generally favorable, there is an increased risk of long-term complications (eg, immune suppression lasting several years, deafness or intellectual disability from encephalitis, blindness from keratitis).</p>\n<h1>Prevention </h1><br><br><p>Vaccination against measles is the most effective strategy for preventing the disease and controlling outbreaks.&nbsp; Generally, with adequate vaccination rates in the community, it can also provide protection to those who are unvaccinated via herd immunity.&nbsp; The <strong>measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine</strong> is typically given at ages 1 and 4, and provides protection in about 95% of patients.&nbsp; Vaccination may also be given to children age 6-11 months if they are traveling to a region with low vaccination rates.</p><br><br><p>Because the MMR vaccine contains a live-attenuated measles strain, it can cause a mild and transient version (eg, fever, rash) of measles within 1-2 weeks of immunization in a minority of individuals.&nbsp; Other characteristic features of wild-type measles strain, such as cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, are absent.&nbsp; The vaccine-strain measles causes a mild and self-limited infection, and no treatment is required.&nbsp; In addition, person-to-person transmission of the vaccine-strain illness does not occur.&nbsp; Therefore, although those who are pregnant or immunocompromised should not receive the MMR vaccine due to risk for serious adverse effects (eg, pneumonitis, encephalitis), it is considered safe for household contacts of these individuals.</p>\n<h1>Summary </h1><br><br><p>Measles (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/36825.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a highly contagious viral infection that remains a significant public health challenge worldwide.&nbsp; The illness begins with a prodrome of cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and fever, before the development of a characteristic maculopapular rash.&nbsp; Measles can lead to complications in up to 30% of patients but can be prevented by vaccination.&nbsp; In uncomplicated cases with appropriate supportive care, measles is typically self-limiting, with resolution of symptoms within 7-10 days.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
