They are the most common cause of unilateral, bloody nipple discharge.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Intraductal papillomas are benign lesions that arise from the lining of the breast ducts.&nbsp; They are papillary projections composed of epithelial and myoepithelial cells that line a fibrovascular stalk (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L4591.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Twisting of the stalk causes intraluminal bleeding with subsequent bloody nipple discharge.<p></p><br><br><p>Intraductal papillomas are usually small (≤1 cm) and may be solitary or multiple.&nbsp; They most often occur near the areola within the central breast.&nbsp; Because of their size and location, they are often not palpable clinically.&nbsp; On occasion, there may be cellular atypia (ie, atypical hyperplasia) or even ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) within the papilloma.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Age 35-55</li>\n\t<li>Family history of breast cancer</li>\n\t<li>Estrogen exposure (oral contraceptive pills, menopausal hormone therapy)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The most common presentation is with <strong>pathologic nipple discharge</strong> (ie, bloody or serosanguineous, unilateral).&nbsp; Most intraductal papillomas present without a palpable lump or mass, but occasionally, a small mass located behind the areola may be felt.&nbsp; Rarely, pain or breast discomfort is a presenting symptom.&nbsp; Some intraductal papillomas are completely asymptomatic and found incidentally on routine imaging.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>A definitive diagnosis is made with histopathologic examination on biopsied specimens (eg, <strong>core needle biopsy</strong>).&nbsp; However, a full evaluation is required in any patient with pathologic nipple discharge because breast malignancy may also present in a similar fashion (ie, malignant tumor growth within the lactiferous duct system).&nbsp; This involves:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Clinical breast examination</strong> may reveal a subareolar lump or mass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Age-based imaging</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L35155.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) with ultrasonography (&lt;30), mammography (≥30), or both (≥40) is performed.&nbsp; Because of the small size of most intraductal papillomas, imaging may be normal and MRI of the breast may be required for greater sensitivity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Core needle biopsy</strong> is the preferred method for obtaining a tissue sample for histologic examination.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</strong>:&nbsp; refers to a mixed group of neoplasms confined to the breast duct and lobules with dystrophic calcifications.&nbsp; DCIS may be associated with a palpable lump or pathologic nipple discharge; however, most are found as abnormal calcifications on screening mammography.&nbsp; Intraductal papillomas are less likely to be identified on mammography (due to small intraductal size) and are not associated with calcifications.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mammary duct ectasia</strong>:&nbsp; a benign condition characterized by dilated subareolar milk ducts, often presents with sticky, green/black nipple discharge that can be expressed with palpation.&nbsp; It is commonly associated with a palpable subareolar mass.&nbsp; Imaging shows dilated tubular structures.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Breast abscess</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/34846.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; a localized infection within the breast tissue containing purulent fluid.&nbsp; Most commonly, breast abscesses follow severe lactational mastitis but can form after other conditions (periductal mastitis).&nbsp; Breast abscesses present with a fluctuant mass, erythema, swelling, systemic symptoms (fever), and, at times, purulent nipple discharge (depending on the abscess location).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Phyllodes tumor</strong>:&nbsp; a fibroepithelial tumor that often experiences rapid growth, leading to a multinodular mass that does not often present with nipple discharge.&nbsp; Histology shows a leaf-like proliferation of stromal tissue on core needle biopsy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fibroadenoma</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/72766.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; presents as a solitary, well-circumscribed, mobile benign breast mass, most often located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast.&nbsp; It does not cause nipple discharge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Asymptomatic (ie, incidentally found), small intraductal papillomas with no evidence of cellular atypia on core needle biopsy may be managed with observation and regular follow-up.&nbsp; Surgical excision is recommended when the intraductal papilloma has bothersome symptoms (eg, bloody nipple discharge), is associated with a palpable mass, or has atypia on core needle biopsy.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Intraductal papillomas are <strong>benign lesions</strong> with an excellent prognosis following appropriate management.&nbsp; The risk for breast cancer is slightly increased in women with multiple papillomas or atypical hyperplasia; therefore, regular monitoring and follow-up are necessary to ensure early detection of potential malignancies.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Intraductal papillomas (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/72446.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are benign papillary tumors arising from the lining of breast ducts.&nbsp;
