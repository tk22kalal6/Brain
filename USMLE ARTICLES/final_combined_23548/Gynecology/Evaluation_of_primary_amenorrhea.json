Amenorrhea can result either from functional or anatomic disorders of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries, uterus, or vagina and from differences of sexual development.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The development of female sexual secondary characteristics and establishment of menarche begin with the onset of pulsatile GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus, which stimulates LH and FSH release from the pituitary gland and, subsequently, the production of ovarian estrogen.&nbsp; Adrenal androgen production also begins but is not stimulated by GnRH.&nbsp; Secondary sexual characteristics are driven by these hormones as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Estrogen stimulates breast development in females in early puberty and menarche in late puberty (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16082.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Adrenal androgens are responsible for pubic and axillary hair development, body odor, and acne (collectively, adrenarche) in both sexes.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Primary amenorrhea (absence of menarche) can result due to a disruption anywhere within the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis or within the uterus or outflow tract:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hypothalamic dysfunction (eg, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, GnRH deficiency).</li>\n\t<li>Pituitary disorders (eg, hyperprolactinemia).</li>\n\t<li>Ovarian failure (eg, Turner syndrome).</li><br><br>\t<li>Uterine disorders (eg, müllerian agenesis).</li>\n\t<li>Outflow tract abnormalities (eg, imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition, primary amenorrhea can be the initial presentation of patients with a difference in sexual development.</p>\n<h1>Evaluation</h1><br><br><p>The evaluation of primary amenorrhea occurs in a systematic, step-wise fashion (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L38795.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Initial evaluation is with <strong>pelvic ultrasonography</strong>, which establishes the presence or absence of a uterus.<p></p><br><br><p>In <strong>patients with a uterus</strong>, the next step is measurement of the <strong>serum FSH level</strong>, which helps distinguish between central and peripheral causes of amenorrhea in the HPO axis.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Low/normal FSH levels are consistent with central causes of amenorrhea (ie, hypothalamic, pituitary), which cause decreased production/secretion of either GnRH (hypothalamus) or FSH (anterior pituitary gland).</li>\n\t<li>High FSH levels are consistent with a peripheral cause of amenorrhea (ie, ovarian).&nbsp; High FSH levels occur due to a lack of ovarian estrogen and inhibin production, which stops feedback inhibition to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland and results in constant FSH production (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24345.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Normal FSH levels are consistent with an anatomic outflow defect (eg, imperforate hymen) as the cause of amenorrhea because these defects do not affect the HPO axis.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In <strong>patients without a uterus</strong>, the next step is a <strong>karyotype analysis</strong> and, possibly, a <strong>serum testosterone level</strong>.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A 46,XX karyotype is consistent with a congenital uterine anomaly as the cause of primary amenorrhea.</li>\n\t<li>46,XY karyotype is consistent with a difference of sexual development as the cause of primary amenorrhea.&nbsp; These patients typically have an elevated female range of testosterone but a normal male pubertal range.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Etiologies and management</h1><h2>Hypothalamic causes</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Constitutional delay of puberty</strong>:&nbsp; Puberty is considered delayed if no female secondary sexual characteristics are present by age 12.&nbsp; Patients with constitutional delay have short stature but normal growth velocity (4-6 cm/year [1.6-2.4 in/year]) and delayed bone age.&nbsp; Because this is a normal variant, management is expectant with reassurance.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea</strong>:&nbsp; This can result from insufficient energy intake (eg, anorexia nervosa), excessive caloric expenditure (eg, excessive exercise), or physiologic/psychologic stress; adolescents are at increased risk for all of these.&nbsp; Management is with nutritional and psychologic support.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Kallman syndrome</strong> (GnRH deficiency):&nbsp; This is caused by a fetal olfactory and GnRH-producing neuron migratory deficiency, which results in anosmia and lack of GnRH production with subsequent low FSH and estrogen levels.&nbsp; Management is with estrogen therapy to establish menstrual cycles and height development.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pituitary causes</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hyperprolactinemia</strong>:&nbsp; Although a common cause of secondary amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemia is a rare cause of primary amenorrhea.&nbsp; In those with a suspected prolactinoma, management is with MRI of the brain followed by either surgery or medical management, depending on the tumor characteristics.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45228.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Thyroid disorders are a common cause of secondary amenorrhea and a rare cause of primary amenorrhea.&nbsp; Patients with hypothyroidism typically present with symptoms of hypothyroidism (eg, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, cold intolerance) in addition to primary amenorrhea.&nbsp; Treatment involves thyroid hormone replacement (levothyroxine), after which reproductive function should resume.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Ovarian causes</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Turner syndrome (45,X)</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L41042.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Turner syndrome causes primary amenorrhea via primary ovarian insufficiency; loss of the X chromosome leads to rapid atresia of oocytes and follicles with fibrous tissue replacement (ie, streak ovaries).&nbsp; Treatment involves estrogen-progesterone replacement to initiate puberty and prevent estrogen-deficiency symptoms (eg, osteoporosis, vaginal atrophy).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Primary ovarian insufficiency</strong>:&nbsp; This is most commonly a cause of secondary amenorrhea and is defined as menopause before age 40;&nbsp; however, autoimmune primary ovarian insufficiency can rarely cause primary amenorrhea in those with a normal karyotype (46,XX).&nbsp; Treatment requires estrogen-progestin therapy to prevent consequences of estrogen deficiency (eg, osteoporosis, vaginal atrophy).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Polycystic ovary syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; This rare cause of primary amenorrhea is seen in overweight patients.&nbsp; Treatment is focused on weight loss and management of comorbid metabolic complications (eg, insulin resistance).&nbsp; Progestin-containing contraception is often prescribed to prevent endometrial cancer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Uterus and outflow tract causes</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Müllerian agenesis</strong>:&nbsp; Müllerian agenesis occurs due to failure of paramesonephric (müllerian) duct formation, resulting in an absent or a rudimentary uterus.&nbsp; Because ovarian development is not affected, patients have normal secondary sexual characteristics (breast and axillary/pubic hair development) and normal female external genitalia.&nbsp; Treatment depends primarily on future family-building desires and may involve assisted reproductive technology with surrogacy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Imperforate hymen</strong> and <strong>transverse vaginal septum</strong>:&nbsp; Patients have normal ovarian, uterine, and external female genitalia development but also an outflow obstruction.&nbsp; Therefore, patients classically present with amenorrhea associated with cyclic abdominal pain, a suprapubic mass (an enlarged uterus), and a blue-tinged vaginal mass from entrapped menses.&nbsp; Treatment is surgical with either hymenal incision or resection of the septum.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Differences of sexual development</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Androgen insensitivity syndrome</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19580.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Androgen insensitivity syndrome is characterized by a nonfunctioning androgen receptor.&nbsp; Patients have functioning cryptorchid testes that produce antimüllerian hormone, which causes regression of the uterus, cervix, and upper third of the vagina; however, because of the nonfunctioning androgen receptor, the epididymis, vas deferens, penis, and prostate do not form and \"default\" to female external genitalia (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L1434.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; At puberty, the increased testosterone is aromatized into estrogen, which produces breast development.&nbsp; There is minimal to no axillary/pubic hair due to androgen resistance.&nbsp; Management involves prophylactic gonadectomy due to the increased risk for testicular cancer associated with cryptorchidism and individualized management based on gender identity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>5-alpha reductase deficiency</strong>:&nbsp; This deficiency is caused by the defective conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and classically presents in genotypically male (46,XY) newborns with male internal genitalia and female external genitalia.&nbsp; Patients often present with primary amenorrhea and virilization (eg, clitoromegaly) from elevated testosterone at puberty.&nbsp; Treatment involves gonadectomy to reduce the risk for testicular cancer and individualized management based on gender identity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Primary amenorrhea is defined as either the absence of menarche at age ≥13 in females with no secondary sexual characteristics (eg, no breast development) or the absence of menarche at age ≥15 in females with secondary sexual characteristics.&nbsp; Amenorrhea can result either from functional or anatomic disorders of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries, uterus, or vagina and from differences in sexual development.&nbsp; Evaluation includes pelvic ultrasonography to evaluate the uterus, followed by a laboratory evaluation (eg, FSH, karyotype analysis) to evaluate for hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and genetic causes.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
