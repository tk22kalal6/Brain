Patients often present with dysmenorrhea and abnormal uterine bleeding.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Although the exact pathogenesis is unclear, adenomyosis may occur due to endometrial invagination into the myometrium during periods of myometrial weakening or changes in vascularity at the endomyometrial interface.&nbsp; Therefore, risk factors are often related to these pathologic changes, which include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Age:&nbsp; more common in women age 40-50</li>\n\t<li>Multiparity:&nbsp; particularly in patients with uterine trauma during delivery (eg, postpartum hemorrhage requiring uterine curettage)</li>\n\t<li>Prior uterine surgery:&nbsp; cesarean delivery, myomectomy</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Adenomyosis has a gross appearance of areas of dark red endometrial tissue within the myometrium.&nbsp; The lesions may be diffuse or focal, and the affected areas often display myometrial hypertrophy and hyperplasia, resulting in a globular, enlarged uterus.&nbsp; Histopathology, which provides the definitive diagnosis, reveals the endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine myometrium (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108163.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with adenomyosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L18075.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) may experience a range of symptoms, including:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Heavy menstrual bleeding</strong> characterized by heavy, cyclic menses caused by an enlarged uterus and increased endometrial cavity surface area</li>\n\t<li><strong>Painful menses</strong> (dysmenorrhea) due to cyclic accumulation of endometrial tissue within the myometrium</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tender, boggy, symmetrically enlarged (\"globular\") uterus</strong> due to continued endometrial gland accumulation.&nbsp; The uterus does not typically exceed a size equivalent to that at 12 weeks gestation.&nbsp; Some patients develop chronic pelvic pain.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with adenomyosis often have concurrent gynecologic conditions, including endometriosis and uterine leiomyomata.&nbsp; Imaging studies can help delineate these etiologies, but many of the management strategies for these conditions are similar.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>A presumptive diagnosis of adenomyosis can be made based on a combination of clinical evaluation and imaging studies (eg, transvaginal ultrasonography [first-line], MRI).&nbsp; Imaging of patients with adenomyosis typically shows an enlarged uterus, asymmetric myometrial thickening, and hypoechoic areas in the myometrium (consistent with endometrial stroma and glands).</p><br><br><p>No laboratory studies are used to diagnose adenomyosis, but some are performed to rule out other conditions and to evaluate for complications.&nbsp; These include a complete blood count (to evaluate for anemia), pregnancy test, and possible endometrial biopsy in patients at high risk for endometrial hyperplasia/cancer (eg, obesity, anovulation).</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Primary dysmenorrhea</strong>:&nbsp; causes painful menses, but patients typically have decreased pain by the first 2 days of the menstrual period, rather than throughout the entire menstrual period (like adenomyosis).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Endometriosis</strong>:&nbsp; can cause painful menses throughout the entire menstrual period, but because endometriosis is endometrial tissue outside of the uterus, it does not cause a diffusely enlarged, boggy uterus.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Uterine fibroids (leiomyoma)</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L39263.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; also cause heavy, regular menses.&nbsp; Fibroids can be distinguished from adenomyosis on either pelvic examination, which can show an irregularly enlarged uterus, or pelvic ultrasound, which shows the fibroids.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The management of adenomyosis depends on the severity of symptoms and the patient's desire for future fertility.</p><br><br><p>First-line management is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief.&nbsp; Hormonal contraception, such as combined estrogen/progestin oral contraceptive pills, progestin-releasing intrauterine devices, and GnRH agonists, are also used for pain management and menstrual regulation.&nbsp; Most patients experience improvement or resolution of symptoms after menopause, at which time medical management can be discontinued.</p><br><br><p>For patients who do not respond to medical management or who do not desire future fertility, surgical management with hysterectomy is the definitive treatment and provides a histologic diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Adenomyosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35408.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an abnormal collection of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium, the muscular wall of the uterus.&nbsp;
