It predominantly affects infants and is characterized by a mass with a distinctive grape-like (botryoid) appearance that arises from the genitourinary tract (eg, bladder, vagina).<p></p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and pathology&nbsp;</h1><br><br><p>Sarcoma botryoides originates from <strong>embryonal mesenchymal cells</strong>, which are precursor cells that can differentiate into skeletal muscle.&nbsp; The tumor cells exhibit various stages of muscle differentiation (eg, rhabdomyoblasts).</p><br><br><p>The hallmark of sarcoma botryoides is its <strong>polypoid or grape-like appearance</strong>, which is typically seen protruding into a hollow organ (eg, vagina).&nbsp; Microscopically, the tumor is composed of small, round, undifferentiated cells with eosinophilic-appearing cytoplasm (which occurs due to poorly formed myofilaments).&nbsp; The presence of a cambium layer, a dense layer of rhabdomyoblasts beneath the epithelium, is a characteristic feature.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Although the exact cause of sarcoma botryoides is not well understood, several risk factors have been identified, including young age (usually <strong>age &lt;1</strong>) and possible genetic predisposition (eg, Li-Fraumeni syndrome).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The clinical presentation of sarcoma botryoides depends on the site of origin:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Bladder</strong>:&nbsp; hematuria, urinary obstruction (with possible recurrent urinary tract infections)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vagina</strong>:&nbsp; vaginal bleeding, mucoid vaginal discharge, protruding polypoid-appearing mass</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for sarcoma botryoides is based on the differential diagnosis of prepubertal vaginal bleeding (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/81764.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and includes the following:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Vaginal foreign body</strong>:&nbsp; can present with mucoid or bloody vaginal discharge, but patients do not have an associated vaginal mass.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Trauma</strong>:&nbsp; can present with bloody vaginal discharge (due to sexual abuse, saddle injury, or abrasion), but patients typically have concomitant bruising and/or perineal trauma (eg, lacerations).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infection</strong>:&nbsp; can present with mucoid or bloody vaginal discharge; in addition, patients with a vulvovaginal infection typically have vulvar and/or perineal erythema.&nbsp; In patients with sarcoma botryoides of the bladder, a urinary tract infection can be ruled out based on lack of bacteria on urine culture.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Precocious puberty</strong>:&nbsp; can present with vaginal bleeding from early menarche but is rare in infants.&nbsp; In addition, there are usually additional signs of precocious puberty, including breast and pubic/axillary hair development.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis, laboratory evaluation, and imaging&nbsp;</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical presentation, imaging studies, and histopathological examination.&nbsp; Physical examination may reveal a mass or protrusion in the vagina or bladder.&nbsp; Definitive diagnosis is made via biopsy of the mass.&nbsp; Patients diagnosed with sarcoma botryoides require further evaluation with imaging (eg, CT scan, MRI) to help determine the extent of the tumor and evaluate for metastasis.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of sarcoma botryoides involves a multidisciplinary approach, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for sarcoma botryoides depends on several factors, including the site of origin, stage of the disease, and response to treatment.&nbsp; Patients with a favorable prognosis include those with early-stage disease, complete surgical resection, and good response to chemotherapy.&nbsp; Overall, the survival rate for localized sarcoma botryoides has improved significantly with advances in multimodal therapy, but those with advanced or metastatic disease have poor survival rates.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Sarcoma botryoides (an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma) is a rare and aggressive pediatric malignancy that predominantly affects infants.&nbsp; It is characterized by a mass with a distinctive grape-like (botryoid) appearance that arises from the genitourinary tract (eg, bladder, vagina).</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
