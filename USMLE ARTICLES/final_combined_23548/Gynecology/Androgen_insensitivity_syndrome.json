Patients with complete AIS have a 46,XY genotype yet have a female phenotype (ie, female external genitalia, breast development) despite the presence of testes and male-range androgen production (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19580.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) normally interact with androgen receptors in target tissues to induce androgenic effects (ie, virilization).</p><br><br><p>AIS, an X-linked recessive disorder, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome.&nbsp; These mutations lead to a lack of response to androgens, resulting in abnormal sexual development (ie, undervirilization) beginning in utero:</p>\n<h2>Development of internal genitalia</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>46,XY</strong> patients with AIS have an intact <em>SRY</em> gene&nbsp;on the Y chromosome, which induces the embryonic gonadal ridges to differentiate into <strong>testes</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29882.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In the testes, Sertoli cells produce anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) and Leydig cells produce testosterone.</li>\n\t<li>AMH causes regression of the müllerian structures; therefore, patients with AIS do not develop female internal genitalia (eg, uterus, cervix, upper third of the vagina).</li>\n\t<li>However, because testosterone cannot bind to the nonfunctioning androgen receptors within wolffian ducts, internal male genitalia (eg, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, epididymis) are absent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Development of external genitalia</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Testosterone is converted into DHT by the enzyme 5-alpha reductase.&nbsp; Normally, DHT stimulates testicular descent and induces embryonic structures (eg, genital tubercle (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L1434.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )) to differentiate into male external genitalia (eg, penis).</li>\n\t<li>Patients with AIS have no response to DHT because of their defective androgen receptors.&nbsp; As a result, male external genitalia do not develop and the testes remain undescended (<strong>cryptorchid</strong>).&nbsp; In the absence of DHT activity, <strong>female external genitalia</strong> (eg, lower two-thirds of the vagina, vulva) develop.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Testosterone is not overtly elevated because it is peripherally aromatized to estrogen.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>At puberty, the testes increase production of testosterone to male-range levels, causing increased estrogen production through aromatization.&nbsp; Therefore, patients with AIS undergo <strong>breast development</strong> because of the combination of androgen resistance (testosterone suppresses breast development) and high levels of estrogen.&nbsp; Peripheral androgen resistance also results in <strong>minimal or absent axillary and pubic hair</strong>.&nbsp; Menses are absent due to the absence of female internal genitalia (ie, uterus).&nbsp; The testes remain cryptorchid with impaired spermatogenesis.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Classically, complete AIS presents during adolescence with a female phenotype and the following features:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Primary amenorrhea (ie, absence of menarche by age 15 in girls with secondary sexual characteristics [eg, breast development])</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Examination typically shows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Minimal or absent axillary and pubic hair</li>\n\t<li>Normal breast development (eg, sexual maturity [Tanner] stage 4)</li>\n\t<li>Normal female external genitalia (eg, vulva)</li>\n\t<li>A short, blind vaginal pouch</li>\n\t<li>Usually, intraabdominal testes that are occasionally palpable in the inguinal canal or labia majora</li>\n\t<li>Tall stature</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>However, depending on the degree of impaired androgen receptor function, AIS can produce a range of phenotypes of varying levels of undervirilization.&nbsp; These range from classic complete AIS, partial AIS (mostly female phenotype with mild pubertal virilization [eg, clitoromegaly]), and mild AIS (eg, predominantly male phenotype but impaired spermatogenesis and gynecomastia).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis may be delayed until <strong>after puberty</strong> (when a patient is evaluated for primary amenorrhea) because patients with complete AIS have female external genitalia at birth and normal breast development at puberty.</p><br><br><p>Primary amenorrhea evaluation includes history (particularly pubertal development), physical examination, hormonal evaluation, and imaging (internal reproductive organ assessment).&nbsp; AIS is suspected with the following features:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Female phenotype (ie, female external genitalia)</li>\n\t<li>Abnormal female pubertal development:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Adrenarche:&nbsp;

presents with ambiguous (undervirilized) or female external genitalia at birth because DHT (the hormone required for differentiation of male external genitalia) is absent during embryogenesis; however, male internal genitalia are present due to testosterone-induced wolffian duct development.&nbsp; At puberty, testosterone reaches male-range levels, causing marked virilization (eg, clitoromegaly).&nbsp; Patients do not develop breasts because androgen receptors are functional, which allows testosterone to inhibit breast development and prevents peripheral aromatization into estrogen.&nbsp;
