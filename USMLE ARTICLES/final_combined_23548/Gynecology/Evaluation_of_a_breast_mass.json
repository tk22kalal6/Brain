The appropriate evaluation is guided by a patient's age and risk factors for malignancy.&nbsp; The diagnostic pathway is essential to differentiate benign conditions (eg, fibroadenoma, cysts) from breast cancer and to ensure timely and appropriate management.</p>\n<h1>Common breast masses</h1><h2>Benign breast masses</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Fibroadenoma</strong>:&nbsp; Benign solid tumor composed of glandular and fibrous tissue.&nbsp; Fibroadenomas typically cause a painless and mobile rubbery mass that are hormonally mediated (ie, increased size with elevated estrogen levels).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Breast cyst</strong>:&nbsp; Fluid-filled round mass that may fluctuate in size due to cyclic hormonal changes.&nbsp; Cysts may be painless or become painful, especially in the days leading up to the onset of menses.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fibrocystic breast disease</strong>:&nbsp; The development of fibrous tissue and cysts within the breast, often associated with hormonal fluctuations.&nbsp; It may cause cyclical breast pain and breast \"lumpiness.\"&nbsp; Breast examination may show an isolated mass, scattered masses, or irregular densities.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Galactocele</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29817.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; A complication of lactation that occurs when the mammary duct becomes obstructed due to inflammation or trauma, leading to a dilated cystic area filled with breast milk that is palpable as a soft breast mass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Breast abscess</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L20684.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; A localized collection of pus in the breast tissue that can develop spontaneously or as a complication of lactational mastitis and cause a fluctuant, tender breast mass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fat necrosis</strong>:&nbsp; Mechanical trauma or surgery may lead to localized ischemia to an area of breast tissue, resulting in necrosis of adipose cells and subsequent inflammation and fibrotic scarring that causes a firm, irregulat breast mass.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Malignant breast masses</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Invasive ductal carcinoma</strong>:&nbsp; The most common malignant cause of a breast mass.&nbsp; Malignant cells originate from the ductal epithelium and invade surrounding breast tissue, inducing a fibrotic response and causing a firm, irregular mass.&nbsp; The precursor to invasive ductal carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, is usually too small to cause a palpable mass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Invasive lobular carcinoma</strong>:&nbsp; Malignant cells arise from the lobules of the breast and invade the surrounding breast tissue in a single-file or individual fashion.&nbsp; These tumors often present with diffuse growth and the resulting mass may not be well-defined.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Paget disease of the breast</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28450.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; A rare type of breast malignancy that causes a scaly or ulcerated lesion of the nipple and areola and often has an underlying breast mass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inflammatory breast cancer</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28417.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; An aggressive malignancy that presents with changes to the appearance of the breast (eg, swelling, erythema, peau d'orange) that may be accompanied by a palpable breast mass.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients have a palpable breast mass (lump), which may be detected incidentally by the patient or during a physical examination.&nbsp; Pain or tenderness is more common in benign conditions, but can be associated with malignancy and may fluctuate with estrogen level changes during the menstrual cycle.</p><br><br><p>Some breast masses can cause nipple discharge, which may be clear, milky, bloody, or purulent, depending on the underlying cause.&nbsp; Skin changes, including dimpling, retraction, or ulceration, are suspicious for malignancy (particularly inflammatory breast cancer).&nbsp; In some cases, axillary lymphadenopathy may be present, which could indicate malignancy or an inflammatory process such as mastitis.</p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><h2>Step 1: Clinical assessment</h2><br><br><p>The evaluation of a breast mass begins with a history and physical examination.&nbsp; History should focus on:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Onset, duration, and progression of the mass.</li>\n\t<li>Associated symptoms (eg, pain, nipple discharge, skin changes) and any relation to the menstrual cycle.</li>\n\t<li>Reproductive history (eg, menstrual history, pregnancy, lactation, use of hormonal medications).</li>\n\t<li>Family history of malignancy.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Physical examination includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inspection:&nbsp; Assess for asymmetry, skin changes, nipple abnormalities, or signs of trauma.</li>\n\t<li>Palpation:&nbsp; Helps determine the size, shape, consistency, mobility, and tenderness of the mass.&nbsp; A firm, fixed, irregular mass raises suspicion for malignancy, whereas a smooth, mobile, well-defined mass is more suggestive of a benign condition.</li>\n\t<li>Evaluation of lymph nodes:&nbsp; Axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes should also be assessed, noting any enlargement, matting, or fixation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 2: Imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Various imaging modalities may be used to evaluate a breast mass:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Mammography</strong>:&nbsp; In patients with a breast mass, diagnostic mammography is performed instead of screening mammography.&nbsp; A diagnostic study provides more views of the breast than screening mammography and allows for additional techniques (eg, spot compression) and angles to evaluate suspicious areas.&nbsp; Findings suggestive of malignancy include microcalcifications (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99229.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), mass lesions with spiculated or irregular borders (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L117391.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), architectural distortion, and asymmetry.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ultrasonography</strong>:&nbsp; Used alone or in conjunction with mammography to further characterize breast masses.&nbsp; Ultrasonography often provides evaluation of benign lesions like breast cysts (appear as well-defined anechoic lesions with posterior acoustic enhancement) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44829.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and fibroadenomas (uniformly hypoechogenic round mass) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L111763.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>MRI:&nbsp; Used occasionally to obtain further information when mammographic or sonographic findings are equivocal.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The choice of imaging depends on the patient's age, clinical findings, and degree of suspicion for cancer (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L1422.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Age &lt;30</strong>:&nbsp; Breast <strong>ultrasonography</strong> is usually the first-line study because younger patients tend to have higher breast density (limiting visualization of some masses on mammography) and lower risk for malignancy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Age 30-40</strong>:&nbsp; Either <strong>mammography or breast ultrasonography</strong> may be the first-line study depending on patient factors and suspected diagnosis.&nbsp; Often both are performed because the studies are complementary.&nbsp; In this age group, ultrasonography has higher sensitivity for malignancy than mammography.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Age ≥40</strong>:&nbsp; <strong>Mammography</strong> is the first-line study; however, ultrasonography is often also performed for further information.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Following an imaging study, the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) is used to determine a standardized score to stratify the risk for malignancy and guide the need for biopsy or surgical resection.&nbsp; The scoring system is as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>0:&nbsp; Needs additional evaluation</li>\n\t<li>1:&nbsp; Normal findings</li>\n\t<li>2:&nbsp; Benign lesion</li>\n\t<li>3:&nbsp; Probably benign lesion (malignancy risk &lt;2%)</li>\n\t<li>4:&nbsp; Suspicious for malignancy (broad category with malignancy risk between 2% and 95%)</li>\n\t<li>5:&nbsp; High risk for malignancy (malignancy risk 95%-100%)</li>\n\t<li>6:&nbsp; Biopsy-proven malignancy</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>All scores of 0, 4, or 5 require additional intervention with further imaging studies, close imaging follow-up, or biopsy.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Tissue diagnosis</h2><br><br><p>Biopsy should be performed in patients with suspicious imaging findings or in those with a clinically suspicious breast mass, even if imaging findings are normal (discordance).&nbsp; Patients with a benign finding can be offered biopsy or follow-up imaging in 6 months.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Core needle biopsy</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28494.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; The preferred method of biopsy because it extracts a \"core\" sample of breast tissue.&nbsp; It is usually performed under imaging guidance to directly target the abnormal area for sampling.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fine-needle aspiration</strong> (FNA) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28493.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Inferior to core needle biopsy for evaluation of breast masses because it does not maintain tissue architecture (ie, cannot distinguish between invasive and in situ carcinoma) and has a higher false-negative rate.&nbsp; It is most often used for cyst aspiration and to evaluate for lymph node metastases in patients with cancer.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Excisional biopsy</strong>:&nbsp; Involves complete removal of a breast mass for diagnosis.&nbsp; It is usually performed when core needle biopsy is inconclusive or inconsistent with imaging findings or if a core needle biopsy is not technically feasible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Benign conditions such as fibroadenomas, fat necrosis, and simple cysts can often be managed conservatively with observation.&nbsp; Symptomatic cysts and galactoceles may be aspirated, whereas enlarging or symptomatic fibroadenomas may require surgical excision.&nbsp; Abscesses are treated with antibiotics and either needle aspiration or surgical drainage.&nbsp; Pain related to benign masses can typically be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><br><br><p>Malignant breast masses require a multidisciplinary approach that may involve surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy), radiation, chemotherapy, or endocrine therapy depending on tumor characteristics.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis and prevention</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of a breast mass depends on its etiology.&nbsp; Benign breast conditions generally have an excellent prognosis.&nbsp; However, some benign conditions (eg, atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, radial scar, sclerosing adenosis, complex fibroadenoma) may have a slightly increased risk for future malignancy.&nbsp; Early-stage breast cancer has a high survival rate when treated appropriately, whereas advanced disease carries a poorer prognosis.</p><br><br><p>Breast cancer screening plays a crucial role in early detection and improving outcomes.&nbsp; Routine mammography is recommended every 1-2 years for women beginning at age 40-50 depending on patient risk factors and preferences.&nbsp; Women at high risk (eg, <em>BRCA</em> mutations, strong family history) should begin screening at an earlier age and may be offered screening breast MRI in addition to mammography.&nbsp; Screening beyond age 75 is appropriate for some patients based on life expectancy and overall health status.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Both benign and malignant breast conditions are common causes of breast masses.&nbsp; The evaluation of a breast mass involves a systematic approach to distinguish between these conditions, including physical examination, imaging, and possible biopsy.&nbsp; Imaging may involve mammography, ultrasonography, or a combination of both to risk-stratify the masses to determine if biopsy is indicated.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
