PMB can occur due to a variety of conditions, many of which are benign, but it is also a common presentation of endometrial cancer.&nbsp; Therefore, all patients presenting with PMB require a thorough evaluation.</p>\n<h1>Etiologies</h1><br><br><p>Although PMB is mostly of uterine origin, it can also occur due to bleeding from other locations in the urogenital tract (eg, vulva, urethra, cervix).&nbsp; The source of bleeding can be divided into nonuterine etiologies, uterine structural etiologies, and uterine nonstructural etiologies (with an emphasis on endometrial hyperplasia and cancer).</p>\n<h2>Nonuterine etiologies</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)</strong>:&nbsp; the thinning and inflammation of the vulvar and vaginal epithelium due to decreased estrogen can lead to bleeding, particularly with tissue trauma (eg, due to sexual intercourse or pessary placement).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pelvic organ prolapse</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L23994.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; herniation of the bladder, bowel, and/or uterus through the vagina can cause protrusion of the vaginal wall beyond the vaginal orifice, causing tissue exposure and tissue friability, ulceration, and bleeding.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sexual assault and intimate partner violence</strong>:&nbsp; may present with PMB, with evidence of genital tract lacerations and bruising.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Uterine structural etiologies </h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Endometrial polyp</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29448.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; benign growths of the endometrium that can cause bleeding by disrupting the surface integrity of the endometrial lining; a common cause of PMB</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cervical cancer</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31148.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; can cause PMB due to cervical friability, particularly with advanced disease</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Uterine nonstructural etiologies</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Endometrial atrophy</strong>:&nbsp; a common cause of PMB.&nbsp; After menopause, decreased estrogen levels cause thinning of the endometrial lining, leading to increased friction and inflammation from the denuded endometrium.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Coagulopathies</strong>:&nbsp; commonly occur secondary to medications (eg, antiplatelets, anticoagulants), but they can also occur secondary to certain medical conditions (eg, thrombocytopenia, von Willebrand disease).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Endometrial hyperplasia and cancer</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Endometrial hyperplasia/cancer</strong>:&nbsp; the most concerning cause of PMB.&nbsp; Both endometrial hyperplasia and cancer occur due to prolonged, unopposed estrogen exposure to the uterine lining, leading to its excessive proliferation and malignant transformation.&nbsp; This should be suspected in patients with risk factors, including obesity, hormone replacement therapy (particularly if progestin is not used), tamoxifen use, or family history (eg, Lynch syndrome).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis, evaluation, and management</h1><br><br><p>Evaluation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16430.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) of PMB aims to, first, rule out endometrial hyperplasia/cancer; second, rule out cervical cancer; and, third, diagnose the potential etiology.<p></p>\n<h2>History and physical examination</h2><br><br><p>Nonuterine etiologies and iatrogenic causes secondary to medication are often readily identified based on patient history and physical examination (eg, visible excoriations or vulvovaginal tissue thinning).&nbsp; Depending on the amount of bleeding, a complete blood count may be indicated to evaluate for anemia.&nbsp; In addition, patients taking anticoagulant medications may require coagulation studies.&nbsp; Regardless of the results of the examination and laboratory evaluation, all patients with PMB require full evaluation of the cervix and endometrium.</p>\n<h2>Cervical evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Patients should undergo evaluation for possible cervical cancer with a <strong>Pap test and human papillomavirus cotesting</strong>.&nbsp; In addition, any obvious lesions on pelvic examination should be biopsied for histopathology.</p><br><br><p>Patients with cervical dysplasia or cancer on Pap testing and colposcopy should be treated based on cervical cancer guidelines, discussed in detail in the cervical cancer article.</p>\n<h2>Endometrial evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Regardless of the results of Pap testing and colposcopy, the endometrium should be evaluated.&nbsp; Initial evaluation of the endometrium can be performed through <strong>transvaginal ultrasonography</strong> or <strong>endometrial sampling</strong>.</p><br><br><p>Although transvaginal ultrasonography cannot provide a definitive diagnosis, it is a reasonable first step for patients with a lower suspicion for malignancy (eg, normal BMI, no use of hormone replacement therapy) because it is less invasive and less painful than an endometrial biopsy.&nbsp; Transvaginal ultrasonography is used to evaluate for endometrial thickness and can help identify endometrial polyps, fibroids, or other structural abnormalities:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Endometrial thickness of <strong>≤4 mm</strong> generally indicates a <strong>low risk for malignancy</strong>, and the patient can be observed and monitored with serial transvaginal ultrasonographies.</li>\n\t<li>In contrast, endometrial thickness of <strong>&gt;4 mm</strong> indicates an <strong>increased risk for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer</strong>, and the patient requires endometrial sampling.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Endometrial biopsy is the gold standard to rule out endometrial hyperplasia or cancer:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Patients with an adequate sample and benign biopsy results can be observed or treated for the other etiology (eg, vaginal estrogen for genitourinary syndrome of menopause).</li>\n\t<li>Patients with an inadequate sample or an endometrial polyp require further evaluation with uterine curettage, typically via hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage.</li>\n\t<li>Patients with endometrial hyperplasia or cancer require treatment.&nbsp; A detailed discussion of treatment can be found in the endometrial hyperplasia and cancer article.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Postmenopausal bleeding is most commonly caused by benign pathologies.&nbsp; However, it can be a symptom of malignancy, particularly endometrial cancer, and all patients with postmenopausal bleeding require a full evaluation.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
