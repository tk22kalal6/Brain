Malpractice claims are heard in civil court, where the patient (plaintiff) must provide evidence that, more likely than not (ie, by a preponderance of evidence), the physician behaved negligently.</p>\n<h1>Criteria</h1><br><br><p>For a physician to be found liable for medical malpractice, all of the following criteria must be met (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/85724.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Duty</strong>:&nbsp; The physician must have an established relationship with the patient, which can be explicit (eg, outpatient consultation) or implicit (eg, informal consultations with a specialist [\"curbside consult\"], supervision of other providers).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Deviation from standard</strong>:&nbsp; The physician must fail to practice according to accepted standards of care due either to lack of attention and care (ie, negligence, dereliction of duty) or to deficits in knowledge or skill.&nbsp; Professional standard of care definitions are state dependent, although they are commonly described as what a reasonable and similarly qualified doctor would have done under the same or similar circumstances.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Direct causation and damages</strong>:&nbsp; The physician's actions must directly and proximately cause patient harm (eg, injury, death).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Common types of medical malpractice claims</h1><br><br><p>Examples of common medical malpractice claims include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Failure to diagnose</strong>:&nbsp; Delayed or missed diagnosis leading to harm (eg, failure to diagnose cancer at an early stage).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Misdiagnosis</strong>:&nbsp; Incorrect diagnosis leading to improper treatment (eg, treating a myocardial infarction as acid reflux).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Surgical errors</strong>:&nbsp; Error made during surgery (eg, wrong-site surgery, retained surgical instruments).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Medication errors</strong>:&nbsp; Prescribing the wrong medication or dose (eg, administering penicillin to a patient with a known allergy).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Birth injuries</strong>:&nbsp; Errors during labor and delivery causing harm to the baby and/or mother (eg, failure to perform an emergency cesarean delivery leading to hypoxia).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lack of informed consent</strong>:&nbsp; Performing a procedure without adequately explaining the risks and alternatives (eg, performing abdominal surgery without explaining the risk for infection).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Legal defenses against malpractice claims</h1><br><br><p>When a physician is accused of medical malpractice, common scenarios indicating that the physician has not met the criteria for medical malpractice include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The physician did not deviate from the standard of care (ie, no breach of duty), or the physician's breach of duty did not result in direct injury to the patient (ie, lack of causation).</li>\n\t<li>The patient is found to have been nonadherent with treatment recommendations or instructions (eg, taking a sedative and then driving).</li>\n\t<li>Good Samaritan laws confer liability protection for physicians and others who provide care at the scene of an emergency at which they happen to be incidental bystanders.&nbsp; These laws apply only when the victim is in immediate peril and regular emergency services are not yet available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Professional liability insurance</h1><br><br><p>Professional liability insurance (also known as medical malpractice insurance) can provide coverage for legal defense and settlement costs in case of a lawsuit.&nbsp; Most states do not legally require physicians to have liability insurance to practice medicine; however, other entities (eg, hospitals, insurance panels) may require coverage.</p>\n<h2>Types of policies</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Claims-made policies</strong>:&nbsp; Provide coverage only for incidents filed while the policy is in effect; claims filed after the policy is inactivated are not covered, even if the harm-incurring event occurred while the policy was active.&nbsp; For continued coverage after the policy is inactivated, \"tail coverage\" must be purchased.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Occurrence policies</strong>:&nbsp; Provide lifetime coverage for incidents that happen during the policy period, even if the claim is filed years later.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Factors affecting premiums</h2><br><br><p>Surgical subspecialties (eg, obstetricians/gynecologists, orthopedic surgeons) are associated with a higher rate of malpractice claims and higher insurance premiums compared to other physicians.&nbsp; Premiums are also determined by geographic location and personal history of malpractice claims.</p>\n<h1>Strategies for reducing medical malpractice liability</h1><h2>Evidence-based medicine</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Adhere to practice guidelines and clinical pathways established by major specialty societies (eg, American College of Radiology), which serve as a broadly recognized standard of care.</li>\n\t<li>Participate in continuing medical education courses and stay up-to-date on best practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Proper documentation</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Provide a clear rationale for clinical decisions (eg, reason for increasing or maintaining medication dose).</li>\n\t<li>Complete documentation in a timely manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Effective communication with patients</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inform patients of office policies, including the use of electronic messaging portals for nonurgent messages, with instructions to call emergency services for only urgent concerns.</li>\n\t<li>Clearly communicate treatment risks, benefits, and alternate options during the informed consent process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Disclosure of medical errors</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Fully disclose complications (preventable and nonpreventable) to patients regardless of whether or not they suffer harm (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/58818.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Early, full disclosure of errors is associated with fewer malpractice lawsuits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>System-wide interventions</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Engage in root cause analysis to identify all causes of an adverse event (most common causes: failures in communication and teamwork).</li>\n\t<li>Implement closed-loop communication (ie, repeat back the information received to reduce the risk for misunderstandings).</li>\n\t<li>Use checklists and protocols for high-risk procedures (eg, surgical safety checklists).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Medical malpractice liability occurs when the physician's actions deviate from standards of care and that deviation directly causes damages to the patient (eg, psychologic injury, bodily injury, lost wages).&nbsp; Multiple strategies including proper documentation and effective communication with patients,&nbsp; can reduce liability risk.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
