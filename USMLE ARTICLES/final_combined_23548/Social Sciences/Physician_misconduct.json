Reporting physician misconduct is essential for protecting patient safety and maintaining public trust.</p>\n<h1>Types of physician misconduct</h1><br><br><p>Each state has a set of statutes known as the Medical Practice Act, which delineates rules and regulations for the practice of medicine, including what constitutes physician misconduct:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Medical negligence &amp; substandard care.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Repeated medical errors leading to patient harm.</li>\n\t\t<li>Patient abandonment (ie, terminating care for a patient without providing adequate notice).</li>\n\t\t<li>Prescription of pain medication in excess or without legitimate reason.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Sexual misconduct and boundary violations.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Sexual assault or harassment of a patient, colleague, or health care team member.</li>\n\t\t<li>Any sexual or romantic relationship with a patient (regardless of consent).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Substance use and impairment.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Provision of patient care while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</li>\n\t\t<li>Diversion of prescription medications for personal use.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Fraud and financial misconduct.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Billing fraud (eg, overbilling, billing for unperformed procedures).</li>\n\t\t<li>Illegal financial relationships (eg, kickbacks for patient referrals).</li>\n\t\t<li>Falsification of credentials (eg, practicing without a medical degree).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Discrimination and harassment.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Racial or gender-based harassment.</li>\n\t\t<li>Discriminatory practices in patient care (eg, quality of care differing based on patient's weight, age, income level, education).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Criminal activity.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Illegal behavior, such as drug trafficking or theft.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Professional misconduct &amp; ethical violations.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Failure to maintain patient confidentiality (violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]).</li>\n\t\t<li>Acceptance of expensive gifts from patients.</li>\n\t\t<li>Misrepresentation of completion of medical licensing requirements.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Research misconduct.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Failure to disclose a conflict of interest.</li>\n\t\t<li>Fabrication of data.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Consequences of physician misconduct</h1><h2>State medical board actions</h2><br><br><p>The state medical board investigates complaints of physician misconduct, resulting in either dismissal of the complaint (if there is no evidence of physician misconduct) or a hearing before a disciplinary panel.&nbsp; If the physician is found to violate the Medical Practice Act, the state medical board may decide to take 1 or more of the following actions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Revocation or temporary suspension of medical license.</li>\n\t<li>Restriction of medical license (eg, ineligible to prescribe controlled substances or perform certain procedures).</li>\n\t<li>Probation (ie, physician is permitted to practice only under certain conditions for a time).&nbsp; Examples include requiring enrollment in a physician health program or conducting random urine drug screens.</li>\n\t<li>Required completion of additional continuing medical education (eg, 8 hr of ethics).</li>\n\t<li>Monetary penalty/fine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Medical malpractice</h2><br><br><p>Physician misconduct (eg, negligence, providing patient care while inebriated) can result in a civil lawsuit involving medical malpractice liability if the action is not consistent with accepted standards of care and directly causes patient harm (eg, emotional suffering, physical injury, death) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/85724.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Medical malpractice is discussed in more detail in a separate dedicated article.</p>\n<h1>Duty to report physician misconduct</h1><h2>Self-reporting requirements</h2><br><br><p>State medical boards have varying self-reporting requirements.&nbsp; Many require self-reporting criminal convictions (eg, felonies, misdemeanors), out-of-state disciplinary actions, and medical malpractice claims within a specific time frame (eg, 30 days).&nbsp; Failure to do so may result in revocation or suspension of a medical license.</p>\n<h2>Reporting physician colleagues</h2><br><br><p>Physicians are ethically and legally obligated to report impaired, incompetent, or unethical colleagues to protect patient safety.&nbsp; Reporting is required when a physician strongly suspects, directly observes, or is informed of (eg, by a patient) a colleague engaging in misconduct.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Gather evidence.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Document specific incidents (dates, times, locations).</li>\n\t\t<li>Be objective and factual in reporting concerns.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Follow institutional policies.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>If patient safety is in immediate danger, report it to the supervisor on duty.</li>\n\t\t<li>Reporting may involve contacting the hospital ethics office or risk management.</li>\n\t\t<li>Many hospital systems have an anonymous compliance hotline for reporting misconduct.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Report to the state medical board.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Each state has a medical board that investigates physician misconduct.</li>\n\t\t<li>Reports can often be submitted online, via phone, or in writing.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Involve law enforcement if necessary (eg, for criminal activity such as child abuse).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Consequences of failing to report</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Harm to patients:&nbsp; Inaction, which may result in patient injury/death.</li>\n\t<li>Professional consequences:&nbsp; State medical board sanctions (eg, loss of license).</li>\n\t<li>Legal consequences:&nbsp; Medical malpractice liability for negligence.</li>\n\t<li>Erosion of public trust:&nbsp;
