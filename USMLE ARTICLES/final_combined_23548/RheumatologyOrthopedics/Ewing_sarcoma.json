X-ray classically demonstrates a central permeative (\"moth-eaten\") lesion with a layered (\"onion skin\") periosteal reaction.<p></p>\n<h1>Epidemiology</h1><br><br><p>Ewing sarcoma is the second-most common primary bone malignancy in children (after osteosarcoma), with a peak incidence between ages 10-15.&nbsp; It is rare among adults.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Ewing sarcoma is a primitive tumor of unclear origin (likely arising from <strong>neuroectodermal or mesenchymal stem cells</strong>).&nbsp; Most cases are driven by a translocation involving <em>EWSR1</em> on chromosome 22 and <em>FLI1</em> on chromosome 11 (ie, a t(11;22) translocation).&nbsp; This results in a fusion protein that functions as an abnormal transcription factor and leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with Ewing sarcoma are most commonly adolescents who have chronic, localized pain that is often worse at night and does not respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.&nbsp; Physical activity may be limited, particularly if a pathologic fracture is present.&nbsp; The most commonly affected sites are the <strong>long bone diaphyses</strong> (eg, femur, tibia, humerus), pelvis, and axial skeleton.&nbsp; Local erythema, warmth, and swelling are common, and a tender soft tissue mass may be present on examination.</p><br><br><p>Systemic findings (eg, fever, weight loss) often indicate metastatic disease.&nbsp; Asymmetric breath sounds or rales may suggest spread to the lungs, the most common site for metastasis.&nbsp; Additional findings, such as petechiae and peripheral neuropathy, suggest the presence of bone marrow metastasis and central nervous system metastasis, respectively.</p>\n<h1>Evaluation</h1><br><br><p>The initial step in evaluation is imaging, typically x-ray first, then MRI:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>X-ray (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L103019.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) shows the following:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Poorly defined, permeative <strong>(\"moth-eaten\") lytic lesion</strong> seen as multiple or coalesced lucencies within a long bone diaphysis, pelvis, or axial skeleton.</li>\n\t\t<li>Aggressive, lamellated periosteal reaction consisting of concentric layers of new bone <strong>(\"onion skinning\")</strong>.&nbsp; Other nonspecific, aggressive periosteal reactions suggestive of rapid tumor growth (eg, Codman triangle) can occur.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>MRI is performed after x-ray to evaluate tumor extension into the bone, growth plate, and/or soft tissue (eg, nerves, blood vessels).&nbsp; MRI is also performed for surgical planning because it can identify necrotic or hypervascular areas that should be avoided during surgery.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation shows the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inflammatory markers (eg, ESR, CRP) are often elevated, especially in patients with systemic symptoms.</li>\n\t<li>Lactate dehydrogenase may be elevated, reflecting overall tumor burden.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis and pathology</h1><br><br><p>Biopsy is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, and histopathology shows sheets of uniform, small, round, blue cells with scant cytoplasm separated by fibrous septa and patches of necrosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L3284.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
