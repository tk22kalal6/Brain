It is a medical emergency that requires prompt intervention (ie, reduction) due to the risk of neurovascular compromise, which can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head and nerve palsies.</p>\n<h1>Anatomy&nbsp;</h1><br><br><p>The hip, a stable ball-and-socket joint formed by the femoral head (the ball) and the acetabulum (the socket), is able to withstand substantial mechanical forces (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L37336.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The joint's stability is supported by the depth of the acetabulum, the cartilaginous labrum, the fibrous joint capsule, and the surrounding muscles (eg, gluteal muscles, rectus femoris) and ligaments (eg, iliofemoral, ischiofemoral).<p></p><br><br><p>The dominant blood supply to the femoral head and neck is from the medial femoral circumflex artery and its branches (eg, retinacular arteries).&nbsp; Injury to these vessels from a hip fracture or dislocation can impair perfusion and result in avascular necrosis (ie, bone ischemia leading to bone death) of the femoral head.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Hip dislocations typically result from a force exerted on the hip joint that disrupts the normal alignment between the femoral head and the acetabulum (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59821.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Dislocation of a native (non-prosthetic) hip typically requires a high-energy traumatic injury.&nbsp; Prosthetic hips are inherently less stable and can dislocate with less force, as many of the anatomic stabilizing structures are either disrupted or replaced during surgery.<p></p><br><br><p>There are two main types of dislocations:</p>\n<h2>Posterior dislocations</h2><br><br><p>Posterior dislocations are the most common (90% of cases) type of hip dislocation and occur when the femoral head is forced out of the acetabulum in a backward (posterior) direction.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>They generally occur in <strong>head-on motor vehicle collisions</strong> in which a bent knee strikes the dashboard while the hip is flexed and abducted.</li>\n\t<li>They may also be associated with posterior acetabulum fractures, femoral head fractures, <strong>sciatic nerve injury</strong>, and <strong>avascular necrosis of the femoral head</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L65137.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Anterior dislocations&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><br><br><p>Anterior dislocations are less common and occur when the femoral head is displaced forward (anterior) with respect to the acetabulum.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>These dislocations can occur when a significant hyperextension force is exerted on an abducted and externally rotated hip, such as in sports injuries (eg, skiing) or falls.</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>They may also be associated with acetabular fractures or injury to the femoral artery or femoral nerve (uncommon).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Due to the significant force required to cause native hip dislocations, there is a high risk of concomitant traumatic injuries, such as pelvic ring fractures (eg, pubic rami, sacroiliac joint), acetabulum fractures, femoral head fractures, femoral shaft fractures, knee dislocation, ligament/meniscus injury, patella fractures, and intraabdominal injuries.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The following factors increase the risk of hip dislocation:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>High-velocity trauma:&nbsp; Motor vehicle accidents, falls from height, and sports injuries are common causes.</li>\n\t<li>Weakness or laxity of hip ligaments:&nbsp; Prior hip surgery or conditions like hip dysplasia can predispose individuals to dislocation.</li>\n\t<li>Previous hip dislocation:&nbsp; Once a hip has dislocated, it may be more prone to future dislocations due to injury/disruption of native stabilizers.</li>\n\t<li>Prosthetic hip joint:&nbsp; Patients with total hip arthroplasty have an increased risk due to the altered joint mechanics and decreased ligamentous support.</li>\n\t<li>Female sex (twice as likely).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Symptoms of a hip dislocation include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pain:&nbsp; severe hip or groin pain, exacerbated by any attempt to move the affected limb</li>\n\t<li>Immobility:&nbsp; unable to bear weight on the affected leg</li>\n\t<li>Deformity:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Posterior dislocation</strong>:&nbsp; The leg is typically <strong>shortened</strong> and <strong>internally rotated</strong>, with the <strong>hip held in flexion and adduction</strong>.&nbsp; The femoral head may be palpable in the gluteal area.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Anterior dislocation</strong>:&nbsp; The leg may appear <strong>externally rotated</strong> and <strong>abducted</strong>.&nbsp; The femoral head may be palpable in the femoral triangle.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Neurologic deficits:&nbsp; Numbness or weakness in the leg may indicate nerve impingement.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Sciatic nerve injury (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24729.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; may be caused by posterior hip dislocation, resulting in weakness of knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion, decreased ankle reflex, and decreased sensation over the posterior thigh, lateral calf, and foot.</li>\n\t\t<li>Femoral nerve injury (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24727.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; may be caused by anterior hip dislocation, resulting in decreased sensation over the thigh, weakness of quadriceps muscles, and loss of knee reflexes</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Acetabular fracture</strong>:&nbsp; can occur in association with a hip dislocation but may also present alone with hip pain and inability to bear weight.&nbsp; X-ray or CT can identify an acetabular fracture with or without dislocation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Femoral shaft fracture</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24541.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; generally results from high-energy trauma, presenting with deformity of the thigh, severe swelling, ecchymosis, and leg shortening, without hip joint displacement.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hip sprain</strong>:&nbsp; may cause hip pain and difficulty ambulating without the gross deformity seen in dislocations.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Femoral neck fracture</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L58836.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; the leg typically appears shortened and externally, rather than internally, rotated (eg, due to contraction of the psoas and iliacus without the normal acetabular counterforce).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of hip dislocation is typically based on a history of trauma resulting in severe hip pain, deformity and inability to ambulate.&nbsp; Imaging that reveals displacement of the femoral head outside the acetabulum confirms the diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Displacement of the femoral head from the acetabulum can be visualized with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>X-ray</strong>:&nbsp; initial imaging modality to evaluate for hip dislocation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59447.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Anteroposterior (AP) x-ray is usually diagnostic, but additional lateral views may be necessary to differentiate a posterior from an anterior dislocation.&nbsp; In addition, x-rays can assess for associated acetabular and femoral head/neck fractures, as these can impair successful closed reduction.</li>\n\t<li><strong>CT scan</strong>:&nbsp; can better evaluate for femoral or acetabular fractures (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L95914.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; A CT scan may be the first-line imaging modality in severe trauma if serious injuries to the abdomen or pelvis are also suspected.&nbsp; A post-reduction CT scan can confirm adequate realignment and assess for fractures incurred during reduction attempts.&nbsp; However, it has limited utility in evaluating prosthetic hips due to streak artifacts.</li>\n\t<li><strong>MRI</strong>:&nbsp; May be performed post-reduction to assess for soft tissue injuries, labral tears, and disruption of joint capsule integrity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Although not diagnostic, laboratory tests may be obtained as part of a trauma evaluation:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count (CBC):&nbsp; to assess for blood loss and thrombocytopenia, especially if there are associated fractures or other traumatic injuries</li>\n\t<li>Electrolytes and renal function:&nbsp; important if sedation (for reduction procedure) or surgery is anticipated</li>\n\t<li>Coagulation profile:&nbsp; essential for the preoperative evaluation for patients on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Treatment of hip dislocation requires expedited reduction to reduce complications.</p>\n<h2>Initial stabilization</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Immediate immobilization</strong> of the affected leg to reduce pain and prevent further injury</li>\n\t<li>Analgesia to manage pain</li>\n\t<li>Thorough assessment for concomitant traumatic injuries that may require immediate intervention (eg, peritonitis, open book pelvic fracture)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Closed reduction&nbsp;</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Indicated for <strong>hip dislocation <u>without</u> associated fractures</strong></li>\n\t<li>Should be attempted promptly, ideally within 6 hours, because a prolonged dislocation significantly increases the risk of avascular necrosis; patients with any sign of neurovascular compromise (eg, sensory changes) require immediate reduction</li>\n\t<li>Typically requires conscious sedation to obtain adequate muscular relaxation for reduction</li>\n\t<li>Involves the use of traction/counter traction forces to reposition the femoral head into the acetabulum; failure to achieve closed reduction warrants a CT scan to assess for fractures or other soft tissues injuries that may have hindered the reduction</li>\n\t<li>Successful reduction should be followed by complete neurovascular examination to rule out new deficits related to the reduction, then a repeat x-ray or CT scan to confirm realignment</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Surgical intervention (ie, open reduction)</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Indicated for <strong>hip dislocation <u>with</u> associated fracture</strong>, failed closed reduction, or post-reduction neurovascular deficits&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Internal fixation may be required if stability cannot be achieved with reduction alone (eg, acetabular fractures)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Post-reduction management</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Immobilize the legs in slight abduction (eg, pad between the thighs)</li>\n\t<li>Hospitalization required for pain control and bed rest (timeline of non-weight bearing varies based on the injury and patient characteristics)</li>\n\t<li>Physical therapy to restore strength, range of motion, and reduce stiffness</li>\n\t<li>Follow-up imaging to evaluate for development of avascular necrosis in cases of delayed reduction (radiographic changes may not be apparent on imaging for several months)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis and complications </h1><br><br><p>Prognosis largely depends on the speed of reduction, the presence of associated fractures, and the severity of the injury.&nbsp; Potential complications include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Avascular necrosis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L47837.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; risk is significantly higher when reduction is delayed beyond 6 hours, and with open reductions or &gt;3 closed reduction attempts&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Post-traumatic arthritis</strong>:&nbsp; increased risk in patients with fractures or cartilage damage</li>\n\t<li>Recurrent dislocations:&nbsp; more common in patients with underlying joint instability or laxity and may result due to disruption of supporting ligaments</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nerve injury</strong>:&nbsp; sciatic nerve injury, especially with posterior dislocations; most neuropraxia due to temporary nerve impingement resolves with time, but some nerve injury is permanent</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary&nbsp;</h1><br><br><p>Hip dislocation is a severe injury typically resulting from high-energy trauma.&nbsp; It requires prompt reduction, within 6 hours, to prevent long term consequences, including avascular necrosis of the femoral head.&nbsp; Closed reduction under conscious sedation is typically performed in patients without associated hip fractures, but surgical intervention may be required with more severe injuries or when closed attempts fail.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
