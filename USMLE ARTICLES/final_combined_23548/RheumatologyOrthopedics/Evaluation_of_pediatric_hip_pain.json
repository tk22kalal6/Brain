Some features overlap, but each category has distinct features that help both to confirm the more likely diagnosis and to determine the next step in management.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Mechanical conditions</strong>:&nbsp; Present with pain that can be acute or chronic and referred to the ipsilateral knee.&nbsp; The pain is usually worse with activity.&nbsp; Generally, no associated systemic symptoms are present, and inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are normal.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infectious conditions</strong>:&nbsp; Present with acute, localized pain that is worse with activity and impairs ambulation.&nbsp; Associated findings include fever, leukocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Autoimmune conditions</strong>:&nbsp; Present with subtle pain that progresses gradually and is often episodic (exacerbations).&nbsp; Other joints can be involved, and patients may develop joint stiffness that is worse with rest, although ambulation is generally preserved.&nbsp; Other organ systems can be involved, including the skin (rash, nail changes), eyes (uveitis), and kidneys.&nbsp; Laboratory findings include elevated inflammatory markers.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition, malignancy (eg, osteoid osteoma) is a less common cause of pediatric hip pain, generally presenting as chronic pain that worsens at night and is sometimes&nbsp; associated with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue).&nbsp; Finally, trauma can present with acute pediatric hip pain, often with overlying skin changes (eg, bruising, swelling) and other associated injuries, depending on the mechanism of injury.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation and diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Clinical presentation varies, depending on the underlying condition.&nbsp; In most cases, evaluation begins with a thorough history to better characterize the pain (eg, onset, location, duration), which is the first step in determining the cause.&nbsp; Acute pain, for example, is more consistent with infection or trauma, whereas chronic pain suggests an autoimmune or mechanical etiology.&nbsp; In addition to the history, objective physical examination, laboratory results, and radiographic findings help determine the diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Gait:&nbsp; Inability to bear weight is concerning for serious pathology.</li>\n\t<li>Positioning:&nbsp; A hip kept in flexion, abduction, and external rotation suggests increased intraarticular pressure, usually from joint effusion.</li>\n\t<li>Range of motion:&nbsp; Pain or resistance to internal rotation further suggests intraarticular involvement.</li>\n\t<li>Overlying skin changes:&nbsp; Erythema and warmth point toward inflammation or infection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Laboratory and imaging studies</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count:&nbsp; Can show leukocytosis in infectious and autoimmune conditions; cytopenias suggest bone marrow suppression, possibly due to malignancy.</li>\n\t<li>Inflammatory markers:&nbsp; Elevated in infectious and autoimmune conditions.</li>\n\t<li>Lactate dehydrogenase:&nbsp; Elevated in malignancy due to increased cell turnover.</li>\n\t<li>Targeted testing:&nbsp; May be warranted depending on clinical findings (eg, arthrocentesis for suspected septic arthritis).</li>\n\t<li>Radiographs:&nbsp; Used to evaluate skeletal abnormalities such as fractures and tumors.</li>\n\t<li>Ultrasonography:&nbsp; Can evaluate for joint effusion.</li>\n\t<li>MRI:&nbsp; Provides the highest-resolution image for intraarticular and soft tissue causes.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These laboratory and imaging studies can identify conditions requiring immediate intervention (eg, septic arthritis) while also guiding management of less urgent conditions.</p>\n<h1>Common etiologies of pediatric hip pain</h1><h2>Mechanical: Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pathogenesis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35460.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Legg-Calvé-Perthes (LCP) disease involves idiopathic avascular necrosis of the femoral head, likely due to recurrent ischemia of the femoral head.&nbsp; LCP disease classically occurs in boys age 3-12, with a peak incidence at age 6.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clinical presentation</strong>:&nbsp; Involves insidious, unilateral hip pain that can be referred to the thigh or knee and an antalgic gait.&nbsp; In severe cases, hip abduction and internal rotation are restricted, and proximal thigh atrophy and Trendelenburg sign (pelvis drops on contralateral side with ambulation) are present (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25370.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Diagnosis</strong>:&nbsp;
