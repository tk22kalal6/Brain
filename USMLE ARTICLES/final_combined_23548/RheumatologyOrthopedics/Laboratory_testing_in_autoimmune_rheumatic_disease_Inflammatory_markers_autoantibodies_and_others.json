However, interpreting these tests can be complex.&nbsp; Autoantibodies can be present in multiple disorders and even in healthy individuals, so serologic testing alone is rarely diagnostic.&nbsp; Therefore, serologic tests should be used in conjunction with clinical presentation and pretest probability for accurate diagnosis.&nbsp; This article reviews some of the most useful autoantibodies and other markers used in the evaluation of rheumatic disease.</p>\n<h1>Sample type</h1><br><br><p>Serology, broadly, refers to laboratory tests using patient serum (blood samples from which the cells and coagulation proteins have been precipitated).&nbsp; In common usage, however, the term \"serology\" usually specifies testing for antibodies that may be present in serum.&nbsp; Serum samples are generally easy to handle and can be kept refrigerated for several days in case follow-up testing is requested.</p><br><br><p>Plasma differs from serum in that plasma also includes components of the coagulation cascade.&nbsp; Plasma samples are not suitable for use in certain laboratory devices and are somewhat less stable than serum samples but may be required if measurement of coagulation proteins is needed.&nbsp; Whole blood (a sample that includes both plasma and blood cells) is not typically used for antibody testing but has utility in other types of testing.</p>\n<h1>Inflammatory/acute phase markers</h1><br><br><p>Acute phase reactants are circulating proteins whose number is increased in response to inflammation or severe illness (eg, infection, trauma).&nbsp; These proteins have a variety of functions in immune regulation, infection control, hemostasis, and other acute responses to disease.</p><br><br><p>Clinical assays for acute phase reactants and other markers of inflammation are widely used in the management of autoimmune rheumatic disease.&nbsp; With limited exceptions, these tests have low specificity for any particular rheumatic disorder but can be used to assess disease activity and response to treatment.&nbsp; Notable exceptions include polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell (temporal) arteritis; these disorders do not have a specific antibody test to confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp; However, in appropriate patients, an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be adequate to make a provisional diagnosis and initiate treatment.</p><br><br><p>Major inflammatory markers include CRP, ESR, fibrinogen, ferritin, haptoglobin, and complement:</p>\n<h2>C-reactive protein</h2><br><br><p>CRP is an innate immune protein that is named for its ability to bind the C polysaccharide of <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>.&nbsp; It functions in nonimmunoglobulin opsonization of bacterial pathogens.&nbsp; Expression of CRP in the liver is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1) in response to infection and inflammatory states.&nbsp; Many laboratories offer 2 CRP assays:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A standard assay for use in assessing inflammatory disorders.</li>\n\t<li>A high-sensitivity assay used primarily to predict the risk for cardiac events in patients with coronary atherosclerosis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate</h2><br><br><p>ESR measures the velocity of precipitation (in millimeters per hour) of red blood cells in a standardized sample tube.&nbsp; ESR reflects total serum levels of immunoglobulins and inflammatory proteins, which induce the formation of streamlined aggregations of red blood cells that precipitate rapidly (ie, rouleaux formation).&nbsp; However, it is also affected by red blood cell morphology and concentration, as well as noninflammatory proteins.&nbsp; ESR correlates roughly with CRP level, and the tests are largely redundant.&nbsp; However, because ESR normalizes more slowly than CRP with resolution of inflammation, CRP has greater utility in following the response to treatment.</p>\n<h2>Fibrinogen</h2><br><br><p>Fibrinogen is a coagulation factor that is produced in the liver and upregulated in response to tissue injury and inflammation.</p>\n<h2>Ferritin</h2><br><br><p>Ferritin is a circulating protein that functions in the storage and transport of iron; baseline levels correlate roughly with iron stores.&nbsp; In addition, by sequestering free iron, ferritin limits microbial growth and reduces oxidative injury to tissues.&nbsp; Levels typically rise quickly in response to severe infection and other inflammatory states.</p>\n<h2>Haptoglobin</h2><br><br><p>Haptoglobin is another iron-sequestering protein that suppresses bacterial infection and minimizes oxidative injury to tissues.</p>\n<h2>Complement (C3, C4, CH<font size=\"2\"><sub>50</sub></font>)</h2><br><br><p>The complement cascade is a set of proteins that contributes to both the innate and adaptive immune response (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73760.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Complement proteins attract immune cells, opsonize pathogens, and directly lyse bacteria.&nbsp; C3 and C4 are acute phase reactants, and levels of these proteins can be elevated in inflammatory states.&nbsp; However, disorders that generate large quantities of immune complexes (eg, SLE) can deplete complement, and C3 and C4 may be low.&nbsp; Levels may also be low at baseline in patients with complement deficiencies.&nbsp; CH<font size=\"2\"><sub>50</sub></font> (50% hemolytic complement) is a functional test that measures overall activity of the classical pathway of the complement system; specifically, it measures the ability of patient serum to lyse antibody-coated sheep red blood cells.<p></p>\n<h1>Autoantibody tests</h1><h2>Testing and reporting methods</h2><br><br><p>Most autoantibody assays use an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a similar technique.&nbsp; In ELISA-based tests, a target antigen is fixed to a solid substrate (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L30282.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; An aliquot of patient serum is added and allowed to react with the antigen; then it is gently washed; antibodies against the target antigen remain bound to the substrate.&nbsp; A signal antibody (eg, linked to a colorimetric enzyme) that binds human immunoglobulin is then added, followed by a colorimetric reagent.&nbsp; The color change can then be read by a technician or standardized meter (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/17407.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Results of antibody tests can be reported as either a reactive level (strength of the test signal measured in the assay) or a titer (patient serum is put through serial dilutions, and the most dilute sample that generates a positive result is reported).</p><br><br><p>Commonly used rheumatic autoantibody tests include antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs), antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), and myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) and myositis-associated antibodies (MAAs).</p>\n<h2>Antinuclear antibodies</h2><br><br><p>ANAs refer to antibodies against various nuclear antigens.&nbsp; ANA testing is classically used as an initial step in the diagnosis of SLE, but positive results also occur in numerous other autoimmune disorders, as well as in many healthy individuals.&nbsp; ANA assays are most often performed using ELISA.&nbsp; However, ANA can also be assessed with an immunofluorescence assay using Hep-2 cells; the pattern under microscopy correlates somewhat with certain disease associations (eg, speckled pattern suggests SLE or Sjögren disease, typical centromere pattern in limited scleroderma).</p><br><br><p>ANA has a number of submarkers with additional utility.&nbsp; In some laboratories, a reflex cascade can be ordered to test for additional autoantibodies if the initial ANA result is positive.&nbsp; However, patients sometimes have a negative (general) ANA assay but positive results for specific subtype antibodies; therefore, directed testing for individual autoantibodies is often appropriate.&nbsp; Clinically useful antibodies include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Anti–double-stranded DNA</strong>:&nbsp; Has lower sensitivity for SLE than ANA but much higher specificity (&gt;90%).&nbsp; Levels correlate with disease activity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti–ribosome P</strong>:&nbsp; Highly specific for SLE and carries an increased risk for CNS involvement.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti-Smith (anti-Sm)</strong>:&nbsp; Targets small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and has low sensitivity but high specificity for SLE.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti-histone</strong>:&nbsp; Found in 95% of patients with drug-induced lupus, as well as about half of patients with idiopathic SLE.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti-SSA/Ro</strong> and <strong>anti-SSB/La</strong>:&nbsp; Support the diagnosis of Sjögren disease and are seen in SLE and many other connective tissue disorders.&nbsp; Maternal anti-SSA is associated with an increased risk for congenital heart block.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti–topoisomerase I (anti–Scl-70)</strong>:&nbsp; Seen in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis/scleroderma and associated with a higher risk for scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anticentromere</strong>:&nbsp; Strongly associated with limited scleroderma (eg, CREST syndrome [<strong>C</strong>alcinosis, <strong>R</strong>aynaud phenomenon, <strong>E</strong>sophageal dysmotility, <strong>S</strong>clerodactyly, and <strong>T</strong>elangiectasia]).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antiribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP/anti-U1RNP)</strong>:&nbsp; High sensitivity for mixed connective tissue disease.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti–Jo-1</strong>:&nbsp; The most common of a set of antibodies against aminoacyl–transfer-RNA synthetases.&nbsp; These antibodies are a hallmark of antisynthetase syndrome, an inflammatory myopathy that is frequently associated with extramuscular manifestations (eg, interstitial lung disease, arthritis, Raynaud syndrome).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The extractable nuclear antigens are a set of proteins that are so named because they can be extracted from the nucleus with neutral buffers.&nbsp; Antibody assays for this ANA subset (ie, anti-SSA and anti-SSB, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti–Scl-70, anti–Jo-1) are often ordered as a panel.</p>\n<h2>Rheumatoid factor</h2><br><br><p>RF is an antibody against the Fc portion of the heavy chain of IgG.&nbsp; It is classically used in the diagnosis of RA; depending on the prevalence in the population studied, it has a sensitivity of 65%-75% and specificity of 70%-80%.&nbsp; However, a large portion of the healthy population has a positive RF test, and positive results should be followed up with more specific assays (eg, anti-CCP).</p>\n<h2>Anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide</h2><br><br><p>Anti-CCP is used primarily for the diagnosis of RA.&nbsp; The sensitivity is similar to that of RF, but the specificity is higher (up to 95%).&nbsp; \"Seronegative RA\" refers to RA with negative tests for both RF and anti-CCP.</p>\n<h2>Antiphospholipid antibodies</h2><br><br><p>APLAs are a category of autoantibodies that target phospholipids and associated proteins.&nbsp; These autoantibodies are a hallmark of antiphospholipid syndrome, a prothrombotic condition characterized by recurrent venous (eg, deep vein thrombosis) and arterial (eg, stroke) thrombosis and pregnancy complications (eg, recurrent miscarriage).&nbsp; Antiphospholipid syndrome can occur alone or as a manifestation of SLE and other autoimmune disorders.&nbsp; The main tests used in the diagnosis of APLA-related disorders include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Anti–beta-2-glycoprotein I (IgG and IgM).</li>\n\t<li>Anticardiolipin antibody (IgG and IgM).</li>\n\t<li>Lupus anticoagulant (LA):&nbsp; A functional assay based on a standard coagulation assay (eg, activated PTT, dilute Russell viper venom time).&nbsp; LA causes a prolonged coagulation time that does not normalize with the addition of normal plasma (ie, the prolonged coagulation time is due to a coagulation inhibitor rather than deficiency of a coagulation factor).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because nontreponemal syphilis tests (eg, rapid plasmin reagent, VDRL) use bovine cardiolipin, patients with anticardiolipin antibodies can have a false-positive test.&nbsp; Therefore, in the evaluation of syphilis, a positive result on a nontreponemal test should be followed by a confirmatory treponemal test (eg, fluorescent treponemal antibody–absorption).</p>\n<h2>Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies</h2><br><br><p>ANCAs are a group of autoantibodies against certain enzymes in neutrophil granules and are seen in several uncommon vasculitic disorders.&nbsp; ANCAs can be detected using neutrophil-based immunofluorescence microscopy, or ELISA can be used for the major ANCA antigens (ie, anti–proteinase 3 [anti-PR3], antimyeloperoxidase [anti-MPO]).&nbsp; The staining pattern on immunofluorescence correlates with the specific antigens and somewhat with individual vasculitic disorders.&nbsp; Major ANCA patterns include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cytoplasmic (c-ANCA)</strong>:&nbsp; Staining is seen throughout the cytoplasm.&nbsp; It is typically associated with anti-PR3 and suggests granulomatosis with polyangiitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Perinuclear (p-ANCA)</strong>:&nbsp; Staining is most prominent around the nucleus.&nbsp; It is typically associated with anti-MPO and suggests microscopic polyangiitis or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Myositis-specific and myositis-associated antibodies</h2><br><br><p>MSAs and MAAs are categories of autoantibodies associated with the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (eg, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, antisynthetase syndrome).&nbsp; Assays for these antibodies can be performed individually but are often ordered as a set for patients with myopathic symptoms.&nbsp; Major MSAs include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Anti–Jo-1</strong>:&nbsp; Associated with antisynthetase syndrome (see above).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti–signal recognition particle (anti-SRP)</strong>:&nbsp; Associated with severe myositis with necrotic myopathy and poor response to treatment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti-Mi2</strong>:&nbsp; Associated with severe, rapid-onset dermatomyositis that often responds well to treatment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti–transcriptional intermediary factor 1-gamma</strong>:&nbsp; Associated with dermatomyositis, especially paraneoplastic dermatomyositis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti–melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5</strong>:&nbsp; Associated with amyopathic dermatomyositis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anti-PM/Scl-75</strong> and <strong>anti-PM/Scl-100</strong>:&nbsp; Associated with an overlap syndrome with features of scleroderma and inflammatory myositis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Cryoglobulins</h1><br><br><p>Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate from serum at temperatures &lt;37 C (98.6 F) and resolubilize with warming.&nbsp; Cryoglobulins can form immune complexes that deposit within small- to medium-sized blood vessels, triggering inflammation and tissue damage (ie, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis).&nbsp; In addition, cryoglobulins can increase serum viscosity, leading to mechanical occlusion of the microcirculation.</p><br><br><p>Cryoglobulinemia is classified into 3 types based on immunoglobulin composition:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Type I</strong>:&nbsp; Single monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgM or IgG), usually associated with lymphoproliferative disorders (eg, multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Type II</strong>:&nbsp; Mixed cryoglobulins comprising monoclonal IgM with RF activity and polyclonal IgG and strongly linked to chronic hepatitis C virus infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Type III</strong>:&nbsp; Mixed polyclonal IgM and IgG, typically associated with autoimmune diseases (eg, SLE, Sjögren syndrome) or chronic infections.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Cryoglobulin testing requires that samples be handled at ≥37 C (98.6 F) during processing.&nbsp; The blood sample is allowed to clot to precipitate cryoglobulins.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory assessment of the autoimmune rheumatic diseases involves measurement of inflammatory/acute phase markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein).&nbsp; These are nonspecific tests that correlate with disease activity and serologic tests that identify certain autoantibodies that are specific for diagnosis of the individual diseases (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/50395.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; However, serologic tests alone are not adequate for diagnosis in most cases and must be interpreted in the context of patient presentation.&nbsp; Antinuclear antibody is the primary initial test for systemic lupus erythematosus, but positive results are seen in many other autoimmune diseases, as well as in some healthy individuals.&nbsp; A positive result can be followed by measuring antinuclear antibody subsets (eg, anti–double-stranded DNA) and other serologic markers that have greater specificity.&nbsp; Rheumatoid factor and anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide are the primary serologic tests in the evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
