It arises from abnormal contact between the acetabulum and proximal femur, disrupting development and resulting in instability of the hip joint.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Proper hip joint development requires normal contact between the acetabulum and femoral head, which facilitates reciprocal induction (ie, the 2 interacting tissues are each inducers for the other's development).&nbsp; Disruption of this contact impedes normal hip development, resulting in a shallow hip socket and inadequate support of the femoral head.&nbsp; Risk factors include both mechanical forces and genetic factors.</p><br><br><p><strong>Mechanical forces</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Before birth</strong>:&nbsp; Near the end of pregnancy, the femur's normal rapid growth results in the acetabular roof having limited coverage of the femoral head.&nbsp; Therefore, normal hip joint contact is easily disrupted by any mechanical force (eg, adduction) that directs the femoral head away from the central portion of the acetabulum.&nbsp; A common risk factor is breech positioning, which can accentuate this process by limiting fetal movement.</li>\n\t<li><strong>After birth</strong>:&nbsp; External mechanical forces that put the hips in adduction and extension (eg, improper swaddling (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26385.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and narrow-base car seats (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26386.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )) can also inhibit normal hip joint development by disrupting normal joint contact.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Genetic factors</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Female sex:&nbsp;

Hip <strong>ultrasound</strong> is preferred due to ability to visualize cartilaginous structures (the femoral head and acetabulum are not sufficiently ossified to visualize on radiographs prior to age 4 months).&nbsp; Hip ultrasound at age &lt;6 weeks may be difficult to interpret due to immature acetabular development and expected joint capsular laxity in the first few weeks of life.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Age &gt;4 months</strong>:&nbsp; Hip <strong>radiographs</strong> help assess joint alignment given that the femoral head and acetabulum are now ossified and can be visualized.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The goal of treatment is to provide an optimal environment for the femoral head and acetabulum to develop by obtaining and maintaining proper alignment.&nbsp; The methods utilized depend on patient age.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Age &lt;6 months</strong>:&nbsp; If age &lt;1 month, mild laxity may be monitored for spontaneous resolution.&nbsp;
