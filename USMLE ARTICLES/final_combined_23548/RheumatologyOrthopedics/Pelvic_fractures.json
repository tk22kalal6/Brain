Severe pelvic fractures most often result from high-energy trauma, such as motor vehicle collisions, and are frequently associated with pelvic organ and vascular injuries (eg, hemorrhage).&nbsp; Low-energy trauma (eg, fall from standing) may cause pelvic fractures in elderly patients with osteoporotic bones (ie, fragility fractures), but these are typically stable fractures with a lower risk for complications.</p>\n<h1>Anatomy</h1><br><br><p>The pelvis is a stable, rigid ring of bones that includes the sacrum, coccyx, and hip bones (ie, ilium, ischium, and pubis) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L118881.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The strength of the pelvic ring is maintained by multiple ligaments, including the symphyseal ligaments that stabilize the anterior pubic symphysis and the posterior sacroiliac ligaments that stabilize the posterior pelvic ring.<p></p><br><br><p>There are multiple important structures within the pelvis that can be injured with pelvic fractures:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Visceral organs:&nbsp; rectum/anus, bladder/urethra, uterus/ovaries, vagina, and prostate.</li>\n\t<li>Veins:&nbsp; The presacral venous plexus (located anterior to the sacrum) is a common source of bleeding in pelvic trauma.</li>\n\t<li>Arteries:&nbsp; external and internal iliac arteries and their branches.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>The posterior branches of the internal iliac artery (eg, superior gluteal, iliolumbar and lateral sacral) overlie the sacroiliac joint and are susceptible to injury with posterior pelvic fractures.</li>\n\t\t<li>The anterior branches of the internal iliac artery (eg, internal pudendal and obturator) can be damaged in fractures of the pubic rami.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Nerves:&nbsp; Injury to the lumbosacral plexus (arising from nerve roots L4 through S3) and the sacral nerves can result in neurologic deficits including numbness, weakness, bowel/bladder incontinence, and sexual dysfunction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Pelvic fractures occur when excessive force is applied to the pelvic bones, exceeding their structural integrity.&nbsp; Fractures can be classified into two broad categories:&nbsp; stable and unstable, depending on whether the pelvic ring structure is maintained.</p>\n<h2>Stable pelvic fractures</h2><br><br><p>Stable pelvic fractures usually occur with <strong>low-energy trauma</strong> such as a fall from standing, particularly in patients with decreased bone density (eg, osteopenia, osteoporosis, long-term corticosteroid therapy).</p><br><br><p>These fractures do <em>not</em> disrupt the continuity of the pelvic ring and typically involve one fracture that is nondisplaced.&nbsp; Because the pelvic ring is not disrupted, the major pelvic structures are less likely to be affected; therefore these fractures are less likely to cause hemodynamic instability or significant complications.</p><br><br><p>Examples include isolated pubic ramus fractures, iliac wing fractures, and avulsion fractures (seen in young athletes who suddenly and forcefully contract a muscle [eg, hamstring] that pulls off a small bony fragment at the muscle's attachment site [eg, ischial tuberosity]).</p>\n<h2>Unstable pelvic fracture</h2><br><br><p>Unstable pelvic fractures typically occur with <strong>high-energy trauma</strong>, such as:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Motor vehicle collisions</strong> (most common cause)</li>\n\t<li>Falls from heights</li>\n\t<li>Crush injuries</li>\n\t<li>Sports injuries (less common but possible in contact sports)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These fractures cause disruption of the pelvic ring due to <strong>fractures in &gt;2 places</strong> (often associated with significant loss of ligamentous stability) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10336.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Because of this, the major pelvic structures are at risk of injury and these fractures are associated with a <strong>high-risk for life threatening complications</strong>, including:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Massive hemorrhage</strong>:&nbsp; Shearing of the presacral venous plexus by pelvic ring instability is a common source of severe bleeding in pelvic injuries.&nbsp; Rapid and massive blood loss can occur into the widened pelvic space, which is unable to effectively tamponade the bleeding.&nbsp; Extension of bleeding into the retroperitoneum can further exacerbate the rapid hemorrhage.&nbsp; Arterial injury (eg, superior gluteal artery) can also occur but is far less common than venous hemorrhage.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pelvic organ injury</strong>:&nbsp; Pelvic organs can be injured by a high pressure force (eg, bladder rupture from a direct blow to the lower abdomen) or when a sharp fracture fragment pierces the viscera wall (eg, open fracture of the rectum).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nerve damage</strong>:&nbsp; Injuries to the lumbosacral plexus can result in lower extremity motor and sensory deficits.&nbsp; Sacral nerve injuries may cause bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chest or abdominal injury</strong>:&nbsp; Due to the significant force required to fracture the strong bony pelvis, other body areas are often affected, such as the abdomen (eg, liver injury) or chest (eg, lung contusion).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Examples include an <strong>open book fracture</strong> (ie, widening of the pubic symphysis due to pelvic ring disruption) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10950.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which commonly occurs from an anterior-posterior compression injury such as a head-on motor vehicle collision, and lateral compression injury (t-bone motor vehicle collision) involving fractures of the sacrum, pubic rami, and ilium.<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with pelvic fractures often present after a traumatic injury and have the following clinical findings:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Severe pelvic or groin pain</strong> (hallmark symptom) that may radiate to the back, abdomen, or lower extremities.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pain worsened by movement</strong>:&nbsp; In minor, stable fractures, patients may report difficulty walking or increased pain when attempting to bear weight.&nbsp; In contrast, in severe, unstable pelvic fractures, even minimal movement of the pelvis causes significant pain.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tenderness</strong> on palpation of the pubic symphysis, iliac crests, and/or sacrum.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Visible deformity</strong>:&nbsp; Gross deformity of the pelvis (eg, asymmetry), limb length discrepancy, or internal or external rotation of the affected leg may be present.&nbsp; However, the absence of visible bony abnormality does not rule out a pelvic fracture and imaging should always be obtained.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Examination findings that suggest a <strong>severe, unstable pelvic fracture</strong> include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pelvic instability</strong> on palpation:&nbsp; Compression of the pelvis to assess for bony instability should be done gently and only once, to avoid exacerbating pelvic organ, vascular, or neurologic injuries.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hemodynamic compromise</strong> (eg, tachycardia, hypotension):&nbsp; may indicate significant hemorrhage.</li>\n\t<li>Perineal lacerations and/or blood in the rectal or vaginal vault:&nbsp; may occur from a fracture fragment that perforates through the perineal skin or rectal/vaginal wall (ie, <strong>open fracture</strong>).</li>\n\t<li>Blood at the urethral meatus, gross hematuria, scrotal hematoma, or high-riding prostate on rectal examination:&nbsp; can be associated with <strong>urethral injury</strong> (occurs more often in men) or bladder rupture.</li>\n\t<li>Ecchymosis in the perineum, groin, or scrotum:&nbsp; indicates bleeding into the pelvis and/or retroperitoneum.</li>\n\t<li>Abdominal distension/peritonitis:&nbsp; suggests associated traumatic intraperitoneal injury (eg, spleen, liver).</li>\n\t<li>Flank ecchymosis:&nbsp; may indicate associated renal injury (eg, laceration) or extension of pelvic hemorrhage into the retroperitoneal space.</li>\n\t<li>Sensory or motor deficits of the lower extremities or bowel/bladder incontinence:&nbsp; injury to the lumbosacral plexus/sacral nerves can lead to neurologic deficits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Posterior hip dislocation</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59821.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; typically presents with adduction and internal rotation at the hip.&nbsp; It usually occurs from an axial force on the femur (eg, dashboard injury), and patients may have neurologic manifestations due to involvement of the sciatic nerve.&nbsp; Imaging confirms the diagnosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anterior hip dislocation</strong>:&nbsp; a less common hip dislocation often related to a high-force trauma.&nbsp; Pain and deformity (eg, leg shortening with external rotation) may be similar to a pelvic fracture, but an anteriorly displaced femoral head is seen on imaging.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Femoral neck fractures</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L58836.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Fracture involves the proximal femur rather than the pelvis.&nbsp; The affected leg is often shortened and externally rotated, but imaging differentiates the two conditions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Spinal fractures</strong>:&nbsp; Vertebral fractures may coexist with severe pelvic fractures, especially in cases of high-energy trauma.&nbsp; They commonly cause back pain or neurologic symptoms.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>It is important to note that these injuries can occur with pelvic fractures, so the diagnosis of one does not necessarily rule out the diagnosis of the others.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Suspicion for a pelvic fracture is based on several factors including the mechanism of injury (eg, high-energy trauma), characteristic symptoms (eg, pelvic/groin pain worse with movement), and physical examination findings (eg, pelvis instability, perineal laceration).</p><br><br><p>Imaging is utilized to confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp; X-ray is typically used to quickly evaluate the pelvis in hemodynamically unstable patients.&nbsp; However, CT scan is preferred (if the patient is stable) because it provides more detailed fracture information and can identify vascular or visceral organ injury.</p>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>The following laboratory tests should be obtained in patients with confirmed or suspected pelvic fractures:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count (CBC):&nbsp; assesses for hemorrhage (low hemoglobin and hematocrit).&nbsp; Serial levels are most useful because the initial hemoglobin may not reflect acute blood loss</li>\n\t<li>Coagulation profile:&nbsp; identifies coagulopathy if there is excessive bleeding and/or if the patient requires surgical intervention</li>\n\t<li>Type and crossmatch:&nbsp; blood typing and crossmatching in anticipation of potential transfusions</li>\n\t<li>Urinalysis:&nbsp; screens for hematuria, which suggests bladder or urethral injury</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Imaging studies</h1><br><br><p>Imaging is indicated in all cases of suspected pelvic fracture, because physical examination may not be reliable in patients with mild fractures, or in patients with multiple distracting injuries or altered mental status.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Portable anteroposterior (AP) pelvic x-ray</strong>:&nbsp; initial radiographic test in hemodynamically unstable patients.&nbsp; Quickly identifies an unstable fracture that requires urgent intervention (eg, application of a pelvic binder to reduce pelvis volume).</li>\n\t<li><strong>CT scan of the pelvis</strong> with 3D reconstruction:&nbsp; is the gold standard for diagnosing pelvic fractures.&nbsp; It provides detailed information on fracture patterns and associated injuries (eg, vascular, visceral).</li>\n\t<li>Focused assessment with sonography for trauma <strong>(FAST) examination</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L52602.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; is performed at the bedside during the initial trauma evaluation to assess for other injuries including pericardial effusion and concomitant intraabdominal bleeding.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Retrograde cystourethrogram</strong>:&nbsp; assesses for urethral injury in patients with blood at the urethral meatus, a high riding prostate, perineal hematoma, or hematuria.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of pelvic fractures varies based on the severity of the fracture, the hemodynamic status of the patient, and the presence of associated injuries.</p><br><br><p>All patients with pelvic trauma should be evaluated and managed according to the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocols, with the first priorities being stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation.&nbsp; Appropriate analgesia should also be provided.</p>\n<h2>Management of hemodynamically stable patients</h2><br><br><p>Hemodynamically stable patients with pelvis injuries should undergo <strong>CT scan of the pelvis</strong> to determine the type of pelvic fracture.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Unstable</strong> pelvic fractures (eg, pelvic ring disruption) require <strong>surgical fixation</strong>.&nbsp; A pelvic binder can be placed to limit pelvic mobility and prevent further injury until definitive fracture management.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stable, nondisplaced</strong> fractures (eg, isolated pubic ramus fracture, avulsion fracture) may be <strong>managed conservatively</strong> with pain control, bed rest, and gradual mobilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Management of hemodynamically unstable patients</h2><br><br><p>Hemodynamically unstable patients (ie, systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg) with pelvic injuries require:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Portable pelvic x-ray</strong> (performed first)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Immediate pelvic binding</strong>:&nbsp; Rapid, external stabilization with a pelvic binder should be performed as soon as possible in hemodynamically unstable patients with pelvic fractures.&nbsp; Binding the pelvis (eg, tying a sheet tightly around the pelvis) decreases pelvic volume and promotes tamponade.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Portable chest x-ray and FAST examination</strong>:&nbsp; to rapidly assess for additional injuries and sources of hemorrhage in the chest or abdomen.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Fluid resuscitation</strong>:&nbsp; aggressive fluid resuscitation with crystalloids and blood products <strong>as needed</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Massive transfusion protocol</strong> (MTP):&nbsp; involves rapid administration of equal amounts of red blood cells, plasma and platelets (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to maintain a balanced coagulation profile (ie, prevent coagulopathy) and promote hemostasis.&nbsp; MTP is often utilized in hypotensive patients with severe pelvic fractures and/or abdominal trauma (eg, positive FAST examination) due to the potential for rapid and massive blood loss into these cavities.</li>\n\t<li><strong>+/- Angioembolization</strong>:&nbsp; Patients with severe or persistent bleeding despite resuscitative efforts, may require embolization of bleeding pelvic vessels.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Surgical fixation</strong>:&nbsp; Early stabilization of the fracture with external or internal hardware (plates, screws) is indicated (once hemodynamically stabilized) to prevent further vascular or pelvic organ injury from bony fragments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Management of associated injuries</h2><br><br><p>Common injuries associated with severe pelvic fractures are managed as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Intraperitoneal hemorrhage</strong> (identified on FAST examination or CT scan):&nbsp; requires urgent exploratory laparotomy to manage intraabdominal and pelvic injuries (eg, surgical ligation of bleeding vessels).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bladder or urethral injuries</strong>:&nbsp; Retrograde cystourethrogram is indicated when there is blood at the meatus, gross hematuria, or a high-riding prostate.&nbsp; Injuries to the bladder or urethra may be surgically repaired or conservatively managed, depending on the location and severity of the injury.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Open fractures</strong> (eg, pelvic fracture associated with rectal or vaginal laceration):&nbsp; must be managed aggressively with thorough surgical washout/debridement, bony fixation, tetanus prophylaxis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics to minimize complications (eg, sepsis, osteomyelitis).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of pelvic fractures depends on the severity of the injury and the presence of associated complications.&nbsp; Stable fractures typically have a good prognosis with appropriate pain management and rehabilitation.&nbsp; In contrast, unstable fractures carry a higher risk of morbidity and mortality, particularly if there is significant hemorrhage or associated organ injury.&nbsp; Chronic complications may include chronic pain, gait abnormalities, or neurologic deficits due to nerve injury.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>The clinical presentation of pelvic fractures can range from mild, stable fractures with minimal complications, to severe, unstable fractures that cause life-threatening hemorrhage.&nbsp; Minor fractures may be managed conservatively (eg, pain control, rest), whereas the treatment of unstable fractures focuses on pelvis stabilization, hemorrhage control, and management of associated injuries.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
