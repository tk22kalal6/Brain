Risk factors associated with this condition are those that create an opportunity for the apophysis at the tibial tubercle to be avulsed and include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Young adolescence (typically age 10-14) and growth spurts</strong>:&nbsp; During this time, the bones lengthen at a faster rate than muscles or tendons, leading to greater tension at the tendon attachment points.&nbsp; In addition, compared to the fully ossified tibial tubercle in adults, the developing tibial tubercle is cartilaginous in nature, making it more prone to injury.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Physical activity</strong>:&nbsp; In particular, activities that involve repetitive contraction of the quadriceps muscle (eg, running, jumping, kicking).&nbsp; The quadriceps muscle inserts on the tibial tubercle via the patellar ligament; continued force of the quadriceps results in chronic stress and fragmentation of the tubercle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Progressive pain located a few centimeters inferior to the patella, aggravated by activities that involve knee extension and alleviated with rest</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tenderness and swelling over the tibial tuberosity</strong>, often accompanied by a visible protuberance due to fibrous tissue filling at the avulsed site</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis and evaluation</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of OSD is made clinically based on history and physical examination.&nbsp; Examination typically reveals:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>tenderness, swelling, and a bony prominence at the tibial tubercle (due to fibrous tissue filling at the avulsed site).</li>\n\t<li>pain elicited by engaging/stressing the quadriceps muscles (eg, extending the knee against resistance, squatting).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Imaging is <u>not</u> required for diagnosis but is often performed in patients with an atypical history (eg, acute onset of pain, pain at night, or pain that is unrelieved by rest) or examination (eg, pain not directly over the tibial tubercle, overlying erythema).&nbsp; If a knee radiograph is obtained, findings suggestive of OSD&nbsp; include tibial tubercle fragmentation, irregularity, or elevation away from the shaft (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L105555.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Most patients respond to conservative management aimed at controlling pain and modifying activities until the apophysis completes ossification (between age 14 and 18).&nbsp; This includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Activity modification</strong>:&nbsp; reducing or modifying activities that exacerbate symptoms.&nbsp; Complete avoidance of activities is not recommended as it can increase the risk of recurrence and lead to deconditioning.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pain control</strong>:&nbsp; applying ice and using analgesics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.&nbsp; A protective pad over the tibial tubercle may alleviate symptoms by offloading tension from the tibial tubercle and preventing direct trauma to the tender area.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Physical therapy</strong>:&nbsp; strengthening and stretching exercises directed at the quadriceps and surrounding muscles.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In patients whose condition is unresponsive to conservative management, surgical intervention may be considered.</p>\n<h1>Complications and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>OSD is typically benign, self-limiting, and resolves once the apophysis completely ossifies.&nbsp; Complications are rare, however, symptoms may recur during periods of increased physical activity until skeletal maturity is reached around age 14-18.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) is an overuse injury resulting in chronic avulsion of the apophysis (secondary ossification center) at the tibial tubercle.&nbsp; This disorder generally occurs in physically active children undergoing a rapid growth spurt and is characterized by chronic pain inferior to the knee that is exacerbated by activities involving quadriceps contraction.&nbsp; Conservative management strategies are highly effective, and the prognosis is generally favorable.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
