It is an X-linked disorder caused by a mutation in the <em>FMR1</em> gene on the X chromosome.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>FXS is due to an unstable <strong>CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion</strong> in the <em><strong>FMR1</strong></em> <strong>gene</strong> on the long arm of the X chromosome (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29098.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; <em>FMR1</em> normally has 6-50 CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5′ untranslated region that can potentially expand during meiosis in oocytes.&nbsp; Expansion over generations can lead to &gt;200 CGG trinucleotide repeats (ie, full mutation).&nbsp; This mutation causes hypermethylation of the gene, which silences the gene and prevents transcription of the associated fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP).&nbsp; Because FMRP is involved in the development and plasticity of neurons, silencing of the gene in FXS results in impaired neural development.<p></p><br><br><p>The name \"fragile X\" comes from the fact that, when the cells of affected individuals are cultured in a folate-deficient medium, the area of increased repeats does not stain and appears \"broken\" with a small gap near the tip of the long arm of the X chromosome (hence, fragile X).</p>\n<h1>Genetics and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>FXS is an <strong>X-linked dominant</strong> disorder.&nbsp; The primary risk factor is a family history of the disorder.&nbsp; Female carriers of the <em>FMR1</em> premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) are at risk of having offspring with FXS.&nbsp; Male carriers may pass the premutation to all of their daughters.&nbsp; With the full mutation (&gt;200 CGG repeats), males are more severely affected than females due to the presence of only one X chromosome.&nbsp; Females with the full mutation usually have milder symptoms due to random X-inactivation (eg, silencing of one of the X chromosomes in each cell).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Male individuals typically manifest the features of FXS, whereas female individuals have a milder and variable presentation.&nbsp; Classic findings in male patients include:</p>\n<h2>Physical features</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A long, narrow face (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26380.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )</li>\n\t<li>Prominent forehead and chin</li>\n\t<li>Large ears</li>\n\t<li>Deep-set eyes</li>\n\t<li>Macroorchidism (eg, large testes)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Neuropsychiatric issues</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (eg, inattention, impulsivity)</li>\n\t<li>ASD (eg, poor eye contact, social deficits)</li>\n\t<li>Aggression, anxiety, and self-injurious behavior (eg, hand-biting)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Developmental delay and/or intellectual disability</h2><br><br><p>These can range in severity from mild to severe.</p><br><br><p>Infants and young children typically present with subtle signs of FXS.&nbsp; They may present with a mild developmental delay, including delayed achievement of motor and language milestones.&nbsp; Delayed language development is the most common finding, with particular difficulty in expressive language.&nbsp; Approximately 10% of children with FXS are completely nonverbal.&nbsp; Neurobehavioral features, such as ADHD and ASD, may become apparent in early childhood.&nbsp; Other physical signs that may be present in younger children include macrocephaly, joint hyperlaxity, hypotonia, and midface hypoplasia with sunken eyes.&nbsp; Some children with FXS (~15%) may develop focal seizures.</p><br><br><p>The major physical findings of FXS are subtle until puberty, at which time macroorchidism and dysmorphic facies (eg, long, narrow face; prominent forehead and chin) become more noticeable.&nbsp; Testicular enlargement is typically seen sometime after age 8; although the testes appear large, they typically have normal function.</p><br><br><p>Females with the full mutation typically have less severe symptoms because random X inactivation occurs in girls.&nbsp; About half of girls with the full mutation have normal intellectual functioning, whereas the other half have mild intellectual disability.&nbsp; Many have subtle learning difficulties.&nbsp; Physical features are usually not as apparent in females but may include primary ovarian insufficiency (ie, absent menses at age &lt;40).</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/69966.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) of FXS includes the following:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Down syndrome</strong> (trisomy 21):&nbsp; is associated with ASD and intellectual disability.&nbsp; However, the diagnosis is usually suspected during prenatal screening or in infancy due to the characteristic dysmorphic features, including a short neck, low-set ears, and epicanthal folds that are present at birth.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Angelman syndrome</strong> (loss of maternal allele on chromosome 15q11-q13):&nbsp; is associated with ASD and severe intellectual disability but typically presents with microcephaly, motor impairments, and inappropriate laughter, which are not seen in patients with FXS.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prader-Willi syndrome</strong> (loss of paternal allele on chromosome 15q11-q13):&nbsp; is also a genetic cause of ASD but typically presents with obesity (hyperphagia), cryptorchidism (not macroorchidism), and short stature in childhood.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rett syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; is caused by a mutation in the <em>MECP2</em> gene.&nbsp; This syndrome can cause autistic features, but it typically presents almost exclusively in females with normal initial development followed by regression in communication at age 12-18 months.&nbsp; An abnormal gait is also seen.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Klinefelter syndrome</strong> (47,XXY):&nbsp; is a sex chromosome aneuploidy, in which patients often have mild intellectual disability and neurobehavioral issues.&nbsp; However, small (not large) testes are expected, and dysmorphic facial features are not typical.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>In patients with suspected FXS, a detailed history and physical examination focusing on cognitive issues and dysmorphic features are key.&nbsp; Parental history of similar symptoms or family history of intellectual disability supports the diagnosis.&nbsp; However, because of its inheritance, female individuals in the family may have a mild phenotype, so in some cases, history may be unrevealing.</p><br><br><p>Early developmental assessments that evaluate for developmental delay, as well as validated screening tools for ASD between 18-24 months, are often used in pediatric well-child checks; these can be useful for identifying delays or ASD symptoms that may prompt further testing.&nbsp; Almost all patients with ASD, intellectual disability, or development delay without a known etiology should undergo standard FXS testing.</p><br><br><p>The gold standard for diagnosing FXS is <em><strong>FMR1</strong></em> <strong>DNA analysis</strong> with PCR followed by Southern blot analysis to measure the CGG repeat length.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The mainstay of management of FXS is individualized and typically involves multiple psychosocial and educational interventions.&nbsp; Behavior, speech, and occupational therapies can be used to improve daily functioning.&nbsp; Individualized education plans can be implemented by schools to provide learning accommodations.&nbsp; Much of the management of FXS involves managing ASD and ADHD.&nbsp; Medications may be used to manage symptoms such as anxiety, ADHD, and mood instability.&nbsp; Genetic counseling is important for families to understand the risks of their children inheriting the disorder and the implications of having FXS.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Patients with FXS have a normal life expectancy; however, individuals have varying degrees of intellectual disability that may affect their ability to perform activities of daily living.&nbsp; Prompt diagnosis with genetic testing allows for early implementation of developmental and behavioral therapies that can help patients with quality of life.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Fragile X syndrome (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/69968.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an X-linked dominant disorder due to &gt;200 CGG repeats on the <em>FMR1</em> gene.&nbsp; It is characterized by prominent physical features (eg, a narrow face, prominent chin and jaw, macroorchidism), intellectual disability, and neurobehavioral issues (eg, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).&nbsp; Male patients with the full mutation display these characteristics, whereas female patients may show mild to no intellectual disability.&nbsp; Diagnosis is by <em>FMR1</em> DNA analysis with PCR with Southern blot analysis.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
