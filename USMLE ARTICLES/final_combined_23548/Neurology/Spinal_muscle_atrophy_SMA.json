SMA is autosomal recessive and has a spectrum of severity, ranging from severe infantile-onset disease to milder adolescent-onset forms.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>SMA occurs most commonly due to a homozygous deletion of exon 7 within the <em>SMN1</em> gene; this results in the loss of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein.&nbsp; This protein is involved in assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (non-coding RNAs) in lower motor neurons.&nbsp; snRNPs are a parts of the spliceosome, which removes introns from pre-mRNA during processing within the nucleus (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26722.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Defective snRNP assembly results in impaired spliceosome function and causes <strong>degeneration of LMNs</strong> in the anterior horns and lower cranial nerve motor nuclei, resulting in progressive muscle atrophy (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L102613.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The degree of SMN protein deficiency correlates with disease severity.<p></p>\n<h1>Genetics</h1><br><br><p>SMA is an <strong>autosomal recessive</strong> disorder caused by a homozygous deletion within the <em>SMN1</em> gene on chromosome 5q.&nbsp; Because it is autosomal recessive, both parents must have an abnormal <em>SMN1</em> gene; however, parents who are carriers may not show signs of disease.&nbsp; If both parents are carriers, they have a 25% chance of having an affected child.</p><br><br><p>A nearly identical gene, <em>SMN2</em>, produces small amounts of functional SMN protein.&nbsp; Patients can have a varying number of copies of <em>SMN2</em>, which can alter the phenotype of the disease; individuals with more SMN2 copies tend to have milder disease because they have a greater amount of functional SMN protein.</p>\n<h2>Clinical presentation</h2><br><br><p>Age of onset and symptom severity depend on the amount of functional SMN protein present.&nbsp; <strong>Lower motor neuron signs</strong> are characteristic of all forms of SMA and include weakness, atrophy, hypotonia, and hyporeflexia; in infants and young children, this often presents as a <strong>gross motor delay</strong> (eg, inability to hold up the head or sit).&nbsp; Specific symptoms reflect various locations of LMN dysfunction:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Proximal lower extremity weakness</strong> (more than the upper extremities) due to spinal cord dysfunction.&nbsp; The proximal lower extremities are primarily affected, perhaps due to the higher metabolic demands of larger muscles (eg, quadriceps).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tongue fasciculations</strong> (from CN XII involvement) and <strong>swallow dysfunction</strong> (from CN IX, X involvement) due to dysfunction of the lower cranial nerve nuclei in the medulla.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sparing of face and eye muscles</strong> because upper brainstem motor nuclei are unaffected.&nbsp; Patients with SMA typically also have intact cognitive function.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Infantile SMA (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease), which is the most common type, is a severe form of disease characterized by absent SMN protein.&nbsp; Presentation is in the first few months of life with weakness or flaccid paralysis, which parents may report as reduced movement in the legs.&nbsp; Infants also usually have head lag, weak cry, and failure to thrive due to poor suck and swallow.&nbsp; On physical examination, deep tendon reflexes are severely diminished or absent, and tongue fasciculations are characteristic; patients may also have a \"frog-leg\" posture when placed supine due to hypotonia in the legs.&nbsp; Respiratory failure is expected due to progressive respiratory muscle weakness.</p><br><br><p>Although most patients with SMA present during infancy and have rapid progression of disease in early childhood, less common SMA subtypes present in older children and carry a better prognosis.&nbsp; Some children with delayed onset SMA learn to walk but have increasing difficulty running, climbing, and keeping up with their peers; given their weak proximal muscles, these children may show a Gowers sign (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L17420.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which is classically associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy but found in other conditions.&nbsp; In cases with only mild reduction of SMN protein levels, patients typically present in adolescence with decreased athletic endurance, muscle cramping, and hand tremors.&nbsp; Patients with delayed onset of SMA often have loss of independent ambulation with time.<p></p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>In many countries, patients are evaluated for SMA on the newborn screen.&nbsp; Creatine kinase (CK) levels can be normal or mildly elevated (due to muscle breakdown) in SMA.&nbsp; Neurodiagnostic testing with electromyography (EMG) may show features consistent with muscle denervation.&nbsp; Diagnosis is confirmed via <strong>molecular genetic testing of the</strong> <em><strong>SMN1</strong></em> <strong>gene</strong>.&nbsp; Carrier testing can identify heterozygous mutations in individuals at risk of having children with SMA and is available to women considering pregnancy or who are pregnant.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Duchenne muscular dystrophy</strong>, an X-linked recessive condition, is the most common dystrophinopathy and presents at age 2-3 with proximal muscle weakness and Gowers sign on examination, similar to delayed onset SMA.&nbsp; However, because dystrophin is associated with skeletal/cardiac muscle fiber sarcolemma, patients typically have markedly CK elevation, calf pseudohypotrophy (replacement of degrading muscle with fibrofatty connective tissue), cardiomyopathy, and mild cognitive impairment (possibly due to stabilizing effects of dystrophin).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Myasthenia gravis</strong> is a neuromuscular junction disorder in which antibodies against the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor antibodies prevent signal transmission.&nbsp; Patients classically have fluctuating and fatigable weakness, but involvement of the ocular muscles (eg, diplopia, ptosis) and proximal upper extremities is expected.&nbsp; Areflexia and tongue fasciculations do not occur.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Myotonic dystrophy</strong> is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat in the <em>DMPK</em> gene.&nbsp; Distal muscle weakness and grip myotonia (delayed relaxation) are characteristic features, and tongue fasciculations do not occur.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mitochondrial myopathies</strong> can present in infancy with weakness and failure to thrive, but other signs of mitochondrial disease (eg, seizures, encephalopathy) are also typically present.&nbsp; Tongue fasciculations would not be expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Botulism</strong> occurs when botulism toxin blocks the presynaptic acetylcholine receptors, causing descending flaccid paralysis.&nbsp; Head lag is common, but ptosis, decreased eye movement (eg, poor tracking), and constipation would also be expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Charcot-Marie-Tooth</strong> is a hereditary peripheral neuropathy that causes distal, not proximal, muscle weakness and sensory changes (eg, pain, tingling).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Disease-modifying therapy with <em>SMN1</em> gene replacement and/or <em>SMN2</em> gene modifiers can improve motor function; however, complications, such as restrictive lung disease, swallowing dysfunction, and scoliosis (from weak paraspinal muscles), can still develop over time.&nbsp; Therefore, treatment includes respiratory support (eg, cough assist, noninvasive ventilation), nutritional support (eg, gastrostomy tube placement if needed), physical therapy, and orthopedic management of complications (eg, scoliosis, joint contractures).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Prognosis depends on disease severity and therapeutic interventions.&nbsp; A shortened life expectancy is typical in infantile SMA due to ventilatory failure from progressive respiratory muscle weakness, while milder forms may allow survival into adulthood with variable degrees of disability.&nbsp; Disease-modifying therapies have significantly altered the course of SMA, improving survival and functional outcomes.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Spinal muscular atrophy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/105088.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by <em>SMN1</em> mutations leading to progressive motor neuron loss and muscle atrophy;
