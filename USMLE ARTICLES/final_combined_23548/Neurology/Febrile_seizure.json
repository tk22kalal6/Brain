Although they can appear alarming, febrile seizures are generally benign and do not indicate a serious underlying neurologic condition.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Seizures are the result of hypersynchronous excitatory activity of neurons located within the cortex.&nbsp; The exact reason for seizures occurring specifically in the setting of febrile illness in children is not fully understood, but it is perhaps related to a combination of a lower seizure threshold during the early years of brain development and a rapidly increasing temperature in the brain leading to increased neuronal firing.&nbsp; There appears to be a genetic susceptibility as well, although mutations are not always identifiable.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Children age <strong>6 months to 5 years</strong> are almost exclusively affected, likely because the seizure threshold is lower during the early years of brain development.&nbsp; In addition, young children are particularly susceptible to <strong>viral illnesses</strong> (eg, roseola [human herpesvirus 6], influenza) associated with <strong>high fever</strong> (≥39.5 C [103.1 F]), a key risk factor for development of these seizures.&nbsp; Children with a family history of febrile seizures or epilepsy have a slightly increased risk.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Febrile seizures typically occur during the first day of a viral illness.&nbsp; Patients may have findings consistent with infection (eg, rhinorrhea, tachycardia, tachypnea); however, febrile seizures may be the initial manifestation of an infection, occurring just prior to the onset of viral symptoms.&nbsp; A simple febrile seizure is characterized by:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Generalized, nonfocal movements</strong> (eg, unresponsiveness with full-body tonic-clonic movements)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Short duration</strong> (&lt;15 min)</li>\n\t<li><strong>No recurrence within 24 hours</strong></li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Postictal drowsiness can be present, typically lasting up to 10 minutes.&nbsp; Patients with febrile seizures have no previous afebrile seizure, no evidence of metabolic disease (eg, asterixis, depressed sensorium), and no signs of intracranial infection (eg, neck stiffness, bulging fontanelle, photophobia).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of febrile seizures is made clinically based on a combination of classic history and normal physical examination.&nbsp; Patients do not require diagnostic studies to evaluate their febrile seizures.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The most important diagnosis to differentiate from febrile seizures is <strong>meningitis</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/60077.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; <strong>Red flag findings</strong> on examination that may suggest meningitis should prompt immediate lumbar puncture.&nbsp; These findings include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Age outside typical febrile seizure range of 6 months to 5 years</li>\n\t<li>Signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, morning headache, vomiting, bulging fontanelle)</li>\n\t<li>Meningeal signs (eg, nuchal rigidity)</li>\n\t<li>Prolonged altered mental status (postictal period &gt;10 min)</li>\n\t<li>Petechial rash (suggestive of <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other considerations in the decision to perform lumbar puncture include current antibiotic therapy, which can mask meningitis symptoms, or incomplete vaccination history.</p><br><br><p>Febrile seizures lasting &gt;15 minutes, have focal features, or occur in clusters (eg, complex febrile seizures), as well as seizures without fever, require further evaluation.&nbsp; These can be differentiated from simple febrile seizures clinically.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Treatment of simple febrile seizures typically involves <strong>parental reassurance</strong>.&nbsp; Benzodiazepines can be used to abort seizures lasting ≥5 minutes; however, most self-resolve prior to presentation.&nbsp; Parents should be informed that febrile seizures are common and self-limited, without acute or long-term sequelae.&nbsp; Antipyretics are administered for general fever reduction, but they do not prevent future febrile seizures.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Families should be educated that febrile seizures often recur (in 30% of patients) and that although the risk for epilepsy is slightly increased, the overall risk remains low (~1%).&nbsp; Typically, febrile seizures that recur eventually resolve spontaneously by school age and have no impact on development.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Febrile seizures (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35357.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) occur in children age 6 months to 5 years with a viral infection.&nbsp;
