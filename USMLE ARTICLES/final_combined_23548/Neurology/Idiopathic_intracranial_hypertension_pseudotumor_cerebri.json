obesity-related increased abdominal and intracranial venous pressure is another proposed mechanism.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Several factors have been identified as increasing the risk of developing IIH, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Women of childbearing age</li>\n\t<li>Obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²) and/or recent weight gain</li>\n\t<li>Use of tetracyclines, vitamin A and its metabolites (eg, retinoids, isotretinoin), and growth hormone (due to various effects on CSF flow or metabolism)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The most common signs and symptoms of IIH include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Headache</li>\n\t<li>Papilledema</li>\n\t<li>Transient visual changes and later in the course permanent vision loss</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Headache </h2><br><br><p>Headache is the most common presenting symptom in patients with IIH and can have variable patterns.&nbsp; Patients typically have a holocranial or lateralized headache; they may have associated nausea and vomiting.&nbsp; Headaches are classically described as <strong>worse during recumbent positioning</strong> (eg, at night, upon waking) or straining (eg, bowel movements, heavy lifting), which increase ICP.&nbsp; Often, the headache of IIH may be similar to, or superimposed on, other primary headache disorders (eg, migraine, tension-type), as well as confounded by headaches associated with obstructive sleep apnea, which is common in obese patients.</p>\n<h2>Papilledema</h2><br><br><p>The hallmark finding of increased ICP on examination is <strong>bilateral symmetric papilledema</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L103390.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which is elevation of the optic discs with blurred disc margins seen on funduscopy.&nbsp; Increased intracranial pressure is transmitted through the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space, which is continuous with the optic nerve sheath; this buildup of pressure compresses the optic nerves externally, which in turn impairs axoplasmic flow within the optic nerves, causing papilledema.<p></p>\n<h2>Visual changes</h2><br><br><p>Pressure on the optic nerve and papilledema can cause:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Transient vision loss that varies according to changes in head positioning.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gradual, permanent vision loss over time</strong>; this is likely due to optic nerve atrophy that occurs due to chronic compression of the optic nerve</li>\n\t<li>Enlargement of the physiologic blind spot (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85444.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which is present at the location of the (now enlarged) optic nerve head</li>\n\t<li>Blurry vision</li>\n\t<li>Light flashes</li>\n\t<li>Peripheral visual field deficits</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In some patients, the increased pressure in IIH can cause cranial nerve palsies; the most commonly affected is the <strong>abducens nerve (CN VI)</strong> because of its long course through the skull to the lateral rectus muscle.&nbsp; Patients with CN VI palsy may have diplopia and impaired eye abduction.&nbsp; Other common findings with IIH include <strong>pulsatile tinnitus</strong> due to increased vascular pulsations and/or <strong>neck pain and stiffness</strong> possibly from increased pressure transmitted to cervical nerve sheaths.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>After thorough history and complete ocular examination, if IIH is suspected, the first step in evaluation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85932.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is <strong>neuroimaging</strong> to exclude other causes of elevated ICP (eg, space-occupying mass).&nbsp; MRI, often with venography (to rule out cerebral venous thrombosis), is the preferred imaging modality; however, CT scan is generally faster and easier to obtain in emergencies.&nbsp; Although neuroimaging is primarily obtained to rule out mass lesions, there are some findings that can suggest a diagnosis of IIH including:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Empty sella (increased CSF pressure flattening the pituitary and filling the sella space with fluid)</li>\n\t<li>Flattening of the posterior sclera due to transmitted pressure onto the posterior side of the globe</li>\n\t<li>Narrowing of the venous sinuses, which can lead to decreased CSF drainage capacity and predispose patients to IIH.&nbsp; This finding is more specific to IIH, in contrast to other causes of increased ICP.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>After a space-occupying lesion is excluded, <strong>lumbar puncture</strong> should be performed.&nbsp; An <strong>opening pressure of &gt;250 mm H₂O</strong> on lumbar puncture confirms the diagnosis of IIH as long as other cerebrospinal fluid studies (eg, cell counts) are normal, ruling out other secondary causes of increased ICP (eg, infection, tumor).</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Several conditions may mimic IIH, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Brain tumor:</strong>&nbsp; Both IIH and brain tumors can cause increased ICP and similar symptoms.&nbsp; However, brain tumors are typically associated with other neurological signs and symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or seizures.&nbsp; Brain imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, will help to differentiate between these two conditions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Meningitis</strong> often presents acutely with symptoms of headache and neck stiffness with elevated ICP on lumbar puncture.&nbsp; However, CSF analysis typically shows some combination of elevated protein concentration, low glucose concentration, and pleocytosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis</strong> can also present with headache and signs of increased ICP without obvious head CT findings.&nbsp; It is associated with prothrombotic conditions and may cause focal neurologic deficits.&nbsp; If suspected, an MR venography will help differentiate this condition from IIH.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Optic neuritis</strong> is usually associated with multiple sclerosis, which can occur in young women and cause vision loss.&nbsp; However, vision loss is typically monocular (vs binocular), and eye pain and an afferent pupillary defect are usually present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Migraines</strong> classically cause unilateral, throbbing headaches and photophobia.&nbsp; Although symptoms of migraine headaches may be indistinguishable from those of IIH, patients with migraine typically do not have papilledema.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Temporal arteritis</strong> (TA) commonly presents with headache.&nbsp; Although neck pain may be present from commonly associated polymyalgia rheumatica, TA almost never occurs in patients age &lt;50, constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss) are common, and increased ICP is not seen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The main treatment goal for IIH is to reduce ICP to prevent permanent vision loss; treatments can also provide symptomatic relief of headaches and other symptoms.&nbsp; The management of IIH (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85934.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) depends on the severity of the symptoms and the risk of vision loss:<p></p>\n<h2>Weight loss</h2><br><br><p>Weight loss is the only disease-modifying therapy and is recommended for all patients with obesity and IIH.&nbsp; For patients with very mild symptoms and without vision deficits it may be the only necessary treatment.</p>\n<h2>Medications</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Acetazolamide:</strong>&nbsp; Acetazolamide is first-line medical therapy and is used for patients with concerning visual deficits or debilitating symptoms.&nbsp; It inhibits choroid plexus carbonic anhydrase, thereby decreasing CSF production and resulting in lower ICP.</li>\n\t<li>Topiramate:&nbsp; Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug that also inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity to reduce ICP.&nbsp; It can be used as an alternative to acetazolamide.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Surgical intervention</h2><br><br><p>Surgery (eg, cerebral venous sinus stenting, ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, optic nerve fenestration) should be performed in patients with an immediate threat to vision (progressive, sustained loss in visual fields/acuity), or in those with progressive or debilitating symptoms who fail medical therapy with acetazolamide.</p>\n<h2>Other</h2><br><br><p>Corticosteroids and serial lumbar punctures are sometimes used as a temporary therapy for patients with IIH and severe visual defects in anticipation of definitive surgery.&nbsp; However, they are not recommended for long-term management given their associated complications.&nbsp; In addition to the treatments above, medications associated with precipitation of IIH (eg, tetracyclines, isotretinoin) should be stopped and avoided if possible.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for IIH is generally good, with most patients experiencing improvement or stabilization with treatment; if the condition is not treated, the risk of permanent vision loss is higher.&nbsp; Patients who improve on medication can slowly be weaned off.&nbsp; Some patients have recurrence of symptoms, often with weight gain.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/51069.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an underlying intracranial mass lesion or hydrocephalus.&nbsp; It is most commonly seen in women of childbearing age and in patients with obesity.&nbsp; Patients typically present with headache, papilledema, and vision changes.&nbsp; Evaluation includes neuroimaging to rule out space occupying lesions; subsequent lumbar puncture with normal cell counts and opening pressure &gt;250 mm H₂O confirms the diagnosis.&nbsp; Treatment options include weight loss, medication (eg, acetazolamide), and surgery for refractory cases.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
