Symptoms are unconsciously produced (ie, they are not feigned or intentionally created), and their acuity and severity may or may not cause the patient distress.&nbsp; Onset can be precipitated by psychological or physical stress, and symptoms cause significant distress and functional impairment.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The estimated prevalence of functional neurological symptom disorder in the general population is 0.05%.&nbsp; The prevalence rate in neurologic settings is higher, approximately 5%-10%.&nbsp; This condition is more likely to occur in females than males, and onset is typically in early to middle adulthood (ages 20-40).</p><br><br><p>Several factors may contribute to the risk of developing functional neurological symptom disorder and can include psychological factors (eg, maladaptive coping skills, high degree of emotional instability) and environmental factors (eg, adverse childhood event and/or trauma, lower socioeconomic status, preexisting neurologic condition).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Onset of symptoms may be preceded by a physical or psychological stressor; however, this is not necessary for diagnosis.&nbsp; Similarly, <em>la belle indifférence</em> (ie, patient's lack of concern regarding the severity of their symptoms) is not a reliable or specific feature for diagnosing functional neurological symptom disorder.</p><br><br><p>Symptoms in functional neurological symptom disorder are highly variable and may include ≥1 of the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Weakness or paralysis</li>\n\t<li>Abnormal movements (eg, dystonia, tremor, tic)</li>\n\t<li>Swallowing symptoms (eg, difficulty swallowing, sensation of lump in throat)</li>\n\t<li>Speech symptoms (eg, slurring of speech, reduced speech volume)</li>\n\t<li>Unresponsiveness or seizure-like symptoms (eg, syncope, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures)</li>\n\t<li>Cognitive symptoms (eg, memory impairment)</li>\n\t<li>Anesthesia or sensory loss</li>\n\t<li>Alteration or loss of vision or hearing&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Urinary retention</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>For a diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder, the following criteria must be met:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function</li>\n\t<li>The symptoms or deficits are not better explained by another medical or mental disorder</li>\n\t<li>The symptoms or deficits cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment (eg, social, occupational, personal) or warrant medical evaluation</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Clinical findings must demonstrate that the symptoms are incompatible with known neurological conditions; normal findings on examination or normal testing/imaging do not provide sufficient evidence for diagnosis.&nbsp; Numerous examination maneuvers and observations for assessing functional symptoms can provide evidence of incompatibility with recognized disease:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Internal inconsistency during examination</strong> (ie, symptoms presenting during one method of testing no longer present when tested another way)<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Functional weakness or paralysis</strong>:&nbsp; leg weakness while seated versus able to stand from seated position without issue; weakness of ankle plantar flexion versus able to walk on tiptoes</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Functional tremor</strong>:&nbsp; tremor frequency changes to match a competing rhythmical movement performed by an unaffected body part (tremor entrainment test); cessation of tremor with distraction (eg, while naming months of year backward)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Incongruence of symptoms</strong> with known pathophysiology or anatomic distributions\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/40974.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; persistent eye closure with resistance to opening; side-to-side head movements; episode duration &gt;5 minutes; no drowsiness or confusion after episode; video electroencephalogram with no epileptiform activity when movements captured</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Psychogenic pseudosyncope</strong>:&nbsp; episodes lasting several minutes to hours (versus 1-2 min in syncope); absence of abnormal vital signs, pallor, or sweating; patient experiences symptoms/events during episode (no true loss of consciousness)</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Functional sensory loss</strong>:&nbsp; non-dermatomal sensory abnormality (eg, sensory loss in left arm ending at the shoulder, hemisensory loss of entire body at midline)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Diagnosis should not be based on a single clinical finding; concluding that symptoms are incompatible with a known disease occurs in the context of a thorough evaluation, including history taking, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing.</p><br><br><p>Diagnosing functional neurological symptom disorder does not require identifying whether a patient is intentionally producing symptoms or not; however, if clear evidence of feigning is found (eg, patient being evaluated for lower extremity paralysis is unknowingly observed to be walking), then a diagnosis of factitious disorder or malingering should be considered instead.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder includes (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/38873.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Somatic symptom disorder</strong>:&nbsp; can involve functionally impairing neurologic symptoms; however, symptoms are not clearly incompatible with known medical disease, which is necessary for diagnosing functional neurological symptom disorder.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Factitious disorder</strong>:&nbsp; can also present with neurologic symptoms; however, there must be objective evidence that the patient is intentionally falsifying or producing symptoms for the purpose of assuming the sick role.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Malingering</strong>:&nbsp; can include neurologic symptoms; however, there must be objective evidence that the patient is intentionally falsifying symptoms for external incentives (eg, pain medication, disability benefits).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Recognized neurological disease</strong>:&nbsp; such as epilepsy or multiple sclerosis can co-occur with functional neurological symptom disorder; a thorough evaluation is necessary to identify whether symptoms represent early stages of a known disease; if symptoms progress, reevaluation may be indicated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>A thorough initial history, including psychiatric and trauma history, and physical examination are crucial for establishing a baseline for the patient and to assess any changes in symptoms and objective findings in subsequent evaluations.&nbsp; Reviewing medical records and collaborating with other providers can provide insights into the patient's course of care, diagnostic work-up, and level of healthcare utilization.</p><br><br><p>Laboratory and imaging studies are often required to assess whether symptoms may be better explained by another medical condition (eg, drug toxicity, early stages of neurodegenerative disease).&nbsp; Of note, negative testing results are not sufficient for a diagnosis; clinical findings showing incompatibility of symptoms with known medical conditions must be present.</p><br><br><p>First-line treatment includes <strong>sharing the diagnosis with patients</strong> in an empathic way and providing psychoeducation.&nbsp; Some patients recover with this treatment alone.&nbsp; General recommendations include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Name the diagnosis and explain clinical findings in a way that the patient can understand (eg, nervous system is not functioning properly though structure intact)</li>\n\t<li>Validate the patient's symptoms without judgment, particularly when testing is normal (eg, \"normal results do not make your weakness any less real\")</li>\n\t<li>Avoid dismissing the patient's concerns inadvertently (eg, \"your symptoms are not due to any serious conditions\" or \"everything is normal\")</li>\n\t<li>Avoid suggesting that symptoms are purely stress related</li>\n\t<li>Discuss that symptom improvement is possible despite an incomplete understanding of the cause</li>\n\t<li>Continue meeting with the patient (multiple appointments may be necessary) to continue discussing the diagnosis and assessing the patient's level of understanding and agreement</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders (most commonly panic disorder) frequently co-occur in individuals with functional neurological symptom disorder and require screening and treatment, which may reduce functional symptoms.</p><br><br><p>Comorbid medical and neurologic conditions can occur (eg, ~10% of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures also have epilepsy), and a diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder does not preclude the development of a recognized neurological condition in the future.</p><br><br><p>Functional neurological symptom disorder is associated with an elevated suicide risk and requires screening for suicidal ideation, assessment of risk factors, and safety planning.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Prognosis is variable and dependent on many factors.&nbsp; A majority of children experience remission of symptoms, though most adult patients experience a poor prognosis with a chronic course and reduced quality of life.&nbsp; Positive prognostic indicators include short duration of symptoms, younger age at onset, healthy premorbid functioning, and engagement in treatment.&nbsp; Negative prognostic indicators include the presence of comorbid physical disease and personality disorders as well as receipt of disability benefits due to symptoms.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Functional neurological symptom disorder (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/38397.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is characterized by symptoms and examination findings that are incompatible with a known neurologic disease.&nbsp;
