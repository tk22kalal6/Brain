15q11-q13.&nbsp; These conditions are classic examples of genomic imprinting disorders, in which the phenotypic outcome depends on the parent of origin of the genetic material.&nbsp; PWS results from the loss of function of paternally expressed genes in this region, whereas Angelman syndrome arises from the loss of function of maternally expressed genes.&nbsp; Despite originating from the same genomic locus, the 2 disorders present with strikingly different clinical features and developmental trajectories.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Normally, <strong>imprinting</strong> is a physiologic phenomenon in which the expression of a small subset of an offspring's genes depends on the parent contributing the involved gene.&nbsp; For instance, an allele inherited from the mother may be physiologically imprinted (silenced) by methylation so that only the allele from the father is expressed.&nbsp; Disease occurs with absent expression of the normally active allele (ie, no functional gene product).</p><br><br><p>Two classic examples of imprinting disorders involving genes on <strong>chromosome 15q11-q13</strong> are PWS and Angelman syndrome.&nbsp; In this region, certain genes are expressed only from one parental allele, either maternal or paternal, whereas the other is silenced through imprinting; these syndromes occur when the active allele is absent or nonfunctional, and the silenced allele cannot compensate (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L103470.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Prader-Willi syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Loss of expression from the <strong>paternal allele</strong> leads to the absence of paternally expressed genes involved in hypothalamic development and neuroendocrine function (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L103472.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Angelman syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Loss of expression from the <strong>maternal allele</strong> results in deficiency of several key maternally expressed genes, including <em>UBE3A</em>, an E3 ubiquitin ligase essential for synaptic development and plasticity.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Mechanisms causing either syndrome include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Deletion of 15q11-q13</strong> (~70% of cases):&nbsp; Deletion of this chromosomal region on the paternal chromosome causes Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), whereas deletion on the maternal chromosome causes Angelman syndrome.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Uniparental disomy</strong> (UPD):&nbsp; UPD results from a meiotic nondisjunction event that results in 3 homologous chromosomes in the zygote.&nbsp; To restore chromosomal balance, 1 chromosome is lost during mitosis (\"trisomy rescue\"), and UPD occurs when the remaining 2 chromosomes are from the same parent.&nbsp; If both retained copies are maternal (maternal UPD), PWS results (eg, no paternal genes can be expressed).&nbsp; If both are paternal (paternal UPD), Angelman syndrome results (eg, no maternal genes can be expressed).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Imprinting errors</strong>:&nbsp; These errors involve abnormal methylation or imprinting center defects that lead to inappropriate silencing of normally active genes.&nbsp; For example, failure to activate paternal genes can cause PWS.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>UBE3A</em> mutations</strong> (specific to Angelman syndrome):&nbsp; Mutations in the <em>UBE3A</em> gene disrupt its function even when imprinting is intact, leading to Angelman syndrome in the absence of a chromosomal deletion or UPD.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>There are no modifiable risk factors for these disorders because they result from sporadic genetic and epigenetic events.&nbsp; Factors that increase the risk of genetic events include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Advanced maternal age.</li>\n\t<li>Use of assisted reproductive technologies, potentially due to epigenetic instability during early embryo development.</li>\n\t<li>Family history of imprinting disorders, which may suggest inherited imprinting center mutations or translocations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><h2>Prader-Willi syndrome</h2><br><br><p>In PWS, in addition to neurologic symptoms, hypothalamic dysfunction is prominent, contributing to endocrine abnormalities and hyperphagia (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/80543.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Key clinical features include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hypotonia</strong>:&nbsp; This can present with poor suck in infancy that can lead to poor feeding and a need for nutritional supplementation.&nbsp; It can also lead to delayed onset of motor milestones (eg, sitting, walking).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Subsequent hyperphagia</strong> in early childhood, leading to <strong>obesity</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mild to moderate intellectual disability</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction</strong>, resulting in short stature, cryptorchidism (failure of testicles to descend), and osteoporosis.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other common features include skin-picking, behavioral difficulties (eg, irritability; tantrums, especially if food is restricted), sleep-disordered breathing (eg, obstructive sleep apnea and/or central apnea), and autistic features such as poor eye contact, speech deficits, and social deficits.</p>\n<h2>Angelman syndrome</h2><br><br><p>In Angelman syndrome, the primary deficit is in neurologic function, with a characteristic phenotype that emerges in early childhood.&nbsp; Key clinical features include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Severe intellectual disability, with absent to minimal speech</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ataxia and tremor</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Seizures</strong>, often starting at age &lt;2.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Frequent smiling and laughter with a happy demeanor</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Microcephaly</strong>, often with postnatal onset.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients often have a fascination with water and other sensory-seeking behaviors.&nbsp; Other findings may include sleep disturbances (eg, reduced need for sleep, difficulty staying asleep), gastrointestinal dysfunction (eg, reflux, cyclic vomiting), and self-injurious behavior.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of both conditions is suspected based on clinical features and confirmed by genetic testing:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>DNA methylation analysis of 15q11-q13 is the first-line test for both conditions.&nbsp; It detects approximately 99% of cases of PWS and approximately 80% of cases of Angelman syndrome.&nbsp; If methylation is abnormal, fluorescence in situ hybridization or chromosomal microarray can identify specific deletions.</li>\n\t<li>If no deletion is found, UPD testing or imprinting center analysis is performed.</li>\n\t<li>For Angelman syndrome, if methylation is normal but features persist, <em>UBE3A</em> gene sequencing is pursued.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with PWS often undergo further testing for endocrine dysfunction (eg, thyroid studies).&nbsp; MRI of the brain in patients with PWS and Angelman syndrome is often normal but may show mild cortical or cerebellar atrophy.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for PWS and Angelman syndrome includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Down syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Caused by trisomy 21 and can present with developmental delay, short stature, and autistic features.&nbsp; Characteristic dysmorphic features of Down syndrome include up-slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthic folds, and a flat nasal bridge.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rett syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Caused by mutations in the <em>MECP2</em> gene and mainly affects the female population.&nbsp; Key features include loss of speech, stereotypical hand movements, and gait abnormalities after an initial period of normal development.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lesch-Nyhan syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Can result in hypotonia and developmental delay but with extreme self-mutilation (eg, biting, banging self) and extrapyramidal symptoms (eg, dystonia, choreoathetosis).&nbsp; It results from a deficiency of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase enzyme and can cause hyperuricemia.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong>:&nbsp; Can present with short stature and cognitive deficits.&nbsp; However, other symptoms, such as thyromegaly, lethargy, constipation, bradycardia, and delayed reflexes, are expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Phenylketonuria</strong>:&nbsp; Can result in intellectual disability, seizures, and microcephaly.&nbsp; Elevated phenylalanine levels are usually found due to a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of PWS and Angelman syndrome is multidisciplinary and symptom specific:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>PWS often requires nutritional support in infancy, strict dietary control in childhood, behavioral interventions for hyperphagia and mood regulation, and endocrine management for growth, pubertal development, and bone health.</li>\n\t<li>Angelman syndrome management focuses on seizure control, physical and speech therapy (including nonverbal communication strategies), and behavioral approaches to improve attention and sleep.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Genetic counseling is important in both syndromes to address the recurrence risk in families.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>With appropriate supportive care, individuals with PWS and Angelman syndrome can have a near-normal life expectancy.&nbsp; However, most require lifelong assistance due to persistent impairments such as hyperphagia and behavioral challenges in PWS and seizures, motor dysfunction, and minimal speech in Angelman syndrome.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes are imprinting disorders of chromosome 15q11-q13 with contrasting phenotypes due to the parental origin of the disrupted gene(s) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32781.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; PWS results from loss of paternal expression and is characterized by hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity, and mild intellectual disability.&nbsp; Angelman syndrome stems from loss of maternal expression, leading to severe intellectual disability, ataxia, and a characteristically happy demeanor.&nbsp; Despite their differences, these syndromes share molecular diagnostic pathways, and patients require lifelong multidisciplinary care.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
