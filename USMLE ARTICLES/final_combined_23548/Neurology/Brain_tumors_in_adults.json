This article focuses on the different types of primary brain tumors in adults.</p><br><br><p>The general pathophysiology, epidemiology/risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of primary brain tumors are discussed in more detail in a separate dedicated article.&nbsp; The diagnosis and management of brain metastases can be found there as well.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology </h1><br><br><p>Brain tumors can be classified according to their cell type of origin.&nbsp; The brain is composed of 2 major cell types: neurons and glial cells.&nbsp; Neurons, which transmit information throughout the brain using electrical signals and chemical messengers, rarely form tumors.&nbsp; Tumors more commonly originate from glial cells, which significantly outnumber neurons and normally provide support to maintain the health of the nervous system.&nbsp; There are 3 main types of glial cells:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Astrocytes, the most common glial cell, help regulate the environment around neurons, contribute to nutrient exchange, and play a role in maintaining the blood-brain barrier.</li>\n\t<li>Oligodendrocytes produce myelin, a fatty substance that insulates nerve fibers and allows for faster signal transmission.</li>\n\t<li>Ependymal cells line the ventricles, fluid-filled cavities within the brain and spinal cord and are involved in cerebrospinal fluid production.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Gliomas, one of the most common types of primary brain tumor, originate from these glial cell populations (eg, astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas).&nbsp; Glioma classification is complex, and molecular subtyping (eg, <em>IDH</em> [isocitrate dehydrogenase] mutation analysis) is important (eg, <em>IDH</em> mutations associated with prognosis).&nbsp; Tumors can also arise from the meninges (eg, meningioma) or from other cell types (eg, pituitary gland, pineal gland, embryonic origin).</p>\n<h2>Adult brain tumors</h2><br><br><p>Commonly encountered adult brain tumors (discussed in this article) include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Glioblastomas (eg, high grade astrocytomas)</li>\n\t<li>Oligodendrogliomas</li>\n\t<li>Meningiomas</li>\n\t<li>Schwannomas</li>\n\t<li>Pituitary tumors</li>\n\t<li>Primary CNS lymphoma</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pediatric brain tumors</h2><br><br><p>Commonly encountered pediatric brain tumors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pilocytic astrocytomas</li>\n\t<li>Ependymomas</li>\n\t<li>Medulloblastomas</li>\n\t<li>Craniopharyngiomas</li>\n\t<li>Pineal gland tumors</li>\n\t<li>Choroid plexus papillomas</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These are discussed in more detail in a separate dedicated article.</p>\n<h1>Glioblastomas (high-grade astrocytomas)</h1><br><br><p>Glioblastomas (GBMs) are <strong>malignant astrocytic tumors</strong> and are one of the most common primary cerebral tumors in adults.&nbsp; A number of characteristic oncogenic mutations are usually present in GBM:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>More than 95% of cases are associated with the overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of neoplastic cells.&nbsp; EGFR is a tyrosine-kinase signal transduction system that conducts external growth signals into the nucleus, thereby promoting cellular survival and proliferation; mutations that enhance this pathway (eg, overexpression of EGFR or EGFR-ligand) are associated with uncontrolled cellular proliferation.</li>\n\t<li>As part of oncogenesis, many GBMs methylate the CpG region adjacent to the <em>O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase</em> (<em>MGMT</em>) gene, which generates a protein that repairs damaged DNA (eg, converts O6-methylguanine [a naturally occurring alkylation product] back to guanine).&nbsp; The resultant silencing of the <em>MGMT</em> gene creates a more permissive environment for DNA mutations to drive cancer growth.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Typical characteristics for GBMs include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Location</strong>:&nbsp; They are usually located supratentorially in the <strong>cerebral hemispheres</strong> (eg, frontal lobe, temporal lobe) and often cross the corpus callosum.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pathology</strong>:&nbsp; GBMs are composed of atypical (eg, pleomorphic, hyperchromatic) astrocytes that often accumulate in columns around regions of necrosis (ie, <strong>pseudopalisading</strong>) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L98821.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The central necrotic areas represent a vascular insult resulting from haphazard tumor growth, with the surviving tumor cells forming columns as they migrate toward the peripheral vasculature.&nbsp; These tumors also produce high amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor, resulting in microvascular proliferation.&nbsp; They are usually glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive, indicative of glial lineage.&nbsp; On gross examination, glioblastomas are typically poorly circumscribed lesions with a variegated appearance, often showing areas of necrosis and hemorrhage.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clinical features</strong>:&nbsp; GBMs are typically <strong>fast-growing</strong> and can cause significant <strong>mass effect</strong> (frequently with midline shift).&nbsp; Patients usually present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, nausea/vomiting), focal neurologic deficits, and/or seizures that rapidly progress within weeks.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Radiological features</strong>:&nbsp; The stiff falx cerebri typically inhibits direct spread of tumors across the midline.&nbsp; Therefore, for a GBM to cross the midline, it must spread under the falx at the midline.&nbsp; This leads to a tumor that is narrow at the midline with a wider spread on either side of the narrow midline portion (ie, <strong>butterfly appearance</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L102130.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).&nbsp; Because these tumors have newly formed, highly fenestrated vessels, large amounts of <strong>vasogenic edema</strong> is seen on imaging; in addition, increased blood flow to the edges of the mass results in heterogenous, serpiginous, peripheral contrast enhancement.&nbsp; Central necrosis (heterogeneous darkness on imaging) occurs because the center of the tumor is hypoxic.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with GBM are usually treated with some combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.&nbsp; Because the pathogenesis often involves silencing the <em>MGMT</em> gene, the cells are more susceptible to alkylating chemotherapy, since they cause DNA damage that cannot be effectively repaired without <em>MGMT</em>; therefore, alkylating agents, such as temozolomide, are commonly used as adjunctive agents in the treatment of GBMs.&nbsp; However, patients with glioblastoma still have a <strong>very poor prognosis</strong>; most patients die within 2 years of diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Low-grade astrocytomas </h1><br><br><p>These tumors also originate from astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type.&nbsp; Typical characteristics include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Location</strong>:&nbsp; These tumors can arise anywhere in the central nervous system but typically occur in the <strong>cerebral hemispheres</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pathology</strong>:&nbsp; Microscopic examination frequently reveals a well-circumscribed tumor containing bipolar astrocytes with ovoid nuclei and hair-like (ie, piloid) processes.&nbsp; These processes contain GFAP, indicative of glial lineage.&nbsp; Proteinaceous, eosinophilic, cytoplasmic inclusions with a corkscrew appearance (ie, Rosenthal fibers) and eosinophilic granular bodies (thought to be derived from lysosomes) are also often present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clinical features</strong>:&nbsp; Low-grade astrocytomas may present with subtle symptoms like headaches, seizures, or <strong>slowly progressive</strong> (eg, over months to years) focal neurological deficits.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Radiological features</strong>:&nbsp; On MRI, low-grade astrocytomas often appear as a hyperintense lesion (on T2/FLAIR sequences) that is not contrast enhancing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Oligodendrogliomas </h1><br><br><p>Oligodendrogliomas arise from oligodendrocytes, cells that produce the myelin sheath insulating nerve fibers and therefore typically involve white matter of the cerebral hemispheres.&nbsp; These tumors are typically slow-growing but can become malignant.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Location</strong>:&nbsp; Oligodendrogliomas can arise anywhere in the white matter, but occur usually in the cerebral hemispheres, often in the <strong>frontal lobe</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pathology</strong>:&nbsp; Under light microscopy, tumor cells have a <strong>\"fried egg\" appearance</strong>, with round nuclei surrounded by a halo of clear cytoplasm, and are often present within a network of branching capillaries and microcalcifications (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97260.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clinical features</strong>:&nbsp; Similar to low-grade astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas may present with an <strong>insidious onset</strong> of symptoms.&nbsp; They frequently present with focal seizures.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Radiological features</strong>:&nbsp; Oligodendrogliomas often appear as heterogeneously contrast-enhancing lesions without clear borders on MRI (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99702.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ); on CT scan, calcifications are often noted as well (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99700.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Meningiomas</h1><br><br><p>These are <strong>benign tumors</strong> arising from the meningothelial cells of the arachnoid mater.&nbsp; They are the most common intracranial tumors overall.&nbsp; Meningiomas are slow-growing, benign tumors; more than two-thirds do not grow, even after several years.&nbsp; They are most commonly found in middle-aged to elderly women (eg, age &gt;35).&nbsp; Exposure to ionizing radiation and genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)–related schwannomatosis are additional risk factors for developing meningioma.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Location</strong>:&nbsp; Meningiomas are often located at a <strong>dural reflection</strong>, in the falcine, parasagittal, or lateral convexity regions of the brain.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pathology</strong>:&nbsp; Histology shows syncytial nests and a whorled pattern of cellular growth, which may calcify and appear as round, laminar structures called <strong>psammoma bodies</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L68549.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clinical features</strong>:&nbsp; Symptoms of meningioma depend on location of the tumor.&nbsp; Because the tumors are <strong>very slow-growing</strong> and outside the brain parenchyma, patients are often <strong>asymptomatic</strong> with the tumor found incidentally on imaging.&nbsp; However, patients can present with headaches, seizures, or focal neurological deficits depending on tumor location (eg, next to the cerebral cortex) and size.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Radiological features</strong>:&nbsp; Meningiomas are typically well-circumscribed, round, extra-axial dural-based (attached to the outermost meningeal layer) lesions with homogeneous contrast enhancement on MRI (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L64671.png\" alt=\"image 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Calcification is a common feature that can be seen as a hyperdensity on noncontrast CT scan as well.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Management of meningiomas depends on size, location, and presence of symptoms.&nbsp; Small (&lt; 2 cm) asymptomatic tumors can be observed with serial imaging.&nbsp; In symptomatic patients, complete surgical excision is typically curative.</p>\n<h1>Schwannomas</h1><br><br><p>Schwannomas are <strong>benign tumors</strong> arising from Schwann cells, which produce the myelin sheath around peripheral nerves.&nbsp; They can occur within the brain (intracranial) or involve cranial nerves.&nbsp; Bilateral vestibular schwannomas are characteristic of NF2-related schwannomatosis (see article \"NF2-related schwannomatosis\" for more details).</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Location</strong>:&nbsp; Schwannomas classically occur at the cerebellopontine angle, though they can occur along any peripheral nerve.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pathology</strong>:&nbsp; Schwannomas are characterized by densely (Antoni type A) or loosely (Antoni type B) arranged spindle-shaped cells that may show nuclear palisading (ie, Verocay bodies) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L75245.png\" alt=\"image 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clinical features</strong>:&nbsp; They typically present with focal neurological deficits related to the affected nerve.&nbsp; For example, an acoustic schwannoma (vestibular schwannoma) can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and imbalance due to compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) at the cerebellopontine angle.&nbsp; Continued growth at this location can cause facial weakness due to compression of the facial nerve (CN VII).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Radiological features</strong>:&nbsp; Schwannomas often appear as well-circumscribed, sometimes round lesions with contrast enhancement on MRI (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L96912.png\" alt=\"image 9\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 9</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pituitary tumors </h1><br><br><p>Pituitary tumors arise from the pituitary gland, a small structure at the base of the brain responsible for hormone production.&nbsp; Pituitary tumors can be functioning (secreting hormones) or nonfunctioning.&nbsp; These are discussed further in a separate dedicated article.</p>\n<h1>Primary CNS lymphoma </h1><br><br><p>Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a <strong>diffuse, large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma</strong> of B-cell origin that is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).&nbsp; It usually occurs in immunosuppressed patients (eg, organ transplant patients, patients with HIV/AIDs); however, PCNSL has been increasingly occurring in older patients (age &gt;60) who are not immunocompromised.&nbsp; Most commonly, it is seen as a late complication of HIV infection in patients with persistently depressed CD4 counts (&lt; 50/mm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>).</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Location</strong>:&nbsp; PCNSL can occur anywhere in the brain, although it typically arises in the cerebral hemispheres, often in the <strong>frontal lobes</strong> or in the <strong>periventricular white matter</strong>.&nbsp; It can also occur in the eyes or in the CSF (eg, leptomeningeal).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pathology</strong>:&nbsp; Histologically, PCNSL is usually characterized by malignant B cells.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clinical features</strong>:&nbsp; PCNSL is a <strong>fast-growing</strong> tumor, with most patients exhibiting symptoms over days to weeks.&nbsp; The presentation depends on the location of the tumor; patients often have focal neurological deficits or mental status changes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Radiological features</strong>:&nbsp; PCNSL usually appears as a <strong>solitary, irregular, ring-enhancing lesion</strong> on brain MRI.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Brain biopsy is often required to make a definitive diagnosis.&nbsp; The diagnosis can be supported by EBV DNA isolated in the cerebrospinal fluid, especially in patients with HIV.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
