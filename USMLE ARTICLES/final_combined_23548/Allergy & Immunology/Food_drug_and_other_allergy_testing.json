These tests vary based on the immunologic mechanism (eg, IgE mediated, T-cell mediated), the type of allergen, and the clinical context.&nbsp; Accurate testing facilitates the diagnosis and guides avoidance strategies; in addition, it can identify drugs that are unnecessarily on a patient's medication allergy list.</p>\n<h1>Immune mechanisms of allergic reactions</h1><br><br><p>Four types of hypersensitivity reactions exist.&nbsp; Types I (IgE mediated, as in anaphylactic food allergy) and IV (T-cell mediated, as in allergic contact dermatitis) can be evaluated via allergy testing, in contrast to types II (IgG- or IgM-autoantibody mediated, as in hemolytic anemia) and III (immune-complex mediated, as in serum sickness).</p>\n<h1>Immediate hypersensitivity (type I)</h1><br><br><p>Type I hypersensitivity is also called immediate reaction because of its rapid onset (eg, minutes) following exposure to an allergen.&nbsp; Examples include anaphylactic food allergy, penicillin allergy, venom allergies (eg, wasps, bees, fire ants), latex allergy, acute urticaria, allergic asthma, and seasonal allergies.</p><br><br><p>The mechanism of type I hypersensitivity involves the production of antigen-specific IgE by B cells that bind mast cell surfaces.&nbsp; If repeat exposure occurs, the bound IgE can cross-link and stimulate the release of preformed histamine via mast cell degranulation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L58489.jpg\" alt=\"Cutaneous type 1 hypersensitivity reaction\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">Cutaneous type 1 hypersensitivity reaction</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; When the allergen is exposed through the skin, superficial dermal edema and erythema (eg, wheal-and-flare reaction) result within minutes and can progress to a more systemic response (eg, anaphylaxis) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L77017.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This wheal-and-flare reaction is what is detected in skin allergy testing (see later section).<p></p><br><br><p>A late-phase, type I hypersensitivity reaction sometimes occurs hours later, manifesting as a palpable, indurated lesion due to tissue damage caused by substances released by eosinophils (also as a downstream effect of IgE).&nbsp; This lesion is not measured in skin allergy testing.</p>\n<h1>T-cell mediated hypersensitivity (type IV)</h1><br><br><p>Unlike immediate hypersensitivity, delayed reactions take 48-72 hours to manifest.&nbsp; Allergic contact dermatitis (eg, poison ivy dermatitis) is a classic example.&nbsp; Certain rare drug reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS], toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN], drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, DRESS syndrome [<strong>D</strong>rug <strong>R</strong>eaction with <strong>E</strong>osinophilia and <strong>S</strong>ystemic <strong>S</strong>ymptoms]) are primarily mediated by T cells and are considered type IV reactions.</p><br><br><p>Type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction occurs in 2 distinct phases (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L6945.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ol type=\"1\">\n\t<li>The sensitization phase leads to the creation of hapten-specific T cells and takes 10-14 days.&nbsp; Cutaneous dendritic cells take up the haptens and express them on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and MHC-II molecules as hapten-conjugated peptides.&nbsp; These dendritic cells travel to the draining lymph nodes and interact with hapten-sensitive CD4<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> and CD8<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> T cells, causing activation and clonal expansion.</li>\n\t<li>The elicitation phase occurs within 2-3 days following reexposure to the same antigen (or following sensitization after first exposure to a highly antigenic antigen such as urushiol in poison ivy).&nbsp; In this phase, the hapten is taken up by skin cells and activates hapten-sensitized T cells in the dermis and epidermis.&nbsp; This results in an inflammatory response and the clinical manifestations of contact dermatitis (eg, vesicles, erythematous papules) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85194.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Allergy tests overview</h1><h2>Tests for type I hypersensitivity reactions</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Skin prick testing (SPT), intradermal allergy testing (IAT).</li>\n\t<li>Serum-specific IgE testing, serum component-resolved diagnostics (CRDs).</li>\n\t<li>Oral food challenge (OFC).</li>\n\t<li>Graded drug challenge and drug provocation testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tests for type IV hypersensitivity reactions</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Patch testing on the skin.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Each of these types of tests is discussed in greater detail below.</p>\n<h1>Skin prick testing</h1><h2>Method and application</h2><br><br><p>With SPT, allergen extracts are applied and introduced into the epidermis via a pricking device to identify allergen-specific IgE on cutaneous mast cells (type I hypersensitivity reactions).&nbsp; SPT tests for aeroallergens and environmental allergens such as pollens (trees, grasses, weeds), molds, dust mites, animal dander (eg, cat, dog), and cockroaches.&nbsp; It also tests various foods (eg, egg, milk, nuts, seafood) and penicillin, which is the only drug approved for SPT.&nbsp; Although SPT can be used for testing other drugs (eg, amoxicillin, cephalosporins, carboplatin), its negative predictive value is diminished.</p><br><br><p>SPT is typically performed to confirm a suspected allergic reaction based on history (eg, development of urticaria after an insect sting); it should not be performed for screening purposes.</p>\n<h2>Result interpretation</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>A positive test indicates sensitization and is generally defined as a wheal that is equal to or larger than the control and that develops within 15-20 minutes.&nbsp; Sensitization must be accompanied by a history of allergic symptoms to establish that the compound causes an allergic reaction.&nbsp; Isolated sensitization without a history of allergic symptoms does not equate with the patient being allergic to the compound.</li>\n\t<li>A negative test has high negative predictive value (eg, 95%), indicating that the patient is highly unlikely to be sensitized to the compound.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Poorly controlled asthma or a history of anaphylaxis (due to potential poor outcome).</li>\n\t<li>Active urticaria and cutaneous mastocytosis (due to false-positive results).</li>\n\t<li>Recent intake (eg, &lt;2-5 days) of H<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> and H<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> antihistamines (due to false-negative results).</li>\n\t<li>Topical corticosteroid therapy (due to false-negative results).</li>\n\t<li>Dermatitis (eg, atopic dermatitis).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Intradermal allergy testing</h1><h2>Method and application</h2><br><br><p>With IAT, allergens are injected into the dermis (vs the epidermis in SPT) with a syringe.&nbsp; Like SPT, IAT identifies allergen-specific IgE on cutaneous mast cells (type I hypersensitivity reactions).&nbsp; Compared to SPT, IAT is more sensitive and is therefore typically performed following a negative SPT.&nbsp; IAT's greater sensitivity makes it more useful for venom and drug testing.</p>\n<h2>Result interpretation</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>A positive test indicates sensitization and is generally defined as a wheal ≥5 mm that develops within 15-20 minutes.&nbsp; Sensitization must be accompanied by allergic symptoms to be considered an allergic reaction; isolated sensitization without a history of allergic symptoms does not equate with the patient being allergic to the compound.</li>\n\t<li>A negative test has high negative predictive value, indicating that the patient is highly unlikely to be allergic to the compound.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><p>In addition to the contraindications of SPT, IAT is contraindicated when food or latex allergy is suspected due to high rates of anaphylaxis with IAT.</p>\n<h1>Serum-specific IgE testing</h1><h2>Method and application</h2><br><br><p>Serum-specific IgE testing is a blood test that identifies allergen-specific IgE in the blood.&nbsp; It is used to evaluate type I hypersensitivity reactions caused by food, venom, environmental (eg, pollens, molds, dust mites, cockroaches, animal allergens), latex, and certain occupational allergens; in contrast, its use in drug allergy testing is largely investigational.&nbsp; It relies on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluorescent enzyme immunoassay, or other immunoassay techniques.</p><br><br><p>Unlike SPT and IAT, serum-specific IgE testing does not introduce allergens to the patient, which makes it an attractive option in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis.&nbsp; In addition, it is preferred in patients with dermatitis or dermatographism and is not affected by medication intake (eg, H<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> and H<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> antihistamines).</p>\n<h2>Result interpretation</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>An elevated IgE level against a specific allergen suggests sensitization and increases the likelihood of clinical allergic symptoms.&nbsp; However, an elevated IgE level against a specific allergen alone without a history of allergic symptoms to that allergen does not indicate that the patient is allergic to the allergen.</li>\n\t<li>A negative result could indicate a lack of sensitization, but it could also indicate that the patient has not been exposed to the allergen recently (eg, within weeks).&nbsp; After allergen exposure, serum IgE rises; however, the half-life of circulating IgE is 48 hours before it attaches to mast cells, making these IgE undetectable via serum testing.&nbsp; A negative result should generally be followed by skin testing if there are no contraindications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><p>There are no contraindications; however, the test is more expensive than skin testing and tends to have lower sensitivity and specificity overall compared to skin testing.</p>\n<h1>Serum component-resolved diagnostics</h1><h2>Method and application</h2><br><br><p>CRD is a blood test done in specialized laboratories.&nbsp; In contrast to serum-specific IgE testing, which detects IgE associated with the whole allergen, CRD tests for IgE that binds specific antigenic epitopes; this allows differentiation between IgE against clinically irrelevant allergens and IgE against allergens that carry a high anaphylaxis risk.&nbsp; Therefore, CRD risk stratifies the patient and offers important prognostic information.</p><br><br><p>For example, CRD can identify IgE that binds multiple epitopes on several peanut proteins:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Ara h 2 protein is strongly associated with anaphylaxis.</li>\n\t<li>Ara h 8 protein is linked to oral allergy syndrome, a localized allergic reaction that is typically limited to throat pruritus without systemic symptoms and that is due to cross-reactivity between Ara h 8 and birch pollen.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In practice, a serum-specific IgE test may show a general sensitivity toward peanuts, whereas CRD risk stratifies the patient based on whether the IgE is against Ara h 2 or Ara h 8.</p><br><br><p>Given the cross-reactivity between birch pollen and Ara h 8, patients with isolated Ara h 8 sensitization and a known history of birch pollen allergy may undergo an OFC test (discussed later); if limited (eg, throat pruritus) or no symptoms develop, patients may generally be reassured that they may eat peanuts.&nbsp; In contrast, a patient with IgE against Ara h 2 on component testing is at high risk for anaphylaxis and should avoid peanuts.</p>\n<h2>Result interpretation</h2><br><br><p>This is discussed in the previous Method and Application section.</p>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><p>Although not a contraindication, component testing is not indicated in patients who can easily avoid a food that is not typically a part of their regular diet.</p>\n<h1>Oral food challenge</h1><h2>Method and application</h2><br><br><p>OFC is the gold standard for diagnosing or refuting a food allergy.&nbsp; It is also used to determine whether a previous food allergy has been resolved.&nbsp; Most commonly, it is used to confirm tolerance when SPT and/or serum IgE testing are negative in a patient with a questionable history of allergic reaction to a particular food.</p><br><br><p>The patient ingests increasing doses of the suspected food under supervision, typically over 4-6 steps.&nbsp; The patient is observed for 15 minutes after each dose for type I hypersensitivity reactions (eg, hives, vomiting, diarrhea) before a higher dose is introduced.</p>\n<h2>Result interpretation</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Type I hypersensitivity reaction at any time during the test indicates food allergy.</li>\n\t<li>Tolerance of a meal-sized portion of the food refutes food allergy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><p>OFC should be avoided when anaphylaxis has occurred after isolated ingestion of a food and when IgE in vitro testing is positive for that food.&nbsp; An OFC will likely precipitate another anaphylactic reaction.</p>\n<h1>Graded drug challenge and drug provocation testing</h1><h2>Method and application</h2><br><br><p>These tests are used primarily to confirm that penicillin is tolerated when skin testing for penicillin is negative.&nbsp; Other drugs (eg, sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines) can also be used in these tests.</p><br><br><p>The tests involve incremental administration of the drug, typically beginning at 1/100 to 1/10 of the therapeutic dose and progressing through multiple steps until a full dose is reached.</p>\n<h2>Result interpretation</h2><br><br><p>Type I hypersensitivity is refuted if the patient tolerates the therapeutic dose without signs of an allergic reaction.</p>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><p>These tests should be avoided with drugs that may have caused SJS, TEN, erythema multiforme, and hypersensitivity reactions involving internal organs (eg, DRESS syndrome).</p>\n<h1>Patch testing</h1><h2>Method and application</h2><br><br><p>Patch testing consists of applying patches of allergenic compounds to the skin (eg, back) for a specified time (usually 48 hr) to allow allergen penetration.&nbsp; It is used primarily to identify allergens in allergic contact dermatitis (type IV hypersensitivity reaction), particularly when it is chronic, recalcitrant, or recurrent.&nbsp; It can also be used to exclude concomitant allergic contact dermatitis in patients with known chronic irritant contact dermatitis.</p>\n<h2>Result interpretation</h2><br><br><p>The presence of erythema and vesicles (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L33611.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) at 48 hours after patch removal indicates that the patient has a delayed-type hypersensitivity toward the compound tested; this compound is identified as an allergen and should be avoided.&nbsp; (Erythema that is present 15-60 min after patch removal but disappears by 48 hr after removal indicates an irritant reaction that is not allergic in nature.)<p></p>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Avoid testing on inflamed skin (eg, atopic dermatitis).</li>\n\t<li>Avoid testing if the patient has recently been taking certain medications (eg, systemic corticosteroid therapy, topical corticosteroid therapy at the test site, certain high-dose immunosuppressive therapy).&nbsp; Oral antihistamines are not expected to interfere with patch testing because type IV hypersensitivity is T-cell, not histamine, mediated.&nbsp; (In contrast, antihistamine therapy must be stopped prior to SPT and IAT because these tests evaluate for type I hypersensitivity, which is histamine mediated.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Examples of clinical applications</h1><h2>Case 1</h2><br><br><p>A child with atopic dermatitis and a history of vomiting after eating eggs tests positive for egg white IgE and has a 6-mm wheal on SPT.&nbsp; OFC confirms objective symptoms at 1 g of egg protein.&nbsp; Diagnosis: IgE-mediated egg allergy.</p>\n<h2>Case 2</h2><br><br><p>An adult reports a childhood penicillin allergy without recall of reaction.&nbsp; SPT and IAT are negative.&nbsp; A supervised oral amoxicillin challenge shows no reaction.&nbsp; Diagnosis: no current penicillin allergy.</p>\n<h2>Case 3</h2><br><br><p>A florist develops chronic hand eczema.&nbsp; Patch testing is positive for thiuram mix (rubber) and colophony (plant resin).&nbsp; Avoidance of rubber gloves and specific plants leads to symptom resolution.&nbsp; Diagnosis: allergic contact dermatitis.</p>\n<h2>Case 4</h2><br><br><p>An adult develops allergic conjunctivitis and allergic rhinitis when outdoors during the spring.&nbsp; Symptoms are generally well controlled with topical antihistamine eye drops and nasal corticosteroid therapy.&nbsp; The patient inquires about allergy testing to identify specific allergens.&nbsp; Allergy testing is not recommended because avoiding the likely allergens (eg, pollen) is impractical or impossible; in addition, symptoms are well controlled with medications.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Allergy testing involves diagnostic tools that identify immune-mediated hypersensitivity to substances such as foods, medications, contact allergens, and aeroallergens.&nbsp; Allergy testing can be broadly divided into tests that identify type I versus type IV hypersensitivities.</p><br><br><p>Type I hypersensitivity is IgE mediated and causes allergic asthma, seasonal allergies, food allergy, penicillin allergy, venom allergies (eg, wasps, bees, fire ants), and latex allergy.&nbsp; IgE-based allergy evaluation includes skin prick testing, intradermal testing, serum-specific IgE testing, and component-resolved diagnostics.&nbsp; A positive test suggests sensitization but must be accompanied by a history of allergic symptoms to diagnose an allergy to a particular compound.&nbsp; To definitively confirm tolerance to a food or drug, oral food challenge testing or graded drug challenge testing is performed under supervision.</p><br><br><p>Type IV hypersensitivity is T-cell mediated and classically causes allergic contact dermatitis (eg, poison ivy dermatitis) and rarer forms of drug allergies (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome).&nbsp; Patch testing is used to identify the culprit allergen in allergic contact dermatitis.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
