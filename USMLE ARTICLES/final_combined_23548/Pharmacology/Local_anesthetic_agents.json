Local anesthetics have a wide range of clinical uses, from alleviating pain during minor procedures to providing regional anesthesia.&nbsp; They are classified into 2 categories (amides and esters) based on their chemical structure, metabolism, and clinical characteristics.</p>\n<h1>Mechanism of action</h1><br><br><p>Nerve impulses are transmitted by the rapid influx of sodium ions through voltage-gated sodium channels in neuronal membranes.&nbsp; Local anesthetics reversibly <strong>block</strong> these <strong>voltage-gated sodium channels</strong>, preventing depolarization and halting the propagation of action potentials.&nbsp; This interrupts the transmission of pain signals to the brain.&nbsp; Sensory blockade occurs in a predictable sequence, beginning with the loss of pain perception, then temperature, touch, and pressure.</p><br><br><p>Local anesthetics are most effective on small, myelinated nerve fibers, although the fiber size plays a more significant role than myelination.&nbsp; The order of nerve blockade generally follows this pattern:&nbsp; Small, myelinated fibers are blocked first and are followed by small, unmyelinated fibers; then large, myelinated fibers; and, finally, large, unmyelinated fibers.&nbsp; In addition, rapidly firing nerves (eg, pain fibers) are more susceptible to blockade because the anesthetic binds when the target nerve's sodium channel is open and active.</p>\n<h1>Pharmacokinetics</h1><br><br><p>Local anesthetics are weak bases that exist in ionized and nonionized forms.&nbsp; The nonionized form is lipid soluble and easily crosses the neuronal membrane.&nbsp; When inside the neuron, the nonionized molecule acquires a proton (from a hydrogen ion) and becomes ionized.&nbsp; The ionized form, which is water soluble, binds to and blocks the voltage-gated sodium channel (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L58785.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Onset of action</h2><br><br><p>The ratio of ionized to nonionized molecules determines the onset of action.&nbsp; Because only the nonionized, lipid-soluble form can readily cross the neuronal membrane, a higher proportion of nonionized molecules leads to a faster onset of action.</p><br><br><p>The proportion of ionized versus nonionized molecules is influenced by the pH of the surrounding environment and the pKa of the anesthetic, which is the pH at which 50% of the drug is ionized and 50% is nonionized.&nbsp; Local anesthetics with a pKa closer to physiologic pH (7.4) have more nonionized molecules, resulting in a more rapid onset.</p><br><br><p>Acidic environments (eg, inflamed tissues) increase the proportion of ionized molecules, reducing the anesthetic's ability to penetrate nerve cells.&nbsp; This delays onset and often requires higher anesthetic concentrations to achieve adequate nerve blockade.&nbsp; Conversely, basic solutions favor the formation of nonionized molecules, so alkalinizing the anesthetic solution (eg, with bicarbonate) increases the onset of action.</p>\n<h2>Potency and duration of action</h2><br><br><p>Local anesthetics that are <strong>more lipid soluble</strong> (eg, bupivacaine) are generally <strong>more potent</strong> because they can more easily diffuse across the neuronal membrane.&nbsp; Lipid solubility also contributes to a <strong>longer duration of action</strong> because the anesthetic tends to accumulate in fatty tissues, which slows its clearance and extends its local effects.</p><br><br><p>The addition of a vasoconstrictor (eg, <strong>epinephrine</strong> [adrenaline]) to a local anesthetic solution <strong>prolongs the duration of action</strong> and increases the drug's effectiveness by reducing blood flow to the site of injection, which slows drug clearance.&nbsp; Epinephrine also lowers the risk for systemic absorption by keeping the anesthetic confined to the injection area.&nbsp; However, epinephrine use should be avoided in regions with smaller, end-arterial vessels (eg, fingers, nose, ears, toes, penis) due to a higher risk for ischemia in these areas.</p>\n<h1>Classification</h1><br><br><p>Although all local anesthetics share a common mechanism of action, they are divided into 2 categories based on molecular structure.&nbsp; Local anesthetics consist of a lipophilic aromatic ring and a tertiary amine, which are connected by an intermediate ester or amide linkage.&nbsp; The ester or amide link determines the category of the anesthetic:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Esters</strong> (eg, procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine) are hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterases, resulting in faster metabolism and a <strong>shorter duration of action</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Amides</strong> (eg, lidocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine) are metabolized by hepatic enzymes, which leads to slower metabolism and a <strong>longer duration of action</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Administration and clinical indications</h1><br><br><p>Local anesthetics are used to anesthetize the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and peripheral nerves.&nbsp; The route of administration depends on the intended effect or clinical indication:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Local infiltration</strong>:&nbsp; Local anesthetic is injected directly into the target site, which is often a small area.&nbsp; It is used for minor procedures (eg, sutures, abscess drainage).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Topical anesthesia</strong>:&nbsp; Topical anesthesia is useful for anesthetizing the skin (eg, prior to intravenous placement), surface of the eye (eg, corneal abrasions), or mucous membranes (eg, stomatitis, pharyngitis).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Peripheral nerve blocks</strong>:&nbsp; Anesthetic is injected near a specific nerve or nerve plexus to achieve anesthesia over a targeted region, such as a limb or dermatome.&nbsp; Examples include an intercostal block for rib fracture (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L66370.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), a digital block for finger/nail bed laceration (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73451.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), and a femoral nerve block for hip fracture.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neuraxial anesthesia</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Spinal anesthesia:&nbsp; Anesthetic is administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid in the lumbar spine, typically for lower abdominal, pelvic (eg, cesarean delivery), or lower extremity surgeries.</li>\n\t\t<li>Epidural anesthesia:&nbsp; A catheter inserted into the epidural space delivers a continuous infusion of local anesthetic (eg, bupivacaine).&nbsp; Epidural anesthesia is most often used to manage labor pain (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L81381.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic pain management</strong> (eg, nerve blocks for cancer or neuropathic pain).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Drug selection</h1><br><br><p>Local anesthetics differ in their potency, onset, duration of action, and potential adverse effects, which makes certain agents better suited for specific clinical indications.&nbsp; Commonly used local anesthetics include lidocaine, bupivacaine, benzocaine, and tetracaine.</p>\n<h2>Lidocaine</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; Amide.</li>\n\t<li>Onset/duration:&nbsp; <strong>Rapid onset</strong> (2-5 min) <strong>moderate duration</strong> (30-120 min).</li>\n\t<li>Uses:&nbsp; Most often used for local infiltration during minor procedures/dental work; also available in various topical formulations (eg, cream, viscous solutions, patch).</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; CNS toxicity and cardiovascular depression at high doses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bupivacaine</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; Amide.</li>\n\t<li>Onset/duration:&nbsp; <strong>Slower onset</strong> (15-30 min), <strong>long duration</strong> (5-10 hr or longer with epinephrine).</li>\n\t<li>Uses:&nbsp; Often used for postsurgical local anesthesia, neuraxial anesthesia, and peripheral nerve blocks due to its long duration of action.</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; High risk for severe <strong>cardiotoxicity</strong> (ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest) with inadvertent intravascular injection or high doses.</li>\n\t<li>Ropivacaine, another local anesthetic, is similar to bupivacaine but has a slightly different molecular structure, making it less potent but also less cardiotoxic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Benzocaine</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; Ester.</li>\n\t<li>Onset/duration:&nbsp; <strong>Rapid onset</strong> (1-3 min), <strong>short duration</strong> (15-30 min).</li>\n\t<li>Uses:&nbsp; Primarily used for <strong>topical anesthesia</strong> of the oropharynx (eg, pharyngitis), anus (eg, hemorrhoids), and skin (eg, insect bite, burns).</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Associated with <strong>methemoglobinemia</strong>, a condition in which hemoglobin loses its ability to carry oxygen effectively, resulting in cyanosis and hypoxia that are unresponsive to supplemental oxygen.&nbsp; The exact mechanism is unclear but can be reversed with methylene blue (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/58954.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tetracaine</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; Ester.</li>\n\t<li>Onset/duration:&nbsp; <strong>Rapid onset</strong> (10-20 sec), <strong>short duration</strong> (10-20 min).</li>\n\t<li>Uses:&nbsp; Most frequently used for topical <strong>ocular anesthesia</strong> (eg, corneal abrasion, tonometry).</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Prolonged, continuous use may lead to corneal epithelial toxicity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Adverse effects</h1><h2>Allergic reactions</h2><br><br><p>Allergic reactions to local anesthetics are rare but occur more often with ester-type anesthetics.&nbsp; This is due to the production of paraaminobenzoic acid, an antigenic metabolite formed by the action of pseudocholinesterase.&nbsp; Although less common, amide-type anesthetics can cause hypersensitivity reactions, primarily due to the preservative methylparaben.&nbsp; If a patient has an allergic reaction to one class of local anesthetics, future use should be limited to the other class.</p>\n<h2>Local anesthetic systemic toxicity</h2><br><br><p>Although local anesthetics are generally considered safe, they can cause systemic toxicity, particularly when administered in high doses or when inadvertently administered via intravascular injection.&nbsp; The CNS and cardiovascular system are most susceptible to toxicity:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>CNS manifestations:&nbsp; Include <strong>perioral numbness</strong>, <strong>metallic taste</strong>, <strong>tinnitus</strong>, anxiety, twitching, dizziness, <strong>seizures</strong>, CNS depression, coma.</li>\n\t<li>Cardiovascular collapse:&nbsp; Typically follows the development of CNS symptoms.&nbsp; Findings include hypotension, arrhythmias, heart block, and <strong>cardiac arrest</strong> (highest risk with bupivacaine).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Lipid emulsion therapy is first-line therapy, but extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be needed in refractory cases.&nbsp; Prevention strategies to avoid systemic toxicity include adhering to maximum dosing guidelines, using the lowest effective dose to achieve anesthesia, aspirating before injecting, and performing regional blocks under ultrasonographic guidance.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Local anesthetics are designed to alleviate pain in a specific location.&nbsp; They are classified as esters or amides and act by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels in the neuronal membrane, thereby preventing pain signals from reaching the brain.&nbsp; Local anesthetics have a wide range of clinical applications, providing both local and regional anesthesia.&nbsp; Although generally well tolerated, excessive systemic absorption or accidental intravascular injection can cause serious toxicity involving the CNS and cardiovascular system.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
