It results from impaired regulation of motor signals due to CNS damage and is commonly seen in conditions such as cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; Long-term management includes antispastic agents such as baclofen (most common), tizanidine, dantrolene, and diazepam.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acute musculoskeletal pain</strong> typically arises from overuse, strain, or injury and is often accompanied by muscle tension, spasms, and reduced range of motion.&nbsp; When initial treatments such as rest and analgesics (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are not sufficient to control symptoms, spasmolytic skeletal muscle relaxants (eg, cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, carisoprodol) may be used as adjunctive therapy.&nbsp; Use of these medications should be limited to &lt;4 weeks due to sedating effects, risk for dependence, and lack of proven long-term benefit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Antispastic agents</h1><h2>Baclofen</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; <strong>GABA B receptor agonist</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Mechanism:&nbsp; Decreases the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in presynaptic neurons in the spinal cord, thereby reducing neuronal excitability and alleviating motor overactivity and spasticity.</li>\n\t<li>Administration:&nbsp; Orally or intrathecally (if there is poor response or excessive sedation with oral therapy).</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Confusion, <strong>sedation</strong>, vertigo, nausea, headache, and muscle weakness (hypotonia).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Abrupt withdrawal of intrathecal baclofen can lead to a hypermetabolic state with high fever, increased spasticity, muscle rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis, resulting in organ failure and death.&nbsp; Abrupt withdrawal of oral baclofen can result in seizures.</p>\n<h2>Tizanidine</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; <strong>Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Mechanism:&nbsp; Works primarily in the spinal cord, inhibiting the presynaptic release of excitatory neurotransmitters.&nbsp; This reduces nerve signals to the motor neurons and prevents overstimulation of the muscle.</li>\n\t<li>Administration:&nbsp; Oral.</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Sedation, dizziness, anxiety, hypotension, and <strong>hepatotoxicity</strong> (requires liver function monitoring).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Use of tizanidine is <strong>contraindicated with CYP1A2 inhibitors</strong> (eg, ciprofloxacin).&nbsp; The combination increases plasma concentrations of tizanidine and increases the risk for hypotension and sedation.&nbsp; Tizanidine also has <strong>some spasmolytic effects</strong> and may be used <strong>for acute muscle pain</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Dantrolene</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; Direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant.</li>\n\t<li>Mechanism:&nbsp; <strong>Antagonizes ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum</strong> and prevents release of calcium into the cytoplasm of muscle fibers.&nbsp; With less intracellular calcium, muscle contraction decreases.</li>\n\t<li>Administration:&nbsp; Oral dantrolene is used for spasticity control.&nbsp; Intravenous dantrolene is used to manage <strong>malignant hyperthermia</strong> and <strong>neuroleptic malignant syndrome</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Hepatotoxicity (with oral administration) and skeletal and respiratory muscle weakness (with intravenous administration).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Oral</strong> dantrolene is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in patients with <strong>liver disease</strong> (eg, cirrhosis, hepatitis).</p>\n<h2>Diazepam</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; <strong>Benzodiazepine</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>Mechanism:&nbsp; <strong>Enhances GABA A receptor–mediated inhibition</strong> of motor pathways in the CNS and spinal cord.</li>\n\t<li>Administration:&nbsp; Oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or rectal.</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Sedation, CNS depression, and respiratory depression (increased risk with higher doses or when combined with opiates/ethanol).\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>High risk for medication <strong>tolerance</strong>, <strong>dependence</strong>, and <strong>abuse</strong>.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Diazepam is also used for muscle relaxation in acute painful muscular conditions.</p>\n<h1>Muscle relaxers (spasmolytics)</h1><h2>Cyclobenzaprine</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant.</li>\n\t<li>Mechanism:&nbsp; CNS depressant that is <strong>structurally similar to tricyclic antidepressants</strong>.&nbsp; It reduces somatic motor neuron activity in the brainstem, indirectly reducing skeletal muscle hyperactivity.</li>\n\t<li>Administration:&nbsp; Oral.</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Confusion, dizziness, and <strong>sedation</strong>.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Anticholinergic effects</strong> (eg, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention):&nbsp; Due to inhibition at muscarinic receptors (like other tricyclic antidepressants).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Serotonin syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; If combined with other serotonergic drugs.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Cyclobenzaprine can precipitate or exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias and is therefore contraindicated in patients with hyperthyroidism, prior myocardial infarction, arrhythmias/heart block, and heart failure.</p>\n<h2>Methocarbamol</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant.</li>\n\t<li>Mechanism:&nbsp; Exact mechanism is unknown; effects are presumed to be related to generalized CNS depression.</li>\n\t<li>Administration:&nbsp; Oral (most common), intravenous, or intramuscular.</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Sedation, dizziness, headache, confusion, amnesia, dyspepsia, and nausea.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Carisoprodol</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Class:&nbsp; Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant.</li>\n\t<li>Mechanism:&nbsp; Modulates neuronal activity in the descending reticular formation of the brain and spinal interneurons.&nbsp; In addition, meprobamate, the primary metabolite of carisoprodol, acts on GABA A receptors to enhance inhibitory neurotransmission.</li>\n\t<li>Administration:&nbsp; Oral.</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Sedation, dizziness, headache, nausea, and dry mouth.&nbsp; Risk for agitation with abrupt cessation.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Carisoprodol induces GABA A activity (similar to benzodiazepines), which increases the risk for tolerance, dependence, and abuse.</p>\n<h1>Additional considerations</h1><br><br><p>Skeletal muscle relaxants cause CNS effects (eg, sedation, dizziness, confusion).&nbsp; As a result, these medications should be avoided or used with caution in the elderly and individuals with cognitive impairment due to an increased risk for excessive drowsiness, falls, and delirium.&nbsp; In addition, concomitant use with other sedating drugs (eg, opiates) increases the risk for adverse effects (eg, respiratory depression).</p><br><br><p>Because of their higher potential for dependence and abuse, diazepam and carisoprodol are not recommended as first-line agents.&nbsp; If used, they should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Skeletal muscle relaxants include a diverse array of agents with different mechanisms of action.&nbsp; Antispastic medications are used for long-term management in patients with spasticity from neurologic disease.&nbsp; Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants are intended to provide short-term symptom relief in patients with acute muscular conditions.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
