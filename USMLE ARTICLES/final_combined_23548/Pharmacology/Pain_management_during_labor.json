Nonpharmacologic approaches generally focus on increasing the capacity to cope with pain, whereas pharmacologic approaches are generally directed at reducing the physical sensation of labor pain.&nbsp; Various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods are available, each with benefits and potential risks.</p>\n<h1>Labor pain physiology</h1><br><br><p>Labor pain arises primarily due to uterine contractions, cervical dilation, and pelvic floor stretching with fetal descent, which triggers both visceral and somatic pain pathways.&nbsp; The different stages of labor activate different pathways, which changes the type of pain experienced (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44056.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>In the first stage of labor, uterine contractions stretch and distend the cervix and lower uterine segment.&nbsp; This activates small, unmyelinated fibers at T10 through L1, resulting in dull and poorly localized visceral pain that is referred to the T10-T12 dermatomes.&nbsp; Therefore, pain is commonly felt in the lower abdomen, sacrum, and back.</p><br><br><p>As labor progresses to the late first stage and into the second stage, cervical, vaginal, and perineal stretching activate fine myelinated fibers at S2 through S4 (via the pudendal nerve), resulting in sharp, localized somatic pain.</p>\n<h1>Nonpharmacologic pain management</h1><br><br><p>Nonpharmacologic approaches are designed to increase comfort and coping ability rather than reduce pain.&nbsp; These methods can be used alone or as adjuncts to pharmacologic intervention and include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Continuous labor support:&nbsp; Trained labor support person (eg, doula) provides nonmedical care in the form of guidance, reassurance, and assistance with movement.</li>\n\t<li>Hydrotherapy:&nbsp; Water immersion reduces pain intensity and improves relaxation.</li>\n\t<li>Movement:&nbsp; Movement or frequent position changes (eg, birthing ball, hands and knees positioning) during labor may ameliorate pain.</li>\n\t<li>Breathing techniques:&nbsp; Controlled breathing (eg, Lamaze method) helps focus attention and manage contractions.</li>\n\t<li>Massage:&nbsp; Lumbosacral counterpressure reduces muscle tension and provides pain relief for some women.</li>\n\t<li>Acupuncture and Acupressure:&nbsp; Stimulation of endorphin release modulates pain perception.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The main advantage of nonpharmacologic pain management techniques is that there are essentially no adverse effects; however, the disadvantage is that they require preparation prior to the onset of labor and do not prevent the actual pain signals.</p>\n<h1>Pharmacologic pain management</h1><h2>Systemic analgesia</h2><br><br><p><strong>Systemic analgesics</strong> act on the CNS to diminish pain and most commonly include <strong>opioids</strong> (eg, fentanyl, nalbuphine).&nbsp; Systemic analgesics are advantageous because they are inexpensive, easily administered, have a quick onset of action, and are less invasive than regional anesthetics (eg, neuraxial blocks).&nbsp; However, their disadvantages can be significant:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Maternal respiratory depression (because they are centrally acting agents).</li>\n\t<li>Somnolence without significant pain relief.</li>\n\t<li>Nausea/vomiting.</li>\n\t<li>Pruritus.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition, they <strong>cross the placenta</strong>; therefore, they can cause changes to the fetal heart rate (most often decreased variability) and <strong>neonatal depression</strong> following delivery.&nbsp; Due to the risk for neonatal depression, systemic opioids are not administered within 4 hours of delivery (to allow ample time for maternal metabolism prior to delivery).</p><br><br><p><strong>Nitrous oxide</strong> is another option for systemic analgesia that is self-administered through a handheld face mask.&nbsp; This anesthetic gas is eliminated quickly through respiration; therefore, it does not accumulate within the mother/neonate or cause respiratory depression.&nbsp; In addition, because it is self-administered, as the patient becomes drowsy, they are no longer able to continue administration.</p>\n<h2>Regional analgesia</h2><br><br><p>Regional analgesia refers to the use of local anesthetics to temporarily block nerve impulses, and therefore pain perception, from specific areas of the body.&nbsp; Several different regional anesthesia methods are used in labor and delivery to achieve pain relief.&nbsp; In general, regional anesthesia provides superior pain relief compared to other options.</p><br><br><p><strong>Neuraxial analgesia</strong> is a type of regional anesthesia that involves <strong>local anesthetic and opioid</strong> administration near the spinal cord to inhibit pain transmission from large regions of the body.&nbsp; For labor and delivery, neuraxial analgesia is achieved by blocking nerve transmission of T10-L1 fibers in the first stage of labor and S2-S4 fibers during the second stage of labor.&nbsp; Access through the ligamentum flavum and dura mater of the vertebral column below the L4 vertebrae (which is below spinal cord termination) is required.&nbsp; Neuraxial analgesia is subdivided based on the space in which medication is administered:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Epidural neuraxial analgesia</strong>:&nbsp; Involves catheter placement within the epidural space, which allows for continuous infusion of local anesthetic (eg, bupivacaine) and opioid (eg, fentanyl) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L81381.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Spinal neuraxial analgesia</strong>:&nbsp; Involves a single injection into the subarachnoid space (contains cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]).&nbsp; This is commonly used in planned cesarean deliveries because its onset is rapid and typically denser than an epidural alone.&nbsp; However, its duration is limited to the half-life of the medication administered because there is no indwelling catheter for additional medication administration.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Combined spinal-epidural (CSE) analgesia</strong>:&nbsp; Consists of both subarachnoid medication injection (spinal) as well as epidural catheter placement to provide continuous relief for longer-lasting anesthesia.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Lower extremity weakness is expected with these techniques because L2-L5 nerve roots innervate the legs.</p><br><br><p>Local anesthetics can be used in more specific areas.&nbsp; Following delivery, local anesthetics are commonly injected into obstetric lacerations for repair.&nbsp; Additionally, a <strong>pudendal nerve block</strong> (S2 through S4) can be administered for extensive laceration repairs or during the second stage of labor to alleviate pain arising from the perineum and external genitalia (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26104.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Regional pain management complications</h1><h2>Maternal hypotension</h2><br><br><p>In addition to blocking the sensory and motor nerves, epidural analgesia also blocks L2-L5 sympathetic nerve fibers responsible for vascular tone in the lower extremities.&nbsp; This results in <strong>vasodilation</strong> (venous pooling), <strong>decreased venous return</strong> to the heart, and decreased cardiac output.&nbsp; As a result, many patients develop <strong>hypotension</strong> and compensatory tachycardia (sympathetic innervation to the heart via T1 through T4 is not impacted).&nbsp; If significant hypotension occurs, patients can have <strong>decreased placental perfusion</strong> (eg, late decelerations, fetal hypoxemia).&nbsp; Because of this, continuous fetal heart rate monitoring is necessary with epidural anesthesia due to the potential for fetal distress from hypotension.</p><br><br><p>Neuraxial-induced hypotension can be managed with left uterine displacement (ie, positioning the patient on the left side to improve venous return), an intravenous fluid bolus, and vasopressor administration (eg, phenylephrine, ephedrine).</p>\n<h2>Prolonged labor</h2><br><br><p>Epidural anesthesia may slightly prolong labor (eg, 30 minutes in the first stage, 15 minutes in the second stage) but is overall clinically negligible.&nbsp; Neuraxial anesthesia does <u>not</u> increase the risk of cesarean delivery or instrumental delivery.</p>\n<h2>Postdural puncture headache</h2><br><br><p>Following spinal block, or with incidental dural injury during epidural placement, CSF may leak into the epidural space, which reduces the pressure around the brain and causes tissue and nerve stretching, resulting in <strong>postdural puncture headache</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/50126.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Patients present within 72 hours of the procedure with:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Postural headache (<strong>worsens with sitting up</strong> and <strong>improves with lying down</strong>).</li>\n\t<li>Nausea, vomiting.</li>\n\t<li>Photophobia.</li>\n\t<li>Neck stiffness.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Most postdural puncture headaches are self-limited and resolve with fluid hydration, <strong>caffeine</strong>, and analgesics; however, patients with severe symptoms are treated with an <strong>epidural blood patch</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L95409.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>High spinal anesthesia</h2><br><br><p>High spinal anesthesia can occur following a spinal block or with an inadvertent dural puncture during epidural placement.&nbsp; Excessive local anesthetic in the subarachnoid (intrathecal) space can spread cephalad (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L65433.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Although complete motor blockade below the low thoracic and lumbar spinal levels is typical and expected with neuraxial anesthesia, high spinal anesthesia results in <strong>ascending paralysis</strong> as the anesthetic diffuses to the upper thoracic and lower cervical spinal levels.&nbsp; Symptoms can include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Acute dyspnea and hypoxemia due to paralysis of the intercostal muscles (T1-T6).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bilateral upper extremity weakness</strong> (C5-C7).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Respiratory paralysis</strong> (apnea) due to blockade of the diaphragm (C3-C5).</li>\n\t<li>Difficulty swallowing or speaking (C3-C5).</li>\n\t<li>Bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia (due to peripheral vasodilation), and cardiopulmonary arrest (sympathetic blockade).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Management is with <strong>immediate cessation of the epidural infusion</strong>, reverse Trendelenburg positioning (head up to decrease the rate of ascending anesthetic), and <strong>emergency supportive care</strong> (eg, intubation, vasopressors).</p>\n<h2>Local anesthetic systemic toxicity</h2><br><br><p>Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) is a <strong>life-threatening adverse event</strong> that may occur after the administration of local anesthetic drugs through a variety of routes.&nbsp; LAST can rarely occur with epidural analgesia containing local anesthesia (eg, bupivacaine) if the catheter is placed within epidural vasculature.&nbsp; When the anesthetic is absorbed into the maternal circulation, it initially blocks inhibitory neural pathways, resulting in CNS overactivity (eg, <strong>perioral numbness</strong>, <strong>tinnitus</strong>), potentially followed by <strong>generalized tonic-clonic seizure</strong>.&nbsp; In addition, patients often develop increased cardiovascular sympathetic activity (eg, hypertension, tachycardia), which is followed by <strong>cardiovascular collapse</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Contraindications to pain management</h1><br><br><p>Systemic opioids are contraindicated near delivery due to the risk for neonatal respiratory depression, and nitrous oxide is contraindicated in patients with pernicious anemia due to further functional depletion of B12, which can lead to severe neurologic complications (eg, peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy).</p><br><br><p>Neuraxial anesthesia contraindications include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increased intracranial pressure (eg, hydrocephalus, intracranial mass) due to the risk for cerebral herniation.</li>\n\t<li>Coagulopathy, preeclampsia with severe thrombocytopenia, and von Willebrand disease due to the risk of spinal hematoma.</li>\n\t<li>Prior spinal surgeries (eg, spinal fusion), scoliosis.</li>\n\t<li>Obstructive cardiomyopathies (eg, severe mitral/aortic stenosis, left ventricular outflow obstruction) because these preload-dependent lesions can have cardiovascular decompensation when combined with neuraxial-induced hypotension.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Effective pain management during labor enhances the birthing experience and ensures maternal and fetal well-being.&nbsp; A multimodal approach, integrating both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic techniques, allows individualized care based on patient needs and medical conditions.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
