The teratogenic potential of a drug depends on multiple factors, including dose, timing of exposure relative to gestational age, genetic susceptibility, and concurrent exposures.&nbsp; The most critical period for structural malformations is during organogenesis in the first trimester (3-8 weeks gestation), although functional deficits can result from exposure at later stages.</p>\n<h1>Mechanisms and timing</h1><br><br><p>Teratogenicity may result from:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Disruption of cell proliferation or differentiation.</li>\n\t<li>Interference with folate metabolism.</li>\n\t<li>Endocrine disruption.</li>\n\t<li>Direct toxicity to developing tissues.</li>\n\t<li>Vascular disruption or thrombosis in the placenta or embryo.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Critical periods</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Preimplantation (0-2 weeks gestation):&nbsp; All-or-none effect; the exposure either results in embryonic death or does not affect the developing fetus.</li>\n\t<li>Organogenesis (3-8 weeks gestation):&nbsp; This period has the highest risk for structural malformations due to its high cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and morphogenesis.&nbsp; Insults during this time are associated with significant fetal malformations.</li>\n\t<li>Fetal period (&gt;8 weeks gestation):&nbsp; Insults during this period are associated with growth abnormalities, CNS abnormalities (eg, microcephaly, low intelligence), and functional deficits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Antiepileptic drugs</h1><br><br><p>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are associated with an increased risk for congenital abnormalities, including neural tube defects, congenital heart anomalies, and cleft palate, due to their ability to cross the placenta and cause low folate levels and high oxidative metabolite levels in the fetus.</p><br><br><p>For women on AEDs, changing to an alternate regimen with a lower teratogenicity risk (eg, levetiracetam) should be tried 6 months prior to attempts to conceive.&nbsp; It is preferable to switch to the lowest possible dose of a single medication (eg, monotherapy) to limit teratogenicity.&nbsp; In contrast, unless absolutely necessary (eg, uncontrolled seizure activity), no changes to the AED regimen should be made after conception because:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Abrupt changes in AEDs may trigger seizures.</li>\n\t<li>In early gestation, gradually changing to an AED regimen by overlapping medications exposes the fetus to possible additional teratogens.</li>\n\t<li>Once pregnancy is confirmed, there is likely little benefit to changes in medication because the majority of organogenesis has already occurred (eg, 3-8 weeks gestation).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Any patient on AEDs should begin <strong>high-dose (4 mg) folic acid supplementation</strong> at least 3 months prior to attempting to conceive.&nbsp; Fetuses of patients on AEDs at the time of conception are screened for neural tube defects using serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and anatomy ultrasonography.</p>\n<h2>Valproic acid</h2><br><br><p>Valproic acid, or valproate, carries the highest teratogenicity risk of all AEDs.&nbsp; In addition to treating epilepsy, it is used for migraine prevention and bipolar disorder treatment.&nbsp; Valproic acid interferes with folate metabolism and causes maternal folate deficiency.&nbsp; Folic acid is required to regulate fetal neural tube closure in early pregnancy; therefore, fetuses of patients taking valproate are at increased risk for <strong>neural tube defects</strong> (eg, meningocele, myelomeningocele).</p>\n<h2>Phenytoin</h2><br><br><p>Phenytoin is a folate-antagonizing AED that can cross the placenta and cause low folate levels and high oxidative metabolite levels in the fetus.&nbsp; Both factors likely contribute to <strong>fetal hydantoin syndrome</strong>, which can present with neural tube defects, microcephaly, distal digit/nail hypoplasia, cardiac defects, and dysmorphic facial features (ie, midface hypoplasia) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L46798.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Phenobarbital, topiramate, and carbamazepine</h2><br><br><p>Phenobarbital is associated with cardiac, orofacial, and urogenital malformations.</p><br><br><p>Topiramate is associated with oral clefts, fetal growth restriction, and neurodevelopmental issues (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder).</p><br><br><p>Carbamazepine is associated with neural tube defects, although to a lesser extent than valproic acid.</p>\n<h1>Retinoids</h1><br><br><p>The most commonly used retinoid is <strong>isotretinoin</strong>, a synthetic vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of severe nodulocystic acne.</p><br><br><p>Retinoids are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy because they disrupt neural crest cell migration and retinoic acid signaling pathways, which are critical for embryonic patterning.&nbsp; Therefore, teratogenic risks involve a wide range of defects, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Spontaneous abortions.</li>\n\t<li>Microcephaly, cerebellar malformation, and developmental delay.</li>\n\t<li>Cardiac anomalies.</li>\n\t<li>Endocrine gland abnormalities.</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Craniofacial defects (microtia, cleft palate, microphthalmia, facial dysmorphia).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because of the severe risk that retinoids pose during pregnancy, the United States requires all patients, regardless of gender, to enroll in the iPLEDGE risk-management program.&nbsp; This program requires that all patients of reproductive age receive oral and written material on the hazards of pregnancy while taking this medication.&nbsp; It also requires:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>2 negative pregnancy tests ≥19 days apart prior to therapy initiation.</li>\n\t<li>2 forms of contraception 1 month prior, during, and 1 month after treatment.</li>\n\t<li>Monthly pregnancy tests.</li>\n\t<li>Pregnancy test 1 month following completion of therapy.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Potentially, any fetus exposed to this medication during pregnancy can be affected; however, no test can determine whether an exposed fetus has been affected.&nbsp; Patients require frequent ultrasonography for evaluation of fetal malformations; those with significant malformations detected in early pregnancy can be offered a pregnancy termination.</p>\n<h1>Methotrexate</h1><br><br><p>Methotrexate is commonly used for cancer treatment and other common conditions (eg, rheumatoid arthritis).&nbsp; Methotrexate is a folic acid analogue that competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28055.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which produces nucleic acid precursors essential to DNA synthesis and repair.&nbsp; Rapidly dividing cells (eg, neural tube, stem, hepatic, and epithelial cells) are particularly susceptible to folate antagonism.<p></p><br><br><p>Methotrexate has abortifacient and/or teratogenic effects when used during the first trimester and is contraindicated in pregnancy except under specific circumstances (eg, cancer therapy with no better alternative, treatment of ectopic pregnancy).&nbsp; Methotrexate can cause:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Spontaneous abortion.</li>\n\t<li>Methotrexate embryopathy:&nbsp; Includes multiple structural anomalies such as fetal growth restriction, cranial ossification defects, microcephaly, and limb deformities (eg, shortened limbs).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Use in pregnancy is avoided when possible.&nbsp; If used in noncancer treatments (eg, rheumatoid arthritis), methotrexate should be discontinued ≥3 months before conception.</p><br><br><p><strong>ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers</strong></p><br><br><p>ACE inhibitors (eg, enalapril, lisinopril) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (eg, losartan) are commonly used, first-line antihypertensive medications.</p><br><br><p>ACE inhibitors and ARBs are highly teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy, particularly during the second and third trimesters (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L69724.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This is because both medications decrease the activity of angiotensin II, which is critical for fetal renal development and urine production.&nbsp; ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to II, and ARBs block angiotensin II activity at the angiotensin II receptor type I.&nbsp; The use of either type of medication during pregnancy can cause <strong>fetal renal hypoplasia or dysgenesis</strong> and decreased fetal urine output.<p></p><br><br><p>Because fetal urine is the main component of amniotic fluid, fetal renal hypoplasia typically equates to low amniotic fluid levels (oligohydramnios).&nbsp; Amniotic fluid is vital for fetal lung development, and normal levels typically protect against fetal compression; chronically low levels can lead to <strong>pulmonary hypoplasia</strong> and limb compression or deformity (ie, <strong>Potter sequence</strong>) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29810.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Low amniotic fluid levels can also contribute to severe fetal growth restriction.<p></p><br><br><p>In patients with chronic hypertension, medications need to be switched to a pregnancy-safe regimen (eg, labetalol, nifedipine, methyldopa) prior to conception.&nbsp; If pregnancy occurs, the medication should be discontinued on recognition of the pregnancy, and detailed anatomic ultrasonography should be performed between 18 and 22 weeks gestation.</p>\n<h1>Antithyroid Medications</h1><br><br><p>Thionamide antithyroid drugs (eg, propylthiouracil [PTU], methimazole) are used to decrease thyroid hormone production (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19124.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Methimazole is preferred for most patients due to the hepatotoxicity of PTU.&nbsp; However, methimazole has potential teratogenic effects, which include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Aplasia cutis.</li>\n\t<li>Esophageal atresia.</li>\n\t<li>Facial anomalies.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Therefore, PTU is preferred in the first trimester of pregnancy, with patients returning to methimazole for the second and third trimesters.</p>\n<h1>Warfarin</h1><br><br><p>Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that blocks epoxide reductase in the liver, leading to impaired vitamin K recycling.&nbsp; This depletes the reduced form of vitamin K, which is required for gamma carboxylation of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X).</p><br><br><p>Although warfarin is the most effective anticoagulant compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), it crosses the placenta and remains highly teratogenic early in pregnancy and poses fetal risks throughout pregnancy.</p><br><br><p><strong>Warfarin embryopathy</strong> can develop when patients take warfarin during the first trimester.&nbsp; It&nbsp; most commonly affects bone and cartilage, resulting in:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Limb hypoplasia</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stippled epiphyses</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nasal hypoplasia</strong>.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>CNS findings (eg, optic atrophy, microcephaly, intellectual disability) are less well documented but may be associated with warfarin use at any point in pregnancy.&nbsp; Fetal hemorrhage and intrauterine fetal demise can occur with warfarin use in the later stages of pregnancy.</p><br><br><p>Typically, warfarin is completely avoided in pregnancy, so another form of anticoagulation is used.&nbsp; However, women with mechanical heart valves require warfarin due to the high anticoagulation risk.&nbsp; Therefore, in these patients, anticoagulation is switched to LMWH during the first trimester to avoid the teratogenic effects of warfarin.&nbsp; Patients are then switched back to warfarin in the second and third trimesters, followed by a switch to UFH near delivery (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/93335.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Antibiotics</h1><br><br><p><strong>Fluoroquinolones</strong></p><br><br><p>Fluoroquinolones should generally be avoided during pregnancy because they cross the placenta and are associated with cartilage and bone toxicity in developing fetuses.&nbsp; However, they should be used if no safe alternative exists.</p><br><br><p><strong>Tetracyclines</strong></p><br><br><p>Tetracyclines cross the placenta and are avoided during pregnancy because they accumulate within fetal bone and teeth, which can temporarily inhibit long bone growth and cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth.&nbsp; In addition, tetracycline use in pregnancy can cause maternal hepatotoxicity.</p>\n<h1>Migraine medications</h1><br><br><p><strong>Ergots</strong></p><br><br><p>Ergot derivatives are absolutely contraindicated in pregnant women due to the potential to induce hypertonic uterine contractions and/or severe vasoconstriction.&nbsp; Alternatives to migraine management in pregnancy include acetaminophen (first line), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (second line), and opioids/triptans (third line).</p>\n<h1>Historically significant teratogens</h1><h2>Lithium</h2><br><br><p>Lithium is an effective treatment in bipolar disorder and can be used for acute mania and depression, as well as the prevention of depressive and manic episodes.</p><br><br><p>Lithium use during the first trimester is classically associated with cardiac malformations, particularly <strong>Ebstein anomaly</strong>, which is the abnormal positioning of the tricuspid valve and atrialization of the right ventricle (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L1428.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The absolute risk is small, given that Ebstein anomaly is rare in the general population and that there is a reduced risk with a lower lithium dose in the first trimester (ie, use minimum effective dose).<p></p><br><br><p>Additional adverse effects (eg, neonatal lithium toxicity, preterm delivery) are associated with lithium use later in pregnancy.</p>\n<h2>Diethylstilbestrol (DES)</h2><br><br><p>Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a nonsteroidal synthetic estrogen that was initially used for lactation suppression and postmenopausal symptoms.&nbsp; It was also widely used for the prevention of spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery.</p><br><br><p>DES readily crosses the placenta; exposure during organogenesis leads to disorganization of the developing uterine muscle layers, prevention of stratification of the vaginal epithelium, and resorption of the vaginal glands (leading to vaginal adenosis).&nbsp; Therefore, DES is historically linked with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Clear cell adenocarcinoma</strong> of the vagina and cervix in female offspring.</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Uterine malformations and infertility, resulting in increased risk for infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and spontaneous abortion.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Thalidomide</strong>Thalidomide was first introduced as a sedative agent designed to treat insomnia and anxiety.&nbsp; However, its use during pregnancy was highly teratogenic and resulted in spontaneous abortions and <strong>phocomelia</strong> (severe limb defects, flipper-like appendage).&nbsp; Thalidomide is still used for patients with refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Several commonly prescribed medications carry teratogenic risks, particularly when exposure occurs during early pregnancy.&nbsp; These teratogenic medications are associated with a spectrum of congenital malformations, growth abnormalities, and neurodevelopmental impairments (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/42328.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
