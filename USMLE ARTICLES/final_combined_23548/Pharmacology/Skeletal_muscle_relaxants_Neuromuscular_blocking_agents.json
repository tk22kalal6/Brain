NMBAs are classified as either depolarizing or nondepolarizing based on their mechanism of action.&nbsp; These medications are used most often to facilitate intubation, provide muscle relaxation during surgery, or enable prolonged mechanical ventilation.</p>\n<h1>Neuromuscular junction physiology</h1><br><br><p>The neuromuscular junction consists of the presynaptic motor neuron terminal, synaptic cleft, and postsynaptic motor endplate, which contains <strong>nicotinic acetylcholine receptors</strong>.&nbsp; When an action potential reaches the presynaptic motor neuron terminal, it triggers the release of acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft.&nbsp; Acetylcholine then binds to the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the motor endplate, leading to the depolarization of the myocyte membrane and causing muscle contraction (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L30213.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Indications</h1><br><br><p>NMBAs induce skeletal muscle paralysis by acting at the neuromuscular junction.&nbsp; They do not affect smooth or cardiac muscle, but they do paralyze respiratory muscles (eg, diaphragm); therefore, patients require mechanical ventilation.&nbsp; Because NMBAs lack sedative or analgesic effects, adequate sedation and pain control are crucial for preventing awareness and distress during paralysis.&nbsp; Common indications include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Endotracheal intubation</strong>:&nbsp; Paralysis of the vocal cords and diaphragm improves intubating conditions, increases success rates, and reduces the risk for vomiting and aspiration during procedures.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Surgery</strong>:&nbsp; Muscle relaxation is especially beneficial during laparoscopic or robotic procedures, abdominal or thoracic surgeries, and intricate microsurgical dissections in which complete immobility of the patient is required.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mechanical ventilation</strong>:&nbsp; NMBAs prevent coughing and patient–ventilator asynchrony.&nbsp; By allowing the ventilator to perform all respiratory work, these medications help reduce metabolic demand and oxygen consumption in severely hypoxemic, critically ill patients (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Therapeutic hypothermia</strong>:&nbsp; Neuromuscular blockade is used to prevent shivering during therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest.&nbsp; Shivering not only generates heat and opposes cooling efforts, but also raises metabolic demand, undermining the goals of hypothermia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Mechanism of action</h1><br><br><p>NMBAs are classified as either depolarizing or nondepolarizing based on their specific mechanism of action.</p>\n<h2>Depolarizing agents</h2><br><br><p>Depolarizing agents (eg, succinylcholine) act as strong <strong>nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists</strong> at the neuromuscular junction.&nbsp; Succinylcholine binds the receptor and causes <strong>sustained depolarization</strong> of the muscle membrane.&nbsp; This renders the muscle fiber unable to repolarize, resulting in transient fasciculations (muscle contractions) followed by flaccid paralysis.&nbsp; This effect occurs in 2 phases:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Phase I</strong> (prolonged depolarization):&nbsp; Sustained depolarization of the motor endplate keeps voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactivated state, preventing the generation of further action potentials and leading to flaccid paralysis of the muscle.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Phase II</strong> (repolarization with desensitization):&nbsp; The motor endplate gradually repolarizes with continued administration of succinylcholine, but the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors become desensitized and less responsive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nondepolarizing agents</h2><br><br><p>Nondepolarizing agents (eg, rocuronium, vecuronium) act as <strong>competitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists</strong> at the neuromuscular junction.&nbsp; They bind to the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (without activating them) and block acetylcholine from binding.&nbsp; This <strong>prevents depolarization</strong> and muscle contraction.</p>\n<h1>Pharmacokinetics and drug selection</h1><br><br><p>NMBAs are typically administered via the intravenous route.&nbsp; Depending on the desired duration of action, the medication can be given as a bolus (eg, rapid sequence intubation) or an infusion (eg, prolonged mechanical ventilation).&nbsp; Dosing calculations are based on ideal (not actual) body weight to avoid overdose or prolonged effects.</p>\n<h1>Depolarizing agents</h1><h2>Succinylcholine</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The only clinically available depolarizing agent.</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Most often used for <strong>rapid sequence intubation</strong> (ie, rapid sequence administration of an induction agent and NMBA).</li>\n\t<li>Onset/duration of action:&nbsp;

Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors causes sodium influx and potassium efflux.&nbsp; Exaggerated hyperkalemia and life-threatening arrhythmias can occur in patients with crush or burn injuries, denervating injuries or diseases (eg, quadriplegia, Guillain-Barré syndrome), and myopathies.&nbsp; These pathologic states cause upregulation of muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and/or rhabdomyolysis, which can result in the release of large amounts of potassium when succinylcholine is administered.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Malignant hyperthermia</strong> (in genetically predisposed individuals):&nbsp;

Increase the amount of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, enabling them to competitively bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and restore nerve transmission and muscle contraction.&nbsp;

<strong>Intermediate onset</strong> (3-4 min), <strong>intermediate duration</strong> of action (25-50 min).</li>\n\t<li>Metabolism:&nbsp; Hepatic and renal excretion.</li>\n\t<li>Reversal agents:&nbsp; Sugammadex and anticholinesterase medications.</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Can accumulate in patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction and cause vagal block (eg, tachycardia).</li>\n\t<li>Contraindications:&nbsp; None, but vecuronium should be used cautiously in patients with renal and hepatic failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Atracurium</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Onset/duration of action:&nbsp; <strong>Intermediate onset</strong> (3-6 min), <strong>intermediate duration</strong> of action (20-60 min).</li>\n\t<li>Metabolism:&nbsp; <strong>Hofmann elimination</strong> (spontaneous degradation in the plasma, independent of renal and hepatic function).</li>\n\t<li>Reversal agents:&nbsp; Anticholinesterase drugs (sugammadex is not effective).</li>\n\t<li>Adverse effects:&nbsp; Releases histamine and may induce flushing, bronchoconstriction, and decreased blood pressure.</li>\n\t<li>Contraindications:&nbsp; Hemodynamic instability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Additional considerations</h1><br><br><p>Several medications can potentiate the effects of NMBAs, leading to toxicity or prolonged paralytic effects.&nbsp; These include inhaled anesthetics, antibiotics (eg, polymyxins, aminoglycosides, vancomycin), calcium channel blockers, lithium, and procainamide.&nbsp; In addition, electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia, hypermagnesemia), hypothermia, and metabolic acidosis can also increase the paralytic effects.</p><br><br><p>Patients with <strong>myasthenia gravis</strong> are extremely <strong>sensitive to nondepolarizing agents</strong>.&nbsp; Because they have a lower number of functioning nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (due to destruction by autoantibodies), very small doses can induce profound paralysis.&nbsp; Conversely, patients with myasthenia gravis are often <strong>resistant to depolarizing agents</strong>.&nbsp; The reduced number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors tends to inhibit endplate depolarization, and patients require extremely large doses to induce muscle relaxation.</p>\n<h1>Assessment of paralytic effect</h1><br><br><p><strong>Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation</strong> is used during anesthesia to assess the degree of paralysis induced by NMBAs (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10321.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; A peripheral nerve is stimulated 4 times in quick succession, and the muscular response is recorded.&nbsp; The height of each bar represents the strength of each twitch; higher bars indicate the activation of increasing numbers of individual muscle fibers.<p></p><br><br><p><strong>Nondepolarizing agents</strong> create a <strong>progressive reduction</strong> in each of the 4 responses (fading pattern) because competitive inhibition of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors prevents some of these fibers from activating, decreasing the strength of the twitch with each stimulus.</p><br><br><p>In contrast, <strong>depolarizing agents</strong> initially prevent repolarization of the motor endplate and show <strong>equal reduction in all 4 twitches</strong> (phase I blockade).&nbsp; Persistent exposure to succinylcholine results in the eventual transition to phase II blockade as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors become desensitized (ie, functionally similar to nondepolarizing blockade).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) induce skeletal muscle paralysis by interfering with neuromuscular transmission at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the motor endplate.&nbsp; They are classified as either depolarizing or nondepolarizing based on their mechanism of action.&nbsp; Depolarizing agents mimic acetylcholine and cause persistent depolarization of the muscle membrane, whereas nondepolarizing agents competitively block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors without activating them.&nbsp; These medications are commonly used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and provide muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
