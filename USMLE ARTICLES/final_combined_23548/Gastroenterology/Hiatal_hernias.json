The most common type is a sliding hiatal hernia, which involves the gastroesophageal junction and proximal stomach slipping upward into the chest.&nbsp; Sliding hiatal hernias are usually asymptomatic but can cause reflux symptoms.&nbsp; The less common paraesophageal hiatal hernia refers to migration of the gastric fundus into the chest through a defect in the diaphragm.&nbsp; This can lead to symptoms including nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, and epigastric/chest pain.&nbsp; Diagnosis of hiatal hernia is confirmed with barium swallow study or upper endoscopy.&nbsp; Symptomatic sliding hernias are typically managed with anti-reflux medications, but paraesophageal hernias often require surgical repair.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The diaphragm is a large muscle that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities.&nbsp; It normally has a small opening (ie, esophageal hiatus) through which the esophagus passes before connecting to the stomach.&nbsp; The distal esophagus is anchored circumferentially to the diaphragm by the phrenoesophageal membrane, and the stomach is held in place by the gastrosplenic and gastrocolic ligaments.&nbsp; A hiatal hernia occurs when either laxity or a defect (hole) in the phrenoesophageal membrane allows for migration of the stomach into the thoracic cavity.</p><br><br><p>Hiatal hernias are categorized as sliding (most common) or paraesophageal:</p>\n<h2>Sliding hiatal hernia (95%)</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Progressive widening of the esophageal hiatus coupled with increasing laxity of phrenoesophageal membrane, typically in the setting of age-related degeneration or repetitive stress (eg, vomiting, coughing), allows the gastroesophageal junction and proximal stomach to slide up into the thoracic cavity.</li>\n\t<li>Predisposes patients to reflux symptoms (eg, heartburn, regurgitation) due to incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter once translocated above the diaphragm.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Paraesophageal hernia (5%)</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A defect in the phrenoesophageal membrane (often due to previous trauma or surgery) and increased laxity of the stomach anchoring gastrocolic and gastrosplenic ligaments allow the gastric fundus to migrate through the diaphragm next to the esophagus while the gastroesophageal junction stays in place.</li>\n\t<li>Larger defects can also result in the subsequent herniation of the surrounding stomach and intraabdominal organs (eg, bowel, spleen) into the chest, causing more severe symptoms.</li>\n\t<li>Predisposes patients to gastric volvulus, incarceration/strangulation, and respiratory complications (due to lung compression).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The exact mechanism of hiatal hernia formation is not fully understood, but contributing risk factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Older age (&gt;50):&nbsp; Age-related loss of diaphragmatic muscle tone and elasticity increases risk of herniation</li>\n\t<li>Elevated intraabdominal pressure:&nbsp; Several factors may lead to progressive weakening of the phrenoesophageal membrane, including obesity, pregnancy, chronic constipation, regular heavy lifting, and chronic cough (eg, COPD)</li>\n\t<li>Congenital malformation:&nbsp; Some individuals are born with an abnormally large esophageal hiatus.</li>\n\t<li>Surgery or trauma:&nbsp; Injuries to the esophageal hiatus can disrupt the muscle/membrane integrity and predispose to herniation; this is more often associated with paraesophageal hernias.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Although symptoms can overlap, the clinical presentation typically varies based on the type of hiatal hernia.</p>\n<h2>Sliding hiatal hernia</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Often asymptomatic (most are discovered incidentally on imaging for other conditions)</li>\n\t<li>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Heartburn:&nbsp; often worse after meals or when lying down</li>\n\t\t<li>Regurgitation:&nbsp; backflow of stomach contents into the esophagus</li>\n\t\t<li>Dysphagia</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Paraesophageal hiatal hernia</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Epigastric or substernal chest pain (can mimic angina)</li>\n\t<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>\n\t<li>Belching and bloating</li>\n\t<li>Postprandial fullness</li>\n\t<li>Shortness of breath:&nbsp; large hernia may compress the lungs</li>\n\t<li>Gastrointestinal bleeding:&nbsp; inflammation or ulceration within the herniated pouch</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Paraesophageal hernias have an increased risk of complications compared to sliding hiatal hernias.&nbsp; This is because in paraesophageal hernias, the gastroesophageal junction remains fixed below the diaphragm and the stomach often rotates as it moves up through the diaphragmatic defect.&nbsp; This increases the risk of gastric volvulus, incarceration/strangulation, and perforation.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Hiatal hernias, particularly asymptomatic sliding hernias, are often identified incidentally on imaging (eg, chest x-ray) performed for other conditions.&nbsp; However, when a patient presents with risk factors (eg, obesity, previous gastric surgery) and signs and symptoms suggestive of a hiatal hernia (eg, chronic GERD, postprandial fullness), a barium swallow study or upper endoscopy can confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Angina pectoris</strong> (chest pain from myocardial ischemia):&nbsp; in contrast to hiatal hernia pain, angina is often exacerbated by exertion (rather than eating) and relieved by rest.&nbsp; Angina pain also commonly radiates to the left arm or jaw, and patients typically have cardiac risk factors (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Esophageal stricture</strong>:&nbsp; esophageal narrowing, which may be due to chronic acid reflux or previous esophagitis, can cause regurgitation, heartburn, chest pressure, and solid food dysphagia that progressively worsen over time.&nbsp; Symptoms may be difficult to differentiate from hiatal hernia, but strictures can be identified on barium swallow study or endoscopy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Esophageal malignancy</strong>:&nbsp; presents with dysphagia and chest discomfort but often leads to weight loss, anemia, and a rapid deterioration in health.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Achalasia</strong>:&nbsp; an esophageal motility disorder in which the lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax properly, causing dysphagia, heartburn, and chest discomfort.&nbsp; Regurgitation of undigested food is typical.&nbsp; Achalasia is diagnosed by esophageal manometry.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Zenker diverticulum</strong>:&nbsp; an outpouching of the mucosa in the upper esophagus.&nbsp; Although this condition causes oropharyngeal dysphagia and regurgitation, it is typically associated with halitosis and gurgling in the throat.&nbsp; Barium swallow study can differentiate Zenker diverticulum from hiatal hernia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory tests are not required to diagnose a hiatal hernia but may be performed to rule out other conditions or assess for complications:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Stool occult blood test:&nbsp; used to detect hidden blood in the stool from potential gastrointestinal bleeding</li>\n\t<li>Complete blood count:&nbsp; checks for anemia due to occult gastrointestinal bleeding</li>\n\t<li>Lipase level:&nbsp; assesses for pancreatitis, which can cause nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain</li>\n\t<li>Cardiac enzymes/ECG:&nbsp; if the patient has risk factors for cardiac disease</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Imaging</h1><br><br><p>Many hiatal hernias are first recognized on x-rays performed for other conditions.&nbsp; X-ray findings of a hiatal herniatypically include a retrocardiac opacity, often with an air/fluid level (more commonly seen with paraesophageal hernias) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Although asymptomatic patients do not necessarily need further workup, those with symptoms should have the diagnosis confirmed by one of the following studies:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Barium swallow study</strong>:&nbsp; most sensitive imaging study.&nbsp;<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>An outpouching of contrast at the distal esophagus with migration of the gastroesophageal junction and proximal stomach (eg, rugal folds) above the diaphragm suggests a sliding hiatal hernia.</li>\n\t\t<li>A bulge of herniated stomach above the diaphragm and alongside the thoracic esophagus, with the gastroesophageal junction below the diaphragm, suggests a paraesophageal hiatal hernia.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Upper endoscopy</strong>:&nbsp; directly visualizes the location of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach to identify herniation; can simultaneously rule out alternative diagnoses such as esophageal strictures and tumors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management strategies depend on the type and severity of the hiatal hernia.</p>\n<h2>Sliding hiatal hernias</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Asymptomatic:&nbsp; no intervention necessary</li>\n\t<li>Symptomatic:&nbsp; manage GERD symptoms\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Lifestyle modifications:&nbsp; lose weight, avoid large meals and aggravating foods (eg, spicy), elevate the head of the bed</li>\n\t\t<li>Medications:&nbsp; antacids, H2 receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors</li>\n\t\t<li>Surgical treatment (for refractory GERD symptoms):&nbsp; Nissen fundoplication (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84686.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), in which the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophagus to strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Paraesophageal hiatal hernias</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Asymptomatic:&nbsp; may be considered for prophylactic surgical repair (particularly in young healthy patients) but are often closely observed</li>\n\t<li>Symptomatic:&nbsp; surgical repair\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Emergent repair is needed for volvulus, strangulated/incarcerated hernia, respiratory compromise, perforation, and gastrointestinal bleeding.</li>\n\t\t<li>Elective repair is performed for bothersome or progressive symptoms, including postprandial fullness, dysphagia, nausea and vomiting, and epigastric or chest pain.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for most patients with hiatal hernia is typically good with appropriate management.&nbsp; Sliding hiatal hernias often respond well to lifestyle changes and medication to minimize reflux.&nbsp; Paraesophageal hiatal hernias have a higher risk for serious complications, but careful monitoring and emergent intervention when required can prevent serious outcomes.</p>\n<h1>Summary </h1><br><br><p>Hiatal hernias occur when contents of the abdominal cavity herniate through the diaphragm at the esophageal hiatus into the thoracic cavity.&nbsp; Sliding hiatal hernias occur due to laxity of the phrenoesophageal membrane, leading to herniation of the gastroesophageal junction and proximal stomach, whereas paraesophageal hernias occur due to defects in the membrane, resulting in gastric fundus herniation.&nbsp; Asymptomatic sliding hiatal hernias do not require intervention, but patients with reflux should be medically managed.&nbsp; Paraesophageal hiatal hernias are less common but more serious due to the risk of volvulus, incarceration, and strangulation; symptomatic patients typically require surgical repair.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
