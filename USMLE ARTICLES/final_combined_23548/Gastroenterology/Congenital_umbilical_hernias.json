Umbilical hernias often resolve spontaneously, but surgical repair may be required to prevent complications.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The umbilical ring is an opening in the abdominal fascia that allows the umbilical vessels to pass.&nbsp; All neonates are born with an open umbilical ring, and the umbilical ring normally closes as the rectus abdominis muscles grow together soon after birth.&nbsp; The fascial layers fuse to form the linea alba, or a midline band of fibrous tissues.&nbsp; Incomplete closure of the umbilical ring allows intraabdominal contents (eg, bowel) to herniate through the abdominal musculature, resulting in a congenital umbilical hernia.</p><br><br><p>Umbilical hernias may also be acquired due to increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, ascites, chronic cough, constipation) or weakening of the abdominal fascia (eg, previous abdominal surgeries).</p><br><br><p>This article focuses on congenital umbilical hernias.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The primary risk factor for congenital umbilical hernias is premature birth, likely related to weak abdominal musculature.&nbsp; Congenital umbilical hernias most commonly occur in isolation but can be associated with many conditions, including trisomy 21, trisomy 18, congenital hypothyroidism, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and certain mucopolysaccharidoses.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>A congenital umbilical hernia presents as a soft, bulging mass at the umbilicus that is covered by skin.&nbsp; The mass becomes more prominent with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, crying, straining).&nbsp; In most cases, the umbilical hernia can be easily reduced (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/21877.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ), and the edges of the umbilical ring can be palpated through the skin.&nbsp;

During midgut development, abdominal contents undergo rapid growth and subsequent physiologic herniation, followed by physiologic reduction.&nbsp; Failed reduction results in the formation of an omphalocele, or a midline sac that contains intraabdominal contents covered by peritoneum (ie, no skin, fascia, or muscle) with the umbilical cord at the apex.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gastroschisis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21940.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

Further evaluation (eg, imaging) is not necessary in otherwise asymptomatic patients with reducible hernias.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of asymptomatic congenital umbilical hernias involves reassurance and observation, with spontaneous resolution often occurring by age 3-5.&nbsp;

Complications are rare and include incarceration (contents unable to be reduced) and strangulation (ie, compromised vascular supply to incarcerated contents).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>An umbilical hernia is a protrusion of intraabdominal contents (eg, omentum, small intestine) through an open umbilical ring.&nbsp;
