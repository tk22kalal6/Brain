This article focuses on some of the major intestinal infections, including hookworm, roundworm, tapeworm, and whipworm.&nbsp; These helminths carry a heavy disease burden and are responsible for significant morbidity, often presenting with gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms.&nbsp; Anthelminthic therapy is typically curative, and public health measures help reduce the prevalence of these infections, particularly in endemic areas.<p></p><h1>Hookworm</h1><h2>Species</h2><p><em>Ancylostoma duodenale</em> and <em>Necator americanus</em> are the main species that infect humans.</p><h2>Epidemiology and transmission</h2><p>Hookworm is common in tropical and subtropical regions.&nbsp; Infection occurs through direct skin contact (eg, walking barefoot) with soil contaminated by human feces.&nbsp; Eggs in feces hatch to produce rhabditiform then filariform (infective) larvae.&nbsp; Once in contact with skin, these filariform larvae penetrate and enter the bloodstream, migrating to the lungs; within 2-3 weeks they travel to the pharynx and are swallowed, reaching the small intestine where they mature into adult works that attach to the mucosa and lacerate capillaries to ingest the extravasated blood (resulting in blood loss and iron deficiency anemia).&nbsp; Eggs are eventually released with feces (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L39076.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><h2>Clinical presentation</h2><p>Symptoms generally arise as a result of skin penetration and/or intestinal colonization:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Ground itch:</strong>&nbsp; A pruritic, erythematous rash occurs at the site of skin penetration, usually on the feet.</li><li><strong>Pulmonary phase:</strong>&nbsp; Transient cough, wheezing, and <strong>eosinophilia</strong> can develop during the larvae's migration to the lungs.</li><li>Intestinal phase:&nbsp; Symptoms may include abdominal pain, anorexia, and diarrhea.&nbsp; Chronic infection can lead to <strong>iron deficiency anemia</strong> due to blood loss, especially in children and pregnant individuals who are more susceptible to complications.</li></ul><h2>Diagnosis</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Stool examination for hookworm eggs with specimens is obtained on 3 separate days because shedding of parasites is intermittent (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13516.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li>Complete blood count (CBC) may reveal microcytic anemia and eosinophilia.</li></ul><h2>Management</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Anthelmintic therapy with albendazole (single dose) is first-line therapy.&nbsp; Other effective regimens include mebendazole and pyrantel pamoate.</li><li>Iron supplementation and nutritional support may be necessary.</li></ul><h1>Roundworm</h1><h2>Species</h2><p><em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em> is the largest human parasitic roundworm.</p><h2>Epidemiology and transmission</h2><p><em>A lumbricoides</em> is a common parasite found in Asia, Africa, and South America.&nbsp; Transmission occurs when eggs are ingested via contaminated food or water.&nbsp; The eggs hatch into larvae in the small intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall, and migrate to the alveoli.&nbsp; After several days, larvae are coughed out of the alveoli and subsequently swallowed into the gastrointestinal tract, where they mature into long (25- to 35-cm) adult worms that shed up to 200,000 eggs per day (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L56433.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><h2>Clinical presentation</h2><p>Most infections are asymptomatic, but when symptomatic, the presentation follows a 2-phase pattern:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Pulmonary phase (<strong>Löffler syndrome</strong>):&nbsp; A transient, eosinophilic pneumonitis with pulmonary symptoms (eg, dry cough, dyspnea, wheezing) occurs when larvae are in the lungs.</li><li>Intestinal phase:&nbsp; Gastrointestinal symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally <strong>obstruction</strong> if worm burden is high (particularly in children).</li></ul><p>Hepatobiliary or pancreatic migration may occur because worms may migrate into the bile ducts or pancreas, causing cholangitis or pancreatitis.&nbsp; Children are at higher risk for severe <strong>complications</strong> (eg, malnutrition, cognitive impairment).</p><h2>Diagnosis</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Stool microscopy reveals an oval egg with a thick outer shell and a single interior ovum (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13493.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li>CBC may demonstrate eosinophilia, especially during the pulmonary phase.</li></ul><h2>Management</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Anthelmintic therapy options include albendazole or mebendazole, among others.</li><li>Surgical intervention may be required (eg, for obstruction).</li><li>Mass treatment programs to reduce worm burden are effective in endemic areas.</li></ul><h1>Tapeworm</h1><h2>Species</h2><p>Common tapeworms include <em>Taenia saginata</em> (beef tapeworm), <em>T solium</em> (pork tapeworm), and <em>Diphyllobothrium latum</em> (fish tapeworm).</p><h2>Epidemiology and transmission</h2><p>Tapeworms are generally acquired by consuming <strong>undercooked or raw meat</strong> (<em>Taenia</em>) or <strong>fish</strong> (<em>Diphyllobothrium</em>) contaminated with larval cysts.&nbsp; The lifecycle may be complex, sometimes involving intermediate and definite hosts.</p><h2>Clinical presentation</h2><p>Most infections are asymptomatic; however, different tapeworms are associated with different disease presentations:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Taeniasis:</strong>&nbsp; Symptomatic patients may have mild abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, or nausea.</li><li><strong>Neurocysticercosis</strong> (with <em>T solium</em>):&nbsp; Seizures and focal neurologic deficits are due to larval cysts in the brain.</li><li><strong>Diphyllobothriasis:</strong>&nbsp; Because of <em>Diphyllobothrium</em>'s affinity for vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font>, diphyllobothriasis is associated with <strong>vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> deficiency</strong>, which can lead to megaloblastic anemia.</li></ul><p><em>T solium</em> and cysticercosis are discussed in more detail in a separate article.</p><h2>Diagnosis</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Stool examination can reveal tapeworm eggs or proglottids.</li><li>Neuroimaging is used in cases of suspected neurocysticercosis to visualize brain cysts, along with serologic testing for cysticercosis.</li><li>Megaloblastic anemia and vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> deficiency can be seen with <em>Diphyllobothrium</em> infection.</li></ul><h2>Management</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Anthelmintics:&nbsp;

Ingestion of embryonated eggs from contaminated soil leads to infection.&nbsp; Eggs hatch in the small intestine, and larvae migrate to the colon, where they mature and embed in the colonic mucosa (particularly the cecum and ascending colon).</p><h2>Clinical presentation</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Mild infection is often asymptomatic.</li><li>Heavy infection causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, and <strong>rectal prolapse</strong>, particularly in children.&nbsp; Chronic infection may lead to growth delay, cognitive impairment, and anemia.&nbsp; Chronic <strong>dysentery</strong> can mimic inflammatory bowel disease.</li></ul><h2>Diagnosis</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Stool examination reveals characteristic barrel-shaped eggs with a hyaline plug at each end (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L13535.jpg\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li><li>CBC may demonstrate eosinophilia and, in severe cases, anemia.</li></ul><h2>Management</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Anthelmintics:&nbsp; Albendazole or mebendazole is effective.</li><li>Supportive therapy may be required for hydration and nutritional rehabilitation in severe cases.</li><li>Mass treatment is used in endemic areas.</li></ul><h1>Eosinophilia</h1><p>The likelihood of eosinophilia varies based on the species and stage of infection:</p><h2>Hookworm</h2><p>Hookworm infections often lead to eosinophilia, particularly during the larval migration phase through the lungs, although its extent may decrease as the infection becomes more chronic.</p><h2>Roundworm (<em>A lumbricoides</em>)</h2><p>Eosinophilia is typically present during the pulmonary migration phase (Löffler syndrome) but may not be as prominent in the intestinal phase.</p><h2>Tapeworm (<em>Taenia</em> spp, <em>Diphyllobothrium</em>)</h2><p>Unlike other helminths, tapeworm infections generally do not cause significant eosinophilia.&nbsp; Eosinophilia is uncommon with <em>T saginata</em> (beef tapeworm) and <em>D latum</em> (fish tapeworm).&nbsp; With <em>T solium</em>, eosinophilia may occur with cysticercosis (but not with simple intestinal infection).</p><h2>Whipworm (<em>T trichiura</em>)</h2><p>Eosinophilia can be present but is often mild or absent, especially in uncomplicated cases localized to the intestines.&nbsp; Heavy infections (eg, colitis, dysentery) may show minimal eosinophilia compared to other helminths with systemic tissue migration phases.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>This table summarizes some of the major intestinal helminthic infections (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/119843.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p></div>\n            "
