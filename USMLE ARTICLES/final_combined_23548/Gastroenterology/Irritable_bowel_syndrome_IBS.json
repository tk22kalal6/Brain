Contributing factors include interactions between visceral hypersensitivity, altered gut motility, abnormal intestinal microbiota, immune dysregulation, and psychosocial factors.&nbsp; These mechanisms contribute to the various presentations seen in patients with IBS.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors </h1><br><br><p>Several risk factors are associated with the development of IBS, including anxiety/depression, certain dietary patterns, and female sex.&nbsp; IBS can also develop following acute gastroenteritis (ie, postinfectious IBS).</p>\n<h1>Pathology </h1><br><br><p>IBS is considered a functional disorder, implying the absence of structural, biochemical, or histologic abnormalities detectable by conventional diagnostic tests.&nbsp; However, microscopic inflammation, alterations in gut microbiota composition, and abnormal immune activation have been reported in subsets of IBS patients.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation and diagnosis </h1><h2>Diagnostic criteria</h2><br><br><p>The diagnostic criteria for IBS includes recurrent abdominal pain/discomfort (present ≥1 day per week for the past ≥3 months) accompanied by any 2 of the following (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/49427.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Change in stool frequency</li>\n\t<li>Change in stool appearance (eg, shape, texture, presence of mucus)</li>\n\t<li>Symptomatic improvement or worsening of abdominal pain with defecation</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition, there should be an absence of alarm features on history and no abnormalities on basic laboratory evaluation that would suggest an organic disease.&nbsp; These include weight loss, nocturnal/fasting diarrhea (suggestive of secretory diarrhea), bloody stools, age &gt;50, family history of colon cancer, worsening abdominal pain, and laboratory abnormalities such as iron deficiency anemia.</p>\n<h2>Subtypes: IBS-D, IBS-C, IBS-M</h2><br><br><p>IBS is classified into subtypes based on predominant stool pattern, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D)</strong>:&nbsp; Patients predominantly experience frequent, loose or watery stools in small quantities, often accompanied by urgency and a sense of incomplete evacuation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Constipation-predominant (IBS-C)</strong>:&nbsp; Patients predominantly present with infrequent bowel movements, hard stools, and straining with defecation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mixed (IBS-M)</strong>:&nbsp; Patients exhibit alternating symptoms of diarrhea and constipation, with variable stool consistency.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition to gastrointestinal symptoms, individuals with IBS may report abdominal bloating and distension, often aggravated by dietary factors or stress, as well as extraintestinal symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.</p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation </h1><br><br><p>In addition to an assessment for alarm features by history, a basic laboratory evaluation to exclude organic disease is also recommended before IBS is diagnosed (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L94356.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>For IBS-C</strong>, a complete blood count is recommended to exclude iron deficiency anemia; when present, a colonoscopy (to exclude colon cancer) is recommended.</li>\n\t<li><strong>For IBS-D</strong>, a complete blood count, stool cultures (to exclude infectious diarrhea), celiac serology, and stool/serum inflammatory markers (to exclude inflammatory bowel disease) are recommended.&nbsp; Next steps in evaluation are guided by abnormal test results (eg, colonoscopy if inflammatory markers are elevated).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The diagnosis of IBS can be made without a colonoscopy if there are no alarm features on history, and basic laboratory evaluation does not demonstrate abnormalities.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis </h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease</strong> (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis):&nbsp; presents with abdominal pain and diarrhea, often accompanied by alarm features (eg, bloody diarrhea) and laboratory abnormalities (eg, elevated fecal calprotectin, iron deficiency anemia).&nbsp; A colonoscopy with biopsy is required for diagnosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Celiac disease</strong>:&nbsp; autoimmune disease characterized by gluten intolerance, positive antitissue transglutaminase antibodies, and small intestinal villous atrophy, resulting in malabsorption-related symptoms (eg, weight loss, steatorrhea, nutritional deficiencies [eg, iron, calcium, vitamin B, vitamin D]).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Functional dyspepsia</strong>:&nbsp; Dyspeptic symptoms (eg, early satiety, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain) may be present in patients with IBS; however, functional dyspepsia lacks the characteristic changes in bowel habits seen in IBS.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Colorectal cancer</strong>:&nbsp; may also present with chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits.&nbsp; However, alarm features (eg, weight loss, rectal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, age &gt;50, family history of colon cancer) are often present and warrant a diagnostic colonoscopy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ovarian cancer</strong>:&nbsp; typically affects older women (age &gt;55) and presents with abdominal discomfort and bloating, early satiety, fatigue, weight loss, and sometimes constipation (due to tumor compression on the colon).&nbsp; Pelvic ultrasonography or a CT scan of the abdomen should be obtained when the diagnosis is suspected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Medication side effect</strong>:&nbsp; Medications can cause diarrhea (eg, colchicine, metformin) or constipation (eg, iron, antihistamines, opioid analgesics) with or without associated abdominal discomfort.&nbsp; Stopping the culprit medication with resolution of symptoms is diagnostic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of all patients with IBS includes lifestyle modifications (eg, consistent meal timings, increased physical activity, adequate sleep) and dietary changes (eg, avoiding alcohol and gas-producing foods, including insoluble fiber [eg, bran]).</p><br><br><p>However, adjunctive pharmacotherapy is often needed for patients with persistent or bothersome symptoms (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/94341.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Persistent abdominal pain</h2><br><br><p>For persistent abdominal pain, first-line treatment is antispasmodic therapy with <strong>hyoscyamine</strong>, a muscarinic antagonist that relaxes gastrointestinal smooth muscles (and thereby reduces cramping).&nbsp; Second-line treatment is tricyclic antidepressant therapy (TCA) (eg, amitriptyline, nortriptyline).&nbsp; TCAs have analgesic properties and are useful for both neuropathic and IBS-related pain.&nbsp; Furthermore, due to their anticholinergic effects (eg, slowing intestinal transit time), they may alleviate symptoms of IBS-D but may exacerbate symptoms of IBS-C.</p>\n<h2>Intractable diarrhea</h2><br><br><p>For management of intractable diarrhea, <strong>soluble fiber</strong> (eg, psyllium) and <strong>loperamide</strong> are first-line treatments.&nbsp; Soluble fiber increases stool caliber and bulks the stool.&nbsp; Loperamide is an agonist of gastrointestinal mu-opioid receptors on gastrointestinal secretomotor neurons (ie, myenteric plexus, submucosal plexus).&nbsp; The drug decreases peristalsis and lengthens intestinal transit time, reducing urgency as well as intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretions.&nbsp; Second-line therapy includes bile acid sequestrants (eg, cholestyramine) and serotonin-3 receptor antagonists (eg, alosetron).</p>\n<h2>Constipation</h2><br><br><p>For management of constipation, <strong>soluble fiber</strong> (eg, psyllium) and <strong>osmotic laxatives</strong> (eg, polyethylene glycol) are first-line treatments.&nbsp; Refractory cases can be treated with lubiprostone, guanylate cyclase agonists (eg, linaclotide), and sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 inhibitors (eg, tenapanor).</p>\n<h2>Other</h2><br><br><p>Comorbid psychiatric conditions (eg, anxiety, depression) should be managed with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy).</p>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>IBS does not increase the risk for colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or other organic colonic diseases and is not associated with serious complications.&nbsp; However, it may adversely impact quality of life, leading to psychologic distress.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>IBS is a life-long condition that has fluctuating symptoms; however, with lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy, symptoms can be adequately controlled.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>IBS is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain accompanied by changes in stool frequency and/or appearance.&nbsp; While the exact pathophysiology is uncertain, visceral hypersensitivity, altered gut motility, and psychosocial factors likely contribute to the condition.&nbsp; The diagnosis is based on symptoms and an absence of alarm features suggestive of organic disease (ie, no concerning features on history, normal basic laboratory evaluation).&nbsp; Management focuses on symptom control with lifestyle changes (eg, stress management, regular exercise, avoidance of gas-producing foods) and pharmacotherapy (eg, antispasmodic therapy for abdominal pain, soluble fiber for diarrhea and constipation).</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
