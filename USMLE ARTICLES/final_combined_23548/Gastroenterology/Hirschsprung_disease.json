The affected segment is therefore unable to relax, causing a functional obstruction.<p></p><h1>Pathophysiology</h1><p>During embryonic development, neural crest cells normally enter the developing foregut and then migrate in a craniocaudal direction along the entire length of the bowel (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L80758.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The neural crest cells normally give rise to ganglion cells of the submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) plexus in the colon.&nbsp; They are present in the wall of the proximal colon by the 8th week of gestation and in the rectum by the 12th week.<p></p><p>However, in patients with HD, neural crest cells do <u>not</u> complete the migration process, instead failing to reach the rectum.&nbsp; Without parasympathetic innervation, the colonic segment lacking ganglion cells is unable to relax, becoming chronically contracted and narrowed (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L111727.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The passage of gas and stool through this area becomes difficult, and compensatory dilation of the proximal colon occurs (ie, <strong>congenital aganglionic megacolon</strong>).<p></p><h1>Risk factors</h1><p>HD often occurs sporadically but can have a familial predisposition, suggesting a genetic component.&nbsp; Approximately 10% of patients with HD have a chromosomal defect, and there is a particularly strong association with <strong>trisomy 21</strong> (Down syndrome).&nbsp; Males are also affected 3-4 times more than females.</p><h1>Clinical presentation</h1><p>The clinical presentation of HD depends on the length of the nonfunctional bowel (eg, longer segments are more severe and present sooner).</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Neonatal period</strong>:&nbsp; Most patients with HD present in the neonatal period, often with <strong>failure to pass meconium</strong> within 48 hours of birth.&nbsp; They may also develop signs of intestinal obstruction (eg, bilious vomiting, abdominal distension).&nbsp; The bowel contains stool, however, because the rectum cannot relax, stool cannot enter the rectum.&nbsp; Therefore, rectal examination shows increased tone and can produce a forceful expulsion of gas and stool (\"<strong>squirt sign</strong>\") from temporary relief from the obstruction.</li><li><strong>Older infants or children</strong>:&nbsp; Patients with a short aganglionic segment may go undiagnosed for years due to milder disease.&nbsp; These patients may have <strong>chronic, refractory constipation</strong> that can lead to poor growth or failure to thrive.&nbsp; Additional findings include abdominal distension and thin caliber stools.&nbsp; Blood with bowel movements may occur due to the development of hemorrhoids (from straining) or anal fissures (from hard stools).</li></ul><h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><p>The differential diagnosis of HD includes the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Neonatal period</strong><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Delayed passage of meconium</strong>:&nbsp; In a neonate with delayed passage of meconium (ie, not passing stool within the first 48 hours of life), other conditions (eg, anorectal malformations, meconium ileus) should also be considered.&nbsp; In contrast to HD, rectal examination in these conditions would not relieve stool impaction.</li><li><strong>Intestinal obstruction</strong>:&nbsp; In patients exhibiting signs of intestinal obstruction (eg, bilious emesis after feeding, abdominal distension), other gastrointestinal malformations (eg, duodenal atresia, intestinal malrotation with volvulus should be considered (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29144.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; However, rectal examination would not produce forceful expulsion of gas.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Older infants or children</strong><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Chronic constipation</strong>:&nbsp; In older children presenting with chronic constipation, other causes (eg, functional constipation, hypothyroidism) should be considered.&nbsp; However, these conditions would not have a history of thin caliber stools or increased rectal tone on examination.</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><p>HD should be suspected based on characteristic history and examination findings (eg, delayed meconium passage, digital rectal examination showing an empty rectum with increased anal sphincter tone), particularly in patients with trisomy 21 or a family history of HD.&nbsp; Work-up may include the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Contrast enema</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12580.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; This can support the diagnosis of HD by showing a transition zone between the relatively narrowed aganglionic segment (due to chronic contraction) and the dilated colon proximal to the obstruction (megacolon), which contains normal innervation.&nbsp; A contrast enema can also help with surgical planning to help determine the length of the aganglionic segment.&nbsp; However, a normal contrast enema cannot exclude HD because the colon may look relatively normal if long segments of the colon are involved.</li><li><strong>Anorectal manometry</strong>:&nbsp; This measures pressure in the rectum and anal sphincter and is often used to screen for HD (ie, a normal relaxation of the internal anal sphincter following rectal distension excludes HD); however, it is less accurate in infants age ≤1 month and lacks the sensitivity of suction biopsy.</li><li><strong>Rectal suction biopsy</strong>:&nbsp; The gold standard for the diagnosis of HD.&nbsp; Samples should include the submucosa of the rectum (ie, narrowed segment), which is the most superficial layer that demonstrates the absence of ganglion cells (ie, submucosal plexus).</li></ul><p>Plain radiographs are not generally helpful for excluding HD but may be obtained as the initial work-up in a patient presenting with intestinal obstruction (eg, abdominal distension, vomiting).&nbsp; Radiographic findings suggesting HD may include dilated bowel loops with absent gas in the rectum (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12245.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><h1>Management</h1><p>Definitive treatment of HD involves <strong>surgical resection</strong> of the aganglionic bowel segment and anastomosis of the normal bowel with the anus.&nbsp; Follow-up is necessary to monitor for complications such as bowel obstruction, Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis, and functional issues related to bowel motility.</p><p>In addition, because up to 25% of patients with HD also have another congenital anomaly (eg, renal anomalies, hearing impairment), additional screening (eg, renal ultrasonography, hearing screening) should be also considered.</p><h1>Complications</h1><p>Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is a severe and potentially lethal complication of undiagnosed HD.&nbsp; HAEC likely stems from fecal stasis, leading to bacterial overgrowth and translocation through the intestinal mucosa.&nbsp; This can lead to pneumatosis intestinalis, intestinal perforation, and septic shock.&nbsp; Patients may present with abdominal distension, fever, vomiting, and explosive, malodorous diarrhea.</p><h1>Prognosis</h1><p>Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications such as HAEC and to optimize long-term bowel function and quality of life.&nbsp; Long-term improvements in quality of life are achieved in most patients, although some have lifelong continence issues.&nbsp; The risk of complications is greatest amongst those with longer segments of colonic aganglionosis and those with underlying conditions (eg, trisomy 21).</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Hirschsprung disease (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/33644.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (also called congenital aganglionic megacolon) is a disorder in which a segment of the distal colon lacks parasympathetic ganglion cells due to failed neural crest cell migration during intestinal development.&nbsp; The affected segment is therefore unable to relax, resulting in intestinal obstruction.&nbsp; A rectal suction biopsy can confirm the diagnosis, and treatment involves surgical resection of the aganglionic region.<p></p></div>\n            "
