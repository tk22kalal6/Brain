Management is guided by identifying the cause, particularly if there are any alarm features (eg, weight loss, blood in stools, family history of colorectal cancer) to suggest a serious diagnosis (eg, colorectal cancer).&nbsp; Whereas most forms of constipation do not cause serious complications (eg, intestinal perforation), sequelae that further contribute to patient discomfort (eg, hemorrhoids, anal fissures) are relatively common.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Normal defecation relies on appropriate colonic transit (peristalsis) coupled with effective evacuation of stool at the rectum.&nbsp; Stool reaches the rectum, resulting in distension.&nbsp; In response, the external anal sphincter relaxes, whereas the muscles of the abdomen and rectum contract to evacuate stool.&nbsp; If any of the components of normal defecation are altered, constipation can occur.</p><br><br><p>There are 2 major types of constipation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/80964.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; primary and secondary.<p></p>\n<h2>Primary constipation</h2><br><br><p>Primary constipation is characterized by the absence of an underlying organic or anatomic etiology and includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Normal-transit (functional) constipation</strong>:&nbsp; Normal colonic motility but perceived difficulty with evacuation (eg, straining, sensation of incomplete emptying).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Slow-transit constipation</strong>:&nbsp; Markedly delayed movement of stool through the colon, resulting in excessive water and electrolyte reabsorption from fecal material, making stools more difficult to pass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Dyssynergic defecation</strong>:&nbsp; Impaired coordination of the external anal sphincter, pelvic floor, and/or abdominal muscles during defecation, resulting in difficulty passing stools from the anal canal.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Risk factors for primary constipation include dietary (low-fiber diet, inadequate hydration), lifestyle (inactive/sedentary), and social (psychosocial stress) factors.</p>\n<h2>Secondary constipation</h2><br><br><p>Secondary constipation is caused by an identifiable organic or anatomic cause, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pharmacologic factors</strong>:&nbsp; Opioids, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, iron supplements.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neurologic disorders</strong>:&nbsp; Multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Hirschsprung disease, spina bifida, Parkinson disease.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Metabolic disorders</strong>:&nbsp; Hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, diabetes mellitus.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Structural abnormalities</strong>:&nbsp; Colorectal cancer/mass, stricture (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemia, postsurgical status), rectocele, ovarian cancer (mass effect on colon).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients typically report infrequent stools, straining, hard stools, or a sensation of incomplete evacuation.&nbsp; Abdominal bloating, discomfort, and anorectal pain may also occur.&nbsp; The Bristol stool form scale (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108734.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) can assist patients in characterizing their bowel movements.&nbsp; A careful medication use history should also be obtained to identify potential culprit medications.<p></p><br><br><p>Physical examination of the abdomen is typically unremarkable, although care should be taken to evaluate for palpable abdominal masses.&nbsp;

A digital rectal examination should be performed to assess for masses, stool impaction, occult blood, internal hemorrhoids, and abnormal rectal sphincter tone.<p></p>\n<h2>Alarm features</h2><br><br><p>Alarm features that warrant further evaluation (eg, colonoscopy) to rule out a serious diagnosis (eg, cancer) include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Blood in stools (eg, hematochezia, positive fecal occult blood testing).</li>\n\t<li>Iron deficiency anemia.</li>\n\t<li>Unintentional weight loss ≥4.5 kg (10 lb).</li>\n\t<li>Family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease.</li>\n\t<li>Rectal pain or tenesmus.</li>\n\t<li>Recent onset without obvious cause.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Evaluation and diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis is typically clinical and based on a thorough history and physical examination, with particular attention to the presence of alarm features.&nbsp; Colonoscopy is indicated in patients with these concerning features or those age ≥45 who have not yet had age-appropriate colorectal cancer screening.&nbsp; Furthermore, patients with severe constipation or symptoms refractory to typical treatment measures should undergo direct visualization by colonoscopy.</p><br><br><p>For patients who do not meet criteria for colonoscopy, the Rome IV criteria may be used to make the diagnosis of functional constipation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/126884.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (with additional sets of Rome IV criteria specific for pediatric populations).<p></p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Laboratory testing should be obtained to identify potential organic causes of constipation.&nbsp; These tests include a complete blood count to identify possible microcytic anemia, basic metabolic panel to identify hypercalcemia and diabetes mellitus, and TSH level to identify hypothyroidism.</p>\n<h2>Imaging evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Imaging and more specialized testing are typically used only when symptoms are refractory to initial management.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Abdominal radiography</strong>:&nbsp; Not typically necessary but if obtained, radiography can identify stool retained in the colon (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59353.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Plain abdominal radiographs sometimes help identify other, more urgent causes of constipation (eg, small bowel obstruction, volvulus); however, abdominal CT scan is often preferred over plain radiographs.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Colonic transit studies</strong>:&nbsp; Ingested radioopaque markers are monitored with serial radiographs as they travel through the colon to determine whether transit is abnormally slow.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other tests of dyssynergy</strong> include anorectal manometry (catheter inserted in rectum to assess rectal motility and pressures), balloon expulsion testing (balloon filled with water inserted into the rectum, with manometry performed), and defecography (barium contrast administered rectally, with fluoroscopic imaging used when bearing down).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Depending on the clinical picture and progression, additional testing (eg, pelvic ultrasonography to exclude ovarian cancer in a postmenopausal woman with acute-onset constipation, pain, and an unrevealing colonoscopy) may be indicated.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Primary constipation must be differentiated from several other conditions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C)</strong>:&nbsp; Like functional constipation, IBS-C features chronic constipation symptoms, but it is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain related to defecation or changes in stool frequency/form (with a different set of Rome criteria than for functional constipation).&nbsp; Pain is not typically expected in patients with normal-transit (functional) constipation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Colorectal cancer</strong>:&nbsp; The initial presenting symptom may be constipation due to obstructive masses, particularly with decreased-caliber (ribbon) stools.&nbsp; The presence of additional alarm features is more suggestive of a malignant cause of constipation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27258.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Colonoscopy with biopsy makes the definitive diagnosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Small bowel obstruction</strong>:&nbsp; The onset of symptoms in small bowel obstruction is typically more acute than with primary constipation.&nbsp; Patients often have refractory vomiting, obstipation, and abdominal distension with hyperactive bowel sounds on examination.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Volvulus</strong>:&nbsp; Sigmoid and cecal volvulus both occur more frequently in patients with chronic constipation.&nbsp; Severe abdominal pain can help differentiate chronic constipation and volvulus.&nbsp; Abdominal radiographs or CT scans can be used to distinguish chronic constipation from sigmoid volvulus (dilated colon appearing as an inverted U-shape (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L111698.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )) or cecal volvulus (large, dilated, closed colonic loop with a coffee-bean appearance (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59505.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>In the absence of alarm features or concern for other organic causes, patients with constipation should undergo initial nonpharmacologic management with lifestyle modifications (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16380.png\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increased dietary fiber intake (20-35 g/day).</li>\n\t<li>Hydration with &gt;1.5 L/day of water.</li>\n\t<li>Regular aerobic physical activity.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>If symptoms do not improve, pharmacologic therapy should be tailored to the particular type/suspected etiology of constipation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/57637.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Bulk-forming agents</strong> (psyllium, methylcellulose):&nbsp;
