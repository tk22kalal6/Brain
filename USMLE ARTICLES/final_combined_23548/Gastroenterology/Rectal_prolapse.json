It can cause rectal discomfort, defecatory dysfunction, and rectal bleeding and may have a significant impact on quality of life.&nbsp; Rectal prolapse varies in severity and is classified as partial (prolapse of only the mucosal layer) or complete (prolapse of all layers of the rectum) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84395.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The rectum courses from the rectosigmoid junction to the dentate line, where it transitions to the anal canal at the level of the levator ani.&nbsp; It is composed of the mucosa (including the epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosa), submucosa, muscularis propria (with an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer), and serosa.&nbsp; The internal anal sphincter (smooth circular muscle) and external anal sphincter (longitudinal striated muscle) maintain continence of liquid, gas, and solid contents of the rectum.</p><br><br><p>The rectum is supported by the pelvic floor muscles (eg, levator ani (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L30355.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), coccygeus), which also contribute to continence.&nbsp; Rectal prolapse results from the weakening of these muscles, the anal sphincter, and the connective tissue that supports the rectum.&nbsp; Contributing factors can include a redundant sigmoid colon (adequate length to allow prolapse), reduced anal sphincter tone, and diastasis of the levator ani muscles.<p></p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Advanced age.</li>\n\t<li>Female sex (due to childbirth and pelvic floor trauma).</li>\n\t<li>Chronic constipation or straining.</li>\n\t<li>Previous pelvic or anorectal surgery.</li>\n\t<li>Pelvic organ prolapse (POP).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Rectal discomfort or pressure.</li>\n\t<li>Sensation, palpation, or visualization of tissue bulging through the anus, especially with straining or defecation.&nbsp; The bulging may persist or reduce spontaneously or with manual reduction (ie, manual replacement of the prolapsing tissue back through the anal sphincter).</li>\n\t<li>Fecal incontinence or urgency.</li>\n\t<li>Constipation or sensation of incomplete emptying (due to obstructed defecation).</li>\n\t<li>Straining or use of digital maneuvers to initiate or complete defecation.</li>\n\t<li>Mucus discharge or bleeding (due to ulceration or irritation of the exposed rectal mucosa).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Rectal intussusception</strong> (ie, occult rectal prolapse):&nbsp; The lower bowel may telescope on itself, leading to symptoms similar to those of rectal prolapse.&nbsp; Physical examination can distinguish between the two because, unlike true rectal prolapse, no tissue descends below the anal verge with intussusception.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hemorrhoids</strong>:&nbsp; Internal hemorrhoids can bulge from the anal canal spontaneously or with straining; however, these are focal prolapses of rectal mucosal tissue in which the muscular layer stays in place (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L20104.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Like rectal prolapse, hemorrhoids can cause a bulging sensation, bleeding, and incontinence.&nbsp; Examination of a prolapsed hemorrhoid demonstrates linear folds or grooves between protruding columns of tissue in a stellate or radial pattern rather than a circumferential ring of prolapsed rectal tissue.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rectal and anal masses</strong>:&nbsp; Masses such as condylomata accuminata and malignancy can cause bloody or mucous discharge and changes in bowel habits.&nbsp; They can persistently or intermittently protrude beyond the anal verge, causing a bulging sensation or palpable external mass.&nbsp; Anal cancer typically appears as a firm, nodular, and irregular mass that may be friable or ulcerated (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12892.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Condylomata accuminata appear as single or multiple papules that may be smooth or verrucous in texture (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10187.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease</strong> (eg, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease):&nbsp; These conditions can cause fecal urgency and loss of blood or mucus from the rectum, but, unlike in rectal prolapse, abdominal pain and diarrhea are usually prominent symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pelvic organ prolapse</strong> (POP):&nbsp; Weakening of the connective tissue and muscular support structures of the vagina, pelvis, and perineum can lead to prolapse of these structures into the vagina or beyond the hymen.&nbsp; POP can cause bowel dysfunction and a bulging sensation that is usually felt at the introitus rather than the anus.&nbsp; POP and rectal prolapse frequently occur together because there is significant overlap between their pathogenesis and risk factors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis is primarily clinical.&nbsp; Visualization of a circular, concentric ring of rectal tissue protruding from the anus confirms the diagnosis.&nbsp; The size of the prolapse can vary and may appear as a small mound or a larger tubular or globular mass that appears moist and red-pink due to the everted rectal epithelium.&nbsp; In cases of intermittent prolapse, the Valsalva maneuver may help elicit the prolapse during the examination.</p><br><br><p>Rectal prolapse is often accompanied by additional examination findings, such as reduced anal sphincter tone, palpable laxity and folds of the rectum, a bulging perineum, and bulging tissue at the vaginal introitus in women with concomitant POP.</p><br><br><p>The clinical diagnosis alone is sufficient in most cases, but imaging studies can be considered when the prolapse cannot be demonstrated on physical examination.&nbsp; Imaging (eg, defecography, colonoscopy) may also be indicated if there is suspicion for additional pelvic floor disorders or the presence of concerning symptoms (eg, weight loss, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, suspected fistulous tracts).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Surgical repair is the gold standard for treatment.&nbsp; The surgical approach and type of procedure chosen depend on patient comorbidities, prolapse severity, and the type of bowel dysfunction (eg, incontinence vs constipation).</p><br><br><p>Nonsurgical management can be considered for early cases of mild prolapse or for patients who are at high risk for surgical complications or who decline surgery but is unlikely to result in significant improvement.&nbsp; These techniques can also be used as postoperative adjuncts to improve response to surgical treatment.&nbsp; They include bowel regulation (eg, dietary modifications, fiber supplementation, stool softeners), biofeedback therapy, and pelvic floor physical therapy.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis and complications</h1><br><br><p>Untreated rectal prolapse is generally progressive.&nbsp; It often begins with prolapse of a small amount of tissue that occurs only with straining and spontaneously reduces or is easily reducible manually.&nbsp; Over time, the prolapse may occur more frequently and with less activity (eg, standing, coughing) or may become persistent.&nbsp; The amount of prolapsed tissue tends to increase over time and increases the risk for bowel incarceration and strangulation.</p><br><br><p>Bowel function worsens over time with untreated rectal prolapse.&nbsp; Persistent stretching of the anal sphincter by the growing prolapse leads to further sphincter weakening and worsening continence.&nbsp; As a result, the prognosis for fecal continence tends to be better in patients who do not delay surgical treatment.</p>\n<h1>Special consideration: Rectal prolapse in children</h1><br><br><p>Rectal prolapse is more common in young children than in other populations due to several anatomic factors (eg, greater mobility of the sigmoid colon, vertical course of the rectum, redundant rectal mucosa, underdeveloped levator ani muscles).&nbsp; It most often occurs in infancy and is rare over age 4.&nbsp; Cases in older children are usually associated with chronic predisposing conditions such as cystic fibrosis, chronic constipation, neurologic abnormalities (eg, myelomeningocele), malnutrition, and diarrheal disease.</p><br><br><p>The presentation is similar to that of rectal prolapse in adults; however, unlike in adults, most cases in young children are self-limited and respond to medical management (eg, bowel regimen, management of underlying conditions).&nbsp; Patients with recurrent rectal prolapse are often treated with sclerotherapy (ie, injection of a sclerosing substance into the submucosa, inducing an inflammatory reaction that adheres the rectum to the perirectal tissue and prevents its descent).&nbsp; Surgery is usually reserved for refractory conditions and cases involving older children, which are less likely to respond to conservative measures.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Rectal prolapse is a debilitating but treatable condition characterized by the protrusion of rectal tissue from the anus.&nbsp; It often results from multifactorial pelvic floor dysfunction and can cause incontinence and constipation.&nbsp; The diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by imaging such as defecography.&nbsp; Because rectal prolapse is a progressive condition, surgery is the preferred management for most adult patients.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
