The primary disturbance in HoHF is a <em>reduction</em> in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which leads to a reflexive increase in cardiac output (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L60481.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; With most other types of heart failure, the primary disturbance is left ventricular (LV) dysfunction leading to a reduction in cardiac output and a reflexive <em>increase</em> in SVR (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L42668.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The reduction in SVR that leads to HoHF can be due to a number of different mechanisms.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><h2>Reduced SVR and increased cardiac output</h2><br><br><p>HoHF results from a disturbance that decreases SVR.&nbsp; The low SVR leads to reduced blood pressure, and, in response, the left ventricle increases cardiac contractility and stroke volume to maintain adequate cardiac output for organ and tissue perfusion.&nbsp; Heart rate is also increased to aid cardiac output.&nbsp; The increase in stroke volume is responsible for characteristic findings of <strong>hyperdynamic circulation</strong>, including bounding pulses, brisk carotid upstroke, warm extremities, and wide pulse pressure (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L69248.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>With increased cardiac output in the setting of low SVR, blood passes through the systemic circulation and back to the heart quickly and easily, resulting in increased cardiac venous return (increased cardiac preload).&nbsp; Despite a sustained increase in cardiac output, the left ventricle becomes unable to keep up with the increased venous return, and decompensated heart failure (eg, pulmonary edema, peripheral edema) eventually develops.&nbsp; In simple terms, the cardiac pump overloads itself because the resistance of the circuit is too low.</p>\n<h2>Overview of causes</h2><br><br><p>The decrease in SVR that leads to HoHF can occur via a number of mechanisms, which are described in more detail in the next section (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/54746.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Bypass of systemic arteriolar resistance:&nbsp; An arteriovenous (AV) fistula (eg, from trauma or surgically created for use in hemodialysis) or AV malformation provides a low-resistance pathway for blood to bypass the systemic arterioles and move directly to the venous circulation and back to the heart.&nbsp; Large AV pathways can reduce SVR enough to cause HoHF.</li>\n\t<li>Unmet metabolic demand in the tissues (via vasodilation):&nbsp; Disruptions that increase metabolic demand (eg, hyperthyroidism) or involve a metabolic shortage (eg, severe anemia, thiamine deficiency) can cause peripheral vasodilation and a reduction in SVR.&nbsp; Chronic lung disease (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) can cause peripheral vasodilation due to hypoxemia and hypercapnia and can lead to HoHF.</li>\n\t<li>Other peripheral vasodilation:&nbsp; Other conditions, including cirrhosis and morbid obesity, cause peripheral vasodilation likely via hormonal mechanisms and are common causes of HoHF.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Correction of the underlying cause of HoHF will often normalize SVR and result in resolution of the heart failure.</p>\n<h1>Causes</h1><h2>Bypass of systemic arteriolar resistance</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Acquired AV fistula</strong>:&nbsp; An AV fistula is an abnormal connection between the arterial and venous circulations that allows blood to bypass the resistance of the systemic arterioles and capillaries.&nbsp; Traumatic injury (eg, a knife or bullet wound to the thigh) that damages both an artery and adjacent vein can create an AV fistula.&nbsp; In addition, an AV fistula is often placed surgically for hemodialysis access (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L20056.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; HoHF can develop if the AV fistula becomes large and allows a substantial portion of cardiac output to bypass arteriolar resistance.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Congenital AV malformations</strong> (eg, Sturge-Weber syndrome):&nbsp; can cause HoHF if the AV malformations become relatively large.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Paget disease (osteitis deformans)</strong>:&nbsp; involves accelerated bone remodeling and bone overgrowth.&nbsp; The areas of bone overgrowth contain small AV malformations such that HoHF can develop if bone overgrowth becomes extensive (eg, involving &gt;20% of the skeleton).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Unmet metabolic demand in the tissues</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hyperthyroidism</strong>:&nbsp; increases systemic metabolism and waste production to cause peripheral vasodilation, and increased thyroid hormone levels also directly increase heart rate and contractility.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Severe anemia</strong> (eg, hemoglobin &lt;5 g/dL):&nbsp; reduces oxygen delivery to the tissues, which can trigger peripheral vasodilation (to supply additional blood flow) and cause HoHF.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Thiamine deficiency</strong>:&nbsp; causes a buildup of lactic acid in the tissues, which triggers peripheral vasodilation and can lead to HoHF (wet beriberi).&nbsp; Thiamine deficiency likely also facilitates myocardial fibrosis and can eventually progress to dilated cardiomyopathy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Myeloproliferative disorders (eg, polycythemia vera)</strong>:&nbsp; increase metabolic demand and facilitate peripheral vasodilation, which can lead to HoHF.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic lung diseases</strong>:&nbsp; that cause chronic hypoxemia and hypercapnia (eg, COPD) can lead to peripheral vasodilation and HoHF.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other peripheral vasodilation</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Morbid obesity</strong>:&nbsp; causes peripheral vasodilation and may be the most common cause of HoHF, but the mechanism of peripheral vasodilation is poorly understood.&nbsp; Supplying blood to the increased quantity of peripheral capillaries in the expanded adipose tissue necessitates an increase in cardiac output, and hormones released from adipose tissue (adipokines) may be the primary contributor to vasodilation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cirrhosis</strong>:&nbsp; is associated with increased levels of circulating vasodilators (eg, nitric oxide) that cause splanchnic vasodilation and can lead to an overall reduction in SVR.&nbsp; HoHF can occur with advanced cirrhosis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The clinical presentation of HoHF is similar to low-output heart failure and demonstrates most of the same signs and symptoms.&nbsp; However, unlike low-output heart failure, characteristic findings of hyperdynamic circulation are present with HoHF, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Bounding pulses</li>\n\t<li>Brisk carotid upstroke</li>\n\t<li>Warm extremities</li>\n\t<li>Wide pulse pressure</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Laboratory</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>As seen in low-output heart failure, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is usually elevated in HoHF, consistent with elevated cardiac filling pressures causing ventricular stretch.</li>\n\t<li>Other laboratory findings consistent with the underlying cause of HoHF may be present (eg, very low hemoglobin, suppressed TSH).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>HoHF should be suspected based on clinical presentation and is typically confirmed using echocardiography and right heart catheterization.</p>\n<h2>Echocardiography</h2><br><br><p>Echocardiography can suggest a high-output state and can also demonstrate typical findings of a dilated left ventricle, right ventricle, and inferior vena cava (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/54744.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; LV ejection fraction is usually normal or slightly increased.<p></p>\n<h2>Right heart catheterization</h2><br><br><p>Right heart catheterization (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L47416.jpg\" alt=\"Right heart catheterization\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">Right heart catheterization</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) confirms heart failure by demonstrating elevated left-sided filling pressures (ie, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &gt;16 mm Hg) and confirms a high-output state by demonstrating an elevated cardiac index &gt;4 L/min/m<font size=\"2\"><sup>2</sup></font>; this value typically corresponds with cardiac output &gt;8 L/min (cardiac index is a measure of cardiac output adjusted per body surface area).&nbsp; Normal cardiac output at rest is 5-6 L/min.<p></p><br><br><p>Because cardiac output is elevated and the peripheral tissues can extract a lower percentage of the blood's total oxygen content as blood passes through the systemic capillaries, the mixed venous oxygen saturation (MvO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>) is characteristically elevated in HoHF.&nbsp; (MvO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>, which can also be measured by right heart catheterization, reflects the oxygen remaining in the blood after it has delivered oxygen to the tissues; it is effectively directly related to cardiac output [Fick principle].)&nbsp; In contrast, MvO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> is characteristically low in low-output heart failure because cardiac output is low.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><h2>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction</h2><br><br><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) can present similarly to HoHF with signs and symptoms of heart failure in the setting of LV ejection fraction ≥50%.&nbsp; Like HoHF, HFpEF is also common in patients with obesity.&nbsp; However, HFpEF does not demonstrate findings of hyperdynamic circulation (stroke volume is not increased) and heart catheterization does not show elevated cardiac output.</p>\n<h2>Chronic aortic regurgitation</h2><br><br><p>Chronic aortic regurgitation can present similarly to HoHF as it causes increased stroke volume with findings of hyperdynamic circulation and can eventually lead to heart failure (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L39519.png\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; However, SVR is not decreased in aortic regurgitation and echocardiography clearly demonstrates valvular regurgitation.<p></p>\n<h2>Early sepsis</h2><br><br><p>Early sepsis creates a hemodynamic state similar to HoHF (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L42671.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Bacterial endotoxin or other inflammatory mediators cause peripheral vasodilation to decrease SVR, and there is a reflexive increase in stroke volume and heart rate (findings of hyperdynamic circulation may also be present).&nbsp; However, elevated cardiac filling pressures are not typical of sepsis in part because sepsis also involves vascular leakage and loss of intravascular blood volume, which reduces venous return and prevents the ventricles from being overloaded.<p></p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of HoHF involves diuretics (eg, furosemide) to improve volume overload and primarily focuses on treatment of the underlying cause.&nbsp; Peripheral vasodilators (eg, ACE inhibitors) may need to be avoided to prevent a further reduction in SVR.&nbsp; Successful correction of the underlying cause of HoHF often normalizes SVR and resolves the heart failure.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis in patients with HoHF is largely dependent on the underlying cause.&nbsp; In general, patients with HoHF that requires hospitalization have a similar mortality rate to patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>High-output heart failure (HoHF) is an uncommon type of heart failure characterized by signs and symptoms of heart failure despite elevated cardiac output.&nbsp; The primary disturbance in high-output heart failure is a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, which can occur via a number of different mechanisms.&nbsp; In response to reduced systemic vascular resistance, there is a reflexive increase in stroke volume and cardiac output, which creates characteristic findings of hyperdynamic circulation (eg, bounding pulses, wide pulse pressure).&nbsp; The diagnosis is confirmed by heart catheterization demonstrating elevated cardiac filling pressures in the setting of elevated cardiac output.&nbsp; Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause, which can often normalize systemic vascular resistance and resolve the heart failure.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
