It is a medical emergency that requires prompt recognition and intervention.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Any condition that causes pericardial effusion can lead to tamponade; this includes all etiologies of pericarditis such as infection (eg, viruses, tuberculosis), uremia, autoimmune disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), and malignancy.&nbsp; Hypothyroidism is a rare cause of pericardial effusion and tamponade.&nbsp; In addition, cardiac trauma (eg, injury, free wall rupture) or invasive procedures (eg, cardiac ablation, cardiothoracic surgery) can result in blood accumulation in the pericardial space and lead to tamponade.&nbsp; Aortic dissection with extension into the aortic root and rupture into the pericardial space is an occasional cause of tamponade.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>There is normally a small volume of fluid within the pericardial space (eg, &lt;50 mL).&nbsp; Cardiac tamponade occurs when excess fluid accumulates within the pericardial space and, due to restricted expansion of the pericardial sac, begins to increase pericardial pressure.&nbsp; As pericardial pressure rises it begins to exceed the normal diastolic filling pressures of the heart and causes compression of the cardiac chambers; the relatively low-pressure right-sided chambers are affected first, with restricted diastolic filling of the right atrium and right ventricle.&nbsp; As these chambers become unable to fill, less blood is pumped to the left side of the heart and cardiac output decreases, resulting in hypotension.&nbsp; Because the obstruction to blood flow is primarily right-sided, pulmonary edema is not expected.&nbsp; As tamponade progresses, diastolic pressures in all 4 cardiac chambers increase and equalize with pericardial pressure (and with one another), eliminating the normal pressure gradients within the heart and stagnating blood flow (and causing obstructive shock (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L64039.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).<p></p><br><br><p>Cardiac tamponade is classified as acute or subacute based on the rate and volume of pericardial fluid accumulation.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Acute tamponade</strong> occurs due to rapid fluid accumulation (eg, bleeding into the pericardial space).&nbsp; Because the normally noncompliant pericardium does not have time to adapt, a small amount of pericardial fluid (eg, 100-200 mL) can dramatically increase pericardial pressure and impair cardiac function.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Subacute tamponade</strong> typically develops from chronic processes that cause the slow accumulation of pericardial fluid (eg, malignancy, renal failure), giving the pericardium time to progressively stretch and increase compliance.&nbsp; The stretched pericardium may accommodate up to 2 liters of fluid before pericardial pressure begins to rise and compromise cardiac function.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><h2>Beck triad</h2><br><br><p>The classic Beck triad of cardiac tamponade presents as follows (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L20860.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Jugular venous distension</strong> occurs due to elevated right atrial pressure.&nbsp; It is highly sensitive (ie, usually present) but sometimes may be difficult to detect on physical examination.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hypotension</strong> develops due to impaired diastolic filling and reduced cardiac output.&nbsp; It is only moderately sensitive as it is a late finding in subacute tamponade.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Muffled heart sounds</strong> can occur due to dampening of sound by the accumulated pericardial fluid.&nbsp; It is poorly sensitive, likely in part because it can be subjective and difficult to detect on physical examination.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>However, the complete triad is seen only in a minority of patients.</p>\n<h2>Acute vs subacute tamponade</h2><br><br><p>The clinical features can vary with acute vs subacute tamponade (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/50052.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>With <strong>acute tamponade</strong>, cardiac dysfunction rapidly develops (eg, within minutes) with resulting hypotension and shock (and reflex tachycardia).&nbsp; Acute-onset chest pain may be present.</li>\n\t<li>With <strong>subacute tamponade</strong>, the presentation is more gradual (eg, several days to weeks) and often more subtle.&nbsp; Patients can have exertional dyspnea and fatigue (due to impaired cardiac output), chest discomfort or fullness, and lower extremity edema.&nbsp; Exertional lightheadedness or syncope may also occur.&nbsp; Tachycardia is typically present before clinically apparent hypotension develops (because the reflexive increase in heart rate can maintain relatively compensated cardiac output at rest).&nbsp; As fluid continues to accumulate, hypotension and shock can abruptly develop once a critical pericardial volume/pressure is reached.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In neither acute nor subacute tamponade are pulmonary edema (eg, lung crackles) or hypoxemia typically expected.&nbsp; In both cases, a narrow pulse pressure is typically present once hypotension develops, reflecting reduced stroke volume.&nbsp; An attenuated y descent is typically seen in the jugular venous pulse waveform due to compression of the right ventricle and impaired diastolic filling (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L50501.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Pulsus paradoxus</h2><br><br><p>Pulsus paradoxus is a helpful finding seen in most patients once tamponade develops.&nbsp; It is an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure (&gt;10 mm Hg) during inspiration that results from the right and left ventricle having to compete for limited space (ie, ventricular interdependence) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25638.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Normally, there is a slight drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration because the reduced intrathoracic pressure with inspiration pulls blood into the lungs and right ventricle while at the same time slightly reducing left ventricular filling and stroke volume.</li>\n\t<li>In tamponade, the right ventricle cannot expand outward to accommodate increased blood return during inspiration, so the increased blood return forces the interventricular septum to bow into the left ventricle.&nbsp; This further reduces left ventricular filling and stroke volume, creating an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Pulsus paradoxus is highly sensitive but only moderately specific for tamponade as it is also seen in other conditions (eg, severe asthma).</p>\n<h2>ECG findings</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Tachycardia (highly sensitive but nonspecific)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Low-voltage QRS complexes</strong> due to either dampening of electrical signals or impaired cardiac function (neither sensitive nor specific)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Electrical alternans</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22874.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;
