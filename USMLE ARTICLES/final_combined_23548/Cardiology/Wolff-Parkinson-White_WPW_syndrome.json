Because conduction through the accessory pathway is typically faster than conduction through the AV node, a portion of the ventricles depolarize earlier than usual in the conduction cycle (ventricular preexcitation).&nbsp; The ventricular preexcitation commonly creates characteristic findings on ECG, known as WPW <em>pattern</em>.&nbsp; Many patients with an accessory pathway and WPW pattern on ECG remain asymptomatic, but some develop symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT); those who develop PSVT have WPW <em>syndrome</em>.&nbsp; Ventricular preexcitation is important to recognize because it can increase the risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD).</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><h2>Accessory pathway</h2><br><br><p>An accessory pathway (sometimes called a bundle of Kent or a <strong>bypass tract</strong>) usually results from congenitally present conduction fibers that fail to resorb during fetal development.&nbsp; These fibers are most commonly located on the left side of the heart and connect the left atrium directly to the left ventricle.&nbsp; Conduction through the accessory pathway is usually <strong>faster</strong> than conduction through the AV node; the characteristics of this process are similar to those of atrial and ventricular myocardium and are primarily driven by fast sodium channels (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L8878.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) rather than the slow calcium channels that drive conduction through the AV node.<p></p>\n<h2>Ventricular preexcitation and WPW pattern</h2><br><br><p>During normal sinus rhythm, a conduction impulse is generated in the sinoatrial node and disperses through the atrial myocardium.&nbsp; In the presence of an accessory conduction pathway, the electrical impulse is able to <strong>leap from the atria to a portion of ventricles</strong> before any conduction passes through the AV node (ventricular preexcitation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10431.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).&nbsp; Conduction through the AV node occurs just after conduction through the accessory pathway and the ventricles are depolarized in a hybrid fashion, partially via the accessory pathway and partially via the normal AV node-His-Purkinje system.&nbsp; On ECG, the ventricular preexcitation classically manifests with the triad of a short PR interval, slurred upstroke of the QRS complex (delta wave), and a wide QRS complex (WPW pattern (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10371.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).<p></p>\n<h2>Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) and reentrant circuit</h2><br><br><p>Ventricular preexcitation itself does not cause symptoms, therefore, patients with an accessory pathway are often asymptomatic.&nbsp; In patients who develop symptoms, it is usually because the accessory pathway allows for the development of AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), a type of PSVT that is the characteristic arrhythmia of WPW syndrome (PSVTs are discussed in detail in a separate article).&nbsp; AVRT commonly results when a premature ventricular contraction sends a conduction impulse retrograde through the accessory pathway to the atria and back down through the AV node, initiating a large reentrant circuit (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/96921.mp4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: video 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This type of AVRT (reentrant circuit passing down through the AV node and back up through the accessory pathway) is known as <em>orthodromic</em> AVRT and accounts for the vast majority of AVRT.&nbsp; Rarely, a reentrant circuit passes up through the AV node and down through the accessory pathway; this is known as <em>antidromic</em> AVRT (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L89907.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Preexcited atrial fibrillation</h2><br><br><p>Atrial fibrillation (or atrial flutter) in the presence of an accessory pathway (preexcited atrial fibrillation) can be an especially dangerous arrhythmia.&nbsp; Normally, the slow calcium current in the AV node allows for a lengthened refractory period and acts as a protective mechanism that slows conduction and prevents the transmission of rapid atrial activity to the ventricles.&nbsp; However, the bypassing of the AV node by the accessory pathway eliminates this protective mechanism and creates risk for transmission of rapid atrial activity (ie, 500-600/min in atrial fibrillation and ~300/min in atrial flutter) to the ventricles.&nbsp; Dangerously high ventricular rates (ie, &gt;200/min) in preexcited atrial fibrillation can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, which is the typical cause of SCD in patients with WPW syndrome.&nbsp; The same concern does not apply to AVRT because the AV node is part of the reentrant circuit and limits the ventricular rate.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Family history of WPW pattern or syndrome (although most cases are sporadic)</li>\n\t<li>Male sex:&nbsp; The prevalence of WPW pattern is similar in men and women, but WPW syndrome is more common in men</li>\n\t<li>Ebstein anomaly:&nbsp; Patients with this condition have an increased prevalence of WPW pattern and syndrome because right-sided accessory pathways can be present due to the tricuspid valve abnormalities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with an accessory pathway who develop PSVT may experience symptoms including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Palpitations or a feeling of a racing heart</li>\n\t<li>Dyspnea</li>\n\t<li>Chest discomfort</li>\n\t<li>Lightheadedness</li>\n\t<li>Syncope</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2><br><br><p>Palpation of the radial pulse during an episode of AVRT shows a regular rhythm with a rapid rate.&nbsp;

The pattern consists of the triad of a <strong>short PR interval</strong> (&lt;0.12 sec), <strong>slurred upstroke of the QRS complex</strong> (delta wave), and a <strong>widened QRS complex</strong> (&gt;0.12 sec).&nbsp; Repolarization abnormalities (eg, T-wave inversions) are also often present.</li>\n\t<li>AVRT (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12094.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) demonstrates a rapid rate with regular R-R intervals.&nbsp; <strong>Inverted P waves</strong>, resulting from retrograde depolarization of the atria, may be visible just <strong>after</strong> the QRS complexes.&nbsp; QRS complexes are narrow in orthodromic AVRT and are wide in antidromic AVRT.&nbsp; Notably, the characteristic WPW pattern is <strong>not</strong> apparent during AVRT (no delta waves).</li>\n\t<li>Preexcited atrial fibrillation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L87736.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) demonstrates a rapid rate with irregular R-R intervals.&nbsp; Delta waves may be present intermittently and the QRS morphology varies due to beat-to-beat variation in the degree of ventricular depolarization that occurs via the AV node and the accessory pathway.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>In asymptomatic patients, a WPW pattern is often incidentally recognized on ECG.</li>\n\t<li>In symptomatic patients with a clinical presentation suspicious for PSVT, the diagnosis is confirmed by ECG or cardiac monitoring capturing the tachyarrhythmia in combination with an ECG during sinus rhythm showing a WPW pattern.</li>\n\t<li>An invasive electrophysiologic study is sometimes needed to confirm the diagnosis, particularly because some accessory pathways do not create the characteristic WPW pattern on ECG (eg, those that conduct more slowly than the AV node, those that can conduct only in a retrograde direction).&nbsp; The diagnosis of these so-called \"concealed\" accessory pathways typically requires clinical suspicion based on the presence of a PSVT followed by invasive electrophysiologic testing to confirm the presence of the pathway.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Acute management</h1><br><br><p>The acute management (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/87762.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) of an accessory pathway-related tachyarrhythmia first depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient and is also specific to the type of arrhythmia present:<p></p>\n<h2>Hemodynamically unstable</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Patients with a PSVT whose condition is hemodynamically unstable (eg, severe hypotension) should undergo immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hemodynamically stable</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>AVRT should be managed by slowing conduction through the AV node with vagal maneuvers (eg, Valsalva maneuver) or via administration of intravenous adenosine.&nbsp; Because the reentrant circuit of AVRT involves the AV node, slowing or temporary blockade of conduction through the AV node often terminates the arrhythmia.&nbsp; Notably, AVRT may be difficult to differentiate from other rapid PSVTs, and adenosine can also be helpful in identifying the arrhythmia.</li>\n\t<li>In preexcited atrial fibrillation, AV nodal blockers (eg, beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, adenosine) are contraindicated because the slowing of conduction through the AV node encourages more rapid conduction through the accessory pathway and increases the ventricular rate and risk for ventricular fibrillation.&nbsp; Procainamide, a class Ia antiarrhythmic agent that inhibits cardiac sodium channels, is usually the drug of choice because it slows conduction through the accessory pathway without affecting conduction through the AV node, and may cardiovert preexcited atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Chronic management</h1><br><br><p>The chronic management of patients with a recognized WPW pattern or WPW syndrome focuses on minimizing the incidence of symptomatic episodes and reducing the risk for SCD.</p>\n<h2>Symptomatic patients (WPW syndrome)</h2><br><br><p>In patients who have had symptomatic tachyarrhythmias related to an accessory pathway, radiofrequency catheter ablation of the accessory pathway (which ablates abnormal tissue) is the treatment of choice.&nbsp; This therapy is approximately 90% effective at eliminating PSVT and the increased risk for SCD and has a complication rate &lt;5%.</p>\n<h2>Asymptomatic patients</h2><br><br><p>The management of asymptomatic patients with an incidentally-recognized WPW pattern on ECG is more nuanced because the risk for future complications related to the accessory pathway is difficult to quantify.&nbsp; The main factors used to help quantify future risk include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Patient age:&nbsp; Relatively older patients (eg, age &gt;40) who have gone decades without developing symptoms are less likely to develop symptoms in the future.&nbsp; In contrast, younger patients are more likely to develop symptoms at some point.</li>\n\t<li>Occupation:&nbsp; Certain occupations (eg, competitive athlete, pilot, bus driver) create a greater risk for injury or death to self or others if symptomatic arrhythmias develop.</li>\n\t<li>Exercise and/or electrophysiology testing:&nbsp; Faster conducting accessory pathways (ie, those with a relatively short refractory period) create a higher risk for serious arrhythmias and SCD compared to slower conducting accessory pathways.&nbsp; Exercise testing is noninvasive and can help evaluate the rate of accessory pathway conduction.&nbsp; The loss of preexcitation (eg, loss of the delta wave on ECG) as the heart rate accelerates during exercise suggests a relatively slow conducting pathway that is unable to conduct fast enough to cause atrial fibrillation to degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (ie, suggests a low-risk accessory pathway).&nbsp; Invasive electrophysiologic testing can also be used to determine the conduction rate of an accessory pathway and identify high risk accessory pathways (ie, refractory period &lt;250 msec).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Asymptomatic patients considered to be at low risk for developing serious tachyarrhythmias can be monitored without intervention, whereas preemptive radiofrequency catheter ablation is indicated in patients considered to be at higher risk.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The risk for SCD in patients with an accessory conduction pathway is higher than the general population, but it is overall relatively low (&lt;1%).&nbsp; In general, the risk for SCD is higher in patients who have experienced symptomatic tachyarrhythmias (ie, WPW syndrome) compared to asymptomatic patients with a recognized WPW pattern on ECG.&nbsp; Fortunately, most patients with WPW syndrome initially have a nonfatal symptomatic arrhythmia, allowing the opportunity for appropriate intervention.&nbsp; Radiofrequency catheter ablation is highly effective in mitigating the risk for SCD in patients with an accessory conduction pathway.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pathophysiology involves a usually congenitally present accessory pathway that directly connects the atria to the ventricles, allowing conduction to bypass the atrioventricular (AV) node.&nbsp; The accessory pathway causes ventricular preexcitation, which is commonly seen on ECG with a characteristic WPW pattern (ie, short PR interval, delta wave, wide QRS complex).&nbsp; Many patients with an accessory pathway remain asymptomatic, but some develop symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (WPW syndrome).&nbsp; AV reentrant tachycardia is the characteristic and most common arrhythmia associated with WPW syndrome.&nbsp; Patients can also develop preexcited atrial fibrillation, which creates the risk for very high ventricular rates, with degeneration to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.&nbsp; Radiofrequency catheter ablation to obliterate the accessory pathway is the treatment of choice for WPW pathophysiology.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
