Syncope can be a benign event or it can be a sign of a serious underlying disturbance that increases the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD).&nbsp; Up to 20% of the population experiences syncope at some point in their lifetime, making it a common medical concern.&nbsp; The details surrounding a syncope event provide clues to the underlying cause and help assess the need for diagnostic workup and intervention.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><h2>Reflex (neurogenic) syncope</h2><br><br><p>Reflex syncope (sometimes referred to as neurogenic syncope) is the <strong>most common type</strong> of syncope and results from a temporary alteration in the autonomic nervous system and baroreceptor reflex that leads to a transient drop in blood pressure.&nbsp; A trigger (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73809.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) sends input to the brainstem cardioregulatory center, which responds by transmitting increased parasympathetic tone and decreased sympathetic tone to the heart and peripheral arteries.&nbsp; The overactive parasympathetic tone and loss of sympathetic tone leads to decreased heart rate (eg, prolonged sinus pause) and reduced cardiac contractility to cause a drop in cardiac output, and peripheral vasodilation contributes to reduced blood pressure.&nbsp; These changes result in a brief but severe drop in cerebral perfusion causing <strong>abrupt LOC</strong> and loss of postural tone.&nbsp; The autonomic nervous system quickly returns to baseline, resulting in restoration of blood pressure and cerebral perfusion and rapid regaining of consciousness.&nbsp; Reflex syncope is <strong>benign</strong> in that it occurs in the setting of intact cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems, and it does not denote any increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or mortality.&nbsp; However, it usually occurs in a standing position and creates risk of injury due to falling during LOC.<p></p>\n<h2>Orthostatic syncope</h2><br><br><p>Orthostatic syncope occurs upon <strong>standing from a supine</strong> or sitting position and results from an inability to compensate for the initial drop in blood pressure that occurs with standing.&nbsp; It usually involves a disruption of the normal baroreceptor response to decreased blood pressure (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59557.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Hypovolemia, certain medications, and underlying autonomic dysfunction can all disrupt the baroreceptor reflex to cause orthostatic syncope.<p></p>\n<h2>Cardiac syncope</h2><br><br><p>Cardiac syncope results from a drop in cardiac output mediated by <strong>primary dysfunction of the heart</strong>, most often from:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction leading to exertional restriction of cardiac output, or</li>\n\t<li>bradyarrhythmia or paroxysmal tachyarrhythmia causing a drop in cardiac output.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In syncope due to cardiac tachyarrhythmia (usually ventricular tachycardia [VT]), the onset of the <strong>arrhythmia</strong> causes an abrupt drop in cardiac output that leads to LOC.&nbsp; Within a couple minutes, the arrhythmia spontaneously terminates or slows in rate to allow a return of adequate cerebral reperfusion and regaining of consciousness.&nbsp; If the arrhythmia had been more sustained and the episode of reduced cardiac output persisted for longer, the syncope would have progressed to SCA (and SCD if not resuscitated).&nbsp; The seriousness of syncope due to cardiac tachyarrhythmia is reflected in the idea that it effectively represents an episode of aborted SCA.</p>\n<h2>Other</h2><br><br><p>Other serious medical conditions that reduce cardiac output (eg, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, cardiac tamponade) can occasionally present with syncope.&nbsp; In these conditions, compensatory mechanisms are able to counteract an initial drop in cardiac output and allow for regaining of consciousness.</p><br><br><p>Syncope events can be multifactorial.&nbsp; For example, dehydration (hypovolemia) may create a lower threshold for reflex syncope to occur.</p>\n<h1>Causes</h1><br><br><p>The cause of syncope is often suggested by clinical clues from the history (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/57146.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p>\n<h2>Reflex syncope</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Vasovagal</strong> syncope is the most common type of reflex syncope.&nbsp; It is characterized by having a typical trigger (eg, prolonged standing, emotional stress such as pain or fear) and classic prodrome symptoms (eg, nausea, sweating, warmth, pallor).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Situational</strong> syncope is a type of reflex syncope triggered by a specific direct trigger, including urination, defecation, swallowing, and cough.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Carotid sinus hypersensitivity</strong> is a type of reflex syncope caused by overly sensitive carotid baroreceptors that stimulate an excessive vagal response to tactile stimulus (eg, shaving, constriction by a shirt collar).&nbsp; It is most commonly seen in elderly men; underlying carotid atherosclerotic disease and prior neck surgery (eg, thyroidectomy) increase the risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Orthostatic syncope</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hypovolemia</strong> (eg, dehydration, blood loss) can make it so an intact baroreceptor response cannot adequately increase blood pressure to maintain cerebral perfusion upon standing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Medications</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/57751.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) can contribute to volume depletion or disrupt either the vasoconstriction or heart rate response of the baroreceptor reflex, causing orthostatic syncope.&nbsp; Medications with alpha-1 blocking properties (eg, terazosin, prazosin, tricyclic antidepressants) tend to be most strongly associated with orthostatic symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Autonomic</strong> dysfunction can occur with advancing age or as a result of underlying chronic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson disease, amyloidosis).&nbsp; The impaired function of the autonomic nervous system disrupts the baroreceptor response and can cause or contribute to orthostatic syncope.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cardiac syncope</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>LV outflow obstruction</strong> occurs with severe aortic stenosis and also may be present with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.&nbsp; The syncope is usually exertional, resulting from an inability to adequately increase cardiac output during exercise.&nbsp; These conditions can also cause syncope by triggering ventricular arrhythmia.</li>\n\t<li>VT accounts for the vast majority of <strong>arrhythmogenic syncope</strong>.&nbsp; Ventricular fibrillation almost never spontaneously terminates; therefore, it almost invariably causes SCA and not syncope.&nbsp; Rapid supraventricular tachycardias (eg, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia) can occasionally cause syncope but are less likely to generate sufficiently high ventricular rates to cause LOC.&nbsp; Syncope due to VT characteristically presents with abrupt LOC without any preceding symptoms (other than possible palpitations), and it most often occurs in patients with underlying cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease.&nbsp; Other risk factors include long QT syndrome and other cardiac channelopathies (eg, Brugada syndrome).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Conduction impairment</strong> leading to bradycardia (eg, sinus node dysfunction, advanced atrioventricular block) is a potential cause of syncope.&nbsp; The syncope may be exertional and is often preceded by symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other causes of syncope</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pulmonary embolism:&nbsp; Approximately 10%-15% of cases of acute pulmonary embolism may present with syncope.&nbsp; The syncope likely results from a sudden drop in cardiac output caused by obstruction of cardiopulmonary blood flow.</li>\n\t<li>Aortic dissection:&nbsp; Syncope can occur due to a pain-induced vasovagal response or due to mechanical disruption of blood flow by the aortic intimal flap.</li>\n\t<li>Tamponade:&nbsp; Syncope can occur with the restricted cardiac output that develops with subacute tamponade, especially during exertion.&nbsp; LOC with acute tamponade may be more likely to manifest as SCA than syncope.</li>\n\t<li>Pulmonary hypertension:&nbsp; Exertional syncope can occur in severe pulmonary hypertension due to inability of the right ventricle to pump blood through the lungs to the left side of the heart, with a resulting drop in cardiac output.</li>\n\t<li>Vertebrobasilar insufficiency:&nbsp; Atherosclerotic narrowing of the vertebrobasilar arteries or subclavian steal syndrome (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14100.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) can rarely cause syncope due to poor perfusion of the reticular activating system.&nbsp; The syncope is usually preceded by symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency (eg, vertigo, diplopia).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with syncope experience a sudden LOC followed by a rapid return to baseline within 1-2 minutes.&nbsp; Because syncope results from a drop in cerebral perfusion, lightheadedness is a nonspecific symptom that may precede any etiology of syncope.&nbsp; Occasionally, patients will experience presyncope, which is severe lightheadedness that resolves before LOC occurs.&nbsp; Other components of the clinical presentation tend to be specific to the etiology of syncope.</p>\n<h2>Reflex syncope</h2><br><br><p>Patients with vasovagal syncope typically have classic vagal prodrome symptoms that can include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Nausea</li>\n\t<li>Sweating</li>\n\t<li>Warmth</li>\n\t<li>Pallor</li>\n\t<li>Visual blurring</li>\n\t<li>Yawning</li>\n\t<li>Diminished hearing or hearing of a whooshing sound</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>A <strong>vagal prodrome</strong> may also occur with situational syncope and carotid sinus hypersensitivity, but it is less commonly reported possibly because the trigger of these types of syncope tends to be more abrupt than in vasovagal syncope (in vasovagal syncope, the overactive vagal tone may develop more gradually).</p><br><br><p>Reflex syncope usually occurs in a standing position and may sometimes occur in a sitting position.&nbsp; It is very unlikely to occur in a supine position.</p>\n<h2>Orthostatic syncope</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Orthostatic syncope can occur immediately upon standing or may be delayed several minutes after standing from a supine or sitting position.</li>\n\t<li>Lightheadedness commonly precedes LOC in orthostatic syncope.</li>\n\t<li>A recent large meal increases the risk of orthostatic syncope because blood is shifted from the systemic capacitance veins to the splanchnic circulation to aid digestion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cardiac syncope</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>LV outflow obstruction:&nbsp;\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>The syncope most commonly occurs during exertion.&nbsp; Syncope that occurs once a patient is resting after exertion is more suggestive of reflex syncope.</li>\n\t\t<li>A systolic ejection murmur is typically present on physical examination.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>VT:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>The syncope can occur at rest or during exertion.</li>\n\t\t<li>The syncope can occur in any position (standing, sitting, supine).&nbsp; Syncope that occurs in a supine position is highly concerning for VT.</li>\n\t\t<li>The drop in cardiac output is typically so abrupt that patients experience no preceding symptoms (other than possible palpitations).</li>\n\t\t<li>Due to the paroxysmal nature of VT, a single ECG is unlikely to demonstrate the arrhythmia.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Bradyarrhythmia:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>The syncope can occur at rest but often occurs with mild exertion.</li>\n\t\t<li>The syncope may be preceded by fatigue and lightheadedness.</li>\n\t\t<li>ECG often demonstrates evidence of sinus node dysfunction (eg, sinus pauses) or advanced atrioventricular block.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The diagnosis of syncope is mostly based on details of the history; however, a 12-lead ECG is recommended in all patients.</li>\n\t<li>Patients with a clear history of a typical trigger and a classic vagal prodrome and no abnormalities on ECG are highly likely to have had vasovagal syncope and&nbsp; typically require no further work-up.&nbsp; Similarly, a patient with a clear history of situational syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity, in the absence of ECG abnormalities, requires no further work-up.</li>\n\t<li>Patients presenting with syncope upon standing should undergo orthostatic blood pressure measurement to evaluate for orthostasis (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/72184.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>ECG may reveal findings suggestive of a particular etiology of cardiac syncope (eg, sinus pauses suggesting bradyarrhythmia, Q waves suggesting ischemic heart disease and risk for VT) that warrant hospital admission.&nbsp; For patients in whom ECG is unrevealing but there is reasonable suspicion for cardiac syncope (eg, elderly patients and/or those with known cardiac disease), admission to the hospital for at least 24 hours of telemetry monitoring and evaluation with echocardiography is typically warranted.</li>\n\t<li>If ventricular arrhythmia is not confirmed by telemetry monitoring but suspicion remains high, electrophysiology testing is often performed for diagnostic confirmation.&nbsp; Ambulatory ECG monitoring can be helpful in the evaluation of syncope due to suspected bradyarrhythmia, and exercise stress testing can be useful in the evaluation of patients with exertional syncope.</li>\n\t<li>In patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause, tilt-table testing can be helpful in evaluating for findings consistent with vasovagal or orthostatic syncope and can help confirm other causes of LOC (eg, psychogenic pseudosyncope).</li>\n\t<li>Neurologic testing, including CT or MRI brain imaging, EEG, and carotid artery imaging, is rarely indicated in the evaluation of syncope.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Seizure</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/49157.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) can present similarly to syncope, especially since the transient cerebral hypoperfusion that occurs with syncope can sometimes cause convulsive movements and urinary incontinence that can mimic seizure.&nbsp; Tongue biting is common with seizure but rare with syncope, and seizure commonly involves a prolonged postictal period of confusion rather than a rapid return to baseline.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mechanical fall followed by concussion and LOC</strong> is common in the elderly and may be difficult to differentiate from syncope.&nbsp; When possible, clear history-taking can help determine whether LOC was the precipitant of the fall (rather than a result of the fall) and whether prodromal symptoms, which would suggest syncope, were present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Narcolepsy</strong> can cause LOC and when accompanied by cataplexy (loss of postural tone) can present similarly to syncope.&nbsp; A typical trigger and classic prodrome are not features of narcolepsy and are consistent with reflex syncope.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Psychogenic pseudosyncope</strong> is a type of conversion disorder involving apparent LOC events.&nbsp; Unlike true syncope, psychogenic pseudosyncope events often last for an extended period (eg, 10-20 min), lack objective findings (eg, prodromal symptoms, bradycardia, injury from falling), and can occur with extensive frequency (eg, multiple times per day).&nbsp; Tilt-table testing can often confirm psychogenic pseudosyncope by demonstrating LOC events despite a normal blood pressure and heart rate.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stroke</strong> is an extremely rare cause of LOC and generally is not considered an etiology of syncope.&nbsp; Stroke is most likely to present with focal weakness, facial paralysis, and/or speech difficulties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><h2>Reflex syncope</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>No intervention is indicated in patients with a single episode or only occasional episodes of vasovagal syncope.&nbsp; In patients with recurrent episodes of vasovagal syncope, avoidance of known triggers should be recommended, and counterpressure techniques (eg, leg-crossing, hand grip) may help prevent syncope when prodromal symptoms develop.&nbsp; Midodrine, an alpha-1 receptor agonist, is occasionally useful in mitigating a drop in blood pressure and may reduce episodes of recurrent vasovagal syncope.&nbsp; Rarely, placement of a permanent pacemaker may be indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope associated with prolonged sinus pauses.</li>\n\t<li>In patients with situational syncope, education should be provided about potential situational triggers, and good oral hydration should be encouraged.</li>\n\t<li>In patients with syncope due to carotid sinus hypersensitivity, education should be provided regarding avoidance of carotid stimulation.&nbsp; In addition, placement of a permanent pacemaker may be helpful in some patients by preventing the prolonged sinus pauses triggered by carotid sinus hypersensitivity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Orthostatic syncope</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Patients with evidence of hypovolemia should be given intravenous hydration if needed, and good oral salt and water intake should be encouraged.</li>\n\t<li>The patient's medication list should be thoroughly reviewed, and contributing medications should be appropriately dose-reduced or discontinued if not strongly indicated.</li>\n\t<li>Patients with risk factors for autonomic dysfunction (eg, advanced age, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus) should be educated about orthostatic hypotension and awareness to brace oneself, if needed, for the first several minutes after standing.</li>\n\t<li>Compression garments (eg, elastic stockings, abdominal binder) may be helpful in patients with recurrent orthostatic symptoms.</li>\n\t<li>Combination therapy with a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist (eg, fludrocortisone) and midodrine can increase blood volume and pressure and may also be helpful in patients with recurrent orthostatic symptoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cardiac syncope</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Patients with evidence of LV outflow obstruction should undergo appropriate medical or surgical management.&nbsp; Prompt surgical valve replacement is indicated for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.&nbsp; Medications (eg, beta blockers, mevacamten) may help relieve LV outflow obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and septal ablation or surgical myectomy is an option in cases that are refractory to medications.</li>\n\t<li>The management of syncope due to VT focuses on reducing the risk of future SCD, and placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is typically indicated.&nbsp; In addition, catheter ablation and/or pharmacologic therapy (eg, amiodarone, sotalol) may help reduce the incidence of VT recurrence.</li>\n\t<li>Syncope due to bradyarrhythmia is initially managed according to treatment guidelines for symptomatic bradycardia (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84240.png\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Definitive management often necessitates placement of a permanent pacemaker.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of syncope is mostly dependent on the underlying cause.&nbsp; Reflex syncope is not associated with any long-term negative effects, and patients have a similar prognosis to the general population.&nbsp; Cardiac syncope, especially that due to VT, carries a poor prognosis compared to the general population.&nbsp; Syncope resulting from an acute hemodynamic disturbance (eg, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection) is also associated with a poor prognosis.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Syncope is a brief loss of consciousness and postural tone that results from a transient drop in cerebral perfusion with a rapid return to baseline within 1-2 minutes.&nbsp; Syncope can be a benign event or it can be a sign of a serious underlying disturbance that increases the risk of sudden cardiac death (eg, cardiac syncope due to ventricular tachycardia).&nbsp; The details surrounding the syncope event provide clues to the underlying cause and help guide the need for diagnostic work-up and intervention.</p>\n\n            "
