The clinical presentation and course of disease are highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic disease that resolves without clinical detection to serious illness with life-threatening complications.<p></p><h1>Pathophysiology</h1><p><strong>Viral infection</strong> is the most common cause of myocarditis, with viruses, including coxsackievirus, adenovirus, and influenza virus, having been implicated.&nbsp; An inadequate initial immune response may allow a virus to invade and persist within cardiomyocytes, causing ongoing inflammation with resulting myocardial damage and often contractile dysfunction.&nbsp; Other causes of myocarditis generate a similar inflammatory response, with infiltration of immune cells and release of inflammatory cytokines leading to myocardial damage.</p><h1>Pathology</h1><p>The histopathology of viral myocarditis typically shows <strong>myocyte necrosis</strong> or degeneration accompanied by an inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrate.&nbsp; The <strong>cellular infiltrate</strong> consists primarily of lymphocytes with some macrophages.&nbsp; Other less common etiologies of myocarditis, including bacterial, parasitic, and rheumatologic, can have a similar histologic appearance but may demonstrate additional findings (eg, granulomas in mycobacterial disease, visible organisms in parasitic disease).</p><h1>Clinical presentation</h1><p>The clinical presentation of myocarditis somewhat depends on the underlying etiology and is often highly variable within a particular etiology.&nbsp; The classic presentation of myocarditis is defined by viral myocarditis, characterized by the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Relatively young adults (eg, age &lt;55) are most commonly affected.</li><li>The condition often remains asymptomatic and resolves without clinical detection.</li><li><strong>Heart failure</strong> is the most common symptomatic presentation.&nbsp; Decreased systolic function leads to ventricular dilation (eccentric hypertrophy) and may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy.</li><li><strong>Chest pain</strong> is sometimes the primary presenting symptom, which can mimic myocardial infarction.&nbsp; The chest pain is often <strong>sharp</strong> (rather than pressure-like with ischemic chest pain) and may be due to concomitant pericardial inflammation.</li><li><strong>Sudden cardiac death</strong> (SCD) can occasionally occur due to ventricular arrhythmia (ie, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation).</li><li>Some patients describe a viral prodrome (eg, fever, malaise, myalgia) that precedes the development of cardiac symptoms, but many have no such history.</li><li>Tachycardia may occasionally be the only clinical manifestation (unexplained tachycardia should raise suspicion for myocarditis).&nbsp; Frequent premature ventricular contractions causing palpitations can also occur.</li></ul><p>Unlike viral myocarditis, Lyme carditis and cardiac sarcoidosis tend to present with conduction system disruption, causing atrioventricular block and associated symptoms (eg, fatigue, dyspnea, light-headedness, syncope).</p><p>Many etiologies other than viral infection often have characteristic coincident manifestations in other organ systems (eg, gastrointestinal manifestations in Chagas myocarditis, pulmonary or systemic manifestations in tuberculosis and histoplasmosis/coccidioidomycosis myocarditis).</p><p>Laboratory and ECG findings include the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>A <strong>mild to moderate serum troponin</strong> elevation is typical, resulting from myocardial inflammation (and not from ischemic injury).&nbsp; The troponin elevation tends to persist for days to weeks (or longer), in contrast with the relatively abrupt rise and fall associated with ischemic injury.</li><li><strong>Inflammatory markers</strong>, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, are usually elevated but are nonspecific.</li><li>In viral myocarditis, ECG typically shows nonspecific ST-segment changes.&nbsp; In Lyme carditis and cardiac sarcoidosis, ECG may reveal varying degrees of atrioventricular block.</li></ul><h1>Diagnosis</h1><p>The diagnosis of myocarditis is based on a consistent clinical presentation combined with imaging findings.&nbsp; Occasionally, endomyocardial biopsy is necessary.</p><h2>Echocardiography </h2><p>Echocardiography is performed in all patients with suspected myocarditis.&nbsp; The classic finding in viral myocarditis presenting with heart failure is <strong>dilation of all 4 cardiac chambers</strong> with <strong>diffuse hypokinesis of the ventricular walls</strong>.&nbsp; However, hypokinesis can often be segmental rather than diffuse.&nbsp; In patients with heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction can be mildly, moderately, or severely depressed.&nbsp; The ejection fraction may be normal in patients with relatively mild symptoms, but some degree of ventricular hypokinesis is often present despite an absence of heart failure symptoms (eg, chest pain only).</p><h2>Cardiac MRI with gadolinium contrast </h2><p>A cardiac MRI with gadolinium contrast is highly useful in diagnosing myocarditis because it can demonstrate a characteristic enhancement pattern.&nbsp; Gadolinium undergoes prolonged retention in areas of the myocardium with active inflammation (eg, edema) or fibrosis.&nbsp; In myocarditis, inflammation occurs primarily within the epicardium and midwall, resulting in enhancement of those regions (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L124987.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; These findings are particularly useful in patients with segmental hypokinesis that mimics ischemic heart disease because ischemic heart disease typically causes subendocardial or transmural fibrosis, leading to a different enhancement pattern.&nbsp; The global extent of gadolinium enhancement is also a strong predictor of mortality in patients with myocarditis.<p></p><h2>Endomyocardial biopsy </h2><p>Endomyocardial biopsy is deferred in most patients because it is invasive and the diagnosis can be confirmed via clinical presentation and imaging findings.&nbsp; In addition, the diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy can be relatively low (&lt;30%), likely due to random variability in sampling (eg, the tissue may be taken from an area not substantially affected by disease).&nbsp; Endomyocardial biopsy should be performed in patients with suspected myocarditis and fulminant (rapidly progressive) heart failure because the potential benefits of securing a firm diagnosis (eg, initiating glucocorticoids or other immunosuppression for rheumatologic myocarditis) outweigh the risks of the procedure.&nbsp; When a biopsy is collected, viral PCR testing of the sample may aid in the diagnosis.</p><h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Myocardial infarction</strong>:&nbsp; presents with chest pain, serum troponin elevation, and wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography (usually segmental).&nbsp; The nature of the chest pain helps in the differentiation (sharp in myocarditis vs pressure-like in myocardial infarction).&nbsp; Highly elevated serum troponin with an abrupt rise and fall favors myocardial infarction.&nbsp; Cardiac MRI can help differentiate myocarditis from ischemic heart disease.</li><li><strong>Acute pericarditis</strong>:&nbsp; presents with sharp chest pain and often coexists with myocarditis due to the proximity of the pericardium to the myocardium and shared underlying etiologies (eg, viral infection).&nbsp; The distinction between isolated pericarditis, isolated myocarditis, and coexistence of the 2 conditions is important because it affects the decision to treat with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).&nbsp; Serum troponin elevation and ventricular wall hypokinesis on echocardiography suggest inflammatory involvement of the myocardium and not the pericardium alone.</li><li><strong>Stress cardiomyopathy (</strong><em><strong>Takotsubo</strong></em>&nbsp;<strong>cardiomyopathy)</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45444.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; presents with chest pain, troponin elevation, and ventricular wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography.&nbsp; However, the wall motion abnormalities usually follow a characteristic pattern of apical hypokinesis (ballooning) with basilar hyperkinesis.&nbsp; A recent stressor is a risk factor, and postmenopausal women are most commonly affected.</li></ul><h1>Complications</h1><p>The most common long-term complication of myocarditis is <strong>heart failure with persistent systolic dysfunction</strong> that does not resolve over time and progresses to <strong>chronic dilated cardiomyopathy</strong>.&nbsp; A small percentage of patients have fulminant heart failure and cardiogenic shock on presentation, with a high rate of acute mortality.&nbsp; SCD due to ventricular arrhythmia can occur in the early stages of myocarditis or later as a complication of dilated cardiomyopathy.</p><h1>Management</h1><p>The management of viral myocarditis is primarily <strong>supportive</strong> and aims to stabilize the patient's condition and minimize disease progression while allowing time for recovery.&nbsp; In patients with heart failure, the standard treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (eg, diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockers, beta blockers) is appropriate.&nbsp; A temporary ventricular assist device may be necessary in patients with severe heart failure.&nbsp; Patients who develop chronic dilated cardiomyopathy likely eventually require cardiac transplantation.</p><p>In all patients with myocarditis, the following should be <strong>avoided</strong> to minimize patient risk:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>NSAIDs are contraindicated because they may worsen myocarditis disease progression.&nbsp; Because NSAIDs are the first-line treatment for acute pericarditis, myocardial involvement should be ruled out before initiating treatment for pericarditis.</li><li>Alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized because it may worsen myocarditis disease progression.</li><li>Vigorous exercise should be avoided because it may encourage ventricular arrhythmias and increase the risk for SCD.&nbsp; Competitive athletes should undergo a comprehensive evaluation (ie, echocardiography, Holter monitoring, exercise stress testing) following presumed recovery from myocarditis prior to returning to play.</li></ul><p>Other causes of myocarditis have specific treatments targeted at the underlying etiology (eg, ceftriaxone for Lyme carditis, glucocorticoids for cardiac sarcoidosis or other rheumatologic myocarditis).</p><h1>Prognosis</h1><p>Considering that many cases of viral myocarditis resolve without clinical detection, most patients likely achieve full or near-full recovery.&nbsp; In patients with heart failure due to viral myocarditis, many achieve a full or at least partial recovery with supportive care, but some have persistent disease and develop chronic dilated cardiomyopathy.&nbsp; The prognosis for other causes of myocarditis is variable and is largely dependent on the extent of myocardial damage that takes place prior to effective treatment.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Myocarditis is an inflammatory condition of the myocardium that can be triggered by both infectious and noninfectious causes, with viral infection being the most common.&nbsp; The clinical presentation depends on the underlying etiology.&nbsp; Viral myocarditis defines the classic clinical presentation, which is highly variable with heart failure being the most common symptomatic presentation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31110.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Diagnostic evaluation involves a combination of clinical assessment and imaging studies; echocardiography should be performed in all patients, and cardiac MRI can be useful in identifying characteristic enhancement patterns.&nbsp; Treatment is primarily supportive; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alcohol intake, and vigorous exercise should be avoided.&nbsp; Most patients likely recover fully, but some develop chronic dilated caridiomyopathy or experience other serious complications (eg, sudden cardiac death).<p></p></div>\n            "
