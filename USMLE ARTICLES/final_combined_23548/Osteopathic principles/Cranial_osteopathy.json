An understanding of the mechanics of the <strong>sphenobasilar synchondrosis (SBS)</strong> and the craniosacral cycle is important.&nbsp; This article explores cranial mechanics, the diagnosis of SBS dysfunctions, and cranial OMT techniques.</p>\n<h1>The SBS and the craniosacral cycle</h1><br><br><p>The SBS is the junction of the sphenoid with the basilar part of the occipital bone at the cranial base and allows for extremely subtle movements during the craniosacral cycle.&nbsp; The sacral base (upper sacrum) is linked to the SBS via a continuous layer of dura that extends along the spinal canal.&nbsp; Biomechanical forces generated by the inherent motion of the brain and spinal cord cause rhythmic movement of the dura and CSF (ie, <strong>cranial rhythmic impulse</strong> [CRI]).&nbsp; These forces are transmitted between the cranium and sacrum, resulting in craniosacral flexion and extension.</p><br><br><p>During <strong>craniosacral flexion</strong>, the SBS moves cephalad (superiorly), producing the following effects (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L75112.jpg\" alt=\"Sphenobasilar synchondrosis SBS\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">Sphenobasilar synchondrosis SBS</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The spinal dura is pulled upward.&nbsp; Because the dura is attached to the sacral base, the <strong>sacrum counternutates</strong> (rotates backward), resulting in <strong>posterior</strong> movement of the <strong>sacral base</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>The temporal and parietal bones (paired bones) externally rotate.&nbsp; This decreases the anteroposterior (AP) diameter and increases the transverse diameter of the cranium, resulting in \"shortening and widening\" of the head.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>During <strong>craniosacral extension</strong>, the SBS moves caudad (inferiorly), producing the following effects (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L75111.jpg\" alt=\"Sphenobasilar synchondrosis SBS\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">Sphenobasilar synchondrosis SBS</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The spinal dura is pushed downward.&nbsp; Because the dura is attached to the sacral base, the <strong>sacrum nutates</strong> (rotates forward), resulting in <strong>anterior</strong> movement of the sacral base.</li>\n\t<li>The temporal and parietal bones (paired bones) internally rotate.&nbsp; This increases the AP diameter and decreases the transverse diameter of the cranium, resulting in \"lengthening and narrowing\" of the head.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Cranial vault hold</h1><br><br><p>The cranial vault hold is a technique used to diagnose dysfunctions at the SBS.&nbsp; It involves specific hand contacts that allow evaluation of inherent cranial mobility and alterations in the CRI.&nbsp; The cranial vault hold is performed as follows:</p><br><br><ol class=\"article-body-ordered-list\" type=\"1\">\n\t<li>The patient lies supine with the physician seated at the head of the table.</li>\n\t<li>The physician cradles the patient's head with both hands.</li>\n\t<li>The fingers are spread to contact specific areas of the cranium:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>The <strong>little fingers</strong> rest along the <strong>occipital</strong> base.</li>\n\t\t<li>The ring fingers contact the temporal bones at the mastoid processes.</li>\n\t\t<li>The middle fingers rest on the temporal bone in front of the ear.</li>\n\t\t<li>The <strong>index fingers</strong> rest at the <strong>greater wings of the sphenoid</strong>.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The physician then carefully feels for subtle motion patterns.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>SBS dysfunction</h1><br><br><p>The cranial vault hold is used to diagnose SBS dysfunctions, both symmetric (flexion, extension) and asymmetric (sidebending/rotation, vertical strain, lateral strain, compression).</p>\n<h2>Flexion and extension dysfunctions</h2><br><br><p>Flexion and extension dysfunctions are characterized by disruption of normal craniosacral flexion and extension where 1 of these movements is limited.&nbsp; This occurs due to impaired SBS movement about the <strong>transverse axis</strong>.&nbsp; Because craniosacral flexion and extension are linked to sacral movement, sacral changes are also noted on palpation.&nbsp; Findings include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Flexion dysfunction</strong>:&nbsp; The sphenoid and occiput move <strong>cephalad</strong> (superiorly).&nbsp; The head remains shortened and widened.&nbsp; Bilaterally <strong>shallow sacral sulci</strong> are present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Extension dysfunction</strong>:&nbsp; The sphenoid and occiput move <strong>caudad</strong> (inferiorly).&nbsp; The head remains lengthened and narrowed.&nbsp; Bilaterally <strong>deep sacral sulci</strong> are present.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Torsion dysfunction</h2><br><br><p>Torsion dysfunction is characterized by twisting of the sphenoid and occiput as they <strong>rotate in opposite</strong> directions about the AP axis.&nbsp; As a result, 1 side of the sphenoid moves superiorly while the other side moves inferiorly.&nbsp; Diagnostic nomenclature is based on the movement of the <strong>greater wing</strong> of the sphenoid (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L75051.jpg\" alt=\"Sphenobasilar synchondrosis SBS\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">Sphenobasilar synchondrosis SBS</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; During the vault hold, the <strong>index finger elevates</strong> while the <strong>little finger depresses</strong> on the side of torsion.&nbsp; Elevation of the right greater wing indicates right torsion, whereas elevation of the left greater wing indicates left torsion.<p></p>\n<h2>Sidebending/rotation dysfunction</h2><br><br><p>Sidebending/rotation dysfunction involves simultaneous, coupled movements of the sphenoid and occiput that:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Sidebend away</strong> from each other (due to rotation in the same direction about 2 vertical axes).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rotate in the same direction</strong> (due to rotation in the same direction about the AP axis).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Diagnosis is made based on the side of convexity (fullness and widening) during the vault hold, with the side of fullness indicating the side of dysfunction.&nbsp; Left sidebending/rotation dysfunction is characterized by a more inferior occiput and more inferior greater wing of the sphenoid on the left (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L75124.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Right sidebending/rotation dysfunction involves the opposite pattern.<p></p>\n<h2>Vertical strain</h2><br><br><p>Vertical strains occur when the sphenoid and occiput move in <strong>opposite vertical directions</strong>.&nbsp; This occurs when these structures <strong>rotate in the same direction</strong> about 2 transverse axes (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L79231.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In a superior vertical strain, the sphenoid moves superiorly relative to the occiput; in an inferior vertical strain, the sphenoid moves inferiorly.&nbsp; On cranial vault examination, the index and little fingers move in opposite directions vertically.<p></p>\n<h2>Lateral strain</h2><br><br><p>Lateral strains occur when the sphenoid and occiput move in <strong>opposite lateral directions</strong>.&nbsp; This occurs when these structures <strong>rotate in the same direction</strong> about 2 vertical axes (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L79175.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In a right lateral strain, the sphenoid moves to the right relative to the occiput; in a left lateral strain, the sphenoid moves to the left.&nbsp; On cranial vault examination, the head feels shaped like a parallelogram (ie, one of the physician's arms pronates while the other supinates).<p></p>\n<h2>Compression</h2><br><br><p>Compression of the SBS occurs when the sphenoid and occiput are pushed together (typically following <strong>trauma</strong>) along the AP axis.&nbsp; This eliminates normal flexion, extension, and torsion motion (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L75115.jpg\" alt=\"Sphenobasilar synchondrosis SBS\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">Sphenobasilar synchondrosis SBS</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The head feels dense and rigid under the hands, often with a significant <strong>decrease in CRI amplitude and/or frequency</strong>.<p></p>\n<h1>Diagnostic algorithms</h1><br><br><p>Applying the algorithms in the following flowcharts can aid in diagnosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L74291.png\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L74292.png\" alt=\"figure 9\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 9</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L74293.png\" alt=\"figure 10\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 10</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Cranial osteopathic techniques</h1><h2>Compression of the fourth ventricle</h2><br><br><p>Compression of the fourth ventricle (CV4) is performed by gently cradling the occiput with the thenar eminences while allowing the fingers to rest lightly along the sides of the cranium.&nbsp; The physician applies <strong>gentle medial and upward pressure</strong> toward the foramen magnum, encouraging a still point—a palpable cessation of the CRI—followed by a softening and return of normal motion.&nbsp; CV4 is commonly utilized to help reduce sympathetic overactivity, <strong>promote parasympathetic tone</strong>, and facilitate overall autonomic balance.</p><br><br><p>It is often indicated for patients experiencing headaches, stress, or insomnia, and after significant trauma such as childbirth.&nbsp; By influencing CSF flow and enhancing the craniosacral rhythm, CV4 may support CNS homeostasis and improve systemic health.&nbsp; In neonates and infants, CV4 may also be employed to promote calming and assist in conditions related to nervous system dysregulation.</p>\n<h2>V-spread technique</h2><br><br><p>V-spread is performed by placing two fingers in a V shape over a cranial suture while applying gentle pressure at a distant point with the opposite hand to <strong>encourage suture release</strong>.&nbsp; Micromovements are induced to restore physiologic motion between cranial bones.</p><br><br><p>It is commonly used to treat suture dysfunctions from trauma, birth, or mechanical compression.&nbsp; V-spread enhances venous and lymphatic drainage and can help with sinus congestion, cranial nerve entrapments, and facial pain.&nbsp; It is particularly effective in infants due to their flexible cranial sutures.</p>\n<h2>Occipital condyle decompression</h2><br><br><p>Occipital condyle decompression is performed by gently cradling the occiput with the index fingers while supporting the patient's head in a supine position.&nbsp; Gentle <strong>lateral and cephalad pressure</strong> is applied along the condyles until a softening or release of tension is palpated.&nbsp; This technique is particularly indicated in neonates who exhibit <strong>difficulty latching</strong> during breastfeeding (after ruling out anatomic causes such as cleft palate, cleft lip, or maternal nipple inversion).</p><br><br><p>During the birth process, compressive forces on the occiput may distort the condyles, leading to functional impairments of the cranial nerves that exit through the hypoglossal canal and jugular foramen.&nbsp; Dysfunction can affect:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The <strong>hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)</strong>:&nbsp; Impaired tongue movement.</li>\n\t<li>The glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) nerves:&nbsp; Impaired swallowing, gag reflex, and autonomic regulation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Venous sinus drainage</h2><br><br><p>Venous sinus drainage is performed by sequentially applying gentle traction and pressure over key cranial sutures and sinus regions (occipital, transverse, straight, sagittal, and cavernous sinuses) to <strong>enhance venous outflow from the cranium</strong>.</p><br><br><p>Indications include cranial congestion, headache, chronic sinusitis, and posttraumatic brain injuries.&nbsp; By promoting venous drainage, this technique can reduce intracranial pressure, improve cerebral perfusion, and facilitate overall cranial homeostasis.&nbsp; It is also beneficial in neonates after complicated deliveries where cranial molding may impair venous return.</p>\n<h2>Temporal rocking</h2><br><br><p>Temporal rocking is performed by placing the fingertips lightly over the squamous portions of the temporal bones and applying gentle alternating pressure to encourage balanced motion.&nbsp; The physician follows the natural external and internal rotation of the bones without forcing movement.</p><br><br><p>This technique is used to address <strong>dysfunctions affecting the middle and inner ear</strong> (eg, tinnitus, vertigo, eustachian tube dysfunction).&nbsp; In infants, temporal rocking can help correct compressive birth forces impacting the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) and improve middle ear drainage, reducing the risk of otitis media.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Cranial osteopathy is a specialized form of osteopathic manipulative treatment used to influence cranial bone motion, dural tension, cerebrospinal fluid flow, and sacral dynamics via the sphenobasilar synchondrosis.&nbsp; At the core of cranial mechanics is the craniosacral cycle, wherein rhythmic pulsations from the brain and spinal cord generate coordinated movements in the cranium and sacrum, detectable as the cranial rhythmic impulse.&nbsp; The cranial vault hold is the key diagnostic technique used to assess sphenobasilar synchondrosis mobility and identify dysfunctions—categorized as flexion/extension, torsion, sidebending/rotation, vertical strain, lateral strain, or compression—based on bone movement patterns and changes in cranial rhythmic impulse.</p><br><br><p>Treatment methods include compression of the fourth ventricle (to restore autonomic balance), V-spread (to improve suture mobility and drainage), occipital condyle decompression (to relieve cranial nerve dysfunction in infants), venous sinus drainage (to enhance intracranial circulation), and temporal rocking (to support auditory and vestibular health).&nbsp; These techniques are especially beneficial in neonates and individuals with cranial trauma, nervous system imbalance, or cranial nerve impairments, with the goal of restoring physiologic motion and systemic equilibrium.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
