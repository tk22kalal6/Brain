OMT integrates precise anatomic knowledge with hands-on therapeutic interventions to address somatic dysfunction.&nbsp; This article provides a general overview of key OMT techniques, including muscle energy; high-velocity low-amplitude; counterstrain; facilitated positional release; Still technique; balanced ligamentous tension; and lymphatic techniques.</p>\n<h1>Direct versus indirect techniques</h1><br><br><p>OMT is broadly classified into direct and indirect techniques, depending on how the physician engages the restrictive barrier (ie, where further movement is prematurely \"stuck\") of dysfunctional tissues:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Direct</strong> techniques:&nbsp; Involve moving the restricted structure <strong>toward the barrier of restriction</strong>.&nbsp; They often require more physical force and patient participation and are typically used when the tissues are not acutely inflamed or overly sensitive.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Indirect</strong> techniques:&nbsp; Involve moving the dysfunctional tissue <strong>away from the barrier of restriction</strong> and into a position of ease.&nbsp; These are typically gentler and often better suited for acute conditions or patients with heightened pain sensitivity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Active versus passive</h1><br><br><p>OMT techniques are also classified based on the level of patient involvement required:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Active</strong> techniques:&nbsp; Require patient participation and voluntary muscle contraction.&nbsp; The patient actively engages in movements or muscle contractions as guided by the physician.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Passive</strong> techniques:&nbsp; Require minimal to no patient effort, relying entirely on the physician's actions.&nbsp; The patient remains relaxed while the physician applies specific forces or positions the patient passively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Muscle energy</h1><br><br><p>Muscle energy techniques (METs) involve active muscle contraction by the patient against a counterforce applied by the physician.&nbsp; The type of muscle contraction performed by the patient is called <strong>isometric contraction</strong>, in which a muscle contracts without changing length, producing tension without movement (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L77695.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; METs utilize <strong>postisometric relaxation</strong>, in which the muscle experiences a period of reduced tone after a sustained isometric contraction lasting 3-5 seconds.&nbsp; These techniques restore mobility, reduce muscle tension, and reestablish joint alignment.&nbsp; METs can be performed directly or indirectly.<p></p>\n<h2>Direct muscle energy</h2><br><br><p>Direct MET engages the muscle contraction directly <strong>against the restrictive barrier</strong>.&nbsp; The physician positions the patient at the restrictive barrier and instructs the patient to perform a specific isometric contraction against resistance, held for 3-5 seconds, followed by relaxation and passive repositioning into a new restrictive barrier (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73126.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This is repeated multiple times to achieve optimal range of motion using postisometric relaxation.<p></p><br><br><p>For example, an innominate outflare somatic dysfunction can be corrected by resisting the patient's hip rotation in the direction opposite to the restricted movement.</p>\n<h2>Indirect muscle energy</h2><br><br><p>Indirect MET moves <strong>away from the restrictive barrier</strong> into a position of ease, utilizing reciprocal inhibition (when an agonist muscle contracts, its antagonist automatically relaxes) or postisometric relaxation.&nbsp; It is particularly beneficial in acute or highly sensitive conditions, where direct pressure might be too painful.</p><br><br><p>For example, acute lumbar muscle spasm can be treated by positioning muscles in their direction of ease and engaging the antagonistic muscles gently to induce relaxation of the spasming muscle.</p>\n<h1>High-velocity low-amplitude</h1><br><br><p>High-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) techniques involve the application of a brief, controlled, and rapid force to move a joint past its restrictive barrier (ie, <strong>direct</strong>), correcting misalignments and restoring functional mobility (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73489.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The hallmark of this technique is its speed rather than force.<p></p><br><br><p>For example, treatment of a thoracic vertebra with restricted rotation can involve precise positioning followed by a quick, shallow thrust that realigns the vertebral segment, improving spinal mechanics immediately.&nbsp; Contraindications for HVLA techniques are shown in the following table (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/69247.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Myofascial release</h1><br><br><p>Myofascial release is a versatile technique that can be applied either directly or indirectly to release restrictions within the fascial system.&nbsp; Fascia is the connective tissue that envelops muscles, organs, and other structures, and restrictions in this tissue can contribute to pain, dysfunction, and decreased mobility.&nbsp; Myofascial release involves palpating the affected area and applying a sustained, gentle pressure or stretch until a release is felt.&nbsp; The physician may follow or gently oppose tissue motion, depending on the desired therapeutic effect.</p><br><br><p>For example, congestion/edema found in sinusitis and otitis media (ear infection) can be treated using the Galbreath technique to facilitate patency of the Eustachian tube and increase lymphatic drainage through the preauricular and parotid lymph nodes.&nbsp; To perform the Galbreath technique, the physician applies slow, repetitive anterior and medial traction to the mandible (increasing displacement at the temporomandibular joint) for several minutes.</p><br><br><p>Myofascial release techniques can also effectively modulate autonomic function by targeting specific ganglia throughout the body.&nbsp; The superior ganglia release technique (T10 through T11) and inferior ganglia release technique (T12 through L2) both reduce sympathetic tone, affecting the jejunum to midtransverse colon and lower gastrointestinal tract, respectively.&nbsp; These applications make myofascial release particularly valuable for conditions such as postoperative ileus and constipation.&nbsp; Visceral autonomic innervation and additional techniques are discussed in more detail in a separate article.</p>\n<h1>Articulatory techniques</h1><br><br><p>Articulatory techniques are direct, passive osteopathic manipulative methods involving rhythmic, repetitive movements that guide a joint through its full range of motion.&nbsp; The primary goal is to gradually increase mobility, reduce restrictions, and restore normal joint function.&nbsp; The physician employs controlled, low-velocity movements to repeatedly approach and disengage the restriction, enhancing local circulation and reducing muscle tension and joint stiffness.</p><br><br><p>For example, rib raising involves applying rhythmic lifting motions to the rib cage, repeatedly engaging restrictive barriers around the costovertebral joints.&nbsp; This repetitive mobilization gradually reduces restrictions, improving rib cage compliance, respiratory mechanics, and lymphatic drainage.&nbsp; Another example is the Spencer technique, which is used for adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73767.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Counterstrain</h1><br><br><p>Counterstrain is a gentle, <strong>indirect</strong> technique designed to relieve musculoskeletal pain by passively placing the affected area into a position of maximum comfort.&nbsp; This reduces inappropriate proprioceptive feedback, muscle spasm, and the sensitivity of <strong>tender points</strong>—palpable areas of localized tenderness associated with dysfunctional segments.&nbsp; The therapeutic effect is believed to occur as a result of <strong>resetting muscle spindle</strong> activity, which regulates muscle tone and reflex contraction.</p><br><br><p>For example, a tender point in the psoas muscle is treated by positioning the patient's hip into flexion until pain diminishes significantly (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L77915.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The position is held comfortably for about 90 seconds to allow the muscle spindles to reset.&nbsp; Tender points and counterstrain are discussed in more detail in a separate article.<p></p>\n<h1>Facilitated positional release</h1><br><br><p>Facilitated positional release quickly reduces muscle hypertonicity and restores mobility through <strong>indirect</strong> myofascial release.&nbsp; The technique involves placing the body in a neutral position, followed by applying an activating force such as compression or torsion, facilitating immediate muscle relaxation.</p><br><br><p>For example, cervical muscle spasm can be effectively addressed by performing the following steps:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>First, move the affected cervical joint into the neutral position and apply a facilitative force (eg, axial compression), which relaxes the surrounding tissues and allows for easier manipulation.</li>\n\t<li>Then, move the joint into a position of ease (ie, in the direction that it is \"stuck\") while maintaining the facilitative force to shorten and further relax the affected hypertonic muscles.</li>\n\t<li>Last, hold the hypertonic muscles in this shortened position for several seconds, which causes release of muscle tension by decreasing input to the muscle spindles (the spindles normally activate muscle contraction in response to increases in muscle fiber length).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Still technique</h1><br><br><p>Still technique is a unique osteopathic method that <strong>combines both indirect and direct</strong> components in a fluid <strong>sequence</strong>.&nbsp; The physician begins by positioning the affected area in a position of ease (indirect) and introducing a compressive or torsional force.&nbsp; While maintaining this force, the physician slowly guides the tissue through the path of least resistance back toward the restrictive barrier (direct), facilitating release and improved motion.&nbsp; The technique is subtle, efficient, and well tolerated, even in patients with acute pain.</p><br><br><p>For example, a lumbar segment with rotational dysfunction is first placed in a position of comfort, after which compression is applied along the spinal axis, and the segment is gently moved through its range of motion toward the restriction.</p>\n<h1>Balanced ligamentous tension</h1><br><br><p>Balanced ligamentous tension (BLT) utilizes gentle and precise positioning to equalize ligamentous tension around joints.&nbsp; It is an <strong>indirect</strong> technique that facilitates the body's intrinsic self-corrective mechanisms by holding tissues at their point of balance.</p><br><br><p>For example, a sacroiliac joint dysfunction may be treated by carefully adjusting the joint until ligamentous tensions feel equally balanced.&nbsp; The physician holds this position gently, allowing inherent physiologic mechanisms to realign tissues and reduce tension naturally.</p>\n<h1>Lymphatic techniques</h1><br><br><p>Lymphatic techniques involve the rhythmic pumping or release of fascial diaphragms to augment the body's intrinsic fluid movement.&nbsp; They are especially useful in conditions such as congestion, edema, or infection, where clearing fluids and boosting immune cell transport are desired.&nbsp; Commonly used lymphatic techniques include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Thoracic pump</strong>:&nbsp; The physician applies rhythmic pressure to the patient's sternum or lower rib cage, creating pressure changes that enhance lymphatic and venous return.&nbsp; Benefits include improved lymph flow, mobilization of lymphocytes, clearance of pulmonary secretions, and reduction of upper body edema.&nbsp; This technique stimulates deep breathing and improves chest wall compliance.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Abdominal pump</strong>:&nbsp; Rhythmic compression over the abdomen enhances lymphatic drainage from abdominal organs and lower extremities.&nbsp; This technique increases thoracic duct lymph flow and releases immune cells from mesenteric lymph nodes.&nbsp; It supports immune function during infections and relieves organ congestion.&nbsp; The motion can stimulate intestinal peristalsis to improve postsurgical bowel function.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pedal pump</strong>:&nbsp; The physician grasps the supine patient's feet and rhythmically dorsiflexes them, creating an oscillatory wave through the body that encourages lymphatic and venous return from the legs.&nbsp; This gentle technique reduces peripheral edema, improves cardiac preload, and stimulates full-body lymphatic flow.&nbsp; The approach is particularly useful for the prevention of stasis in patients who are postoperative or bedridden.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Restrictions should be addressed in <strong>sequence from central to peripheral</strong>, as demonstrated by the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Thoracic inlet release</strong>:&nbsp; All lymphatic drainage must pass through the thoracic inlet (ie, superior thoracic aperture; formed by T1, the first ribs, and the manubrium) before reentering the venous circulation.&nbsp; Therefore, myofascial release to the thoracic inlet should be completed prior to other lymphatic treatments to decrease any restrictions and increase the overall lymphatic drainage from the entire body (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L73624.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Promote respiratory-assisted lymphatic flow</strong>:&nbsp; After thoracic inlet release, the next step is to maximize efficient movement of the diaphragm and ribs to facilitate respiratory-assisted lymphatic drainage.&nbsp; Diaphragm motion can be enhanced by <strong>doming the diaphragm</strong> and mobilizing soft tissue at the inferior thoracic aperture (formed by T12, ribs 11 and 12, and the xiphoid process).&nbsp; Techniques that improve thoracic spine motion and rib cage compliance (eg, rib raising, thoracic pump) also maximize respiratory-assisted lymphatic flow.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Peripheral pump techniques</strong>:&nbsp; Once the thoracic inlet and diaphragm are free of restrictions, peripheral lymphatic pump techniques are performed to increase lymphatic return from different areas of the body.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Contraindications to lymphatic techniques include severe localized <strong>infection</strong> (could potentially spread infection), <strong>decompensated heart failure</strong> (increased venous return), and <strong>malignancy</strong> (could facilitate metastasis).</p>\n<h1>Clinical applications</h1><br><br><p>OMT is clinically effective for a wide range of conditions (particularly those involving somatic dysfunction), including the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Musculoskeletal pain</strong>:&nbsp; Low back pain, neck pain, and joint dysfunctions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Headaches</strong>:&nbsp; Tension-type and cervicogenic headaches.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Respiratory disorders</strong>:&nbsp; Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia (improving rib mechanics and lymphatic drainage).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gastrointestinal issues</strong>:&nbsp; Postoperative ileus (restoration of visceral autonomic function).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lymphatic and circulatory conditions</strong>:&nbsp; Edema and immune system support.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic stress and autonomic imbalance</strong>:&nbsp; Techniques that influence parasympathetic/sympathetic tone.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>OMT is tailored to each patient's clinical presentation, level of discomfort, and sensitivity to manipulation, and techniques are often combined in a single session for maximum benefit.</p><br><br><p><strong>Treatment sequencing</strong> is a strategic aspect of OMT.&nbsp; Sessions generally begin with gentle, indirect methods (eg, counterstrain, BLT) to reduce muscle tone and discomfort.&nbsp; This prepares tissues for more direct interventions (eg, direct muscle energy, HVLA).&nbsp; The session may conclude with lymphatic techniques to support lymphatic clearance and recovery.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is a hands-on approach that restores structural and functional balance by engaging the body's self-healing mechanisms.&nbsp; Techniques are classified as direct (moving toward the restriction) or indirect (moving away from the restriction), with clinical application tailored to tissue sensitivity and dysfunction.&nbsp; Techniques are summarized in the following table (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/76371.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; OMT is effective at treating musculoskeletal pain, headaches, respiratory and gastrointestinal dysfunctions, and somatic manifestations of stress.&nbsp; Sequencing typically begins with indirect methods, progresses to direct techniques, and concludes with lymphatic drainage to maximize physiologic benefit.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
