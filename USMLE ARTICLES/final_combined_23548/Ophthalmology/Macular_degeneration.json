AMD is classified into dry (atrophic) and wet (neovascular) subtypes.&nbsp; The dry form typically affects both eyes and has an insidious onset.&nbsp; By contrast, the wet form is associated with a more rapid and aggressive course that requires prompt treatment.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Age &gt;50</li>\n\t<li>Smoking (most significant modifiable risk factor)</li>\n\t<li>Genetic predisposition/family history</li>\n\t<li>Low dietary intake of antioxidants (eg, fruits, vegetables)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Anatomy</h1><br><br><p>The macula is the portion of the retina responsible for central vision.&nbsp; In the macula, each cone synapses to a single bipolar cell that synapses to a single ganglion cell (in contrast to the peripheral retina, where multiple cones converge onto a single ganglion cell).&nbsp; Because of this arrangement, visual acuity (sharpness, contrast) and metabolic activity are greater in the macula than in any other area of the retina.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>AMD is a complex and multifactorial condition that involves degeneration of the retinal photoreceptors of the macula.&nbsp; It is separated into dry (most common) and wet subtypes, which are differentiated by their pathogenesis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27250.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Dry (atrophic) AMD </h2><br><br><p>Chronic oxidative injury, which occurs with normal aging (and is exacerbated by smoking), preferentially damages the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the outermost layer of the retina that transports nutrients from the choroid to the photoreceptors and metabolizes retinal waste products.&nbsp; RPE damage/dysfunction causes lipid and protein waste (ie, drusen) to build up between the retina and the choroid.&nbsp; These drusen deposits create chronic inflammation and limit nutrient delivery to the retina, leading to death of the overlying photoreceptors.&nbsp; The metabolically active macula is preferentially affected, thereby resulting in <strong>gradual reduction</strong> in central visual acuity.</p>\n<h2>Wet (neovascular) AMD</h2><br><br><p>Progressive waste product accumulation (eg, drusen deposits) can eventually result in retinal hypoxia, which stimulates local vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.&nbsp; VEGF causes <strong>neovascularization</strong> (ie, formation of new, abnormal blood vessels) underneath the retina, and also increases vascular permeability, making these new vessels prone to leakage.&nbsp; Subretinal fluid/hemorrhage disrupts photoreceptor function and eventually creates fibrosis/atrophy of the macula; it also increases the risk of retinal detachment.&nbsp; Vision loss in wet AMD is typically <strong>severe</strong> and <strong>rapidly progressive</strong> (within days to weeks).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Although patients may initially be asymptomatic, the clinical manifestations of macular damage include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Painless loss of fine, central visual acuity</strong>:&nbsp;

used to detect neovascularization in wet AMD and highlight areas of leakage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>There are currently no available treatments to halt or reverse retinal damage from dry AMD, though the following interventions may delay onset or slow progression:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Smoking cessation</strong></li>\n\t<li>Antioxidant-rich diet:&nbsp; green leafy vegetables and fish (eg, Mediterranean diet), which may decrease the risk of developing advanced AMD</li>\n\t<li>Nutritional supplements (eg, vitamins C and E, zinc, copper, lutein), which may help slow progression in intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye, though evidence is limited</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Wet AMD requires urgent intervention once identified as treatment improves visual outcomes.&nbsp; The mainstay of treatment is <strong>anti-VEGF therapy</strong>.&nbsp; In this treatment, intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents (eg, ranibizumab, bevacizumab) inhibit the growth of abnormal blood vessels and reduce vascular leakage, improving or stabilizing vision.&nbsp; Laser photocoagulation is another treatment for neovascularization in wet AMD.&nbsp; However, it is used less frequently because anti-VEGF therapy is so effective.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of AMD depends on the type and stage of the disease:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Dry AMD:&nbsp; vision loss is typically gradual and less severe than wet AMD.&nbsp; However, disease progression results in irreversible visual impairment.</li>\n\t<li>Wet AMD:&nbsp; without treatment, wet AMD can lead to rapid and severe central vision loss.&nbsp; With anti-VEGF therapy, many patients experience stabilization or improvement in vision, but regular treatment is often necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Smoking is the leading modifiable risk factor for AMD.&nbsp; Maintaining a healthy diet rich in vitamins and antioxidants may also provide some protective benefits.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Macular degeneration is a leading cause of vision loss, particularly in older adults (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/101551.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Injury to photoreceptors in the macula leads to progressive central vision loss.&nbsp; Dry AMD is the most common subtype and occurs due to the deposition of drusen beneath the retinal pigment epithelium.&nbsp; Although it progresses slowly over years, there is no effective treatment at this time.&nbsp; Wet AMD causes rapid vision loss due to neovascularization and subretinal fluid accumulation from VEGF production.&nbsp; Treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections improves visual outcomes.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
