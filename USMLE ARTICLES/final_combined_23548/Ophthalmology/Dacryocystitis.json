Symptoms include tenderness, erythema, and edema over the inferior medial canthus; purulent discharge may be expressed from the eyelid puncta.&nbsp; Treatment of acute infection involves warm compresses, lacrimal sac massage, and antibiotics.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The lacrimal system is responsible for draining tears from the eye into the nasal cavity (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L83998.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Dacryocystitis occurs when the nasolacrimal duct becomes obstructed and tears back up into the lacrimal sac.&nbsp; Stagnation of fluid within the sac creates an environment conducive to bacterial growth.&nbsp; Common pathogens implicated in dacryocystitis include <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>.<p></p><br><br><p>Several factors increase the risk for lacrimal gland obstruction and dacryocystitis, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (dacryostenosis)</li>\n\t<li>Aging (may cause narrowing of the puncta)</li>\n\t<li>History of trauma to the face or nose (eg, nasoethmoid fracture)</li>\n\t<li>Previous endonasal or endoscopic sinus surgery</li>\n\t<li>Chronic rhinosinusitis</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The clinical presentation of dacryocystitis may include (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11865.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pain, erythema, swelling</strong>, and tenderness <strong>over the lacrimal sac/medial canthus</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Mucopurulent discharge from the puncta</strong></li>\n\t<li>Excessive tearing (epiphora)</li>\n\t<li>Fever and systemic symptoms (in severe cases)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Dacryocystitis is typically a clinical diagnosis made primarily on history and physical examination findings.&nbsp;

an infection involving the soft tissue surrounding the eye, which presents with diffuse (rather than focal) edema and erythema.&nbsp; Preseptal cellulitis does not cause isolated tenderness over the lacrimal sac, distinguishing it from dacryocystitis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of dacryocystitis aims to alleviate symptoms, treat the underlying infection, and restore normal tear drainage.&nbsp; Treatments include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Warm compresses and gentle <strong>nasolacrimal duct massage</strong> promote tear drainage (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L61066.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Systemic <strong>antibiotics</strong> control bacterial infection; oral antibiotics are typically adequate, but IV administration may be necessary in severe cases.</li>\n\t<li>Nasolacrimal duct probing or irrigation relieves obstruction (if needed, it is performed by an ophthalmologist).</li>\n\t<li>Surgical intervention (dacryocystorhinostomy) is indicated for persistent or recurrent cases.</li>\n\t<li>Predisposing factors such as chronic rhinosinusitis are addressed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for dacryocystitis is generally favorable.&nbsp; Most cases respond well to conservative measures.&nbsp; However, extension of localized infection may cause complications such as preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis (infection of the orbital fat and extraocular muscles), or orbital abscess.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Dacryocystitis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L109063.jpg\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an inflammatory condition of the lacrimal sac caused by obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct.&nbsp; Presenting symptoms include erythema, swelling, and tenderness over the lacrimal sac in the medial canthus region of the eye.&nbsp; Dacryocystitis is often managed conservatively with warm compresses, massage, and antibiotics, but surgery may be required to alleviate chronic or persistent obstructions.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
