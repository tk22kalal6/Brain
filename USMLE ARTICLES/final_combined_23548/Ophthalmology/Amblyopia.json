It is one of the most common causes of pediatric visual impairment.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Normal development of the visual cortex requires appropriately focused visual stimulation from both eyes in early childhood.&nbsp; Therefore, the development of amblyopia is a 2-step process, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Step 1:&nbsp; Impaired transmission of a sharply focused image from both eyes due to an underlying ocular defect.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>In deprivation amblyopia, this is due to obstruction of the visual axis (eg, cataract (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11916.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), ptosis, hemangioma).</li>\n\t\t<li>In refractive amblyopia, this is due to an uncorrected asymmetric refractive error (eg, myopia, hyperopia (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31447.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).</li>\n\t\t<li>In strabismic amblyopia, abnormal binocular interactions (eg, strabismus (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21723.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )) lead to diplopia and suppression of the image from one eye.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Step 2:&nbsp; Abnormal development of visual processing pathways due to impaired transmission of stimuli (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L88273.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>If the underlying ocular defect is not corrected in early childhood during the critical period of vision development (ie, by age 8-10), permanent cortical visual impairment can occur.&nbsp; Patients with amblyopia have a functional reduction in visual acuity, which persists even if the ocular pathology is corrected later in life.&nbsp; Amblyopia is usually unilateral but can be bilateral if there is abnormal visual stimulation from both eyes (eg, occlusion from bilateral cataracts).</p><br><br><p>The primary risk factor for amblyopia is having an underlying visual defect, which is more likely in certain conditions (eg, premature birth, eye injuries during childhood).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The clinical presentation of amblyopia varies depending on its underlying cause and severity.&nbsp; Caregivers may notice subtle findings (eg, mild asymmetry between the patient's eyes, poor depth perception).&nbsp; However, the majority of children with unilateral amblyopia are undiagnosed until routine vision screening is performed.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Routine vision screening is the primary method of detecting amblyopia; <strong>screening</strong> is recommended in children <strong>ages 3-5</strong> at their health maintenance visits.&nbsp; Screening technique depends on the patient's age and development.&nbsp; When amblyopia is suspected, a comprehensive eye examination should be performed, including assessment of:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Visual acuity</strong>:&nbsp; This assesses the sharpness and clarity of vision (ie, ability of the eye to distinguish details) at a distance.&nbsp; It is commonly evaluated with a standard vision chart (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21629.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Refraction</strong>:&nbsp; Refraction refers to the focusing of an optical image on the retina.&nbsp; A refraction test assesses for changes in visual acuity while the patient looks through various lenses in a phoropter (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L114731.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ocular alignment and motility</strong>:&nbsp; To achieve normal binocular vision, the eyes must be properly aligned and have balanced/coordinated movement in all directions.&nbsp; This can be assessed by examining extraocular movements evaluating the red reflex and corneal light reflection (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L17507.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stereopsis</strong>:&nbsp; Because there is space between the eyes, images are perceived slightly differently in each eye.&nbsp; This slight offset allows for depth perception.&nbsp; Stereopsis tests measure a patient's ability to perceive depth by testing for the ability to detect targets that have contour.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anterior and posterior segments of the eye</strong>:&nbsp; This involves evaluating the structural components (eg, cornea, lens, retina) of the eye for abnormalities.&nbsp; They are assessed with a slit-lamp examination and dilated funduscopic examination.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Based on this assessment, the diagnosis of amblyopia is made if one of the following criteria is met:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Difference in unilateral vision between eyes</strong> (best corrected visual acuity) <strong>≥2 lines on a standard vision chart</strong> (eg, 20/20 in one eye and 20/30 in the other eye).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Best corrected visual acuity in both eyes is worse than 20/40 in children age ≥4</strong>.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Imaging studies (eg, optical coherence tomography) may be indicated if suspected structural abnormalities or optic nerve pathology interferes with visual acuity.&nbsp; Laboratory evaluation is generally not required for the diagnosis of amblyopia.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Although amblyopia occurs secondary to an underlying ocular defect (eg, refractive error, cataracts), not all patients with these defects develop amblyopia.&nbsp; If visual acuity normalizes after correcting the primary ocular defect (eg, extracting the cataract), the patient does not have amblyopia.</p><br><br><p>If the patient has a functional reduction in visual acuity but no detectable ocular defect, primary disorders of the visual pathway (eg, structural brain lesions) should be considered.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management strategy of amblyopia involves first correcting the underlying ocular defect so that the image transmitted to the visual cortex from both eyes is sharp and focused.&nbsp; These interventions include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Removal of obstruction (eg, cataract) of the visual axis</li>\n\t<li>Correction of refractive errors with glasses or contact lenses</li>\n\t<li>Correction of ocular alignment in strabismus</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>After correcting the underlying defect, use of the amblyopic eye must be encouraged.&nbsp; This can be done by <strong>occluding the better eye</strong> with either eye patching or pharmacologic blurring, forcing the visual cortex to recognize the signal coming from the amblyopic eye (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21723.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; As a result, the nerve pathways from the amblyopic eye are stimulated to develop.&nbsp; Early intervention is crucial for promoting normal visual development.<p></p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for amblyopia depends on various factors, including the age of onset, severity of visual impairment, compliance with treatment, and underlying ocular defect.&nbsp; Early detection and intervention (ie, age &lt;5) are crucial for optimizing visual outcomes (with many attaining visual acuity of 20/25 or better) and preventing permanent vision loss.&nbsp; However, even if normal visual acuity is achieved, patients with a history of amblyopia may have deficits in other aspects of vision (eg, fine depth perception, hand-eye coordination).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Amblyopia is a disruption to the development of the visual cortex early in life, occurring as a secondary consequence of an underlying ocular pathology (eg, strabismus, cataracts) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/58819.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
