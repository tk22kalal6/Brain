The globe itself is not affected.&nbsp; Orbital cellulitis is a medical emergency because it can lead to permanent vision loss as well as intracranial complications such as meningitis and cavernous sinus thrombosis.</p>\n<h1>Anatomy</h1><br><br><p>The orbital septum is a fascial membrane that forms a boundary between the anterior and posterior orbit (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11657.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; It extends vertically from the superior and inferior orbital rims to the upper and lower eyelids, respectively.&nbsp; It acts to prevent anterior infection of the eyelids and periorbital soft tissues (ie, preseptal cellulitis) from migrating into the deeper structures of the posterior orbit.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Orbital cellulitis tends to occur more often in young children, but it can occur at any age.&nbsp; The infection is typically caused by the <strong>contiguous spread of bacteria from adjacent structures</strong> such as the paranasal sinuses, teeth, or periorbital skin.&nbsp; Therefore, risk factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Sinusitis, particularly ethmoidal (most common)</li>\n\t<li>Dental infection</li>\n\t<li>Dacryocystitis (lacrimal sac infection)</li>\n\t<li>Orbital or facial trauma</li>\n\t<li>Orbital or periocular surgery</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Microbiology</h1><br><br><p>The most common causative organisms include <em><strong>Staphylococcus aureus</strong></em> (including methicillin-resistant <em>S aureus</em> [MRSA]), <strong><em>Streptococcus</em> species</strong> (eg, <em>S pyogenes</em>, <em>S pneumoniae</em>), and <strong>nontypeable <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em></strong>.&nbsp; These are the same bacteria frequently associated with sinus and skin infections.&nbsp; Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic organisms (eg, <em>Bacteroides</em>) are less common as an isolated source of infection but may be present in polymicrobial infections (eg, odontogenic source).</p><br><br><p>Fungal infections (eg, mucormycosis) are rare but should be considered in patients with significant immunosuppression (eg, HIV).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Like many other eye infections (eg, preseptal cellulitis), orbital cellulitis can present with eyelid edema, erythema, and pain.&nbsp; However, only orbital cellulitis causes <strong>inflammation of the orbital fat and extraocular muscles</strong> that leads to the following characteristic clinical features (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/37182.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Proptosis</strong> (ie, forward displacement of the globe due to orbital fat inflammation)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pain with extraocular movements</strong> (due to muscle inflammation)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ophthalmoplegia</strong> (ie, weakness/paralysis of the extraocular muscles) <strong>with or without diplopia</strong></li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Fever</strong> and chemosis (<strong>conjunctival swelling</strong>) are also more likely to occur with orbital cellulitis than with other eye/orbital infections.</p><br><br><p>Facial numbness and septal necrosis are alarming features that should raise suspicion for fungal infection.</p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Orbital cellulitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on characteristic physical examination findings and historical information.&nbsp; Imaging, such as <strong>MRI or CT scan of the orbits and sinuses</strong> with intravenous (IV) contrast, can be used to:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>confirm the diagnosis (eg, identify extraocular muscle inflammation, fat stranding, proptosis).</li>\n\t<li>assess the extent of infection.</li>\n\t<li>evaluate for a fluid collection (eg, orbital abscess) that may require surgical drainage.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Imaging frequently shows concomitant sinusitis (typically ethmoid) adjacent to the affected orbit.</p><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count to assess for leukocytosis (typically with a neutrophil predominance), which is common in orbital cellulitis.&nbsp; Blood cultures should be obtained but may be unreliable (eg, negative or misrepresentative of orbital microbiology).&nbsp; Cultures should also be performed on any purulent drainage from the sinuses.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Patients with orbital cellulitis require <strong>hospital admission for IV antibiotics</strong>.&nbsp; Ophthalmology (and otolaryngology if sinusitis is present) specialists should be consulted to guide management and determine the need for surgical intervention.</p><br><br><p>Most uncomplicated cases can be managed effectively with antibiotics alone.&nbsp; The empiric regimen should provide coverage against common pathogens responsible for orbital cellulitis infection.&nbsp; A typical empiric antibiotic regimen for orbital cellulitis should include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime</strong>:&nbsp; third-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum coverage against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including <em>Streptococcus</em> spp and <em>H influenzae</em></li>\n\t<li><strong>Vancomycin</strong>:&nbsp; effective against MRSA, resistant strains of <em>S pneumoniae</em>, and other gram-positive bacteria</li>\n\t<li><strong>Metronidazole</strong>:&nbsp; has activity against anaerobic bacteria commonly found in sinusitis and odontogenic infections (given until intracranial extension of infection has been ruled out)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Signs of clinical improvement should be evident within 24-48 hours of initiating antibiotic therapy.&nbsp; Patients who respond appropriately (eg, resolution of fever, improvement of orbital symptoms) can be transitioned to oral medications, typically within 3-5 days.&nbsp; Oral antibiotics are continued until all signs of infection are resolved, for a total duration of 2-3 weeks.&nbsp; Patients with severe sinusitis associated with orbital cellulitis may require longer courses of treatment.</p><br><br><p>Patients who do not improve promptly with IV antibiotics should be reevaluated (eg, undergo repeat imaging) for an orbital abscess or extension of infection causing intracranial complications such as brain abscess, meningitis, epidural or subdural empyema, and cavernous or dural sinus thrombosis.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>With prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment, the prognosis for orbital cellulitis is generally favorable.&nbsp; However, delayed or inadequate treatment can lead to severe complications.&nbsp; Vision loss can result from prolonged orbital inflammation that leads to optic nerve injury/ischemia, retinal artery occlusion (from compression), or orbital vein thrombophlebitis.&nbsp; Close monitoring, timely intervention, and aggressive management of complications are crucial for optimizing outcomes.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Orbital cellulitis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/39169.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a serious infection involving the structures of the posterior orbit and is most often caused by contiguous spread of infection from the sinuses.&nbsp; Defining characteristics are pain with eye movements, proptosis, and ophthalmoplegia.&nbsp; Diagnosis is confirmed with CT or MRI imaging.&nbsp; Treatment is with immediate intravenous antibiotics to prevent complications (eg, brain abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis).<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
