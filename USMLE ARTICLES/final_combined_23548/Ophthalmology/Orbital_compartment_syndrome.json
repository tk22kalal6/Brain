Patients typically present after an orbital trauma with severe eye pain, decreased visual acuity, proptosis, a tense globe, and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The orbit is a rigid, bony compartment with minimal capacity for expansion.&nbsp; When bleeding or soft tissue edema develops within this fixed space, intraorbital pressure rises rapidly.&nbsp; Once intraorbital pressure exceeds the perfusion pressure of the central retinal artery (a branch of the ophthalmic artery), retinal and optic nerve ischemia ensue, resulting in irreversible vision loss.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>OCS most often follows <strong>blunt orbital or facial trauma</strong>, particularly when associated with a <strong>retrobulbar hemorrhage</strong> (bleeding behind the globe).&nbsp; The rapid accumulation of blood and edema within the orbit following trauma is the most significant risk factor for OCS.</p><br><br><p>Additional causes include postoperative bleeding following ophthalmologic procedures, retrobulbar injections, or craniofacial and sinus surgery.&nbsp; Patients with bleeding disorders or those receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy are at increased risk, even after minor trauma or surgical manipulation.</p><br><br><p>Nonhemorrhagic conditions that can rapidly expand intraorbital volume include orbital cellulitis or abscess, angioedema due to severe allergic reactions or burns, or orbital/subcutaneous emphysema after a blowout fracture involving the paranasal sinuses.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients often have a history of recent trauma, surgery, or orbital infection, and present with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Severe ocular or orbital pain.</li>\n\t<li>Decreased visual acuity or diplopia.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Proptosis with a tense \"rock-hard\" orbit</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)</strong> (&gt;40 mmHg) on tonometry.</li>\n\t<li>Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L118023.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Ophthalmoplegia (restricted eye movement).</li>\n\t<li>Diffuse subconjunctival hemorrhage and periorbital ecchymosis (posttraumatic OCS).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Orbital cellulitis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/39169.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

High suspicion requires immediate intervention to decompress the orbit, as permanent vision loss can occur within 90-120 minutes of onset.</p>\n<h1>Laboratory testing</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory testing is not required for diagnosis but may help identify a predisposing condition (eg, coagulopathy) when the etiology is unclear.&nbsp; Testing may include a complete blood count and coagulation profile (PT/INR, aPTT, platelets).</p>\n<h1>Imaging studies</h1><br><br><p>A noncontrast CT of the orbit should be obtained only if the diagnosis is uncertain.&nbsp; Supportive findings may include a retrobulbar hemorrhage/hematoma (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L81876.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), globe tenting (ie, posterior flattening of the globe), proptosis, or a space occupying lesion (eg, abscess).<p></p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>OCS is an ophthalmologic emergency.&nbsp; An elevated IOP (eg, &gt;40 mmHg) with clinical signs of optic nerve ischemia (eg, visual loss, RAPD) is an indication for immediate surgical decompression with a <strong>lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L84448.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This procedure involves cutting the lateral canthal skin and the inferior crus of the lateral canthal tendon, which releases the lower eyelid from its attachment to the orbital rim and permits anterior displacement of the globe, leading to a rapid reduction in IOP.<p></p><br><br><p>Additional supportive measures may include elevating the head of the bed, administering high-flow oxygen to improve retinal oxygenation, providing adequate analgesia and antiemetic therapy, using mannitol or acetazolamide to lower IOP, and discontinuing anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents (with reversal if indicated).</p><br><br><p>After IOP is emergently reduced, definitive surgical management (eg, retrobulbar hematoma evacuation, orbital fracture repair) is performed.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Prognosis depends almost exclusively on time to decompression.&nbsp; If treated within 60-90 minutes, vision recovery is possible; delays beyond 2 hours drastically reduce visual outcomes.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Preventive measures include careful hemostasis during orbital or sinus surgery and close monitoring of anticoagulated patients after facial trauma or orbital procedures.&nbsp; Use of protective facial gear can also reduce risk.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Orbital compartment syndrome (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/83795.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a sight-threatening emergency caused by rapid elevation of intraorbital pressure leading to ischemia of the optic nerve (CN II) and retina.&nbsp; It most often follows orbital trauma and presents with pain, proptosis, decreased vision, and elevated IOP.&nbsp; Diagnosis is clinical, and immediate lateral canthotomy and cantholysis are sight-saving interventions that should not be delayed.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
