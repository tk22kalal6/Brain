It is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if left untreated.&nbsp; MN can be classified into primary and secondary forms, with distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms driving each subtype.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology</h1><br><br><p>MN accounts for approximately 20%-30% of nephrotic syndrome cases in adults, with a peak incidence between age 40 and 60.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Primary</strong> (idiopathic) MN (70%-80% of cases) is due to autoantibodies capable of forming ICs with the phospholipase A<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> receptor (PLA2R) or podocytes.&nbsp; It shows a slight male predominance (2:1 ratio) and varies in prevalence geographically and racially, with higher rates in Western countries and in White individuals, respectively.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Secondary</strong> MN (20%-30%%) is due to ICs formed in response to underlying systemic conditions, medications, or infections (eg, hepatitis B virus [HBV]), making its epidemiology partially dependent on these associated factors.&nbsp; It is rare in children largely due to universal HBV vaccination.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and etiologies</h1><h2>Primary MN</h2><br><br><p>Primary MN is the most common type of MN and is usually due to autoantibody formation (typically IgG4) against <strong>PLA2R</strong> on podocytes.&nbsp; The resultant formation of ICs (in situ) activates complement, leading to GBM thickening and disruption of the filtration barrier, resulting in significant proteinuria (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L35856.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Rarely, causative antibodies may target other podocyte antigens (eg, thrombospondin type-1 domain–containing 7A).<p></p>\n<h2>Secondary MN</h2><br><br><p>Secondary MN arises from ICs in patients with systemic conditions or from external triggers.&nbsp; These ICs, which can be circulating or form in situ, deposit in the subepithelial space of the glomerulus, leading to podocyte and GBM injury as in primary disease.&nbsp; Etiologies include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Malignancy</strong>:&nbsp; Solid tumors (eg, lung, colon, breast) and, less commonly, hematologic cancers, with ICs typically containing tumor antigens and their corresponding antibodies (although the specific antigens vary by tumor type and are often unidentified).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Autoimmune disease</strong>:&nbsp; Most commonly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (ie, class V lupus nephritis), with ICs containing DNA antigens and anti-DNA antibodies.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infection</strong>:&nbsp; HBV (most common infectious etiology), with ICs formed from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and anti-HBeAg.&nbsp; Additional infectious causes include syphilis, hepatitis C, and HIV.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Medications</strong>:&nbsp; Certain drugs (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, penicillamine), with ICs containing drug-modified proteins that act as antigens (ie, haptens), paired with antibodies against these modified proteins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>MN can present with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Nephrotic syndrome</strong> (~80% of cases), defined by heavy proteinuria (&gt;3.5 g/day), hypoalbuminemia, and peripheral edema.&nbsp; It develops subacutely (weeks to months) due to gradual podocyte damage (vs more acute progression in primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis).</li>\n\t<li>Less commonly, subnephrotic proteinuria with normal albumin and therefore minimal, if any, edema (particularly in secondary MN).</li>\n\t<li>Rarely, hypertension, microscopic hematuria, and acute kidney injury in severe cases.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Although nephrotic syndrome in general predisposes patients to venous thromboses due to hypercoagulability (eg, urinary loss of natural anticoagulants), this risk is particularly high in those with MN.&nbsp; <strong>Renal vein thrombosis</strong> is especially common, occurring in 10%-40% of patients, and is often chronic and asymptomatic.&nbsp; The risk is highest in patients with very low albumin levels (&lt;2.0-2.5 g/dL).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><h2>Autoantibodies</h2><br><br><p>MN in adults is most commonly primary (70%-80% of cases), which is often associated with positive serology (eg, anti-PLA2R antibodies).&nbsp; Therefore, checking <strong>serum PLA2R antibodies</strong> is crucial early in the evaluation of adults with nephrotic syndrome.&nbsp; Positive titers are highly specific for primary MN and <strong>may eliminate the need for invasive renal biopsy</strong> in many patients.&nbsp; Negative anti-PLA2R antibodies do not exclude primary MN because up to 20% of patients lack detectable antibodies on presentation (eg, the kidneys may act as a sponge for the antibodies).</p>\n<h2>Biopsy</h2><br><br><p><strong>Kidney biopsy</strong> should be performed in patients with <strong>negative PLA2R autoantibodies</strong> or positive autoantibodies but renal impairment, nephritic features or hypocomplementemia, or risk factors for secondary MN (eg, SLE, malignancy, viral hepatitis).</p><br><br><p>Biopsy findings include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Light microscopy</strong>:&nbsp; Diffuse GBM thickening without significant glomerular hypercellularity (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99184.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;

Granular IgG and C3 deposits along capillary loops (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L7795.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Electron microscopy</strong>:&nbsp; Irregular, electron-dense immune deposits between the GBM and epithelial cells (ie, subepithelial cells).&nbsp; Podocyte foot process effacement is seen (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L43442.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Biopsy findings can also help distinguish primary MN from secondary MN.&nbsp; Primary MN typically shows PLA2R staining, even if serum PLA2R antibody titers are negative, whereas secondary MN may reveal additional immune reactants related to the underlying condition (eg, hepatitis antigens).</p>\n<h2>Further evaluation</h2><br><br><p>In addition to kidney biopsy, patients should be evaluated for <strong>causes of secondary MN</strong>.&nbsp; Evaluation includes a careful medication review, viral serology (HBV, hepatitis C, HIV), autoimmune testing (eg, antinuclear antibodies), complement levels, tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen, PSA), and age- and risk-appropriate <strong>cancer screening</strong> (eg, colonoscopy, chest CT scan for smokers).&nbsp; Although malignancy is often clinically apparent before the onset of MN, it can sometimes be the presenting feature of occult malignancy.&nbsp; An extensive search for occult malignancy (eg, positron emission tomography) is not recommended.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><h2>Primary MN</h2><br><br><p>Without treatment, the natural course of primary MN is highly variable:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Approximately one-third of patients experience spontaneous remission.</li>\n\t<li>Another third has persistent proteinuria (&lt;2 g/day) without significant decline in renal function.</li>\n\t<li>The remaining third progress to ESRD over 10-15 years.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Given this variability, the decision to initiate immunosuppressive therapy (eg, rituximab, cyclophosphamide) must be carefully considered.&nbsp; Although these agents can alter the disease course in high-risk patients, they carry significant adverse effects (eg, infection risk, bone marrow suppression).&nbsp; Therefore, their use should be reserved for patients with a higher likelihood of progression, balancing the risks from the medication against the disease's natural progression in untreated individuals.</p><br><br><p>Several factors are associated with a worse prognosis in primary MN (ie, high-risk primary MN), including sustained proteinuria &gt;8 g/day and high anti-PLA2R titers.&nbsp; These factors can help identify patients who are more likely to benefit from early intervention.&nbsp; In addition, serial monitoring of anti-PLA2R is helpful because declining titers often precede clinical remission, whereas persistently high or rising titers may indicate a need for treatment.</p>\n<h2>Secondary MN</h2><br><br><p>The prognosis of secondary MN also varies widely.&nbsp; For example, the prognosis for malignancy-associated MN hinges on cancer stage, whereas SLE-related MN outcomes improve with immunosuppression.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management involves supportive care and, for some, targeted therapy.</p>\n<h2>Supportive care</h2><br><br><p>General management goals for all patients include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Reducing proteinuria:&nbsp; ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers are key; sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may provide added benefit.</li>\n\t<li>Controlling edema:&nbsp; Diuretics and sodium restriction are often needed.</li>\n\t<li>Preventing thrombosis:&nbsp; Prophylactic anticoagulation (eg, heparin with warfarin bridge) is commonly given if albumin levels are &lt;2.5 g/dL.</li>\n\t<li>Treating hyperlipidemia:&nbsp; Statins and dietary changes are mainstays of management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Specific therapy for primary MN</h2><br><br><p>Primary MN management depends on the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>High risk</strong> (proteinuria &gt;8 g/day, persistently high PLA2R titers, declining kidney function):&nbsp; Initiating <strong>immunosuppression</strong> (eg, rituximab, steroids plus cyclophosphamide) is recommended.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Low risk</strong> (proteinuria &lt;4 g/day, declining PLA2R titers, stable kidney function):&nbsp; <strong>Monitoring</strong> every 3-6 months is preferred; approximately 33% of cases remit spontaneously.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Serial anti-PLA2R monitoring aids in predicting relapse or remission.</p>\n<h2>Specific therapy for secondary MN</h2><br><br><p>Secondary MN treatment involves <strong>addressing the underlying cause</strong>, such as providing antiviral agents for HBV, initiating chemotherapy for cancer, or discontinuing a potentially causative medication.&nbsp; Immunosuppression is rarely used unless the primary condition (eg, SLE) warrants it.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Membranous nephropathy (MN) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/93754.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults;
