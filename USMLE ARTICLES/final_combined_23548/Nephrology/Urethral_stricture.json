The resulting obstruction causes lower urinary tract symptoms and, if untreated, may lead to recurrent infections, bladder dysfunction, and renal impairment.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The male urethra consists of the fixed posterior urethra, which includes the bladder neck, prostatic urethra, and membranous urethra, and the mobile anterior urethra, which includes the bulbar and penile urethra, fossa navicularis, and urethral meatus (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L90747.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The full length of the urethra is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium (ie, urothelium), and in the anterior urethra, the urethra is surrounded by corpus spongiosum (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31069.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Urethral strictures develop following <strong>injury to the urethral epithelium or corpus spongiosum</strong>.&nbsp; Urethral insults produce a defect in the urethral lining, allowing urine to extravasate into the underlying tissues, leading to an inflammatory and fibrotic response.&nbsp; Fibrotic remodeling and scar tissue deposition in the urothelium and underlying corpus spongiosum <strong>(spongiofibrosis)</strong> during the wound healing process cause circumferential contraction of the urethra, narrowing the lumen.&nbsp; Over time, repeated trauma in fragile and inelastic tissue leads to additional narrowing.</p><br><br><p>Strictures may develop anywhere in the anterior or posterior urethra but are most common in the bulbar urethra.&nbsp; Although the majority of cases are idiopathic, other potential causes include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Iatrogenic</strong>:&nbsp; Catheterization (particularly prolonged catheterization), cystoscopy, urologic surgery (eg, radical prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, hypospadias repair), and radiation therapy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Trauma</strong>:&nbsp; Pelvic fracture (causing avulsion between the bulbar urethra and membranous urethra (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L90748.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )), straddle or other perineal injuries (anterior urethral injuries), and penile fracture.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Infectious</strong>:&nbsp; Sexually transmitted infections (eg, gonorrhea), chronic urethritis, and recurrent urinary tract infections.&nbsp; Infectious strictures involve the anterior urethra and are longer (&gt;4 cm) than strictures caused by other etiologies because of inflammation throughout the entire length of the urethra.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inflammatory</strong>:&nbsp; Lichen sclerosus.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Congenital</strong>:&nbsp; Meatal stenosis, associated with hypospadias.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Common symptoms of urethral stricture include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Lower urinary tract symptoms</strong>:&nbsp; Weak or interrupted stream, straining to urinate, incomplete bladder emptying, spraying of urine, dysuria, postvoid dribbling.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ejaculatory dysfunction</strong>:&nbsp; Pain with ejaculation, delayed or intermittent discharge of ejaculate.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Some patients may have recurrent urinary tract infections, hematuria, or acute urinary retention requiring emergency drainage.&nbsp; In severe cases, chronic obstruction may develop due to hydronephrosis and renal dysfunction.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Evaluation begins with a physical examination to assess for fibrotic segments along the anterior urethra, meatal narrowing, or signs of lichen sclerosus (eg, shiny white tissue on the glans).&nbsp; A prostate examination can evaluate for enlargement and nodularity.</p><br><br><p>Imaging is the primary method for diagnosing urethral stricture.&nbsp; Although urethrocystoscopy is the most sensitive diagnostic tool, it cannot assess stricture severity or length.&nbsp; Therefore, retrograde urethrography is the gold standard imaging modality because it evaluates the site, length, and number of strictures.&nbsp; During the procedure, contrast is injected through the urethral opening to the bladder, and areas of luminal narrowing indicate areas of stricture (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L98784.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation includes urinalysis and urine culture to detect infection or hematuria, and renal function tests to assess for renal impairment due to obstructive uropathy.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Benign prostatic hyperplasia</strong> (BPH) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L40927.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; An enlarging prostate can externally compress the prostatic urethra and cause lower urinary tract symptoms (eg, slow urinary stream, straining to void, incomplete emptying) similar to those of urethral strictures.&nbsp; However, BPH is more likely to occur in older males, and it causes a symmetrically enlarged prostate.&nbsp; It is also less likely to interfere with ejaculation, particularly if the obstruction occurs proximal to the point where the ejaculatory ducts meet the urethra (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L60293.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In addition, alpha blockers typically relieve symptoms in BPH but not in urethral stricture (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L15785.png\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prostate cancer</strong>:&nbsp; Although most prostate cancers are diagnosed at an early, asymptomatic stage due to screening, they may occasionally present at an advanced stage with hematuria, urinary hesitancy or frequency, or urinary retention.&nbsp; Patients typically have an elevated prostate-specific antigen and may have a nodular, asymmetrically enlarged prostate.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Urethral cancer</strong> (eg, urothelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma):&nbsp; Urethral cancer may cause urinary retention, dysuria, and hematuria; however, urethral discharge, fistula, abscess, or lymphadenopathy may also occur.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bladder neck contracture</strong>:&nbsp; Narrowing of the bladder outlet due to scar tissue development can occur following prostate surgery or pelvic radiation therapy.&nbsp; The contracture can cause obstructive voiding symptoms and urge or overflow incontinence.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neurogenic bladder dysfunction</strong>:&nbsp; Neurologic disorders (eg, spinal cord lesions, multiple sclerosis) interfere with bladder emptying through impaired innervation of the detrusor and sphincter muscles, resulting in either urinary or overflow urinary incontinence.&nbsp; Such symptoms are often accompanied by other neurologic symptoms or deficits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Urethral stricture is primarily managed surgically, with the type of surgery dependent on the stricture length, location, and recurrence risk.&nbsp; Short (&lt;2 cm) anterior urethral strictures may be treated endoscopically with either urethral dilation or endoscopic stricture incision, which allows the lumen to develop a larger caliber.&nbsp; In contrast, longer strictures (&gt;2 cm) or those within the posterior urethra require open surgical repair with urethroplasty, which creates a larger caliber lumen.&nbsp; Urinary diversion with suprapubic catheter placement or perineal urethrotomy (ie, creation of a new urinary orifice to bypass the stricture) is used for individuals with contraindications to surgery or in those who have failed other surgical repairs.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Untreated strictures often progress and can result in chronic urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, bladder stones, fistula formation, and prostatitis.&nbsp; Chronic obstruction may lead to bladder hypertrophy, hydronephrosis, and renal damage.&nbsp; However, the prognosis varies depending on the stricture length, location, and type of treatment.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Prevention focuses on avoiding initial trauma to the urethra by minimizing urethral catheterization, using atraumatic techniques during urologic procedures, and promptly recognizing and treating urethritis and sexually transmitted infections.</p>\n<h1>Special consideration: urethral strictures in females</h1><br><br><p>Female urethral strictures are rare but develop from fibrotic scarring triggered by inflammation following injury to the urethral epithelium.&nbsp; This scarring may occur after childbirth-related trauma, iatrogenic injury (eg, urethral instrumentation, urethral diverticulum excision, radiation), malignancy, or infection.&nbsp; Female strictures are characterized by obstructive voiding symptoms (eg, urinary retention, slow or interrupted urinary stream, sensation of incomplete emptying), urinary frequency or urgency, and recurrent urinary tract infections.</p><br><br><p>Topical estrogen may be used for distal or meatal strictures, whereas most cases are initially treated with urethral dilation followed by intermittent self-dilation.&nbsp; Urethroplasty may be performed but carries a risk of fistula formation, dyspareunia, stress urinary incontinence, and impaired sensation.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Urethral stricture is a fibrotic narrowing of the urethra that may be idiopathic or due to trauma, infection, inflammation, or iatrogenic injury.&nbsp; Obstructive voiding symptoms are common but may progress to other complications (eg, hydronephrosis, renal dysfunction) if untreated.&nbsp; Retrograde urethrography confirms the diagnosis by localizing and measuring the stricture.&nbsp; Management is surgical.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
