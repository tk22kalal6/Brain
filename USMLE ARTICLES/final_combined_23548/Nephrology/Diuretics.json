Most diuretic medications induce natriuresis, leading to diuresis because water follows sodium into the urine.&nbsp; An exception is vasopressin receptor antagonists, which promote pure water diuresis without sodium excretion (aquaresis).&nbsp; This article focuses on the different classes of diuretics, their mechanisms of action, adverse effects, and clinical applications.</p>\n<h1>Classes of diuretics</h1><br><br><p>Diuretics are classified based on their site of action within the nephron and their mechanism of action (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L12298.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The different classes are discussed below and summarized in this table (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/81297.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Loop diuretics</h2><br><br><p>Loop diuretics (eg, furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid) are the most potent class.&nbsp; They work by inhibiting the Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>-K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>-2Cl<font size=\"2\"><sup>−</sup></font> cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.&nbsp; This nephron segment is responsible for most Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> reabsorption, with approximately 20%-25% of filtered Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> occurring here.&nbsp; By blocking this, loop diuretics lead to significant urinary Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> loss (natriuresis).</p><br><br><p>The loop of Henle also plays a crucial role in maintaining the medullary concentration gradient, allowing the kidneys to concentrate urine.&nbsp; The thick ascending limb is impermeable to water but actively transports Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>, K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>, and Cl<font size=\"2\"><sup>−</sup></font> into the medullary interstitium, increasing its osmolarity.&nbsp; This high osmolarity enables water reabsorption in the descending limb and collecting ducts (under the influence of antidiuretic hormone [ADH]).&nbsp; By inhibiting the Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>-K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>-2Cl<font size=\"2\"><sup>−</sup></font> cotransporter, loop diuretics reduce ion transport into the medullary interstitium, diminishing the osmotic gradient and impairing water reabsorption.&nbsp; The combination of increased sodium loss and reduced water reabsorption leads to robust diuresis.</p><br><br><p>Because loop diuretics are highly protein-bound, they enter the renal tubules predominantly via secretion rather than filtration.&nbsp; This allows them to remain effective in patients with a significantly reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (chronic kidney disease [CKD]).&nbsp; Adverse effects include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia</li>\n\t<li>Hypovolemia, hypotension, and acute kidney injury (AKI)</li>\n\t<li>Metabolic alkalosis (mainly due to chloride depletion) and hyperuricemia (predisposing to gout)</li>\n\t<li>Ototoxicity, especially at high doses or with rapid intravenous (IV) administration</li>\n\t<li>Hypersensitivity reactions to sulfonamides (ethacrynic acid (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L117302.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is used instead).&nbsp; Notably, patients allergic to sulfonamide antibiotics can generally still receive loop diuretics due to their lack of cross-reactivity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics</h2><br><br><p>Thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, metolazone, indapamide) inhibit the Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>-Cl<font size=\"2\"><sup>−</sup></font> cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule.&nbsp; This segment reabsorbs significantly less Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> than the loop of Henle, so thiazides excrete only 3%-5% of filtered Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>, making them less effective than loop diuretics.&nbsp; In addition, they increase calcium reabsorption (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14230.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), in contrast to loop diuretics.&nbsp; Thiazides are much less protein-bound than loop diuretics and are therefore largely dependent on glomerular filtration; as such, they are less effective in patients with advanced CKD (GFR &lt;30 mL/min).&nbsp; Adverse effects include the following:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic alkalosis (less profound than loop diuretics)</li>\n\t<li>Mild hypercalcemia, especially in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism</li>\n\t<li>Hyponatremia (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/106529.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ), most commonly seen in elderly female patients with a low BMI (often due to increased water intake and retention)</li>\n\t<li>Mild hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, although clinically insignificant compared to antihypertensive benefits</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Potassium-sparing diuretics</h2><br><br><p>Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (eg, spironolactone, eplerenone, finerenone) and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) blockers (eg, amiloride, triamterene) inhibit Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> reabsorption at the most distal nephron site, the collecting duct.&nbsp; MRAs specifically block the aldosterone receptor, reducing activity of the apical ENaC channel and basolateral Na-K-ATPase, whereas ENaC blockers directly inhibit the Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> channels.</p><br><br><p>Because most Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> reabsorption has already occurred more proximally, these diuretics are weak, excreting only 1%-2% of filtered Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>.&nbsp; However, they are very effective in promoting K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> retention due to their ability to inhibit K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> secretion (hence the name potassium-sparing diuretics) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L16602.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Adverse effects include the following:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hyperkalemia may occur, particularly in patients also taking an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).</li>\n\t<li>Metabolic acidosis due to less K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> in the tubules, which reduces electronegativity and impairs acid excretion.&nbsp; Acidosis is more pronounced with MRAs due to the additional inhibition of H<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>-ATPse.</li>\n\t<li>Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction by also binding androgen receptors (not seen with eplerenone).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>When combined with loop diuretics or thiazides, potassium-sparing diuretics can help counteract the potassium loss and metabolic alkalosis induced by the other agents, helping to maintain normal serum potassium and bicarbonate levels.</p>\n<h2>Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors</h2><br><br><p>Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (eg, acetazolamide) act by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the proximal tubule, reducing bicarbonate reabsorption (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59841.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Bicarbonate normally binds to filtered Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>, and although the proximal tubule normally reabsorbs the majority of filtered Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font>, blocking this process does not cause significant diuresis.&nbsp; This is because Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> is simply reabsorbed in more distal parts of the nephron.&nbsp; Therefore, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are not used for managing volume overload but are more commonly used to counteract diuretic-induced metabolic alkalosis.&nbsp; In addition to metabolic acidosis, the major adverse effect is an increased risk for nephrolithiasis (ie, increased urine pH promotes calcium phosphate formation).<p></p><br><br><p>The use in conditions such as altitude sickness, glaucoma, and benign idiopathic intracranial hypertension is distinct from their diuretic effects (discussed in separate articles).</p>\n<h2>Osmotic diuretics</h2><br><br><p>Osmotic diuretics (eg, mannitol) increase the osmolarity of the filtrate, primarily in the proximal tubule and descending loop of Henle.&nbsp; This limits water reabsorption, leading to diuresis.&nbsp; Unlike other classes, osmotic diuretics do not directly affect electrolyte transport.&nbsp; However, retained water in the tubules indirectly promotes excretion of Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> and other electrolytes.&nbsp; Although effective at increasing urine volume, this class is not used for routine diuresis due to the lack of specific Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> modulation and the potential for transiently increasing intravascular volume in patients with heart failure (before the mannitol is filtered by the kidneys).&nbsp; Instead, they are used for other purposes, such as managing elevated intracranial pressure and glaucoma.</p>\n<h2>Vasopressin receptor antagonists</h2><br><br><p>Vasopressin receptor antagonists, commonly referred to as \"vaptans,\" include tolvaptan (oral) or conivaptan (IV).&nbsp; These medications block vasopressin (ADH) at the V2 aquaporin receptors in the collecting ducts.&nbsp; Normally, ADH promotes water reabsorption by increasing the number of aquaporin channels.&nbsp; By inhibiting this action, vaptans promote pure water excretion without Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> loss, thereby increasing serum Na<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> concentration.&nbsp; As such, vaptans cause aquaresis rather than natriuresis and are therefore used to treat water overload seen in hyponatremia (eg, syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) rather than volume overload.&nbsp; Major adverse effects include liver toxicity with prolonged use (particularly with tolvaptan) and the risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly.</p>\n<h1>Clinical applications</h1> <h2>Heart failure</h2><br><br><p>Loop diuretics are the primary agents for managing volume overload in heart failure due to their strong natriuretic effect.&nbsp; For resistant edema, typically seen in advanced disease, thiazides may be added.&nbsp; Dietary salt intake should also be limited for the following reasons:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Diuretic efficacy:&nbsp; High salt intake decreases diuretic effectiveness.&nbsp; Increased dietary sodium leads to greater filtered sodium, potentially overwhelming the diuretic's capacity to promote sodium excretion.</li>\n\t<li>Compensatory mechanisms:&nbsp; Diuretic-induced volume loss activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), promoting sodium retention.&nbsp; A high-sodium diet exacerbates this maladaptive response, further reducing diuretic efficacy.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, MRAs) can be added to help offset diuretic-induced hypokalemia and may provide the added benefits of mildly enhancing diuresis and lowering blood pressure.&nbsp; Furthermore, MRAs specifically improve long-term survival in heart failure with an ejection fraction &lt;35% by helping reverse aldosterone-mediated left ventricular remodeling.</p>\n<h2>Hypertension and CKD</h2><br><br><p>Thiazides are a first-line option for hypertension in most patients, with chlorthalidone showing the greatest efficacy.&nbsp; Beyond their diuretic effect, thiazides may lower blood pressure by inducing peripheral vasodilation (eg, opening vascular K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> channels).&nbsp; As GFR decreases, thiazides become less effective because their delivery to the site of action in the renal tubules is impaired.&nbsp; In advanced CKD (GFR &lt;30 mL/min), loop diuretics are the preferred diuretic for managing blood pressure and volume overload.</p>\n<h2>Nephrotic syndrome</h2><br><br><p>Loop diuretics are the mainstay of edema management in nephrotic syndrome, often requiring high doses to overcome the reduced efficacy caused by hypoalbuminemia (loop diuretics are highly protein-bound).&nbsp; For persistent edema, combination therapy with thiazides or potassium-sparing diuretics may be necessary to achieve adequate diuresis by targeting different nephron segments.&nbsp; In addition, strict dietary salt restriction is essential to optimize the diuretic response and minimize fluid retention.</p>\n<h2>Cirrhosis </h2><br><br><p>MRAs (eg, spironolactone) are first-line therapy for managing volume overload in cirrhosis due to their ability to block aldosterone, which is markedly elevated in this condition (due to RAAS hyperactivity).&nbsp; Loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) are typically added as adjunctive therapy to enhance diuresis and maintain normal serum K<font size=\"2\"><sup>+</sup></font> (when given in a standard ratio [eg, 40 mg furosemide:100 mg spironolactone]).&nbsp; Dietary salt restriction is of paramount importance given the extreme avidity for sodium that is seen in cirrhosis.</p>\n<h2>Metabolic disorders </h2><br><br><p>Loop diuretics are used to promote calcium excretion in the management of hypercalcemia.&nbsp; Conversely, thiazides should be avoided in hypercalcemia because they pull calcium from the urine into the blood.&nbsp; As such, thiazides are a treatment option for patients with calcium-containing kidney stones to reduce urinary calcium excretion.&nbsp; For acute hyperkalemia, both loop diuretics and thiazides can help promote potassium excretion, although they are typically reserved for patients with concurrent volume overload.</p>\n<h1>Special considerations</h1> <h2>Combination therapy </h2><br><br><p>Combination diuretic therapy may be required when monotherapy fails to control volume overload.&nbsp; Thiazides can be combined with loop diuretics to enhance diuresis by blocking sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule, compensating for the increased distal sodium delivery caused by loop diuretics.&nbsp; This approach, known as sequential nephron blockade, is particularly effective in patients with resistant edema or heart failure.&nbsp; In addition, potassium-sparing diuretics can be used alongside loop diuretics or thiazides to minimize the risk for hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.</p>\n<h2>Diuretic resistance </h2><br><br><p>Patients may develop a reduction or loss of diuretic effectiveness due to the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increased sodium reabsorption in distal nephron segments (the \"braking\" phenomenon)</li>\n\t<li>Worsening renal function (eg, reduced renal blood flow or impaired tubular secretion of the diuretic)</li>\n\t<li>Decreased bioavailability, particularly with oral furosemide, which can have significantly impaired absorption in patients with gut edema</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Mitigation strategies include increasing the diuretic dose and/or frequency, switching from oral to IV formulations (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108696.png\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), or using sequential nephron blockade.&nbsp; In severe cases, when conventional diuretics fail, ultrafiltration via dialysis may be required to remove excess fluid.<p></p>\n<h2>Drug interactions </h2><br><br><p>Diuretics can interact with various medications, altering their efficacy or increasing the risk for adverse effects.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):&nbsp; By inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, NSAIDs reduce renal blood flow and GFR, which can result in reduced diuretic efficacy (particularly with loop diuretics) or lead to AKI.</li>\n\t<li>ACE inhibitors or ARBs:&nbsp; Combined with loop diuretics or thiazides, these medications increase the risk for AKI.&nbsp; When used with potassium-sparing diuretics, they can increase the risk for hyperkalemia, especially in patients with CKD.</li>\n\t<li>Digoxin:&nbsp; In patients with heart failure who are taking loop diuretics, diuretic-induced hypokalemia increases the risk for digoxin toxicity by enhancing its binding to the cardiac Na-K-ATPase, predisposing to arrhythmias.</li>\n\t<li>Lithium:&nbsp; Thiazides and loop diuretics can increase lithium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, potentially causing lithium toxicity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Diuretic misuse </h2><br><br><p>Diuretics, particularly loop diuretics, may be misused by individuals with eating disorders attempting to lose weight.&nbsp; This can lead to severe electrolyte imbalances, metabolic alkalosis, and AKI.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Diuretics are diverse medications that help in the management of a wide range of conditions, including heart failure, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and edema from various causes (eg, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis).&nbsp; Each diuretic class works via distinct mechanisms within different parts of the nephron, resulting in varying effects on sodium and water excretion.&nbsp; Although loop diuretics are the most potent and widely used for managing volume overload, thiazides are preferred for blood pressure control.&nbsp; Potassium-sparing diuretics provide a valuable adjunct to counteract electrolyte imbalances, whereas osmotic diuretics and vasopressin receptor antagonists have more specialized uses.</p><br><br><p>Although generally effective and well-tolerated, diuretics can cause significant adverse effects, particularly electrolyte imbalances and metabolic disturbances.&nbsp; Careful monitoring and appropriate dosing are necessary to minimize these risks.&nbsp; In some cases, combination therapy may be required to enhance efficacy or mitigate adverse effects.&nbsp; Challenges such as diuretic resistance may arise, requiring strategies like employing dose adjustment, switching to intravenous formulations, or using sequential nephron blockade.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
