MGUS typically precedes more severe plasma cell disorders (eg, multiple myeloma) and is often discovered incidentally.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The pathogenesis of MGUS likely begins with genetic changes (eg, mutations affecting cell cycle regulators [eg, cyclin D1], translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain [IgH] locus) in a plasma cell, leading to clonal proliferation and production of M protein.&nbsp; The clonal plasma cells comprise &lt;10% of cells in the bone marrow and are generally nonaggressive.&nbsp; Patients have no evidence of end-organ damage (eg, CRAB features [hyper<strong>C</strong>alcemia, <strong>R</strong>enal insufficiency, <strong>A</strong>nemia, <strong>B</strong>one lesions], hyperviscosity, hepatosplenomegaly) characteristic of multiple myeloma.</p><br><br><p>The risk of MGUS increases with age, particularly in patients age &gt;50.&nbsp; First-degree relatives of patients with MGUS or other plasma cell disorders are also at increased risk, suggesting a genetic predisposition.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with MGUS are typically <strong>asymptomatic</strong>.&nbsp; The condition is often discovered incidentally when the M protein is detected on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) while evaluating for other unrelated conditions (eg, elevated total serum protein on routine laboratory evaluation).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>If elevated total serum protein is detected on routine laboratory evaluation, SPEP should be performed to better characterize the proteins present in the serum.&nbsp; SPEP is an agarose gel electrophoresis that separates serum proteins based on weight, shape, and net charge.&nbsp; Albumin, normally the most abundant serum protein, is always detectable as a spike on SPEP.&nbsp; The presence of several different immunoglobulin spikes is suggestive of polyclonal gammopathy, which can be due to chronic infection.&nbsp; In contrast, the presence of a single spike (ie, \"M spike\") is suggestive of a <strong>clonal plasma cell disorder</strong>.&nbsp; Further workup with serum immunofixation can confirm the isotype of M protein (eg, IgA, IgM, IgG) present.</p><br><br><p>MGUS is defined by the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>&lt;3 g/dL of serum M protein</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>&lt;10% clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>No clinical findings related to the clonal proliferation</strong></li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other laboratory findings (eg, complete blood count, serum creatinine and calcium levels) should be unremarkable.&nbsp; Imaging is generally not required for the diagnosis of MGUS unless there are symptoms suggestive of multiple myeloma or another plasma cell disorder (eg, anemia, lymphadenopathy).&nbsp; In such cases, a skeletal survey, MRI, or PET/CT scan may be necessary.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis of MGUS includes other disorders associated with elevated serum protein, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chronic infections</strong> (eg, HIV, chronic viral hepatitis):&nbsp; Plasma cells produce a variety of immunoglobulins in response to pathogenic proteins, resulting in polyclonal gammopathy (ie, no M spike) on SPEP.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clonal plasma cell disorders</strong>:&nbsp; are associated with production of monoclonal immunoglobulins or monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains.&nbsp; These disorders include:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Multiple myeloma</strong>:&nbsp; is distinguished from MGUS by the presence of ≥10% clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and evidence of end-organ damage (ie, CRAB features).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Smoldering myeloma</strong>:&nbsp; is an intermediate stage between MGUS and multiple myeloma.&nbsp; Similar to MGUS, CRAB features are absent, but SPEP shows ≥3g/dL of serum M protein.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Waldenström macroglobulinemia</strong>:&nbsp; is characterized by the presence of IgM M protein (ie, not IgA or IgG isotypes) and symptoms related to hyperviscosity, lymphadenopathy, and/or splenomegaly.</li>\n\t\t<li> <strong>Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis</strong> (ie, primary amyloidosis):&nbsp; occurs due to the deposition of immunoglobulin light chain fragments (amyloid proteins) in tissues, often causing organ dysfunction (eg, nephrotic syndrome, heart failure).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Because MGUS is a <strong>premalignant condition</strong>, management, which includes the following, involves close surveillance for disease progression to multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Regular clinical assessments</li>\n\t<li>Serial SPEP and immunofixation to evaluation for increasing serum M protein</li>\n\t<li>Serial complete blood count and serum chemistries (eg, creatinine, calcium) to evaluate for end-organ damage (eg, cytopenias due to bone marrow infiltration with clonal plasma cells, hypercalcemia due to lytic bone lesions)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The frequency of clinical assessments and laboratory evaluations depends on various factors that increase the risk for disease progression (eg, high serum M protein at diagnosis, non-IgG isotype, rapid rate of increase of serum M protein concentration).&nbsp; Patients should also be educated about the symptoms of progression, such as bone pain, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and recurrent infections.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>MGUS has a generally favorable prognosis, with a low risk for progression to multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders.&nbsp; Although the majority of patients with a plasma cell malignancy have a history of MGUS, only a small percentage of patients with MGUS develop a plasma cell malignancy (the annual risk of progression to multiple myeloma is approximately 1%).&nbsp; Most patients with MGUS remain asymptomatic without disease progression for years or decades.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic, premalignant condition characterized by the production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) by clonal plasma cells.&nbsp; MGUS is often discovered incidentally and is considered a benign condition.&nbsp; However, because it is associated with a risk for progression to multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders, patients require close surveillance.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
