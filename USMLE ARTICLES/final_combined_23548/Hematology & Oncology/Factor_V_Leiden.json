It results from a mutation that renders factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C (APC), a natural anticoagulant.&nbsp; This resistance shifts the hemostatic balance toward a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Hemostasis is a tightly regulated physiologic process that preserves vascular integrity by forming and stabilizing platelet-rich clots in response to vascular injury.&nbsp; During hemostasis, activated factor V (factor Va) amplifies thrombin generation, thereby promoting fibrin clot formation and stabilization (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L9709.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; To prevent excessive clot propagation, activated protein C (APC) functions as a natural anticoagulant by cleaving and degrading factor Va.<p></p><br><br><p>FVL arises from a single point mutation in the <em>F5</em> gene, which renders <strong>factor Va resistant to inactivation by APC</strong>.&nbsp; This impairment in the normal anticoagulant pathway shifts the hemostatic balance toward a <strong>prothrombotic state</strong>, leading to increased thrombin generation and prolonged clot stability.&nbsp; Eventually, this can lead to thrombosis (ie, the pathologic formation of a clot that obstructs blood flow).</p><br><br><p>FVL is the most common <strong>inherited thrombophilia</strong>, found in approximately 5% of individuals of European ancestry.&nbsp; A heterozygous mutation, which accounts for the majority of cases, confers an approximately 4-fold increased risk for thrombosis compared to the general population.&nbsp; However, given the low baseline incidence of thrombosis in the general population, the absolute risk in heterozygous individuals remains low, and the majority (~95%) never experience a thrombotic event during their lifetime, which carries important implications for clinical management.</p><br><br><p>Patients with FVL who develop thrombosis often have additional prothrombotic factors, as described by the Virchow triad:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Abnormal blood flow (eg, blood stasis due to immobility, presence of a foreign device such as a central venous catheter).</li>\n\t<li>Endothelial damage (eg, due to trauma or inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis).</li>\n\t<li>Hypercoagulability (ie, increased intrinsic tendency for clot formation) due to other inherited or acquired thrombophilias.&nbsp; The risk for thrombosis markedly increases in patients with homozygous FVL.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The majority of patients with FVL are asymptomatic and never develop thromboses.&nbsp; Among those who develop symptoms, <strong>VTE</strong> is the most common presentation, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Deep vein thrombosis</strong> (DVT):&nbsp; Most commonly involves the lower extremities and presents with acute unilateral swelling with associated pain, discoloration (eg, redness), and warmth.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pulmonary embolism</strong>:&nbsp; Occurs in up to 50% of those with untreated DVTs.&nbsp; Classic signs include sudden-onset dyspnea, chest pain, and hypoxia.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis</strong>:&nbsp; Presents with headache, papilledema, and focal neurologic signs (eg, cranial nerve palsies).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>FVL may also present with unexplained <strong>recurrent late pregnancy loss</strong>, possibly related to placental thromboses.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Because the clinical presentation of FVL is typically VTE, the differential diagnosis includes other conditions that increase the risk for thrombosis, including inherited and acquired thrombophilias.</p>\n<h2>Inherited thrombophilias</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Prothrombin G20210A</strong>:&nbsp; Has become the second most common thrombophilia.&nbsp; In this condition, patients generate approximately 30% more prothrombin.&nbsp; However, most individuals remain asymptomatic, similar to FVL.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Protein C or S deficiency</strong>:&nbsp; Presents with unprovoked or recurrent VTEs, often early in life.&nbsp; Patients with homozygous deficiency can have purpura fulminans, a life-threatening condition marked by widespread thrombosis and skin necrosis shortly after birth.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antithrombin deficiency</strong>:&nbsp; Presents with early-onset or recurrent VTEs.&nbsp; Homozygous mutations are incompatible with life.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Acquired thrombophilias</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Antiphospholipid syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; An autoimmune disorder that occurs due to antibodies directed against phospholipid-binding proteins on cell membranes.&nbsp; Patients can have recurrent thrombotic events (arterial or venous) and/or pregnancy complications.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</strong> (HIT):&nbsp; An adverse reaction to heparin therapy characterized by thrombocytopenia and a life-threatening prothrombotic state.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Estrogen-containing contraceptive use</strong>:&nbsp; Increases protein C resistance and reduces protein S activity.</li>\n\t<li>Other clinical conditions (eg, malignancy, surgery, pregnancy, liver or renal dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation) that increase the risk for VTE.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These conditions can be distinguished via laboratory testing.</p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><br><br><p>In cases of suspected thrombosis, evaluation begins with a comprehensive history (including family history assessment for VTEs) and physical examination.&nbsp; The Virchow triad is a useful framework for identifying potential contributing factors (eg, stasis related to immobility or central venous catheter, hypercoagulability from pregnancy or underlying malignancy).&nbsp; Those with unprovoked VTE (ie, no identifiable contributing cause) are far more likely to have underlying thrombophilia.</p><br><br><p>Imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis, determine the location and extent of the thrombus, and identify anatomic variants that may predispose to thrombosis (eg, cervical rib compressing the subclavian vein, leading to stasis in thoracic outlet syndrome (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26826.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).<p></p><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation at diagnosis can help assess for underlying contributors and establish a baseline prior to initiating anticoagulation:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count with peripheral smear:&nbsp; This evaluates for cytopenias, which may suggest malignancy or HIT, and red blood cell fragmentation on smear, which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation.</li>\n\t<li>Renal and liver function testing:&nbsp; These tests guide anticoagulant dosing and may identify systemic illness.</li>\n\t<li>Coagulation studies (eg, PT, PTT, fibrinogen):&nbsp; PTT may be artificially prolonged in antiphospholipid syndrome due to lupus anticoagulant interference.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Testing for an underlying thrombophilia such as FVL is not necessary for all patients with VTE, particularly if provoking factors are identified.&nbsp; The decision to pursue testing is individualized; the potential benefits (eg, guidance for management, informational value for the patient and family) should be weighed against the potential drawbacks (eg, limited impact on therapeutic decisions, psychologic burden of a diagnosis).</p><br><br><p>FVL can be confirmed via genetic testing (usually PCR based).&nbsp; Functional testing that assesses for APC resistance can also screen for FVL, but they are less widely available and used less frequently.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of FVL is determined primarily by clinical status (ie, whether the patient developed VTE), rather than the FVL status alone.</p>\n<h2>Patients with FVL and VTE</h2><br><br><p>The goals of treating VTEs are to resolve the existing thrombus, prevent extension or embolization, reduce the risk for recurrence, and minimize long-term complications (eg, postthrombotic syndrome, a chronic condition marked by pain, edema, and venous insufficiency following DVTs).</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Initial management:&nbsp; Initial management involves standard anticoagulation (eg, direct oral anticoagulants).</li>\n\t<li>Long-term management:&nbsp; The duration of anticoagulation should be determined by the risk for recurrence versus the risk for bleeding.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Short duration (typically 3 months because the risk for recurrence is highest during this period):&nbsp; Applies to most patients with a single episode of provoked VTE (ie, related to a known transient prothrombotic risk factor beyond FVL).</li>\n\t\t<li>Longer duration (&gt;6-12 months):&nbsp; Considered in provoked VTEs with ongoing risk factors beyond FVL (eg, pregnancy, prolonged immobility).&nbsp; Indefinite anticoagulation may be considered in those with a very high risk for recurrence (eg, VTE in FVL with no other provoking factors).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Patients with FVL and no VTE</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>General education:&nbsp; Should be provided regarding signs and symptoms of VTEs, avoidance of estrogen-containing contraceptives, and lifestyle modifications to reduce the thrombotic risk (eg, encouraging mobility during prolonged travel).</li>\n\t<li>Prophylactic anticoagulation:&nbsp; Generally not recommended but may be considered during high-risk situations (eg, surgery, pregnancy), particularly in patients who have homozygous mutations, coinherit other thrombophilias, or have a family history of early or severe VTEs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited form of thrombophilia.&nbsp; It is caused by a specific genetic mutation in the <em>F5</em> gene, which encodes clotting factor V.&nbsp; This mutation leads to factor V becoming resistant to activated protein C, one of the natural anticoagulants, increasing the risk for clot formation.&nbsp; Diagnosis is confirmed through genetic testing.&nbsp; Management is individualized and guided primarily by the patient's clinical status.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
