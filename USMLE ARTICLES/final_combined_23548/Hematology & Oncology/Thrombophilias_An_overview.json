Individuals with thrombophilia are at increased risk for primarily venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Hemostasis is a tightly regulated physiologic process that preserves vascular integrity by forming and stabilizing platelet-rich clots in response to vascular injury.&nbsp; Disruption in the balance of this system can lead to thrombosis, the pathologic formation of a thrombus (clot) that obstructs blood flow.&nbsp; Thrombosis typically results from an interplay of 3 independent but related processes known as the Virchow triad:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Abnormal blood flow (eg, blood stasis from immobility, presence of foreign device [eg, central venous catheter]).</li>\n\t<li>Endothelial damage (eg, due to trauma or inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis).</li>\n\t<li>Hypercoagulability (ie, increased intrinsic tendency for clot formation), often seen in inherited or acquired thrombophilias.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>These factors provide a conceptual framework for evaluating patients with thrombotic disorders.&nbsp; Venous thromboses are more closely linked to hypercoagulability and therefore to thrombophilias.&nbsp; In contrast, arterial thromboses are more closely linked to vascular abnormalities such as atherosclerosis.&nbsp; This distinction may be due to differences in hemodynamics between the venous and the arterial systems.&nbsp; For example, slow venous flow velocity promotes the accumulation and activation of clotting factors, particularly with underlying hypercoagulability; rapid arterial flow velocity promotes thrombosis primarily when vascular endothelial integrity is disrupted.</p>\n<h1>Types of thrombophilia</h1><br><br><p>Thrombophilias can be due to inherited genetic conditions or conditions acquired after birth.</p><br><br><p><strong>Notable inherited thrombophilias</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Increased activity of procoagulant factors:&nbsp; Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation.</li>\n\t<li>Deficiency of natural anticoagulants:&nbsp; Antithrombin (AT) deficiency, protein C or S deficiency.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Notable acquired thrombophilias</strong></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Antiphospholipid syndrome.</li>\n\t<li>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.</li>\n\t<li>Estrogen-containing contraceptive use.</li>\n\t<li>Other clinical conditions (eg, malignancy, surgery, pregnancy, liver or renal dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>This article focuses on the inherited thrombophilias and antiphospholipid syndrome, conditions commonly evaluated as underlying thrombophilias.</p>\n<h2>Factor V Leiden</h2><br><br><p>During hemostasis, activated factor V (factor Va) amplifies thrombin generation, thereby promoting fibrin clot formation and stabilization (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L9709.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; To prevent excessive clot propagation, activated protein C (APC) functions as a natural anticoagulant by cleaving and degrading factor Va.<p></p><br><br><p>Factor V Leiden arises from a single point mutation in the <em>F5</em> gene, which renders factor Va resistant to inactivation by APC.&nbsp; This impairment in the normal anticoagulant pathway shifts the hemostatic balance toward a prothrombotic state, leading to increased thrombin generation and prolonged clot stability.</p><br><br><p>Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited thrombophilia.&nbsp; Heterozygous mutations, which account for the majority of cases, confer a 4-fold increased risk for thrombosis compared to the general population.&nbsp; However, given the low baseline incidence of thrombosis in the general population, the absolute risk in heterozygous individuals remains low, and the majority never develop a VTE.&nbsp; Homozygous mutations, although significantly less common, have a dramatically elevated VTE risk, particularly in the presence of additional prothrombotic factors (eg, surgery, immobility).</p>\n<h2>Prothrombin G20210A mutation</h2><br><br><p>Prothrombin G20210A mutation is the second most common inherited thrombophilia.&nbsp; It results from a single nucleotide substitution of the <em>F2</em> gene, which encodes prothrombin (ie, factor II).&nbsp; Although this mutation does not alter the protein's structure, it leads to increased gene expression, resulting in approximately 30% higher plasma prothrombin levels than normal.</p><br><br><p>The elevated prothrombin levels promote enhanced thrombin generation, tipping the hemostatic balance toward a prothrombotic state.&nbsp; Although there is an increased relative risk for a VTE, the absolute risk remains low (similar to factor V Leiden), and most patients with the prothrombin G20210A mutation are asymptomatic.</p>\n<h2>Antithrombin deficiency</h2><br><br><p>AT is a key endogenous anticoagulant that inhibits several activated coagulation factors, primarily thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa.&nbsp; Its activity is enhanced by endogenous heparin found on endothelial surfaces.&nbsp; AT plays a crucial role in regulating clot formation and maintaining hemostatic balance.</p><br><br><p>AT deficiency impairs natural anticoagulation pathways, predisposing affected individuals to early-onset or recurrent VTEs.&nbsp; This condition should be suspected in patients who have unexplained thrombosis at an early age or if a strong family history of thrombosis exists.&nbsp; Severe deficiency (ie, plasma levels &lt;10%) typically results from homozygous mutations and is considered incompatible with life, often contributing to fetal loss.</p>\n<h2>Protein C deficiency</h2><br><br><p>Protein C is a vitamin K–dependent anticoagulant that is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on endothelial surfaces.&nbsp; APC, with its cofactor protein S, cleaves and degrades factors Va and VIIIa, thereby downregulating thrombin generation and limiting clot propagation.</p><br><br><p>Protein C deficiency leads to unchecked coagulation and VTEs.&nbsp; It is relatively rare, and most affected individuals are heterozygous and typically have unprovoked or recurrent VTEs at an early age.&nbsp; Homozygous protein C deficiency is much more severe and often presents in neonates as purpura fulminans, a life-threatening condition marked by widespread thrombosis and skin necrosis shortly after birth.&nbsp; Protein C has one of the shortest half-lives among the vitamin K–dependent clotting factors.&nbsp; As a result, initiation of vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin) can cause a transient drop in protein C levels before reducing procoagulant factors, leading to warfarin-induced skin necrosis in susceptible individuals.</p>\n<h2>Protein S deficiency</h2><br><br><p>Protein S is a vitamin K–dependent protein that functions as an essential cofactor for APC.&nbsp; Together, the APC–protein S complex inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, thereby limiting thrombin generation.</p><br><br><p>Protein S deficiency impairs this regulatory mechanism, leading to an increased thrombotic risk, resulting in VTEs.&nbsp; The clinical presentation is similar to that of protein C deficiency, with most affected individuals harboring heterozygous mutations and presenting with unprovoked or recurrent VTEs, often early in life.&nbsp; Homozygous mutations are rare but can result in severe thrombosis early in life (eg, neonatal purpura fulminans).&nbsp; Similar to protein C levels, protein S levels can be reduced in other conditions (eg, liver disease, warfarin therapy).&nbsp; These transient reductions can mimic inherited deficiency and should be considered when protein S levels are low.</p>\n<h2>Antiphospholipid syndrome</h2><br><br><p>Antiphospholipid syndrome (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35373.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent thrombotic events and/or pregnancy complications in the presence of persistent antiphospholipid antibodies.&nbsp; These autoantibodies are directed against phospholipid-binding proteins on cell membranes, leading to the activation of platelets and endothelial cells, as well as inhibition of natural anticoagulants (eg, protein C, AT).&nbsp; This culminates in a marked hypercoagulable state that predisposes to thrombosis in both the arterial and venous systems (in contrast to the VTE-predominant tendency in the inherited thrombophilias).<p></p><br><br><p>Antiphospholipid syndrome is also a major cause of recurrent pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, and uteroplacental insufficiency.&nbsp; It may present as a primary disorder or occur secondary to other autoimmune diseases, most commonly systemic lupus erythematosus.</p><br><br><p>A unique laboratory feature is an artificially prolonged activated PTT, despite a prothrombotic state.&nbsp; This paradox occurs because antiphospholipid antibodies interfere with phospholipid components in the PTT assay, rather than reflecting a true coagulation defect.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients with underlying thrombophilias have an increased tendency to form blood clots, most commonly VTEs.&nbsp; The clinical presentation varies depending on the site of thrombosis and may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>DVT</strong>:&nbsp; Presents with acute unilateral swelling with pain and/or tenderness.&nbsp; There may be discoloration (eg, redness) and warmth on examination.&nbsp; DVTs most commonly involve the lower extremities.</li>\n\t<li><strong>PE</strong>:&nbsp; Occurs in up to 50% of individuals with untreated DVTs.&nbsp; Classic signs include sudden-onset dyspnea, chest pain, and hypoxia.&nbsp; In addition, patients (especially younger children) may have nonspecific findings such as tachycardia, cough, and/or fever.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis</strong>:&nbsp; Presents with headache, papilledema, focal neurologic signs (eg, cranial nerve palsies).&nbsp; In neonates, seizures may be the initial sign.</li>\n\t<li>Less common presentations:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Portal vein thrombosis</strong>:&nbsp; Often asymptomatic initially; patients may later develop signs of chronic portal hypertension (eg, splenomegaly, esophageal varices).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Renal vein thrombosis</strong>:&nbsp; May have urinary changes (eg, hematuria, anuria) or lower extremity edema, particularly if the thrombus extends into the inferior vena cava.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Arterial thromboses (eg, ischemic strokes) can also occur but are less common with thrombophilias.&nbsp; Patients with an underlying thrombophilia may also have unexplained <strong>recurrent pregnancy loss</strong>, possibly related to placental thromboses.&nbsp; Some patients with mild thrombophilias may remain asymptomatic throughout life and are identified only through evaluation prompted by a positive family history.</p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><br><br><p>In a patient with suspected thrombosis, evaluation begins with a comprehensive history (including family history assessment for VTEs) and physical examination.&nbsp; The Virchow triad is a useful framework for identifying potential contributing factors (eg, stasis related to immobility or central venous catheter, hypercoagulability from pregnancy or underlying malignancy).&nbsp; Those with an unprovoked VTE (ie, no identifiable contributing cause) are far more likely to have an underlying thrombophilia.</p><br><br><p>Imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis, determine the location and extent of the thrombus, and identify anatomic variants that may predispose to thrombosis (eg, cervical rib compressing the subclavian vein in thoracic outlet syndrome).</p><br><br><p>Laboratory evaluation at diagnosis can help assess for underlying contributors and establish a baseline prior to initiating anticoagulation:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count with peripheral smear:&nbsp; Evaluates for cytopenias, which may suggest malignancy or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; red cell fragmentation on smear may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation.</li>\n\t<li>Renal and liver function testing:&nbsp; Guides anticoagulant dosing; may identify systemic illness.</li>\n\t<li>Coagulation studies (eg, PT, PTT, fibrinogen):&nbsp; Establishes preanticoagulation baseline; PTT may be artificially prolonged in antiphospholipid syndrome due to lupus anticoagulant interference.</li>\n\t<li>Pregnancy test:&nbsp; Important prior to initiating warfarin, which is teratogenic.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Testing for an underlying thrombophilia is not necessary for all patients with VTE, particularly if there are provoking factors identified.&nbsp; The decision to pursue testing should be individualized, weighing the potential benefits (eg, guidance for management, informational value for the patient and family) against the potential drawbacks (eg, limited impact on therapeutic decisions, psychologic burden of a diagnosis).&nbsp; For patients with thrombosis, thrombophilia testing is generally <strong>not recommended</strong> if it is the first episode of VTE that is associated with a clear provoking factor (eg, prolonged immobility, central venous catheter).&nbsp; In these cases, the likelihood of an inherited thrombophilia is low, and results are unlikely to alter management.</p><br><br><p>Thrombophilia testing may be considered in the following situations:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Recurrent or unusual thromboses (eg, occurring in multiple sites or unusual locations [eg, portal vein]).</li>\n\t<li>Strong family history concerning for thrombophilia.</li>\n\t<li>Unprovoked VTE at a young age (ie, &lt;45):&nbsp; VTEs in the absence of identifiable risk factors have a high risk for recurrence.&nbsp; Results of thrombophilia testing may inform decisions regarding treatment duration, particularly in pediatric patients.&nbsp; In contrast, for older adults, long-term anticoagulation is often warranted despite whether or not an underlying thrombophilia is present.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In asymptomatic individuals with a concerning family history, testing is considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><br><br><p>The following are commonly ordered laboratory tests in a thrombophilia panel:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inherited thrombophilias:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Genetic testing:&nbsp; Factor V Leiden mutation testing<em>,</em> prothrombin G20210A mutation testing.</li>\n\t\t<li>Functional assays/plasma levels (should be performed after resolution of the illness and anticoagulation has been held, if feasible):&nbsp; AT activity assay, protein C activity assay, free protein S antigen level.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Acquired thrombophilias:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Antiphospholipid antibody testing (positive results are repeated in 12 weeks):&nbsp; Anti–beta-2 glycoprotein I antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant assay.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The management of thrombophilias is guided primarily by clinical status (ie, whether the patient has developed a VTE).</p>\n<h2>Patients with thrombophilia and VTE</h2><br><br><p>The goals of treating VTEs are to resolve the existing thrombus, prevent extension or embolization, reduce the risk for recurrence, and minimize long-term complications (eg, postthrombotic syndrome, a chronic condition marked by pain, edema, and venous insufficiency following DVTs).</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Initial management:&nbsp; Initial management involves prompt initiation of anticoagulation (eg, direct oral anticoagulants), provided that there are no contraindications (eg, active bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia).&nbsp; Additional specific interventions (eg, fresh frozen plasma to replace missing protein C in severe protein C deficiency) may also be indicated.</li>\n\t<li>Long-term management:&nbsp; The risk for recurrence versus the risk for bleeding should be considered when determining the duration of anticoagulation:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Short duration (3 months because the risk for recurrence is highest during this period):&nbsp; Applies to most patients with a <strong>provoked VTE</strong> (ie, related to a known transient prothrombotic risk factor).</li>\n\t\t<li>Longer duration (&gt;6-12 months):&nbsp; Considered in provoked VTEs with ongoing risk factors (eg, pregnancy, prolonged immobility), life-threatening VTEs, or VTEs at an unusual site.&nbsp; Indefinite anticoagulation may be considered in those with a very high risk for recurrence (eg, unprovoked VTE).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Patients with thrombophilia and no VTE</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>General education:&nbsp; Should be provided regarding signs and symptoms of VTEs, avoidance of estrogen-containing contraceptives, and lifestyle modifications to reduce thrombotic risk (eg, encouraging mobility during prolonged travel).</li>\n\t<li>Prophylactic anticoagulation:&nbsp; Generally <u>not</u> recommended, but may be considered during high-risk situations (eg, pregnancy, major surgery), particularly for patients who have multiple inherited thrombophilias or a family history of early or severe VTEs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Thrombophilias are conditions that increase an individual's propensity to form abnormal blood clots.&nbsp; These may arise from inherited genetic mutations or conditions acquired later in life.&nbsp; Individuals with thrombophilia are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.&nbsp; Certain conditions may also contribute to arterial thrombotic events and/or pregnancy complications.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
