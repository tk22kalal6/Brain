Myelofibrosis can arise on its own (ie, primary myelofibrosis) or develop as a complication of other myeloproliferative disorders (eg, myelofibrosis secondary to polycythemia vera).&nbsp; Patients typically present with cytopenias (eg, anemia), hepatosplenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms (eg, severe fatigue).</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Chronic myeloproliferative disorders are a group of neoplasms that occur due to gain-of-function mutations in tyrosine kinases (eg, enzymes involved in hematopoietic growth factor pathways) that lead to overproduction of myeloid cells (eg, platelets, granulocytes) with normal differentiation.&nbsp; The clonal cells in myeloproliferative disorders are prone to acquiring additional mutations that can lead to acute leukemia over time.</p><br><br><p>Primary myelofibrosis is a type of chronic myeloproliferative disorder associated with the clonal expansion of <strong>atypical megakaryocytes</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/43363.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; These neoplastic cells secrete the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta, which stimulates benign bone marrow fibroblasts to produce collagen.&nbsp; Initially, there is marrow hypercellularity with minimal fibrosis; however, as the disease progresses, collagen accumulates in the medullary cavity, leading to extensive fibrosis with the following:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Extramedullary hematopoiesis</strong>:&nbsp; Because the bone marrow is destroyed by fibrotic tissue, hematopoietic stem cells migrate to the spleen and liver, the most common sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis.&nbsp; The proliferation of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic progenitor cells in the spleen results in marked expansion of the splenic red pulp and massive splenomegaly.&nbsp; Peripheral smear reveals leukoerythroblastosis (ie, nucleated red blood cells and immature granulocytes in the circulation, a finding suggestive of bone marrow failure).&nbsp; In addition, the red blood cell membrane is damaged as it passes through the fibrotic bone marrow or enlarged spleen, resulting in teardrop-shaped red cells (ie, dacrocytes) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21943.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cytopenias</strong>:&nbsp; Because extramedullary hematopoiesis is much less efficient than medullary hematopoiesis, there is typically deficient production of ≥1 cell lines (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Approximately 50% of patients with primary myelofibrosis harbor a mutation in the gene for <strong><em>Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)</em></strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11193.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), a nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase.&nbsp; This mutation results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation, and, consequently, the activation of signal transducers and activators of the transcription (STAT) pathway.&nbsp; Once activated, STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus to promote transcription.<p></p><br><br><p>In addition to being a primary condition, myelofibrosis can occur as a complication of other chronic myeloproliferative disorders (eg, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia).&nbsp; Known as secondary myelofibrosis, the clonal cells in these conditions acquire additional mutations that lead to the replacement of bone marrow by collagen, similar to the pathophysiology of primary myelofibrosis.</p><br><br><p>Therefore, risk factors for myelofibrosis include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pre-existing chronic myeloproliferative disorders</li>\n\t<li>Age &gt;60</li>\n\t<li>Radiation or toxin (eg, toluene, benzene) exposure</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Clinical features of myelofibrosis are related to bone marrow failure and extramedullary hematopoiesis, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Bone pain</strong>:&nbsp; Due to expansion of the medullary cavity with collagen.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anemia</strong>:&nbsp; Leads to fatigue and weakness.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hepatosplenomegaly</strong>:&nbsp; Due to extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen.&nbsp; Splenomegaly can present with early satiety (due to compression of the stomach) and left upper quadrant pain.&nbsp; Patients with hepatomegaly may develop portal hypertension, resulting in esophageal and gastric varices and/or ascites.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Constitutional symptoms</strong>:&nbsp; Weight loss, night sweats, and fever due to cytokine release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis and pathology</h1><br><br><p>In cases of suspected myelofibrosis, initial laboratory findings include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count:&nbsp; Typically shows anemia.&nbsp; Platelet and leukocyte count can vary early in the disease process.&nbsp; Because the condition involves proliferation of abnormal megakaryocytes, patients may initially have thrombocytosis.&nbsp; However, as myelofibrosis continues, thrombocytopenia is typically seen.</li>\n\t<li>Peripheral blood smear:&nbsp; Reveals leukoerythroblastosis (ie, nucleated red blood cells, immature granulocytes, and dacrocytes).</li>\n\t<li>Lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid:&nbsp; Elevated due to increased cell turnover.</li>\n\t<li>Alkaline phosphatase:&nbsp; Can be elevated due to liver involvement</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis requires <strong>bone marrow evaluation</strong>.&nbsp; However, bone marrow aspiration is often unsuccessful (ie, <strong>\"dry tap\"</strong>) due to fibrosis (and is a classic presentation).&nbsp; Therefore, bone marrow biopsy (ie, sampling a core segment of bone marrow) is generally required and usually shows hypocellular marrow with significant fibrosis and proliferation of atypical megakaryocytes (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L68310.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Cytogenetic testing should be performed to screen for associated mutations (eg, <em>JAK2</em>) and evaluate for high-risk features (eg, monosomy 7, <em>ASXL1</em> mutation).&nbsp; Evaluation for other myeloid conditions (eg, essential thrombocythemia) that can progress to myelofibrosis (ie, secondary myelofibrosis) should also be performed.</p><br><br><p>Unlike many solid tumors (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma), which use staging to classify the tumor size and extent of disease for risk stratification, myelofibrosis is stratified into higher or lower risk based on a scoring system that assesses for factors associated with a poor prognosis (eg, presence of high-risk genetic features, presence of circulating blasts, severe cytopenias involving multiple cell lines).&nbsp; A high score is indicative of higher-risk disease.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for myelofibrosis is broad and includes other conditions associated with cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, and/or constitutional symptoms, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Acute leukemia</strong> (eg, acute myeloid leukemia):&nbsp; Can present similarly with cytopenias and hepatosplenomegaly from bone marrow failure.&nbsp; Patients with acute leukemia typically have blast cells, not dacrocytes, in the peripheral blood.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other chronic myeloproliferative disorders</strong>:&nbsp;\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Chronic myeloid leukemia</strong>:&nbsp; Can mimic myelofibrosis in the early stages of disease but is distinguished by the presence of the <em>BCR::ABL1</em> fusion gene.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Essential thrombocythemia</strong>:&nbsp; Involves excessive clonal platelet production, resulting in thrombocytosis, which can also be seen early in the early stages of myelofibrosis.&nbsp; However, bone marrow evaluation shows large, mature megakaryocytes, not the atypical megakaryocytes seen in myelofibrosis.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Polycythemia vera</strong>:&nbsp; Similar to the other chronic myeloproliferative disorders, patients often develop splenomegaly.&nbsp; However, polycythemia vera is characterized by an increased red cell mass, and bone marrow evaluation shows hypercellularity, not fibrosis.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Myelodysplastic syndrome</strong> (MDS):&nbsp; A hematopoietic malignancy associated with the production of dysplastic, atypical blood cells.&nbsp; Similar to myelofibrosis, MDS is characterized by cytopenias and bone marrow fibrosis; however, the bone marrow is typically hypercellular with significant multilineage dysplasia.&nbsp; Splenomegaly is uncommon in MDS.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Plasma cell disorders</strong> (eg, multiple myeloma):&nbsp; Can also cause anemia and bone pain.&nbsp; However, serum protein would be elevated with a monoclonal protein.&nbsp; Bone marrow evaluation shows a predominance of plasma cells, not fibrosis.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition to these conditions, metastatic cancer can cause bone pain, cytopenias, and constitutional symptoms.&nbsp; Bone marrow biopsy shows the primary malignant cells with no fibrosis.</p><br><br><p>Benign conditions that result in splenomegaly (eg, acute infections, portal hypertension) can also be associated with cytopenias.&nbsp; However, dacrocytes are not expected on peripheral smear.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of myelofibrosis depends on the presence of high-risk features (eg, monosomy 7, <em>ASXL1</em> mutations) and symptoms.&nbsp; For patients with no high-risk features and minimal or no symptoms, close observation is an option.&nbsp; If symptoms develop or worsen, treatment is supportive, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Exogenous erythropoietin or transfusions</strong>:&nbsp; Can relieve symptoms of anemia.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hydroxyurea</strong>:&nbsp; An antimetabolite that halts the cell cycle at the G1/S phase and can be used to control cell proliferation and improve symptoms of splenomegaly.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>JAK</em> inhibitors</strong> (eg, ruxolitinib):&nbsp; Can relieve symptoms in patients with <em>JAK2</em> mutations.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Splenectomy</strong>:&nbsp; Should be considered in patients with severe splenomegaly that is refractory to medical management (eg, hydroxyurea, <em>JAK</em> inhibitors).&nbsp; However, there is risk for complications (eg, thrombosis, intra-abdominal hemorrhage).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with high-risk features have a poor prognosis, and <strong>allogeneic stem cell transplantation</strong> is the only curative option.&nbsp; However, this procedure is an option only for certain patients (eg, age &lt;70 without medical comorbidities) due to the risk of complications.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Myelofibrosis has a median survival of approximately 5 years.&nbsp; Factors associated with poor prognosis include older age, presence of high-risk features, and severe anemia requiring frequent transfusions.&nbsp; Disease transformation to acute myeloid leukemia is a common cause of death.</p>\n<h1>Summary </h1><br><br><p>Myelofibrosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/79865.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the progressive replacement of bone marrow with fibrous tissue and subsequent bone marrow failure.&nbsp;
