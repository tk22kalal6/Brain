It can arise from a variety of causes, broadly grouped into 3 mechanisms: blood loss, impaired RBC production, and increased RBC destruction.&nbsp; The evaluation of anemia involves integrating clinical presentation with targeted laboratory investigations to identify the underlying cause.</p>\n<h1>RBC homeostasis</h1><h2>Erythropoiesis</h2><br><br><p>Erythropoietin (EPO), which is secreted by the kidneys in response to tissue hypoxia (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L94613.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), stimulates hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow to undergo differentiation, rapid replication, and division.&nbsp; This process eventually results in the production of reticulocytes (immature RBCs), which exit the bone marrow and eventually become mature RBCs.&nbsp; Normal RBCs are anucleate and have a biconcave disc shape with a central pallor.<p></p>\n<h2>Hemoglobin and iron</h2><br><br><p>Hemoglobin, the major protein in RBCs, consists of 4 globin subunits (2 alpha-globin and 2 beta-globin subunits) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L38416.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Each globin chain has an iron-containing heme group that can reversibly bind to oxygen.&nbsp; Fully saturated hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin) is bound to 4 oxygen molecules.<p></p><br><br><p>Recycling of damaged and aged RBCs (and iron) primarily occurs within the reticuloendothelial system (RES, also known as the mononuclear phagocyte system), consisting of macrophages, monocytes, and reticular cells in the spleen, liver (known as Kupffer cells) and elsewhere (eg, alveoli).</p><br><br><p>Key proteins involved in iron homeostasis include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Transferrin</strong> transports circulating iron; due to negative feedback regulation, transferrin levels (also sometimes reported as total iron-binding capacity [TIBC]) decrease when iron levels are abundant.&nbsp; Transferrin saturation (ratio of serum iron to TIBC) is the percentage of iron bound to transferrin and is directly proportional to the level of iron.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ferritin</strong> serves as an iron storage protein; it increases in proportion to total iron stores but also can be elevated as an acute phase reactant (independent of iron levels) in states of inflammation, infection, malignancy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hepcidin</strong> regulates iron bioavailability and is produced by the liver (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L18386.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Increased hepcidin levels, seen in states of inflammation or infection, decrease iron bioavailability by reducing intestinal absorption of iron and release from macrophages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Complete blood count and hemoglobin parameters</h1><br><br><p>Anemia is diagnosed with complete blood count (CBC).&nbsp; General definitions of anemia include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hemoglobin</strong> &lt;11.5 g/dL (females) or &lt;13.5 g/dL (males)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hematocrit</strong> &lt;35% (females) or &lt;40% (males)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In children, anemia is typically defined by a hemoglobin or hematocrit ≤2.5th percentile.</p><br><br><p>Other parameters of RBC health reported with CBC include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)</strong> depicts RBC size; abnormalities include microcytosis (small size, &lt;80 μm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>), macrocytosis (large size, &gt;100 μm<font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup></font>).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Red cell distribution width (RDW)</strong> is a marker of RBC size variability; abnormalities include anisocytosis (increased RDW).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)</strong> depict average RBC hemoglobin concentration and content; abnormalities include hypochromia (low MCHC/MCH).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>A peripheral smear test enables direct visualization of RBCs (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22800.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), assessing for color (eg, hypochromia), abnormally shaped cells (eg, sickle-shaped, spherocytes), evidence of trauma (eg, schistocytes), or malformed cells (eg, target cells).&nbsp; Reticulocytes, which are larger than RBCs and have a blue tint (polychromatophilia (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L69458.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )), can also be seen on a peripheral blood smear (normally 1%-2% of circulating RBCs).<p></p><br><br><p>The significance of abnormalities in hemoglobin parameters is discussed further below.</p>\n<h1>Conceptual approach to anemia</h1><br><br><p>Anemia can be classified into 3 main categories based on the underlying pathophysiology:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Blood loss</strong>, whether acute or chronic, directly decreases blood volume and leads to iron deficiency.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inadequate RBC production</strong> may occur due to nutritional deficiencies, bone marrow failure, or states of chronic inflammation, all of which impair erythropoiesis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Increased RBC destruction (hemolysis)</strong> may occur due to intrinsic defects in the structure or shape of RBC, or external (eg, immune-mediated) destruction.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Understanding this conceptual framework helps guide the diagnostic process and refine further testing.</p>\n<h1>Blood loss</h1><br><br><p>Blood loss may be acute or chronic.</p>\n<h2>Acute blood loss</h2><br><br><p>Associated with precipitating factors (eg, surgery, trauma), acute blood loss manifests with acute clinical signs (eg, tachycardia, hypotension) and symptoms (eg, melena, abdominal pain from gastrointestinal bleeding).&nbsp; In acute blood loss, the hemoglobin and hematocrit initially remain normal within the first 36-48 hours.</p>\n<h2>Chronic blood loss</h2><br><br><p>Chronic blood loss progressively depletes iron stores and results in iron deficiency anemia (IDA); it is commonly caused by occult gastrointestinal bleeding (eg, peptic ulcers, colorectal cancer) and menorrhagia.&nbsp; Due to chronicity, patients are often asymptomatic or have mild, nonspecific symptoms (eg, fatigue); more pronounced symptoms may be present in later stages (eg, dyspnea on exertion, pallor).</p>\n<h1>Inadequate RBC production</h1><br><br><p>Causes of inadequate RBC production include deficiencies in nutrients necessary for erythropoiesis (eg, iron, B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font>) and conditions affecting the bone marrow (eg, malignancy).</p>\n<h2>Nutritional deficiencies</h2><br><br><p>Common nutritional deficiencies associated with anemia include iron, vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/116692.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ), folate, and copper.&nbsp;

Both types are associated with predominant extravascular hemolysis (some intravascular hemolysis may also occur in severe disease), increased MCHC and reticulocytosis.&nbsp; Cold AIHA, unlike warm AIHA, is associated with intravascular agglutination and acrocyanosis (due to the pentameric structure of IgM causing clumping of RBCs) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L40313.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;

The most common triggers are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, diclofenac), penicillins, and anticancer drugs (eg, checkpoint inhibitors).&nbsp; Although medications can trigger hemolysis through a variety of mechanisms (eg, oxidative injury, complement-mediated injury), hemolysis typically occurs when drugs binding to the erythrocyte surface act as a hapten facilitating IgG attachment and subsequent destruction by splenic macrophages (extravascular hemolysis) (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/59785.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 15\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Severe hemolysis can cause back or abdominal pain due to erythrocytosis in the vertebral bodies, liver, and spleen.&nbsp; The time course is typically hours to a few days after drug administration.&nbsp;

The patient's history, risk factors, and physical examination, in combination with CBC, inform the need for targeted, additional testing.&nbsp; One approach (out of several possible ones) is presented here.<p></p>\n<h2>Step 1:&nbsp; Assess patient symptoms and history</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Timing of symptoms:</strong>&nbsp; Sudden, prominent symptoms (eg, tachycardia, syncope, shock) suggest acute blood loss (eg, hemorrhage, hemolysis), whereas chronic causes may be asymptomatic and have an insidious presentation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Associated findings:</strong>&nbsp; These may point toward hemolysis (eg, jaundice, abdominal pain, purpura, splenomegaly, hemoglobinuria), nutritional deficiencies (eg, neuropathy, hair loss, pica), or malignancy (eg, malaise, night sweats).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Family history and lifestyle/social factors:</strong>&nbsp; These can identify likely hereditary disorders; in addition, historical intake covering regularity and heaviness of menstrual cycle, quality and type of diet, and use of substances (eg, alcohol, tobacco) can be useful.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other abnormalities in CBC:</strong>&nbsp; The presence of ≥2 cytopenias (eg, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) suggests a possible bone marrow disorder, whereas marked leukocytosis may indicate infection or malignancy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Presence of comorbidities:</strong>&nbsp; Certain chronic conditions (eg, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disorders) may increase the risk for anemia of chronic disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 2:&nbsp; Mean corpuscular volume</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Microcytosis (MCV &lt;80 μm</strong><font size=\"2\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></font><strong>):</strong>&nbsp; This finding suggests deficient hemoglobin synthesis, as seen in IDA and thalassemia; very low MCV suggests thalassemia or advanced IDA (eg, hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL).&nbsp; However, ACD may also be associated with mild microcytosis.&nbsp; Therefore, the next step in mild microcytic anemia is to obtain iron studies (serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation), which can differentiate between IDA, ACD, and thalassemia (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35096.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 18\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Normal iron studies with an elevated RBC count and microcytosis suggest thalassemia; additional hemoglobin-specific testing should be considered in this setting (eg, globin gene studies, hemoglobin electrophoresis).&nbsp; Note that in children age &lt;2 with mild microcytic anemia (hemoglobin &lt;11 g/dL) and a dietary history suggestive of iron deficiency, iron studies are not needed; response to empiric iron therapy confirms the diagnosis of IDA.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Normocytic anemia:</strong>&nbsp; This category is most common and also most nonspecific because it can be seen in the early stages of a variety of disorders (eg, early nutritional deficiencies, hemolysis, IDA, ACD, hypothyroidism), or may represent combined disorders (eg, combined IDA and vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> deficiency).&nbsp; Therefore, the next step is to assess bone marrow function with the reticulocyte count and assess for early IDA with iron studies.&nbsp; The reticulocyte count guides further testing (eg, hemolysis studies or testing for underlying lymphoproliferative disorders [eg, bone marrow studies]).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Macrocytic anemia:</strong>&nbsp; This is most commonly caused by inadequate cell division during erythropoiesis, as seen in vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> or folate deficiency (eg, accompanied by a low reticulocyte count).&nbsp; Mild macrocytosis can also be seen with hemolysis due to increased reticulocyte production (eg, accompanied by increased reticulocyte count and RDW).&nbsp; Other causes include myelodysplasia, hypothyroidism, aplastic anemia, excessive alcohol use, and medications.&nbsp; The next step is generally to obtain serum B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font> and folate levels, reticulocyte count, and a TSH.&nbsp; If these are negative, a peripheral blood smear should be assessed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 3:&nbsp; Reticulocyte count</h2><br><br><p>The reticulocyte count indicates bone marrow activity; it should be corrected for the degree of anemia (because the count may be \"normal\" but is actually inadequate given the degree of anemia).&nbsp; This \"corrected\" reticulocyte count may sometimes be reported as the reticulocyte index.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Low reticulocyte count</strong> suggests possible nutritional deficiency (eg, advanced IDA, vitamin B<font size=\"2\"><sub>12</sub></font>, folate, or copper), impairment of renal function (eg, insufficient EPO stimulus), or primary bone marrow disorder.&nbsp; The reticulocyte count can also be inappropriately low in the setting of acute bleeding (eg, &lt;48 hr).&nbsp; If the cause is not apparent, iron studies and testing of renal function should be obtained.&nbsp; The presence of other cytopenias should prompt possible bone marrow biopsy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>High reticulocyte count</strong> indicates appropriate marrow response, which can be seen during treatment of nutritional deficiencies, post-acute hemorrhage, and hemolysis.&nbsp; Testing for hemolysis (eg, LDH, haptoglobin, peripheral smear) should be performed if the cause is unknown.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Special tests based on clinical suspicion</h2><br><br><p>Based on results of initial testing and clinical presentation, additional specialized testing may be performed based on clinical suspicion:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Bone marrow biopsy</strong> is indicated if aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or unexplained pancytopenia is suspected;
