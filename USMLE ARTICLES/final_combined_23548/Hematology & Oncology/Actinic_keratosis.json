Although most AKs remain stable, a small percentage can progress to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).&nbsp; Early detection and treatment are essential to prevent malignant transformation.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Chronic ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure induces DNA damage in keratinocytes (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24050.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), leading to genetic mutations.&nbsp; These mutations can disrupt cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation.&nbsp; Over time, these abnormal keratinocytes accumulate and form AKs.<p></p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Chronic sun exposure/history of sunburns.</li>\n\t<li>Fair skin.</li>\n\t<li>Disorders of DNA repair (eg, xeroderma pigmentosum).</li>\n\t<li>Immunosuppression (eg, chronic immunosuppressive therapy).</li>\n\t<li>Advanced age.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>On histologic examination (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L91472.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), AKs show disorganized keratinocytes with signs of <strong>atypia</strong>, such as nuclei that are hyperchromatic (ie, stained a darker color) and pleomorphic (ie, varying in size/shape).&nbsp; The presence of mitoses reflects proliferative activity, and corresponding epidermal thickening (ie, acanthosis) may be present.&nbsp; The overlying stratum corneum is often thickened (ie, <strong>hyperkeratosis</strong>) with retained nuclei (ie, <strong>parakeratosis</strong>).<p></p><br><br><p>AKs are considered <strong>premalignant</strong> lesions on a <strong>continuum</strong> with SCC.&nbsp;

Although SK commonly presents in older individuals, it is not related to sun exposure and has no malignant potential.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Atopic dermatitis</strong>:&nbsp; When chronic, presents with scaly papules (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L46140.png\" alt=\"image 9\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 9</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and lichenified plaques.&nbsp;
