These bites can lead to severe complications, including neurotoxicity, tissue damage, and systemic effects such as bleeding and organ failure.&nbsp; When indicated, prompt administration of antivenom can prevent further injury and may be crucial to ensuring survival and minimizing long-term effects.</p>\n<h1>Classification and characteristics</h1><br><br><p>The most common snakes to cause dangerous bites in humans come from the Viperidae and Elapidae families.&nbsp; In North America, the most frequently encountered venomous snakes belong to the pit viper group (Viperidae family, Crotalinae subfamily); the coral snake (Elapidae family) is encountered much less frequently.</p>\n<h2>Viperidae family (including Crotalinae subfamily)</h2><br><br><p>Toxins from snakes in this family typically cause more local effects (eg, local tissue necrosis); however, coagulopathy, hemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, or acute kidney injury can also occur.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Viper:&nbsp; Russell's, carpet, saw-scaled, Gaboon\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Found in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Europe, and the Middle East (not native to Australia)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Pit viper (Crotalinae subfamily):&nbsp; rattlesnake, cottonmouth, copperhead\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Found throughout the United States, mainly in the Southeast and Southwest</li>\n\t\t<li>Accounts for the majority of the medically significant snakebites in North America (~10,000 bites per year)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Snakes from this family typically have folding, long fangs; triangular heads; and an abrupt transition between the head and the body.</p>\n<h2>Elapidae family</h2><br><br><p>Toxins from snakes in this family typically cause systemic effects, with many causing neurotoxicity, such as flaccid paralysis.&nbsp; They can also lead to local tissue damage (eg, necrosis), coagulopathy, hemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Cobras, kraits, mambas, Taipans, tiger snakes, copperheads (Australian), death adders (Australia and New Guinea), black snakes (Australia), and brown snakes (Australia)\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Found throughout tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, South America, the Middle East, and Australia</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Coral snakes (including the Eastern and Texas coral snake)\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Found in southeastern United States, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas.&nbsp; Usually a brightly colored red, yellow, and black snake.&nbsp; In general, the rhyme \"red on yellow, kill a fellow; red on black, venom lack\" is true, but color variants do occur, which can be misleading.</li>\n\t\t<li>Bites are uncommon (~100 bites per year in the United States)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Elapid snakes typically have shorter fangs, a less triangular head, and a more gradual transition between the head and body than snakes in the Viperidae family.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation and pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Symptoms of a snakebite can range from mild local pain to severe systemic manifestations.&nbsp; Snake venom comprises a mixture of proteins, enzymes, and other molecules that can cause a wide range of effects on the human body.&nbsp; These effects can be broadly categorized into local and systemic effects and explain most manifestations of a snakebite (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/61898.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Local effects at the bite site</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Tissue damage and inflammation:</strong>&nbsp; pain, swelling, bruising, and potential tissue necrosis at the bite site.&nbsp; These manifestations reflect the following pathophysiologic effects:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Venom enzymes</strong> (eg, phospholipase A2, phosphodiesterases, hyaluronidases, peptidases, metalloproteinases):&nbsp; These enzymes cause local tissue destruction through a variety of mechanisms, including degradation of tissue, disruption of cell membranes, and direct injury to blood vessels.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Systemic effects</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Neurotoxicity:</strong>&nbsp; paralysis that typically starts with smaller muscles (causing ophthalmoplegia and ptosis) potentially progressing to larger muscles such as the diaphragm, leading to respiratory failure.&nbsp; These manifestations reflect the following pathophysiologic effects:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Neurotoxins:</strong>&nbsp; Postsynaptic neurotoxins bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, inhibiting acetylcholine binding and preventing muscle fiber depolarization, leading to paralysis.&nbsp; Presynaptic neurotoxins inhibit acetylcholine release (in some cases by blocking calcium influx, crucial for neurotransmitter release).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Coagulopathy:</strong>&nbsp; hemorrhage (external and internal), hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinuria, thrombocytopenia, and low fibrinogen levels.&nbsp; Rarely, clotting and thrombosis can occur (eg, Martinique viper venom), which may result in deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, and cerebral infarction.&nbsp; These manifestations reflect the following pathophysiologic effects:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Anticoagulant and procoagulant activity:</strong>&nbsp; Some venoms inhibit clotting factors or platelet aggregation, leading to spontaneous bleeding.&nbsp; Venom-induced procoagulants (eg, thrombin-like enzymes) cause uncontrolled coagulation, consuming clotting factors and platelets, resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Myotoxicity:</strong>&nbsp; rhabdomyolysis, muscle pain, elevated creatine kinase levels, severe tissue necrosis, and compartment syndrome (a rare complication of a snakebite, that can be confused with local venom effects).&nbsp; These manifestations reflect the following pathophysiologic effects:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Myotoxins</strong> (particularly phospholipase A2 isoforms):&nbsp; These toxins disrupt muscle cell membranes, leading to cell lysis and necrosis that cause a release of myoglobin.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity can occur due to direct effects of toxins but are more commonly caused secondary to complications from venom effects (eg, hemorrhage, hypovolemia, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis) on other systems.&nbsp; Gastrointestinal effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, abominable pain) can also occur.</p>\n<h1>Laboratory and imaging evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory testing is valuable for assessing the severity of envenomation.&nbsp; Depending on the snake species involved and the patient's symptoms, the following tests may be indicated:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Coagulopathy</strong> (especially in crotalid snakebites):&nbsp; complete blood count with platelets, PT/INR, activated PTT, fibrinogen, and fibrin degradation products or D-dimer.&nbsp; These tests may need to be repeated frequently.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rhabdomyolysis:</strong>&nbsp; urine dipstick for blood, urine myoglobin, creatine phosphokinase, electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and a 12-lead ECG.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neurotoxicity and respiratory failure:</strong>&nbsp; arterial blood gas and maximal inspiratory and expiratory force measurements.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Imaging studies, such as x-ray or CT scan, are generally not indicated for snakebites unless there is concern for underlying injuries.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Differentiating a snakebite from another condition with similar symptoms is crucial for appropriate management.&nbsp; Key considerations include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Spider bite:</strong>&nbsp; A brown recluse bite may lead to local tissue necrosis, but this process unfolds over days, unlike the rapid progression seen in a snakebite, which occurs within minutes to hours.&nbsp; Although a black widow bite can cause systemic symptoms, the severe muscle pain and abdominal spasms characteristic of black widow envenomation are generally not seen with a snakebite.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cellulitis:</strong>&nbsp; This skin infection is characterized by localized warmth, redness, and swelling, but it usually lacks the rapid progression and severity of a snakebite.&nbsp; Coagulapathy and neurotoxicity are not expected with cellulitis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Guillain-Barré syndrome:</strong>&nbsp; This autoimmune condition typically presents with ascending paralysis, in contrast to the descending paralysis typical of many snakebites.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tick paralysis:</strong>&nbsp; This tick-borne illness causes weakness, but the onset is typically slower than the rapid progression seen in a snakebite.&nbsp; Symptoms may include ataxia or localized paralysis of the face or extremities.&nbsp; Diagnosis is made by identifying an attached argasid or ixodid tick.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Botulism and paralytic shellfish poisoning:</strong>&nbsp; Both foodborne conditions can cause rapid onset of neurologic symptoms, such as cranial nerve dysfunction, muscle weakness, and respiratory failure.&nbsp; However, there is usually a history of recent ingestion of high-risk foods, such as home-canned goods (botulism) or shellfish (paralytic shellfish poisoning).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Myasthenia gravis:</strong>&nbsp; This autoimmune condition can present with ocular (eg, ptosis, diplopia) and bulbar (eg, dysphagia) symptoms; however, they are usually fluctuating and the muscle weakness typically worsens with activity and improves with rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><h2>Overall management approach</h2><br><br><p>Immediate first aid for all snakebites include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Immobilize the bitten limb and place it at the level of the heart in patients at risk for local tissue injury (typically bites from North American snakes) and below in the heart in patients at risk for systemic toxicity.&nbsp; Pressure immobilization (elastic bandage applied to the affected limb to delay venom spread) is recommended for some snakebites, but is not recommended for crotalid snakebites (believed to worsen local tissue necrosis).</li>\n\t<li>Avoid any attempts at venom extraction or tourniquet application.</li>\n\t<li>Do not allow patients to exert themselves (local muscle contraction may increase snake venom absorption) and do not manipulate the wound.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients who report possible venomous snakebites should receive cardiac monitoring and continuous pulse oximetry, undergo initial laboratory testing (eg, hematologic and coagulation testing), and be monitored for signs of toxicity.&nbsp; Close monitoring for signs of toxicity is essential, with frequent wound examinations (eg, every 15 min) and ongoing surveillance for systemic effects to detect any progression of envenomation.</p><br><br><p>Definitive management varies based on the snake species, the severity of envenomation, and the availability of specific antivenom.&nbsp; Antivenom is the primary treatment for severe snakebites, but due to its potential risks (most significantly anaphylaxis) and high cost, it is typically reserved for cases of significant envenomation and administered under the guidance of local or regional poison control centers.</p><br><br><p>Crotalid and coral snakebites are the most common venomous snake encounters in North America.&nbsp; The specific management of these snakebites is detailed below:</p>\n<h2>Management of crotalid snakebites (from Viperidae family, Crotalinae subfamily)</h2><br><br><p>Crotalid snakebites are from pit vipers (rattlesnakes, cottonmouths, copperheads).&nbsp; In addition to the standard management of snakebites, patients who experince a crotalid bite should be managed as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Dry bite</strong> (no envenomation) <strong>or mild envenomation</strong> (mild, localized swelling; normal laboratory studies) does not require antivenom.&nbsp; Patients should be closely observed (at least 12-24 hr) with laboratory monitoring (eg, obtaining hematologic and coagulation studies every few hours).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Moderate to severe envenomation</strong> (unstable vital signs, rapidly progressing changes in wound, or abnormal coagulation studies) requires antivenom.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Antivenom</strong></p><br><br><p>There are 2 types of antivenom for North American crotalid snakebites:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab (ovine), brand name CroFab<font size=\"2\"><sup>®</sup></font> (FabAV)</li>\n\t<li>Crotalidae Immune F(ab')2 (equine), brand name Anavip<font size=\"2\"><sup>®</sup></font> (Fab2AV)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Dosage will vary depending on the severity of the snakebite.&nbsp; After administration, close monitoring is indicated; in particular, hematologic studies should be repeated at frequent intervals (eg, every 1-4 hr) to confirm improvement in coagulation values (eg, coagulation studies, fibrinogen, D-dimer).</p><br><br><p>Complications of antivenom administration include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Anaphylaxis:</strong>&nbsp; Treatment with either antivenom carries a significant risk for anaphylaxis and should be performed in consultation with a regional poison control center.&nbsp; Patients receiving antivenom should be closely monitored for signs of anaphylaxis (which may be serious and require epinephrine and mechanical ventilation).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Late hematotoxicity</strong> (recurrent, delayed onset, or persistent thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT, and/or decreased fibrinogen):&nbsp; This effect can occur hours to days after initial control of symptoms is achieved; therefore, patients must be closely monitored for a prolonged period (eg, several days) even after the symptoms have stopped progressing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Serum sickness:</strong>&nbsp; This type of hypersensitivity reaction can occur 7-14 days after receiving antivenom.&nbsp; Symptoms include fever, rash, arthralgia, and lymphadenopathy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Management of coral snakebites (from Elapidae family)</h2><br><br><p>These snakebites are from Eastern or Texas coral snakes.&nbsp; All patients should be observed for 24 hours due to risk for delayed neurotoxicity (eg, bulbar weakness, muscle weakness) and respiratory failure (eg, continuous capnography, serial pulmonary function test measurements).</p><br><br><p><strong>Antivenom</strong></p><br><br><p>In the presence of neuromuscular or other systemic findings of envenomation, North American coral snake antivenom should be administered in consultation with a regional poison control center.&nbsp; The primary risk for treatment with an antivenom is anaphylaxis.</p><br><br><p>For snakebites by coral snakes located in other regions (eg, Mexico, Central America, South America) antivenom should be administered.&nbsp; Obtaining this antivenom can usually be done with assistance from regional and international poison control centers (local zoos can also be helpful).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of snakebites varies widely depending on the type of snake, the amount of venom injected, and the timeliness of medical intervention.&nbsp; Early and appropriate treatment can significantly improve outcomes.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Snake envenomation can result in life-threatening systemic toxicities.&nbsp; In North America, snakebites are predominantly caused by crotalid (pit viper) and coral snakes.&nbsp; Crotalid envenomations typically lead to localized pain and swelling, with possible systemic effects such as coagulopathy, whereas coral snakebites primarily induce neurotoxic effects, including muscle weakness and respiratory failure.&nbsp; Management involves immobilization of the affected limb, urgent transport to a medical facility, and continuous monitoring of the patient's condition.&nbsp; Antivenom is critical for moderate to severe envenomations, and timely intervention is essential to minimize complications and optimize patient outcomes.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
