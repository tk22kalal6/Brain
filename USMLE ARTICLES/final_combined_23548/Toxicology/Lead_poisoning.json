Exposure to lead can cause significant health consequences, particularly in children.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Lead can enter the human body via the lungs (eg, inhalation of lead dust), intestinal tract (eg, ingestion of lead-contaminated food), and, to a lesser extent, the skin (eg, handling of lead-contaminated products).&nbsp; The majority of absorbed lead is excreted in the urine or bile, and the remainder is distributed and retained in 3 main compartments: blood, soft-tissue organs (eg, brain, kidneys), and skeleton.&nbsp; On entry, lead is first distributed to the blood, where 99% is bound to erythrocytes.&nbsp; The remaining 1% is free-floating in plasma and subsequently distributed to soft-tissue organs and the skeleton.&nbsp; Lead in the blood and soft tissues has a half life of about 1 month.&nbsp; Conversely, lead distributed to the skeleton has a much longer half life (about 25 years).&nbsp; About 70%-95% of the total body burden of lead is within the skeleton, which serves as an endogenous source of lead as it leaches out over decades, even if the original exogenous source has been removed.</p><br><br><p>Lead has no physiologic function in the human body.&nbsp; Instead, it interferes with essential biochemical structures and processes (eg, binding sulfhydryl groups on proteins, competing with calcium in calcium-dependent cellular functions), and affecting multiple organ systems, including the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Neurologic</strong>:&nbsp; Lead disrupts neurotransmitter function, alters neuronal development, and induces oxidative stress, leading to cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbances.&nbsp; Severe lead poisoning can cause seizures and acute lead encephalopathy.&nbsp; Children whose nervous systems are still developing are at significantly increased risk for neurologic effects.&nbsp; This is further compounded by an immature blood-brain barrier in young children.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Renal</strong>:&nbsp; Lead can cause interstitial nephritis and interfere with renal tubular function, resulting in hypertension and gout from decreased secretion of uric acid.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hematologic</strong>:&nbsp; Lead inhibits delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (delta-ALA dehydratase) and ferrochelatase (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25947.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), enzymes involved in heme synthesis.&nbsp; Impaired hemoglobin synthesis results in microcytic, hypochromic anemia.&nbsp; Lead also inhibits erythrocyte 5' nucleotidase, an enzyme that degrades RNA.&nbsp; RNA accumulates in the cytoplasm of red blood cells, forming precipitates that are visible on peripheral blood smear as coarse blue punctate dots (ie, <strong>basophilic stippling</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L17408.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).&nbsp; Although rare, high lead levels can also affect enzymes involved in maintaining erythrocyte membrane integrity, resulting in mild hemolysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Environment and diet:&nbsp; Water may be contaminated from corroded lead piping, and food may be contaminated from crops grown in lead-contaminated soil.</li>\n\t<li>Occupation (eg, battery manufacturing plants, automotive repair shops):&nbsp; Employees may inhale aerosolized lead in these environments.&nbsp; In addition, their family members may be exposed to lead that is brought home on contaminated personal items (eg, clothes, car).</li>\n\t<li>Housing:&nbsp; Lead-based paint and other materials can continue to be a source of lead toxicity as paint peels and forms dust that may be inhaled by occupants.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Resource-limited countries:&nbsp; Lead continues to be used in the manufacture of many items (eg, toys, cookware, decorations, traditional/folk remedies) in resource-limited countries.</li>\n\t<li>Age &lt;3:&nbsp; Infants and young children tend to put inedible objects (eg, toys, paint chips) in their mouths.&nbsp; In comparison to adults, children are at increased risk for nutritional deficiency (eg, iron, calcium), which can increase gastrointestinal absorption of lead.&nbsp; Furthermore, the immature blood-brain barrier allows entry of lead into the developing nervous system.</li>\n\t<li>Pregnancy:&nbsp; Lead can cross the placenta and is associated with pregnancy complications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Most patients with lead poisoning are asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms.&nbsp; If present, symptoms vary depending on the organ systems involved, duration of exposure, and blood lead level (BLL).&nbsp; Possible symptoms of lead poisoning may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Neurologic</strong>:&nbsp; Behavioral/cognitive impairment, headache, irritability, peripheral neuropathy (resulting in foot or wrist drop), ataxia, acute encephalopathy</li>\n\t<li><strong>Renal</strong>:&nbsp; Hypertension, gout</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hematologic</strong>:&nbsp; Fatigue from anemia</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong>:&nbsp; Constipation, abdominal pain (\"lead colic\"), vomiting</li>\n\t<li><strong>Musculoskeletal</strong>:&nbsp; Joint pains, muscle aches</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Physical examination is usually normal or nonspecific.&nbsp; However, some patients develop blue <strong>\"lead lines\"</strong> at the junction of the teeth and gingiva due to the interaction between lead and oral bacteria.</p>\n<h1>Diagnostic evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Because most patients with lead toxicity are asymptomatic, screening for risk factors (eg, environmental exposures) with a high degree of suspicion is essential for early diagnosis.&nbsp; Furthermore, irreversible neurodevelopmental effects can occur even with low exposure, so screening for BLL is particularly important for those at increased risk from poisoning (eg, young children).</p><br><br><p><strong>Capillary (fingerstick) blood sampling</strong> is frequently used for a screening BLL, but false-positive results are common due to environmental contamination and improper collection.&nbsp; Therefore, an elevated screening BLL must be confirmed with <strong>venous blood sampling</strong>.&nbsp; The BLL reference value is set at 3.5 µg/dL, corresponding to the 97.5th percentile of BLL in the United States.</p><br><br><p>BLL measures only the blood compartment and does not reflect the total body lead burden (a majority of which is retained in the skeletal compartment).&nbsp; However, because lead from the skeletal compartment (which has a half-life of decades) slowly leaches into the blood, monitoring BLL over time may provide some insight regarding the chronicity of lead exposure.&nbsp; For example, a slowly declining BLL (despite no further lead exposure) may indicate a significant lead burden in the skeleton from prior chronic exposure.&nbsp; In contrast, a rapidly declining BLL suggests a recent acute exposure.</p><br><br><p>Other laboratory testing to consider in the diagnostic evaluation of lead poisoning may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Complete blood count:&nbsp; Microcytic anemia and basophilic stippling support the diagnosis of lead poisoning.&nbsp; The peripheral blood smear may show anisocytosis, microcytosis, hypochromia, and basophilic stippling.</li>\n\t<li>Serum iron, ferritin, and reticulocyte count:&nbsp; May demonstrate iron deficiency (often coexisting with lead poisoning), which increases the rate of intestinal lead absorption.</li>\n\t<li>Renal function testing and urinalysis:&nbsp; To assess for lead-associated nephrotoxicity.</li>\n\t<li>Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP):&nbsp; ZPP level may be obtained to assess the acuity of exposure in patients with an elevated BLL.&nbsp; Because lead inhibits ferrochelatase, protoporphyrin IX cannot combine with iron to form heme.&nbsp; Instead, protoporphyrin IX combines with zinc to form ZPP.&nbsp; Because erythrocytes circulate for approximately 120 days, a significantly elevated ZPP suggests that the patient has had an elevated BLL for at least 120 days.&nbsp; A normal ZPP level in the setting of an elevated BLL suggests that the patient had a more recent, acute lead exposure.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Diagnostic imaging may also be considered:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Abdominal radiographs should be obtained if there is suspicion for ingested lead particles, which will appear radiopaque.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Radiographs of long bones may reveal skeletal changes such as lead lines at the metaphysis due to skeletal retention from lead chronic exposure (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99165.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Patients with lead poisoning are usually asymptomatic but may present with nonspecific symptoms that overlap with other medical conditions.&nbsp; The following differential diagnoses may be considered:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Anemia</strong>:&nbsp; Other causes of microcytic anemia (eg, iron deficiency anemia [IDA]) should be considered, particularly in children and pregnant women.&nbsp; Clinical features of IDA include fatigue, pallor, and microcytic hypochromic anemia, which can resemble those seen in lead poisoning.&nbsp; However, basophilic stippling is not expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Renal disorders</strong>:&nbsp; Prolonged lead exposure can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) with symptoms such as fatigue, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.&nbsp; CKD due to chronic lead exposure would likely be associated with other extrarenal features (eg, neurocognitive symptoms) and can be distinguished by an elevated BLL.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neurologic disorders</strong>:&nbsp; Conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability may present with behavioral disturbances, developmental delays, and cognitive impairment similar to those in lead poisoning.&nbsp; Certain infectious diseases, including viral encephalitis, meningitis, and chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS, can manifest with encephalopathy.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gastrointestinal disorders</strong>:&nbsp; The gastrointestinal symptoms associated with lead poisoning are nonspecific (eg, abdominal pain, constipation), and a thorough history and physical examination are required to identify distinguishing features (eg, delayed passage of meconium at birth) of other conditions (eg, Hirschsprung disease, hypothyroidism).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Because there is no safe BLL, primary prevention (ie, avoiding exposure to lead sources) is the most effective strategy to prevent adverse effects from lead poisoning.</p><br><br><p>Among patients with elevated BLL, the overall goal of management is to prevent further lead exposure and minimize toxicity.&nbsp; Specific management is dependent on severity of exposure (indicated by the BLL), risk factors, and presence of symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Asymptomatic patient management </h2><br><br><p>In general, management for asymptomatic patients with confirmed elevated BLL includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Education and identification/reduction of exposure\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Providing anticipatory guidance on health effects of lead exposure and sources of environmental lead exposure (eg, occupation, housing)</li>\n\t\t<li>Removing or limiting ongoing lead exposure (eg, notification of public health authorities to inspect homes and provide lead abatement, use of respirators and lead decontamination wipes in the workplace)</li>\n\t\t<li>Reducing gastrointestinal absorption, particularly in children\n\t\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t\t<li>Obtaining abdominal radiographs if there is a history of mouthing behaviors to assess need for bowel decontamination of ingested lead foreign bodies</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Addressing nutritional (eg, iron, calcium) deficiencies and avoiding fasting to decrease gastrointestinal absorption of lead</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Follow-up and serial BLLs to assess rate of decline</li>\n\t<li>Assessment and treatment of exposure effects\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Laboratory monitoring for anemia and renal disease and screening for cognitive impairment (eg, neuropsychological evaluation, developmental screening)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Chelation therapy </h2><br><br><p>Chelation therapy may also be considered in some patients with lead poisoning.&nbsp; The benefit of chelation therapy (ie, increased urinary lead excretion) must outweigh the risk for adverse effects (eg, neutropenia, elevated transaminases).&nbsp; For asymptomatic patients with BLL &lt;45 µg/dL, chelation does not improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes when compared to lead abatement alone and is therefore not recommended.&nbsp; Because of the risk for lead encephalopathy in children with BLL ≥45 µg/dL, chelation therapy is recommended, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>BLL 45-69 µg/dL</strong>:&nbsp; First-line treatment is single chelator therapy with <strong>succimer</strong> (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA), which can be administered orally and has few adverse effects (eg, rash, neutropenia).</li>\n\t<li><strong>BLL ≥70 µg/dL</strong>:&nbsp; Combination chelator therapy using <strong>calcium disodium edetate</strong> (EDTA) PLUS either <strong>succimer or dimercaprol</strong> is recommended.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In asymptomatic adults, the threshold to intervene with chelation therapy is generally higher (eg, BLL ≥80 µg/dL).</p>\n<h2>Symptomatic patient management </h2><br><br><p>Patients with symptoms attributed to lead poisoning (eg, encephalopathy, lethargy, intermittent severe abdominal pain or vomiting) require hospitalization for close monitoring.&nbsp; Initial management involves stabilization (eg, antiepileptics to control seizures, management of increased intracranial pressure) and supportive care with intravenous fluids.&nbsp; Gastrointestinal decontamination should be performed if there are ingested lead foreign bodies.&nbsp; Combination chelation therapy with <strong>EDTA plus dimercaprol</strong> (which can cross the blood-brain barrier) should also be provided as it has been shown to reduce mortality with lead encephalopathy.</p>\n<h2>Pregnancy considerations </h2><br><br><p>Management of lead poisoning during pregnancy primarily involves preventing further lead exposure and monitoring.&nbsp; Chelation is generally not recommended due to the risk for teratogenicity but may be considered if BLL approaches 45 µg/dL.&nbsp; BLL should be monitored closely in infants after delivery.&nbsp; For infants of mothers with elevated BLL, breastfeeding may continue depending on the value.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of lead poisoning depends on severity of exposure, timing of diagnosis, and effectiveness of treatment.&nbsp; Early detection and intervention can lead to significant improvement in symptoms and reduce the risk for long-term complications.&nbsp; However, chronic exposure to lead, particularly in young children, may result in irreversible neurologic damage and developmental delays.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Lead (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/36835.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a naturally occurring toxic metal used in many products (eg, batteries, plumbing materials, paint, ammunition).&nbsp;
