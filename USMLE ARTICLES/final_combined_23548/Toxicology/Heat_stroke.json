The condition results from prolonged exposure to high environmental temperatures that overwhelm the body's ability to effectively dissipate heat.&nbsp; Heat stroke is categorized as exertional or nonexertional based on the etiology that leads to hyperthermia.&nbsp; Clinical manifestations include flushed skin, altered mental status, tachycardia, tachypnea, and end-organ dysfunction (eg, renal/hepatic failure).</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The body normally maintains a core temperature around 37 C (98.6 F) through multiple thermoregulatory mechanisms controlled by the preoptic nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L59687.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;

Risk factors include:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Advanced <strong>age</strong>:&nbsp; Patients may remain in a hot environment due to physical disability or mental limitations (eg, dementia).&nbsp; Tonic contraction of the peripheral vasculature limits heat transfer to the skin, and reduced sweat gland density limits the ability to dissipate heat via evaporation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Young children</strong>:&nbsp; Patients have an underdeveloped thermoregulatory system and lower sweating rates.&nbsp; In addition, because of their total dependence on caregivers, patients may experience insufficient hydration, inadequate cooling measures, and prolonged time in hot environments (eg, if left in the car).</li>\n\t<li>Comorbid medical conditions:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Cardiovascular disease may limit peripheral vasodilation and decrease the stroke volume necessary to shunt blood and heat to the skin.</li>\n\t\t<li>Obesity causes an increased propensity to store heat within fat tissue.</li>\n\t\t<li>Alcohol overuse results in a predisposition to dehydration and possible decreased awareness of hyperthermia.</li>\n\t\t<li>Substance abuse/psychiatric conditions may alter appropriate behavioral responses to excessive heat exposure.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Medications</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Anticholinergics inhibit diaphoresis, limiting the primary mechanism of heat dissipation.</li>\n\t\t<li>Diuretics and beta blockers limit the cardiac response to heat stress by reducing cardiac output or heart rate, thereby decreasing blood flow to the skin.</li>\n\t\t<li>Sympathomimetics (eg, amphetamines) impair peripheral vasodilation, limiting heat transfer to the skin.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Most signs and symptoms of heat stroke are similar whether it is exertional and nonexertional.&nbsp; However, exertional heat stroke typically develops shortly after strenuous exercise, whereas nonexertional heat stroke develops more slowly with prolonged exposure to high temperatures.</p><br><br><p>Clinical manifestations of heat stroke include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hyperthermia:&nbsp; core body temperature often &gt;40 C (104 F)</li>\n\t<li>Generalized symptoms:&nbsp; nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, weakness, dizziness</li>\n\t<li>CNS dysfunction:&nbsp; confusion, agitation, slurred speech, ataxia, seizure, coma</li>\n\t<li>Hemodynamic instability:&nbsp; tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension</li>\n\t<li>Hot skin with flushing:&nbsp; skin is classically&nbsp;<strong>dry in nonexertional</strong> heat stroke (due to impaired sweating response) and&nbsp;<strong>moist in exertional</strong> heat stroke, but this is an unreliable sign</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>High core temperatures and tissue ischemia (from peripheral shunting of blood) can cause end-organ dysfunction, resulting in:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Renal failure</li>\n\t<li>Hepatic injury</li>\n\t<li>Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown; more common in exertional heat stroke)</li>\n\t<li>Metabolic acidosis</li>\n\t<li>Cardiac ischemia</li>\n\t<li>Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</li>\n\t<li>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (tissue necrosis leading to release of procoagulant factors)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of heat stroke is typically made clinically based on a <strong>core body temperature &gt;40 C</strong> (104 F), <strong>CNS dysfunction</strong> (eg, mental status changes), and an <strong>environmental exposure</strong> to high temperatures.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Severe sepsis</strong>:&nbsp; is an infection-induced systemic inflammatory response resulting in high fever, hypotension, and mental status changes (eg, lethargy confusion).&nbsp; Evaluation often reveals a source of infection (eg, urinary tract infection, pneumonia), and patients typically lack a history of heat exposure.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stimulant (eg, cocaine, amphetamine) overdose</strong>:&nbsp; severe intoxication can cause hyperthermia, tachycardia, and renal insufficiency, but patients usually also have hypertension (not hypotension), mydriasis, severe agitation, and psychosis.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Malignant hyperthermia</strong>:&nbsp; occurs in genetically susceptible individuals during anesthesia with a volatile gas (eg, halothane).&nbsp; It results in hyperthermia, acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis, but diffuse muscle rigidity is also expected.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; occurs in patients taking antipsychotic medications and presents with hyperthermia, altered mental status, and autonomic dysfunction (eg, tachycardia), but patients also have significant generalized muscle rigidity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anticholinergic toxicity</strong>:&nbsp; can cause confusion, tachycardia, and temperature elevations.&nbsp; However, severe hyperthermia &gt;40 C (104 F) is atypical, and most patients have other signs of anticholinergic toxicity (eg, pupillary dilation, urinary retention).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Heat exhaustion</strong>:&nbsp; characterized by hyperthermia, weakness, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, tachycardia, and tachypnea, but mentation remains normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Heat stroke is a clinical diagnosis, but laboratory evaluation is essential to evaluate for associated end-organ damage and to rule out alternative diagnoses:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Electrolyte levels:&nbsp; Exertional heat stroke is associated with hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia (related to muscle breakdown).&nbsp; Hypernatremia may be present in patients with either type of heat stroke due to dehydration.</li>\n\t<li>Renal and liver function tests:&nbsp; These tests are used to evaluate for acute kidney injury and hepatic injury.</li>\n\t<li>Coagulation profile:&nbsp; Prolonged PT/INR and activated PTT suggest coagulopathy (eg, disseminated intravascular coagulation).</li>\n\t<li>Arterial blood gas:&nbsp; Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis is typical due to tissue hypoxia with associated tachypnea.</li>\n\t<li>Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK):&nbsp; Muscle breakdown in rhabdomyolysis causes elevated CPK levels.</li>\n\t<li>Complete blood count:&nbsp; This may reveal leukocytosis and elevated hemoglobin due to dehydration (hemoconcentration).</li>\n\t<li>Urinalysis:&nbsp; Proteinuria, casts, and high specific gravity may occur due to dehydration and renal injury.</li>\n\t<li>Urine drug screen:&nbsp; Certain substances (eg, cocaine) may exacerbate heat stroke.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Imaging</h1><br><br><p>Imaging is not required to diagnose heat stroke but may be used to assess for complications or rule out other conditions.&nbsp; For example, X-ray of the chest can be used to rule out pulmonary edema (related to ARDS) or aspiration pneumonia (which can present with altered mental status); CT scan of the brain can be used to exclude other causes of altered mental status (eg, hemorrhage, mass).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Emergency and aggressive cooling procedures are required to reverse hyperthermia, limit organ damage, and prevent death.&nbsp; Rapid temperature reduction to 38-39 C (100.4-102.2 F; to avoid overshooting and causing hypothermia) can be achieved by:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>External cooling measures</strong> include removing clothing and applying ice packs to the neck, groin, and axillae.&nbsp; Evaporative cooling techniques (eg, spraying lukewarm water while a fan blows on the skin) are also utilized.&nbsp; In some cases, cold-water immersion is used, but it interferes with monitoring and is associated with increased mortality in elderly patients.&nbsp; Younger patients with exertional heat stroke better tolerate this technique.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Internal cooling measures</strong> include cold IV fluids.&nbsp; Pleural or peritoneal lavage with cold fluids may be required but is invasive.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Supportive care is also necessary during the cooling process.&nbsp; This includes airway management (ie, intubate if patient is too lethargic to protect airway or is in respiratory distress), fluid resuscitation and electrolyte correction, and continuous monitoring of core temperature with rectal or esophageal probe.</p><br><br><p>Because heat stroke is primarily due to impaired thermoregulatory mechanisms rather than cytokine production, there is no role for antipyretic therapy (eg, acetaminophen).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Mortality rates are related to the severity of core temperature elevation, time to treatment/cooling, and extent of end-organ injury.&nbsp; The mortality rate can be as high as 10%-50% depending on these factors.&nbsp; Early recognition and prompt temperature reduction are key to improving outcomes.&nbsp; Exertional heat stroke tends to have a better prognosis than nonexertional heat stroke because the typical nonexertional heat stroke patient is often older with comorbid conditions.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Heat stroke (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/36213.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is characterized by severe hyperthermia and CNS dysfunction (eg, confusion, seizures).&nbsp; It occurs when heat exposure exceeds the body's capacity for thermoregulation.&nbsp; Heat stroke can occur from strenuous activity in a hot environment (exertional heat stroke) or in patients with poor thermoregulatory mechanisms or comorbid medical conditions that limit effective cooling (nonexertional heat stroke).&nbsp; Clinical findings include an elevated core body temperature, hot skin, mental status changes, and evidence of end-organ injury.&nbsp; Management of heat stroke includes rapid cooling and supportive measures to prevent multiorgan failure and death.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
