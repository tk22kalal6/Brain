This mismatch can cause ear pain, aural fullness, and, in severe cases, rupture of the tympanic membrane.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The gas-filled middle ear space is bordered by the tympanic membrane laterally and the eustachian tube anteromedially (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L54953.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Equal pressure between the middle ear and the external environment is essential for normal tympanic membrane vibration.&nbsp; The eustachian tube typically opens intermittently (eg, while swallowing, chewing gum, or yawning) to allow airflow and pressure balance.<p></p><br><br><p>Rapid <strong>changes in barometric pressure</strong>, particularly in the presence of eustachian tube dysfunction (eg, due to an upper respiratory infection), can impair this pressure regulation.&nbsp; The resulting <strong>mismatch stretches and distorts the tympanic membrane</strong>, causing ear pain, fullness, and reduced hearing.&nbsp; In severe cases, it may lead to bruising, middle ear effusion, or tympanic membrane rupture, which can result in conductive hearing loss and mild bloody otorrhea.&nbsp; Most symptoms resolve with time as middle ear pressure normalizes, and barotraumatic tympanic membrane injuries typically heal spontaneously within a few weeks.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Rapid changes in altitude or depth (eg, while flying or diving).</li>\n\t<li>Blast injuries.</li>\n\t<li>Eustachian tube dysfunction may occur due to nasal congestion, upper respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis, or anatomic variations (eg, narrow, straight eustachian tubes are common in children (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25501.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Symptoms of middle ear barotrauma typically have a sudden onset following changes in ambient pressure and may affect one or both ears.&nbsp; Clinical manifestations include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Ear fullness or pressure.</li>\n\t<li>Otalgia (ear pain).</li>\n\t<li>Hearing loss (conductive).</li>\n\t<li>Serous or bloody otorrhea (if tympanic membrane perforates).</li>\n\t<li>Otoscopy may show tympanic membrane retraction or bulging, hyperemia, blood behind the membrane, or perforation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Acute otitis media</strong>:&nbsp; Presents with acute onset of ear pain, fever, and a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane, typically after an upper respiratory infection.&nbsp; Unlike barotrauma, it is not triggered by pressure changes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Eustachian tube dysfunction</strong>:&nbsp; Causes ear fullness and muffled hearing, often in the setting of allergies or upper respiratory infections.&nbsp; Symptoms are chronic or intermittent and are not linked to acute barometric shifts.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inner ear barotrauma</strong> (injury to the cochlea or vestibular apparatus):&nbsp; Marked by sudden sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus after barotrauma or head trauma.&nbsp; Otoscopy is often normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of middle ear barotrauma is primarily clinical, based on a history of recent environmental pressure changes followed by the acute onset of ear pain or fullness, hearing loss, and possibly otorrhea.&nbsp; Otoscopy findings, such as tympanic membrane perforation, further support the diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Routine laboratory tests and imaging are usually <u>not</u> necessary unless there is concern for complications, such as inner ear barotrauma, bony ossicle disruption, or the presence of a middle ear foreign body (eg, following a blast injury).&nbsp; CT scan of the temporal bones and/or MRI of the internal auditory canal and brain may be indicated in these cases.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Most symptoms of middle ear barotrauma <strong>resolve spontaneously</strong> within 4-6 weeks with <strong>conservative management</strong>, which includes reassurance and analgesics (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for pain relief.</p><br><br><p>If the tympanic membrane is perforated, water exposure to the affected ear should be avoided to prevent secondary infection.&nbsp; Topical antibiotics are indicated for tympanic membrane rupture with middle ear contamination.&nbsp; Systemic antibiotics are reserved for patients with signs of secondary middle ear infection (eg, fever, purulent discharge).</p><br><br><p>Surgical intervention may be necessary for patients with recurrent episodes of barotrauma, prolonged symptoms, or persistent tympanic membrane perforation.&nbsp; Myringotomy (incision in the tympanic membrane) can relieve pressure or drain middle ear fluid in severe or nonresolving cases.&nbsp; Tympanoplasty (tympanic membrane repair) is performed for persistent, nonhealing perforation.</p><br><br><p>Patients with atypical symptoms such as severe vertigo, nystagmus, and sensorineural hearing loss should be referred for urgent evaluation to rule out inner ear injury.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Most cases of middle ear barotrauma resolve spontaneously without complications within a few days to weeks, especially when the tympanic membrane remains intact or the perforation is small.&nbsp; Most perforations typically heal on their own within 1 to 2 months.&nbsp; During the healing period, avoiding further barometric stress (eg, flying or diving) helps prevent worsening or recurrence.&nbsp; Although uncommon, complications such as chronic tympanic membrane perforation or secondary infection can develop; however, with appropriate management, long-term consequences are rare.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Preventive strategies to reduce the risk of middle ear barotrauma include avoiding air travel or diving while experiencing upper respiratory infections, using antihistamines or decongestants before flights or dives when congestion is present, and practicing pressure equalization techniques such as swallowing or performing the Valsalva maneuver.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Middle ear barotrauma occurs when there is a pressure imbalance between the middle ear and the external environment, typically triggered by rapid barometric pressure changes in the setting of eustachian tube dysfunction.&nbsp; It presents with ear pain, hearing loss, and, in some cases, tympanic membrane rupture.&nbsp; Diagnosis is clinical, and treatment focuses on symptom relief and restoring pressure balance, often with conservative measures such as decongestants and nasal corticosteroids.&nbsp; Most cases resolve spontaneously without the need for invasive intervention.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
