Normal left aortic arch formation occurs through the specific regression of certain segments (eg, right dorsal aorta) and remodeling of others.&nbsp; Vascular rings occur when certain embryonic arch segments abnormally persist, forming vascular structures that encircle the trachea and esophagus.<p></p><br><br><p>A double aortic arch, although rare, is the most frequently observed vascular ring anomaly and arises due to failed regression of the right dorsal aorta (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14807.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Less common configurations of vascular rings include an aberrant left or right subclavian artery.&nbsp; Vascular malformations that do not fully encircle the trachea or esophagus are not considered true vascular rings and are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally.<p></p><br><br><p>Although there are no known modifiable risk factors for vascular rings, there is an increased incidence with certain congenital conditions, including 22q11.2 deletion syndromes.&nbsp; In addition, many children with vascular rings have associated cardiac defects, such as ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, or aortic coarctation.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Because the degree of tracheal and esophageal compression varies, severe cases may present as life-threatening airway obstruction in a neonate, whereas mild cases may be asymptomatic and found incidentally in an adult.</p><br><br><p>The most common and classic presentation is in an infant with a reported history of \"noisy breathing\" since birth and tracheal or esophageal compression.</p>\n<h2>Tracheal compression</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Biphasic stridor that improves with neck extension (which reduces tracheal compression).</li>\n\t<li>Dyspnea associated with crying or feeding (due to increased airflow and turbulence through a narrowed airway).</li>\n\t<li>Wheezing unresponsive to bronchodilators (because smooth muscle relaxation does not affect the external compression of the airway).</li>\n\t<li>Chronic cough and recurrent respiratory tract infections (due to disruption of normal mucociliary clearance).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Esophageal compression</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Feeding difficulties, such as choking with feeds, prolonged feeding time, and feeding aversion (due to ineffective peristalsis and poor expansion).</li>\n\t<li>Solid-food dysphagia and food impaction (due to ineffective peristalsis &amp; poor expansion).</li>\n\t<li>Vomiting.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Poor weight gain can result from increased work of breathing and feeding difficulties, particularly after solid food is introduced.</p>\n<h1>Evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Evaluation for infants with chronic respiratory symptoms (eg, stridor) typically begins with a chest x-ray to evaluate for common respiratory pathologies (eg, pneumonia).&nbsp; In patients with a vascular ring, lateral x-ray may reveal anterior bowing of the trachea.</p><br><br><p>For those with primarily gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, dysphagia), a fluoroscopic swallowing study often demonstrates a posterior esophageal indentation.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The definitive diagnosis of a vascular ring is made using CT or MR angiography of the chest, which delineates the specific anatomic structures forming the vascular ring.&nbsp; Because a vascular ring is a congenital vascular defect, echocardiography is also performed to evaluate for associated intracardiac anomalies (eg, ventricular septal defect).</p><br><br><p>Prenatal echocardiography may also provide a definitive diagnosis in some cases.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The most common respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms seen in children with a vascular ring are stridor and dysphagia, respectively.&nbsp; It is important to differentiate a vascular ring from other conditions with overlapping symptoms.</p>\n<h2>Stridor</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Croup</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L62857.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

Rapid proliferation of a vascular airway lesion in the first 1-2 months of life can lead to progressively worsening biphasic stridor.&nbsp; Because this narrowing is intrinsic (rather than caused by external compression), the stridor does not generally improve with neck extension.&nbsp; In addition, cutaneous hemangiomas of the chin/neck are often present (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L9303.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Foreign body aspiration</strong>:&nbsp;
