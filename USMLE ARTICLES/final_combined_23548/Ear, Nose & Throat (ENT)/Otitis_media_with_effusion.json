OME is most commonly seen in children, often following an episode of acute otitis media (AOM); however, it may also occur in adults, typically in association with eustachian tube dysfunction.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>A middle ear effusion occurs when serous or mucoid fluid accumulates in the middle ear space.&nbsp; This commonly occurs after an episode of AOM (even when the infection is treated) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25500.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The buildup of fluid within the middle ear exerts pressure on the tympanic membrane, reducing its ability to vibrate and transmit sound to the ossicles.&nbsp; The resultant conductive hearing loss is typically mild and transient, resolving within a few weeks as the effusion resorbs.<p></p><br><br><p>Effusions that persist &gt;3 months can become increasingly viscous due to the accumulation of mucins and proteins.&nbsp; This increases the risk for prolonged hearing impairment and may contribute to speech and language delays, particularly in young children during critical developmental periods.</p><br><br><p>The pathogenesis of persistent middle ear effusion is not fully understood, but 2 main factors are believed to contribute:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Eustachian tube dysfunction</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/91855.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; The eustachian tube plays a critical role in ventilating the middle ear and draining secretions into the nasopharynx.&nbsp; When its function is impaired (eg, due to inflammation or anatomic abnormalities) drainage becomes inadequate.&nbsp; In addition, failure of the eustachian tube to open properly creates negative pressure within the middle ear, which causes a transudative effusion (eg, clear, amber, or yellow fluid).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic middle ear inflammation</strong>:&nbsp; Residual bacterial components or biofilm formation following an episode of AOM can impair mucociliary clearance and promote persistent inflammation and mucus secretion within the middle ear.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The risk factors for developing OME are similar to those for AOM:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Age &lt;2</strong>:&nbsp; Children age 6-12 months are at the highest risk, likely due to the eustachian tube being shorter and more horizontal in young children, which hinders fluid drainage (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25501.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Formula-feeding</strong>:&nbsp; Breastfeeding is protective against AOM and OME, likely due to the relative decrease in bacterial colonization of the nasopharynx and/or the immunologic benefits of breastmilk.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Day care attendance</strong>:&nbsp; Increases the incidence of upper respiratory infections and may also increase the risk for exposure to biofilm-creating bacteria.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Passive smoke exposure</strong>:&nbsp; Appears to increase colonization of the nasopharynx with otopathogens and promotes eustachian tube dysfunction.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anatomic abnormalities</strong>:&nbsp; Conditions including cleft palate, craniofacial syndromes, Down syndrome, adenoid hypertrophy, and nasopharyngeal masses are associated with eustachian tube dysfunction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The predominant manifestation of symptomatic OME is <strong>conductive hearing loss</strong>, although the presentation varies somewhat between adults and children.&nbsp; Adults typically report subjective hearing loss and ear fullness, whereas most children are asymptomatic (or may not verbalize hearing changes).</p><br><br><p>In young children, <strong>speech and language delays</strong> may be the primary indicators of hearing loss from OME.&nbsp; Parents should be specifically asked about developmental issues because these symptoms often go unrecognized.&nbsp; Caregivers may also observe subtle behavioral changes, such as decreased attentiveness or a preference for higher volumes on electronic devices.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>AOM (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L32783.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Characterized by the sudden onset of ear pain and fever, typically accompanied by a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane on otoscopy examination.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Eustachian tube dysfunction</strong>:&nbsp; Can lead to ear fullness and muffled hearing but without a middle ear effusion on otoscopy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cholesteatoma</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45949.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Most commonly presents with painless, recurrent otorrhea; conductive hearing loss is usually present.&nbsp; Otoscopy shows keratin debris, usually emanating from a retraction pocket in the superior portion of the tympanic membrane.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>OME is diagnosed on examination by the presence of a <strong>middle ear effusion in the absence of acute infection</strong>.&nbsp; Key otoscopic findings include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A <strong>dull and retracted tympanic membrane</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Immobility of the tympanic membrane</strong> on pneumatic otoscopy.</li>\n\t<li>Visible <strong>fluid behind the tympanic membrane</strong>, which appears as an air fluid level, bubbles, or an amber-colored effusion (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L32785.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>Landmarks including the ossicles and/or the light reflex are often obscured.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Evaluation</h1><h2>Audiologic evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Audiologic testing (eg, audiometry, tympanometry) can help confirm the diagnosis of OME when otoscopic findings are inconclusive.&nbsp; In addition, audiometric evaluation is recommended in the following circumstances:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Persistent middle ear effusion for &gt;3 months.</li>\n\t<li>Middle ear effusion associated with subjective hearing loss.</li>\n\t<li>Child with middle ear effusion who exhibits signs of speech and language delay or has risk factors for developmental delay.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p><strong>Audiometry</strong> is a diagnostic test that measures hearing ability across a range of sound frequencies and intensities.&nbsp; It helps identify the type, degree, and configuration of hearing loss.&nbsp; Audiometry in OME typically reveals <strong>conductive hearing loss</strong>, especially at lower frequencies, as fluid in the middle ear reduces tympanic membrane mobility.</p><br><br><p><strong>Tympanometry</strong> provides objective information about the mobility of the tympanic membrane and the pressure within the middle ear, both of which are affected by the presence of fluid.&nbsp; Compared to a normal tympanogram (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L121124.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), a tympanogram in OME is flat because the effusion restricts tympanic membrane and ossicular chain mobility (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L121125.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Tympanometry can be used to confirm the presence of an effusion and monitor resolution over time.<p></p>\n<h2>Laboratory testing and imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Patients diagnosed with OME typically do not require further laboratory testing or imaging because the condition is usually self-limited.&nbsp; However, imaging studies may be indicated in certain cases.&nbsp; For example, nasopharyngoscopy is recommended for adults with recurrent, unilateral OME (especially in the absence of a preceding episode of AOM) to assess for eustachian tube obstruction due to a nasopharyngeal mass.&nbsp; CT scan of temporal bones is indicated when there is concern for cholesteatoma, a benign growth of squamous epithelium in the middle ear that can complicate OME.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>OME often resolves spontaneously; therefore, <strong>watchful waiting</strong> for 3 months after diagnosis is appropriate in patients with mild or no hearing loss and without risk factors for speech, language, or developmental delays.&nbsp; In contrast, patients with significant hearing deficits or high-risk features should undergo otolaryngology evaluation.</p><br><br><p><strong>Tympanostomy tube placement</strong> is the mainstay of treatment for effusions that cause significant symptoms (eg, moderate to severe hearing loss, ongoing ear fullness, developmental delays).&nbsp; Most effusions that persist for &gt;3 months will also require tube placement.&nbsp; Tympanostomy tubes are inserted into the tympanic membrane to ventilate and drain the middle ear, bypassing the eustachian tube (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31094.png\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; They typically extrude spontaneously within 6-12 months.<p></p>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>The primary complication of OME is conductive hearing loss and speech/language delays.&nbsp; Without intervention, communication difficulties can persist long after OME resolution due to deficits in normal auditory processing and neural pathway development.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for OME is generally very favorable.&nbsp; Long-term outcomes in children who receive appropriate treatment, including tympanostomy tubes, are generally excellent, with hearing returning to normal after resolution of the effusion.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Otitis media with effusion is defined by the presence of noninfected fluid in the middle ear, most often after an episode of acute otitis media.&nbsp; Although many patients are asymptomatic, the fluid can impair sound transmission across the tympanic membrane, leading to conductive hearing loss.&nbsp; In young children, this may contribute to speech and language delays.&nbsp; Diagnosis is typically made via otoscopy, which reveals a dull, immobile tympanic membrane and evidence of middle ear effusion.&nbsp; Most cases resolve spontaneously, but tympanostomy tube placement is indicated for persistent effusions and those associated with hearing loss or developmental concerns.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
