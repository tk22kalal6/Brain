ET dysfunction (ETD) most commonly arises from mucosal inflammation (eg, allergic rhinitis), leading to functional obstruction and impaired tube function.&nbsp; Symptoms typically include aural fullness, muffled hearing, and popping sensations; the condition may lead to recurrent ear infections.</p>\n<h1>Anatomy and physiology</h1><br><br><p>The ET is a narrow canal that connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx; it opens transiently in response to positive pressure changes (eg, yawning, swallowing, sneezing).&nbsp; Its ability to open is mediated primarily by the tensor veli palatini and levator veli palatini muscles (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L72520.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The ET serves 3 essential functions:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Ventilation</strong>:&nbsp; The ET equalizes pressure between the middle ear and the external environment, allowing for tympanic membrane (TM) mobility, which is crucial for effective sound conduction.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Drainage</strong>:&nbsp; Ciliated epithelial cells within the ET facilitate the clearance of secretions and inflammatory debris from the middle ear into the nasopharynx.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Protection</strong>:&nbsp; The ET prevents the reflux of nasopharyngeal pathogens into the middle ear, thereby reducing the risk for infection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>There are 2 main categories of ETD: obstructive and patulous.</p>\n<h2>Obstructive ETD</h2><br><br><p>Obstructive ETD, the most common of the two categories, occurs when the <strong>ET fails to open properly</strong>, impairing normal ventilation and drainage of the middle ear.&nbsp; This dysfunction is often caused by <strong>mucosal inflammation and edema</strong> (eg, from allergic rhinitis or upper respiratory infections) or <strong>structural obstructions</strong> (eg, adenoidal hypertrophy, nasopharyngeal tumors).&nbsp; As a result, negative pressure builds within the middle ear, leading to TM retraction and fluid accumulation.&nbsp; These changes increase the risk for recurrent otitis media, otitis media with effusion (OME), cholesteatoma formation, and conductive hearing loss.</p>\n<h2>Patulous ETD</h2><br><br><p>Patulous ETD occurs when the ET fails to close normally, creating continuous communication between the nasopharynx and the middle ear.&nbsp; This can be caused by nasal mucosal atrophy from chronic allergies, neuromuscular disorders, weight loss (eg, tissue atrophy), dehydration, and high estrogen levels (eg, pregnancy).&nbsp; Although it typically does not result in acute or chronic middle ear disease, it can cause distressing symptoms, most notably autophony (ie, patients perceive echoing or amplification of their own voices).</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Young age</strong>:&nbsp; Children, who have shorter, more horizontally oriented ETs that hinder fluid drainage (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25501.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and are more prone to adenoid hypertrophy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mucosal edema</strong>:&nbsp; Upper respiratory tract infections, chronic rhinosinusitis, or allergic rhinitis.</li>\n\t<li>Environmental irritants:&nbsp; Smoking (active or passive), environmental pollution, or allergens.</li>\n\t<li>Anatomic abnormalities:&nbsp; Nasopharyngeal mass, cleft palate, or craniofacial syndromes.</li>\n\t<li>Barometric pressure changes:&nbsp; Rapid changes in atmospheric pressure (eg, air travel, scuba diving), which can overwhelm the ET's ability to adequately ventilate the middle ear.</li>\n\t<li>Pregnancy:&nbsp; Mucosal congestion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Sensation of ear <strong>fullness or pressure</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Muffled hearing</strong> or fluctuating conductive hearing loss.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Popping or clicking</strong> sounds, especially with swallowing or yawning.</li>\n\t<li>Chronic discomfort during altitude or depth changes.</li>\n\t<li>Occasional tinnitus.</li>\n\t<li>Recurrent episodes of otitis media.</li>\n\t<li>Otoscopy findings that may include a retracted TM with reduced or absent mobility on pneumatic otoscopy.&nbsp; Long-standing cases: effusion (eg, fluid levels/bubbles), TM perforation, or cholesteatoma.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Otitis media with effusion</strong>:&nbsp; Often arises as a complication of chronic ETD and is characterized by the presence of fluid (effusion) behind the TM without signs of acute infection.&nbsp; It may also cause hearing loss and a sensation of ear fullness.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Acute otitis media</strong>:&nbsp; Presents with sudden-onset ear pain, often accompanied by fever.&nbsp; Otoscopic examination typically shows a bulging, erythematous TM, indicating an active middle ear infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Barotrauma</strong>:&nbsp; Involves a pressure-related injury to the middle ear that typically occurs during rapid altitude changes (eg, flying).&nbsp; It presents with sudden-onset ear pain and aural fullness and may result in TM rupture.&nbsp; Underlying ETD increases the risk for barotrauma by impairing the ear's ability to equalize pressure.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ménière disease</strong>:&nbsp; May present with aural fullness, tinnitus, and fluctuating hearing loss.&nbsp; However, Ménière disease is characterized by sensorineural, not conductive, hearing loss and recurrent episodes of vertigo, which are not typical of ETD.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>ETD is primarily diagnosed clinically, based on the patient's history (eg, recent viral infection, aural fullness) and characteristic otoscopic findings (eg, retracted, immobile TM).</p><br><br><p>Although there is no single gold standard test, several diagnostic tools can support the diagnosis:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Tympanometry</strong> can be used to evaluate TM mobility and middle ear pressure.&nbsp; In ETD, tympanography typically shows negative middle ear pressure.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Audiometry</strong> is performed in patients with hearing loss (eg, as diagnosed by abnormal whispered voice test or tuning fork examination).&nbsp; Audiometry assesses hearing thresholds to define the type and degree of hearing loss.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nasopharyngoscopy</strong> allows direct visualization of the nasopharynx to assess for mucosal edema, infection, masses, or other causes of ETD.&nbsp; It also provides evaluation of ET dynamics, particularly during swallowing and yawning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Laboratory testing is usually not required but may be considered in patients with chronic allergic rhinitis (eg, skin or serum IgE levels) or frequent infections (eg, immunologic testing).</p><br><br><p>MRI of the nasopharynx and/or CT scan of temporal bones is performed in adults with &gt;3 months of unilateral ear symptoms (eg, fullness, hearing loss) and a persistent middle ear effusion to rule out an obstructing nasopharyngeal neoplasm (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L67095.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Imaging can also be used to detect cholesteatoma, a complication of chronic ETD that presents with chronic otorrhea.<p></p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Initial management of ETD focuses on addressing the underlying causes of obstruction:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Allergic rhinitis:&nbsp; Oral antihistamines (loratadine, cetirizine) and intranasal corticosteroids (fluticasone, mometasone).</li>\n\t<li>Nasal congestion/viral upper respiratory infections:&nbsp; Decongestants (eg, oxymetazoline, pseudoephedrine) and saline nasal wash.</li>\n\t<li>Bacterial upper respiratory infections (eg, sinusitis, acute otitis media):&nbsp; Antibiotics.</li>\n\t<li>Environmental irritants:&nbsp; Quitting smoking and avoidance of passive exposure.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In patients without an identifiable underlying cause for ETD, symptoms may be managed with autoinsufflation (a modified Valsalva maneuver).&nbsp; This involves closing the nostrils and gently blowing through the nose while swallowing, which increases intranasal pressure and activates the muscles that help open the ET.</p><br><br><p>Surgical management may be required in patients with persistent symptoms despite medical therapy.&nbsp; Options include tympanostomy tubes (tubes inserted into the TM to ventilate and drain the middle ear) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31094.png\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), ET balloon dilation, and surgical excision of hypertrophic adenoids or a nasopharyngeal mass.<p></p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Many cases of ETD resolve over time or with medical management.&nbsp; In children, symptoms often improve with age-related anatomic maturation of the ET.&nbsp; However, untreated chronic ETD can lead to significant complications, including recurrent otitis media, cholesteatoma, chronic OME, and potentially permanent conductive hearing loss.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Eustachian tube dysfunction (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/57097.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) disrupts normal middle ear drainage, ventilation, and pressure regulation, producing symptoms of ear fullness, muffled hearing, popping sounds, and discomfort with atmospheric pressure changes.&nbsp; Diagnosis is primarily clinical, and management focuses on treating the underlying cause.&nbsp; Most patients have a favorable outcome, but persistent cases may benefit from surgical intervention (eg, tympanostomy tubes) to prevent complications (eg, otitis media with effusion, cholesteatoma).<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
