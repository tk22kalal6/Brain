Patients typically have:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chronic cough</strong> (&gt;8 weeks)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nasal congestion</strong> and/or <strong>rhinorrhea</strong></li>\n\t<li>Temporary improvement of the cough with nose-blowing or sneezing</li>\n\t<li>Worsening of the cough with exacerbation of the underlying condition (eg, periods of high pollen count in patients with allergic rhinitis)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The cough of UACS was previously thought to be due to the production of excessive mucus that accumulates in the throat and triggers a cough to clear these secretions.&nbsp; As a result, symptoms thought to reflect UACS have included frequent throat clearing, persistent nasal discharge, and a liquid sensation flowing into the back of the throat.&nbsp; However, it is likely that the underlying rhinologic condition that induces UACS triggers cough hypersensitivity (a neurogenic component) in which mechanical stimulation to the afferent limb of the cough reflex leads to excessive coughing.&nbsp; This results in coughing out of proportion to secretion production.&nbsp; For this reason, patients may have a predominantly dry (nonproductive) cough and may not present with excessive mucus.&nbsp; Cobblestoning, a physical examination finding classically associated with UACS, is not sensitive.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>UACS should be considered in any patient with chronic cough.&nbsp; In patients who do not smoke, are not on an ACE inhibitor, and have a normal chest x-ray, UACS is one of the 3 most common causes of chronic cough.&nbsp; In fact, &gt;90% of chronic cough can be attributed to UACS, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or asthma.&nbsp; Asthma and GERD can often be distinguished from UACS via history.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Asthma</strong> (especially cough variant asthma):&nbsp; History often reveals shortness of breath and wheezing in addition to cough.&nbsp; Cough triggers often include exertion, cold air, and/or respiratory infections.</li>\n\t<li><strong>GERD</strong>:&nbsp; Heartburn and regurgitation are hallmark symptoms, but GERD can present with isolated throat symptoms including cough, hoarseness, and a sour taste in the mouth.&nbsp; Throat symptoms due to GERD are often most pronounced in the morning.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>There are no specific criteria for a UACS diagnosis.&nbsp; For patients in whom UACS is strongly suspected, improvement in cough with empiric treatment for the suspected underlying etiology of UACS (as described below) confirms the diagnosis.</p><br><br><p>In patients unresponsive to empiric treatment of either UACS, GERD, or asthma, further evaluation should be performed, including a chest x-ray (if not previously obtained).&nbsp; Other possible etiologies of chronic cough may include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Postinfectious cough</strong>:&nbsp; a very common cause of subacute (2-8 weeks) cough, usually with an antecedent illness; certain viruses (eg, COVID-19) may cause this to be prolonged.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other pulmonary conditions</strong>:&nbsp; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pertussis, <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex infection.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Neurogenic cough</strong>:&nbsp; vagal nerve-mediated chronic cough characterized by daytime predominance of hypertussivity (long fits of coughing difficult to stop) and allotussivity (eg, triggered by talking, laughing, nonallergic/nonirritant smells, contact with the external auditory canal).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management should be targeted to the most likely underlying rhinologic diagnosis and may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Allergic rhinitis:&nbsp; allergen avoidance, intranasal glucocorticoids, intranasal antihistamines, oral antihistamines, and/or allergy immunotherapy.</li>\n\t<li>Nonallergic rhinitis:&nbsp; intranasal glucocorticoids, intranasal ipratropium bromide, irritant avoidance.</li>\n\t<li>Chronic sinusitis:&nbsp; nasal saline irrigation, intranasal glucocorticoids, antibiotics, sinus CT scan; sinus surgery should be considered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>Coughing is a violent airway protective reflex.&nbsp; Chronic cough can lead to significant morbidity, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Syncope, posttussive emesis after long, uncontrolled fits of coughing</li>\n\t<li>Urinary incontinence (stress incontinence)</li>\n\t<li>Fatigue, inability to exercise, muscle pain (chest, shoulders, neck), rib fractures</li>\n\t<li>Social isolation/ostracization from decrease in social obligations (eg, attendance at religious services, hobby groups, family gatherings) or adverse social interactions (may be especially pronounced since the COVID-19 pandemic)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>With appropriate treatment, the prognosis for UACS is excellent.&nbsp; Most patients experience significant improvement in symptoms with resolution of the cough.&nbsp; However, if underlying conditions are not adequately managed, symptoms may persist or recur.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Upper airway cough syndrome describes chronic cough that occurs due to an underlying rhinologic diagnosis.&nbsp; An accurate diagnosis of the underlying condition is the most important step.&nbsp; Management is targeted to the underlying cause.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
