It most commonly arises due to the retrograde spread of infection from the face, sinuses, or orbit.&nbsp; Clinical presentation includes headache, fever, periorbital edema and pain, and varying degrees of cranial nerve abnormalities (eg, ophthalmoplegia).</p><h1>Anatomy</h1><p>The dural sinuses are a network of veins that drain blood from the brain into the internal jugular vein (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L15859.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The cavernous sinus lies on each side of the sella turcica posterior to the optic chiasm (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11112.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and is unique among the dural sinuses for several reasons.&nbsp; It is the only dural sinus that receives venous blood not only from the cerebral veins, but also from the facial veins (via the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11690.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; In addition, multiple important structures either pass through or lie within the walls of the cavernous sinus, including the internal carotid artery, abducens nerve (CN VI), oculomotor nerve (CN III), trochlear nerve (CN IV), and trigeminal nerves (ophthalmic nerve [CN V1] and maxillary nerve [CN V2]).&nbsp; Infection, thrombosis, or trauma to the cavernous sinus can damage these structures.<p></p><h1>Pathogenesis</h1><p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis generally occurs due to the <strong>retrograde spread of infection through the facial and ophthalmic venous system</strong>.&nbsp; Because this venous system lacks valves, infections from the face, pharynx, sinuses, or orbit can travel unimpeded into the cavernous sinus.&nbsp; Embolization of bacteria (or other infectious pathogens) into the sinus triggers endothelial inflammation, which promotes thrombus formation.&nbsp; Common pathogens that precipitate cavernous sinus thrombosis include <em><strong>Staphylococcus aureus</strong></em> (most common) and streptococci; other possible pathogens include fungal organisms (eg, <em>Mucor</em>, <em>Rhizopus</em>).</p><p>A thrombus in the cavernous sinus disrupts normal venous drainage from the facial and ophthalmic veins.&nbsp; The resultant venous congestion causes periorbital swelling, eye pain/headache, proptosis, and chemosis (conjunctival swelling).&nbsp; Inflammation and/or compression of the cranial nerves that traverse the cavernous sinus leads to deficits involving CNs III, IV, V (V1/V2), and VI.&nbsp; Because the cavernous sinus has anastomoses that cross the midline, symptoms that begin unilaterally can rapidly become bilateral.</p><p>Without intervention, infection can spread from the cavernous sinus into the CNS (eg, meningitis, brain abscess, subdural empyema) and lead to life-threatening fulminant sepsis.</p><h1>Risk factors</h1><h2>Infectious risk factors</h2><p>Most cases of cavernous sinus thrombosis result from <strong>central facial infections</strong>, especially within the danger triangle of the face (from the corners of the mouth to the bridge of the nose).&nbsp; However, any of the following conditions increase this risk:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Sinusitis (ethmoid, sphenoid)</strong>:&nbsp; Most common etiology.</li><li>Facial infections (eg, furuncles, cellulitis).</li><li>Dental infections.</li><li>Periorbital and orbital cellulitis.</li><li>Pharyngitis, tonsillitis, otitis media, or mastoiditis.</li><li>Immunocompromise:&nbsp; Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chemotherapy, chronic steroid use.</li></ul><h2>Noninfectious risk factors</h2><p>Noninfectious causes of cavernous sinus thrombosis are significantly less common than infectious causes.&nbsp; These causes, which are conditions generally associated with an <strong>increased clotting risk</strong>, include trauma (eg, head injury, facial fractures), thrombophilias, malignancy, surgery, pregnancy, and use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pills.</p><h1>Clinical presentation</h1><p>The clinical signs and symptoms of cavernous sinus thrombosis typically progress over the course of several days (although some cases are more indolent), and many patients have a preceding infection (eg, sinusitis, nasal furuncle).&nbsp; Common clinical manifestations include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Headache</strong> (earliest symptom):&nbsp; Pain is generally sharp, unilateral, retroorbital or frontal in location, and progressively severe.</li><li><strong>Fever</strong>, chills, and malaise.</li><li><strong>Periorbital swelling</strong>, followed by proptosis and chemosis:&nbsp; Due to obstruction and distension of the ophthalmic veins.</li><li>Cranial nerve deficits (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/96701.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Lateral gaze palsy</strong> and <strong>horizontal diplopia</strong> (CN VI deficit):&nbsp;

An infection involving the extraocular muscles and orbital fat that presents with eye swelling, painful extraocular movements, proptosis, and weakness/paralysis of the extraocular muscles.&nbsp; However, pupillary changes (eg, mydriasis), sensory changes over the forehead and cheek, and involvement of both eyes are not expected.</li><li><strong>Preseptal cellulitis</strong>:&nbsp; A mild soft tissue infection of the eyelid (anterior to the orbital septum) that can present with fever and eyelid erythema/edema.&nbsp; The condition does not involve ocular muscle palsies or facial hypoesthesia.</li><li><strong>Cluster headache</strong>:&nbsp; Characterized by severe, repetitive orbital headaches that last minutes to a few hours and are accompanied by autonomic symptoms (eg, ptosis, lacrimation).&nbsp; However, cluster headaches do not cause periorbital edema, proptosis, or fever.</li><li><strong>Migraine</strong>:&nbsp; Typically involves a unilateral, retroorbital headache.&nbsp; Patients typically have a history of similar recurrent headaches, but they lack fever, cranial nerve palsies, eye swelling, and proptosis.</li></ul><h1>Diagnosis</h1><p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a rare condition, so the diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion.&nbsp; It should be considered in a patient with appropriate risk factors (eg, recent sinusitis) and characteristic symptoms (eg, severe headache, periorbital edema) and examination findings (eg, fever, cranial nerve palsy).&nbsp; Laboratory testing is an important aspect of the clinical evaluation, but imaging confirms the diagnosis.</p><h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><p>Evaluation of cavernous sinus thrombosis includes a complete blood count and inflammatory markers.&nbsp; In addition, <strong>blood cultures</strong> are collected to identify the causative organism to guide antibiotic coverage.&nbsp; If thrombophilia is suspected, coagulation studies are indicated.&nbsp; In patients with suspected extension to meningitis, a lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis is performed.</p><h2>Imaging studies</h2><p>Urgent imaging confirms the diagnosis.&nbsp; A <strong>contrast-enhanced MRI with MR venography (MRV)</strong> is the test of choice for detecting thrombus within the cavernous sinus.&nbsp; Findings include a filling defect, sinus enlargement, dilated ophthalmic veins, and dural wall enhancement (due to inflammation).&nbsp; CT venography (CTV) with contrast is an alternative to MRV, but CTV is slightly less sensitive for early or subtle presentations, and a negative CTV does not definitively rule out the diagnosis.</p><h1>Management</h1><p>The mainstay of treatment for cavernous sinus thrombosis is with <strong>empiric intravenous (IV) antibiotics</strong>.&nbsp; The typical regimen includes <strong>vancomycin</strong> (to cover methicillin-resistant <em>S aureus</em>) <strong>plus a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin</strong> (eg, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime).&nbsp; If a dental or sinus source of infection is suspected, anaerobic coverage (eg, metronidazole) is added.&nbsp; IV antibiotics should continue for at least 3 weeks because bacteria may persist inside a residual clot.</p><p>The following treatments are somewhat controversial (due to limited data):</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Anticoagulation (eg, heparin, low-molecular weight heparin):&nbsp; Potentially limits thrombus growth and reduces propagation of clot into other structures, but there is a risk for intracranial hemorrhage.&nbsp; Anticoagulation may be considered in cases of unilateral cavernous sinus thrombosis to prevent extension to the unaffected side.</li><li>Corticosteroids:&nbsp; May reduce inflammation and cranial nerve edema/dysfunction, but may increase the risk for worsening systemic infection (eg, sepsis).</li></ul><p>Surgical drainage and debridement of the primary infection (eg, sinuses, facial abscess) provide source control and improve outcomes.</p><h1>Prognosis</h1><p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a rare condition, so robust morbidity and mortality data are lacking.&nbsp; Current available evidence suggests that mortality is &lt;20% with early recognition and prompt antibiotic treatment.&nbsp; However, many patients who recover have persistent cranial nerve deficits.</p><p>Patients who develop meningitis, brain abscess, septicemia, or septic emboli to other organs have a worse prognosis.&nbsp; Propagation of clots to involve additional dural sinuses can result in increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, ischemia, and hemorrhage.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by the retrograde spread of infection from the face, sinuses, pharynx, or orbit.&nbsp; The infection triggers inflammation and thrombus formation within the cavernous sinus.&nbsp; Patients typically have fever, headache, eye pain/swelling, and cranial nerve palsies involving cranial nerves III, IV, V (V1/V2), and VI.&nbsp; MRI with MR venography is the imaging modality of choice to confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp; Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics reduces the risk for serious complications.</p></div>\n            "
