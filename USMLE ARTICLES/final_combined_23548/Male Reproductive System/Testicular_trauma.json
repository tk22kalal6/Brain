Patients typically have acute and severe scrotal pain, swelling, ecchymosis, and tenderness, often with nausea or vomiting.&nbsp; Minor injuries are frequently managed conservatively, but prompt surgical intervention is required for significant testicular trauma to preserve fertility, maintain endocrine function, and reduce long-term complications.</p>\n<h1>Anatomy</h1><br><br><p>The testicles are a pair of oval organs within the scrotum that produce sperm and testosterone.&nbsp; Each testis is encased by a capsule composed of 2 layers.&nbsp; The outermost layer is the tunica vaginalis, a peritoneal derivative with parietal and visceral portions.&nbsp; Beneath the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis lies the tunica albuginea, a dense fibrous layer that maintains the shape and structural integrity of the testis.&nbsp; Along the posterior testis, the tunica albuginea thickens and extends septa inward, which divide the testis into lobules, each containing seminiferous tubules where spermatogenesis occurs; these tubules converge and ultimately drain into the epididymis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L3590.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Mechanisms of testicular injury</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Blunt trauma</strong> (most common):&nbsp; Sports injuries, straddle injuries, direct blows (eg, kick to the scrotum), motor vehicle collisions.&nbsp; Injuries may include:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Contusion:&nbsp; Bruising of testicular tissue with minor hemorrhage and edema.</li>\n\t\t<li>Hematoma:&nbsp; Localized blood collection either within the testis (intratesticular hematoma/hematocele) or within the scrotum (extratesticular).</li>\n\t\t<li>Testicular rupture:&nbsp; Disruption of the tunica albuginea with extrusion of seminiferous tubules.&nbsp; This represents a surgical emergency.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Penetrating trauma</strong>:&nbsp; Stab wounds, gunshot wounds, animal bites, self-inflicted injuries.\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Lacerations/wounds may involve the scrotal wall and can extend to the tunica vaginalis, tunica albuginea, and testicular parenchyma.&nbsp; These are associated with a high risk of infection and testicular loss.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Degloving and avulsion injuries</strong>:&nbsp; High-energy trauma, such as industrial or machinery accidents:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Degloving:&nbsp; Shearing away of scrotal skin and subcutaneous tissue, leaving the testis exposed.</li>\n\t\t<li>Avulsion:&nbsp; Partial or complete separation of the testis from the spermatic cord and its vascular supply.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Testicular dislocation</strong> (rare):&nbsp; Typically associated with high-velocity blunt trauma:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Involves displacement of the testis from the scrotum.&nbsp; The testis may be located in the inguinal canal, in the perineum, or even intraabdominally.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Iatrogenic injury</strong>:&nbsp; May occur during procedures such as orchiopexy, inguinal hernia repair, or pelvic surgery, possibly resulting in vascular compromise, ischemia, and eventual testicular atrophy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Patients typically present after scrotal trauma with the following clinical features:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Acute scrotal pain (often extreme).</li>\n\t<li>Nausea and vomiting (due to visceral pain reflex).</li>\n\t<li>Ecchymosis/hematoma, swelling, and tenderness of the scrotum.</li>\n\t<li>Palpable irregularity and absent testis (if rupture and avulsion, respectively).</li>\n\t<li>Open wound or extrusion of testicular tissue (in penetrating trauma).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Testicular injury should be suspected in any patient with scrotal or perineal trauma who experiences scrotal pain, swelling, or ecchymosis.&nbsp; Careful inspection for open wounds and abnormal testicular contour or asymmetry is essential.&nbsp; However, pain and bruising may limit the reliability of the physical examination, and scrotal ultrasonography is often required to assess the extent of injury and guide management.</p><br><br><p><strong>Scrotal ultrasonography with Doppler</strong> is the gold standard for evaluating testicular trauma, particularly blunt trauma, when the extent of injury is not plainly visible.&nbsp; Characteristic findings of testicular injury include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Testicular rupture:&nbsp; Discontinuity of the tunica albuginea with heterogeneous, disrupted parenchyma.</li>\n\t<li>Hematoma:&nbsp; Focal hypoechoic or heterogeneous fluid collections.</li>\n\t<li>Hematocele:&nbsp; Complex fluid within the tunica vaginalis.</li>\n\t<li>Trauma-related ischemia:&nbsp; Absent or decreased intratesticular blood flow on Doppler.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Although not diagnostic for testicular trauma, certain laboratory tests are often obtained to assess for associated injuries and complications.&nbsp; In particular, a urinalysis is frequently performed to detect hematuria, which may indicate concomitant urinary tract injury involving the urethra or bladder.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Minor testicular contusions or small hematomas in which the scrotum and tunica albuginea remain intact are typically managed conservatively with analgesia (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), scrotal support/elevation, ice packs, and rest (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/129931.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Follow-up imaging is often obtained to confirm hematoma resolution.<p></p><br><br><p>Immediate surgical intervention is indicated for the following conditions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Testicular rupture, laceration, degloving injury, or avulsion.</li>\n\t<li>Decreased or absent perfusion on Doppler (ischemic injury).</li>\n\t<li>Large or expanding hematoma/hematocele (pressure can impair testicular perfusion).</li>\n\t<li>Inconclusive imaging with high suspicion of significant injury.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Intraoperative interventions may include hematoma evacuation with irrigation and hemostasis, debridement of damaged/necrotic tissue with repair of the tunica albuginea, and orchiectomy if the testis is nonviable.&nbsp; Broad-spectrum antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis are also provided for penetrating or degloving injuries.</p>\n<h1>Complications and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Potential complications of testicular trauma include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Infection/abscess formation.</li>\n\t<li>Testicular atrophy due to ischemia and fibrosis.</li>\n\t<li>Chronic pain or orchialgia due to nerve injury or scarring.</li>\n\t<li>Impaired spermatogenesis (infertility) and sex hormone production (hypogonadism).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Early recognition and prompt surgical management significantly improve testicular salvage rates.&nbsp; Testicular rupture repair within 72 hours has salvage rates &gt;80%.&nbsp; Delayed intervention increases the risk of orchiectomy, infertility, and endocrine dysfunction.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Testicular trauma (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35840.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is uncommon but clinically important due to the risk of infertility, hypogonadism, and chronic pain.&nbsp; Most cases are caused by blunt trauma, and patients typically have scrotal pain, swelling, and ecchymosis.&nbsp; Careful physical examination and Doppler ultrasonography are essential for distinguishing minor injuries (eg, contusion, hematoma), which can be managed conservatively, from severe injuries (eg, rupture, laceration, avulsion), which require prompt surgical exploration to prevent testicular loss.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
