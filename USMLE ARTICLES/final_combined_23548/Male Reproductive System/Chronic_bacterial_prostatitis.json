Unlike acute bacterial prostatitis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/44178.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which typically presents with prominent systemic signs (eg, fever), CBP often manifests more subtly.&nbsp; One of the hallmark clues to diagnosis is recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by the same bacterial strain, despite appropriate antibiotic therapy.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The pathogenesis is not fully understood, but CBP often begins with an episode of acute bacterial prostatitis or a lower UTI that does not fully resolve.&nbsp; Incomplete eradication may result from inadequate antibiotic therapy, antibiotic resistance, or anatomic and functional abnormalities of the urinary tract (eg, bladder outlet obstruction, intraprostatic reflux of contaminated urine).&nbsp; The prostate contains a complex ductal network that is poorly penetrated by host immune defenses and many antibiotics.&nbsp; This allows bacteria to persist within the gland, where many form biofilms that promote chronic infection, recurrence, and treatment failure.</p><br><br><p>The organisms responsible for CBP are typically the same as those causing most UTIs.&nbsp; Infection usually occurs when coliform bacteria contaminate the urethra, then enter the prostate via intraprostatic reflux.&nbsp; <em><strong>Escherichia coli</strong></em> is the most commonly isolated bacterium; other enteric organisms include <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>.&nbsp; Atypical bacteria, including <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>, <em>Ureaplasma urealyticum</em>, <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>, <em>and Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, have also been implicated.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>CBP is most common in young and middle-aged men.&nbsp; Predisposing factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Recurrent UTIs.</li>\n\t<li>Previous episodes of acute bacterial prostatitis.</li>\n\t<li>Impaired bladder emptying (eg, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urethral stricture).</li>\n\t<li>Indwelling catheters, self-catheterization, or recent urologic instrumentation (eg, prostate biopsy, cystoscopy).</li>\n\t<li>Immunosuppression and diabetes mellitus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Histologic examination shows varying degrees of inflammation within the prostate gland.&nbsp; This includes lymphocytic and mononuclear infiltration, especially in the periductal areas.&nbsp; Foci of bacterial colonization may also be present.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The presentation of CBP can vary and is often subtle.&nbsp; <strong>Recurrent UTIs</strong> with the <strong>same bacterial strain</strong>, a hallmark feature, may be the first clue to a diagnosis.&nbsp; Symptoms persist for <strong>≥3 months</strong> and may be continuous or episodic (eg, symptoms improve but recur shortly after completing antibiotics); these include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Dysuria, frequency, urgency, and nocturia.</li>\n\t<li>Pelvic or perineal discomfort, which can radiate to the genitalia, anorectal area, or lower back.</li>\n\t<li>Painful ejaculation or ejaculatory dysfunction (eg, delayed, premature).</li>\n\t<li>Bloody ejaculate (hematospermia).</li>\n\t<li>Absence of systemic symptoms (eg, fever, chills).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>On digital rectal examination, the prostate is often normal (or mildly tender); significant tenderness, warmth, swelling, or bogginess suggests acute bacterial prostatitis.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31146.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; The most common form of chronic prostatitis, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome presents similarly to CBP with pelvic pain and voiding symptoms.&nbsp; However, no bacterial infection is detected on urine culture or in prostatic massage specimens.&nbsp; This diagnosis of exclusion is thought to have a multifactorial etiology (eg, noninfectious inflammation, pelvic floor dysfunction, neuropathic pain).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Benign prostatic hyperplasia</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L40927.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Benign prostatic hyperplasia typically presents with irritative and obstructive urinary symptoms (eg, hesitancy, weak stream, incomplete bladder emptying) caused by mechanical compression of the urethra.&nbsp; Pain is not a typical feature, and both urinalysis and urine cultures are generally normal.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Urethritis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/47242.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Usually associated with sexually transmitted infections (eg, <em>C trachomatis</em>, <em>N gonorrhoeae</em>), urethritis presents with dysuria and urethral discharge.&nbsp; Because the infection is limited to the urethra, pelvic and perineal pain are uncommon.&nbsp; Most cases respond to antibiotic therapy, and chronic or relapsing symptoms are rare.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prostate cancer</strong>:&nbsp; Often asymptomatic in its early stages, prostate cancer may present with obstructive urinary symptoms or back pain in advanced disease.&nbsp; The prostate may be hard, irregular, or nodular on digital rectal examination, and urinalysis and urine cultures are typically negative.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of CBP should be considered in patients with <strong>persistent urogenital symptoms</strong> (eg, dysuria, perineal/pelvic pain) that <strong>recur or do not resolve after antibiotic therapy</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory evaluation</h2><br><br><p>Urine culture remains the primary test for confirming a bacterial infection in the urine and identifying the causative organism.&nbsp; Detection of the same uropathogen on repeated urine cultures in a symptomatic patient strongly supports the diagnosis of CBP.</p><br><br><p>The 2-glass test is the most common method for confirming a diagnosis of CBP.&nbsp; It involves collecting 2 urine samples: 1 before and 1 after prostate massage.&nbsp; During the massage, the provider gently presses on the prostate for approximately 1 minute to release prostatic secretions.&nbsp; These secretions, along with the postmassage urine, are analyzed for bacterial content.&nbsp; CBP is diagnosed when there is a <strong>≥10-fold increase in bacterial count in the postmassage urine sample</strong> or in expressed prostatic secretions compared to the premassage urine sample.</p><br><br><p>In patients with persistent symptoms strongly suggestive of CBP but with negative urine cultures and an unrevealing 2-glass test, PCR testing for atypical pathogens (eg, <em>C trachomatis</em>, <em>M genitalium</em>) should be considered to detect organisms not identified by standard culture methods.</p>\n<h2>Imaging studies</h2><br><br><p>Imaging studies are not routinely required because CBP is typically diagnosed based on clinical presentation and microbiologic testing.&nbsp; However, imaging can be helpful in complex, atypical, or treatment-resistant cases to evaluate for underlying structural abnormalities or complications.&nbsp; For example, transrectal ultrasonography may be used to detect prostatic calculi, abscesses, and ductal obstruction, which can serve as reservoirs for persistent infection or contribute to poor antibiotic penetration.&nbsp; Cystoscopy allows for direct visualization of the urinary tract and may be warranted to rule out urothelial malignancy or structural abnormalities (eg, bladder neck obstruction, urethral strictures).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The cornerstone of treatment for CBP is <strong>prolonged antibiotic therapy</strong>, usually for 4-6 weeks.&nbsp; <strong>Fluoroquinolones</strong> (eg, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) are commonly used due to their excellent prostatic penetration and activity against gram-negative bacteria.&nbsp; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an alternate agent that also achieves high penetration levels within the prostate, but antibiotic resistance may limit its effectiveness.&nbsp; Culture with sensitivity profile should be considered prior to initiating therapy.</p><br><br><p>Sexually transmitted infections are managed with the usual agents (eg, doxycycline for <em>C trachomatis</em>), but the course of treatment is also extended to 4-6 weeks.&nbsp; Adjunctive therapies include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to control pain and alpha-blockers (eg, tamsulosin) to improve voiding symptoms and relieve bladder outlet resistance.&nbsp; Surgical intervention to correct anatomic or functional obstruction should be considered in refractory cases.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of CBP is variable and depends on factors such as the infecting organism, presence of anatomic abnormalities, and response to antibiotic therapy.&nbsp; Many patients experience symptom improvement with prolonged antibiotic treatment.&nbsp; However, recurrence is common (20%-50% of cases) and often necessitates a second extended course of antibiotics.&nbsp; Some patients continue to experience chronic pelvic or urogenital symptoms even after bacterial eradication (ie, negative cultures), likely representing a transition to chronic pelvic pain syndrome, which can significantly impact quality of life.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Prevention of CBP primarily involves appropriate and timely treatment of UTIs and acute bacterial prostatitis, avoidance of unnecessary catheterization/urologic instrumentation, and prompt identification and management of anatomic/functional abnormalities (eg, urinary retention/reflux, bladder outlet obstruction, benign prostatic hyperplasia).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Chronic bacterial prostatitis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/47251.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is characterized by relapsing episodes of urinary symptoms (eg, dysuria, frequency) and pelvic/perineal discomfort for ≥3 months due to a persistent bacterial infection of the prostate gland.&nbsp; Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating a ≥10-fold increase in bacterial count in urine collected before versus after prostatic massage.&nbsp; Prolonged antibiotic therapy, typically for 4-6 weeks, is required to eradicate infection, although recurrence is common.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
