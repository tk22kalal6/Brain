A patient's concern about the inability to maintain an erection during intercourse may precipitate premature ejaculation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic prostatitis</strong>:&nbsp; Chronic inflammation of the prostate and surrounding structures may increase nerve sensitivity in the pelvic area and alter the normal coordination of muscles involved in ejaculation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Medical comorbidities</strong>:&nbsp; Hyperthyroidism is associated with premature ejaculation, possibly due to overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psychologic/interpersonal factors</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Mood disorders</strong>:&nbsp; Anxiety, depression</li>\n\t<li><strong>Stressful life events and sleep deprivation</strong>:&nbsp; Associated with abnormal serotonin levels/function</li>\n\t<li><strong>Relationship issues</strong>:&nbsp; Conflict, performance anxiety, unrealistic sexual expectations</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lack of confidence</strong>:&nbsp; Body image concerns, shame, feelings of unworthiness</li>\n\t<li><strong>History of sexual abuse</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Premature ejaculation is characterized by:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Ejaculation</strong> that routinely occurs <strong>prior to the patient's and/or partner's wishes</strong>, typically within 1 minute of penetration (or similarly short durations for other forms of sexual activity).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inability to delay ejaculation</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Psychologic distress or interpersonal difficulties</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Premature ejaculation is a clinical diagnosis based on the clinical history of uncontrolled ejaculation that occurs sooner than desired.&nbsp; It is important to take a comprehensive psychologic and sexual history, including inquiries about past sexual experiences (such as abuse), erectile dysfunction, life stressors, and mental health conditions that may be contributing factors.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The time to ejaculation during intercourse varies widely from person to person, as do the expectations of how much time is adequate.&nbsp; Premature ejaculation is typically characterized by ejaculation that occurs before one or both partners desire.&nbsp; If intercourse is prolonged because the receiving partner has difficulty achieving orgasm, the other partner may ejaculate too soon.&nbsp; This may not be premature ejaculation but delayed orgasm in the other partner.&nbsp; Alternatively, if the receiving partner is able to climax relatively quickly and the time to ejaculation is prompt but adequate, this is not premature ejaculation.</p>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory tests are not required to diagnose premature ejaculation but may be useful to identify underlying medical conditions that contribute to the issue.&nbsp; These may include urinalysis and serum testosterone, prolactin, and TSH levels.</p><br><br><p>Imaging studies such as pelvic ultrasonography or pelvic/lumbar MRI are rarely indicated unless structural abnormalities (eg, mass), inflammatory conditions (eg, prostatitis), or neurologic problems (eg, spinal cord lesion) are suspected.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Several treatment strategies that may improve ejaculatory control and latency.&nbsp; Management often involves a multidisciplinary team that includes a primary physician, sex therapist, psychologist, and/or psychiatrist.</p>\n<h2>Pharmacologic therapies</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</strong>:&nbsp; Sexual dysfunction, specifically delayed orgasm, is a well-established adverse effect of SSRIs.&nbsp; When used in patients with premature ejaculation, SSRIs have been effective at prolonging ejaculatory latency.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)</strong> (eg, clomipramine):&nbsp; Have SSRI-like activity and produce similar effects of delaying ejaculation, but TCAs have a higher risk profile (eg, arrhythmia).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Topical anesthetics</strong>:&nbsp; Lidocaine-prilocaine cream applied to the glans before sexual intercourse reduces penile sensitivity and prolongs the time to ejaculation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors</strong>:&nbsp; Used for managing erectile dysfunction, which may resolve associated premature ejaculation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Behavioral therapies</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Start-stop technique</strong>:&nbsp; Alternating stimulation and rest to delay ejaculation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Squeeze technique</strong>:&nbsp; Partner stimulates the penis until highly aroused, then applies firm pressure just posterior to the glans until the sensation of imminent ejaculation subsides.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>With repetition, these techniques can help prolong the time to ejaculation.</p><br><br><p>Psychologic counseling with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be used to address concurrent anxiety, mood disorders, and intimacy concerns.&nbsp; In addition, couples therapy may improve communication between partners and address relationship issues.</p><br><br><p>Other interventions can include pelvic floor exercises, which are strengthening exercises to enhance ejaculatory control and decrease hyperexcitability, as well as providing reassurance and normalizing discussions about sexual health.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Premature ejaculation often causes significant psychosocial distress.&nbsp; Shame and embarrassment about inadequate sexual performance can result in poor self-esteem, sexual dissatisfaction, relational discord, and depression.&nbsp; Early and effective intervention improves sexual function, quality of life, and relationships.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Prevention strategies include stress/anxiety management, effective communication with partners, regular medical evaluations, and counseling for psychologic problems.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Premature ejaculation is uncontrolled ejaculation that occurs before one or both partners desire (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/61507.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The etiology is often multifactorial and may involve a combination of biologic and psychosocial factors.&nbsp; Most patients respond well to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and concurrent psychotherapy and behavioral techniques may further improve outcomes.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
