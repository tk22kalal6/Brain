However, spermatoceles require evaluation to differentiate them from other, potentially malignant, testicular masses.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>A spermatocele is a <strong>&gt;2-cm, fluid-filled benign cyst</strong> that <strong>forms in the epididymis</strong>, the coiled tube behind the testicle where sperm is stored and transported (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L25910.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ); cysts &lt;2 cm are referred to as epididymal cysts.&nbsp; These fluid collections result from the obstruction and subsequent expansion of the efferent ductules, which are microscopic tubes that carry sperm from the rete testis to the head of epididymis (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L3590.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; When these ductules are blocked, accumulation of nonviable sperm, lymphocytes, and cellular debris form the characteristic palpable cyst.&nbsp; It most commonly occurs in the head of epididymis but can also manifest in the epididymal body or tail.<p></p><br><br><p>The mechanism of obstruction may involve inflammation or trauma to the epididymis, causing scarring and narrowing of the efferent ductules.&nbsp; In addition, congenital abnormalities, such as underdeveloped or malformed ductules, can increase an individual's susceptibility to developing a spermatocele.&nbsp; However, the precise mechanism is often not evident.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Spermatoceles are among the most common scrotal masses in adult males, with a prevalence that typically increases with age.&nbsp; They are usually found incidentally on routine physical examination as a <strong>unilateral, smooth, round mass</strong> at the head of epididymis.&nbsp; Although they are typically located at the superior and/or posterior aspect of the testis, they are <strong>distinctly separate from the testis</strong> itself.&nbsp; Spermatoceles are generally asymptomatic, but some patients may experience scrotal discomfort or heaviness.</p><br><br><p>When a light source is placed behind the scrotum, the spermatocele <strong>transilluminates</strong> due to its cystic structure.&nbsp; Unlike other testicular masses (eg, varicoceles), the size of a spermatocele does <em>not</em> change with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, Valsalva maneuver).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis and evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Spermatocele can be diagnosed clinically when a painless, distinct cyst is palpated at the head of epididymis and transilluminates during examination.&nbsp; Imaging with ultrasonography supports the diagnosis by demonstrating a well-defined hypoechoic cystic lesion within the epididymis.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Testicular tumors</strong>:&nbsp; Testicular cancer (eg, germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors) can present as a painless mass.&nbsp; However, malignancies are typically solid nodules that do not transilluminate and are located within the testis itself.&nbsp; Some patients may also have endocrine manifestations (eg, gynecomastia) or systemic symptoms due to metastasis (eg, bone pain).</li><br><br>\t<li><strong>Varicocele</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19009.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Dilation of spermatic veins can cause a scrotal mass that is often described as a \"bag of worms\" when palpated; it does not transilluminate.&nbsp; The swelling increases in size with standing or Valsalva maneuvers and reduces spontaneously when the patient is recumbent.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hydrocele</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24839.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; This fluid collection within the tunica vaginalis causes painless swelling of a hemiscrotum.&nbsp; The fluid transilluminates on examination (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L116281.png\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ); however, it uniformly surrounds and obscures the testis rather than presenting as a distinctly separate mass.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Indirect inguinal hernia</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24744.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Intestinal loops can pass through an internal ring defect and into the scrotum, causing an indirect inguinal hernia.&nbsp; Manifestations include a painless, intermittent groin and scrotal mass that appears with straining (eg, Valsalva maneuver) and reduces spontaneously.&nbsp; It does not transilluminate on examination.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Spermatoceles generally do not require treatment because they usually remain stable in size and rarely develop complications (eg, torsion).&nbsp; However, surgical excision of the spermatocele can be considered for patients with persistent pain or cosmetic concerns.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Spermatocele is a common benign epididymal cyst filled with sperm that presents in adult males as a painless scrotal mass at the head of epididymis and is distinct from the testis.&nbsp; The diagnosis is clinical and supported by ultrasonography.&nbsp; Spermatoceles usually require no treatment.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
