Parents often seek clarification about the medical implications of the procedure, including its risks and benefits.</p>\n<h1>Anatomy and natural history</h1><br><br><p>The prepuce, or foreskin (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L64040.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), is a retractable fold of skin that covers the glans penis and typically extends over at least a third of the penis length.&nbsp; Its outer keratinized layer folds over and is continuous with an inner mucosal epithelium; these layers are separated by a central layer of dartos fascia.<p></p><br><br><p>Physiologic phimosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L31411.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), a normal condition in early childhood, prevents foreskin retraction due to natural adhesions between the inner foreskin and the glans.&nbsp; The foreskin gradually retracts over time as epithelial cells shed (forming smegma), and intermittent erections cause the breakdown of adhesions.&nbsp; Most males have spontaneously retractable foreskin by the onset of puberty.<p></p>\n<h1>Epidemiology</h1><br><br><p>Rates of male circumcision, or the surgical removal of the penile foreskin, vary greatly depending on religious practices and geographic location:&nbsp; The highest rates of circumcision performed for religious reasons are among Jewish and Muslim populations, whereas the highest rates performed for nonreligious reasons are in the United States.</p>\n<h1>Risks and benefits</h1><br><br><p>Risks of circumcision include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Postprocedural bleeding.</li>\n\t<li>Infection (minimized with proper application of antiseptic solution).</li>\n\t<li>Procedural pain (if not adequately anesthetized).</li>\n\t<li>Inadequate or excessive removal of foreskin.</li>\n\t<li>Urethral injury.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Benefits of circumcision include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Significant decrease (approximately 10-fold) in urinary tract infections in the first year of life (baseline risk is low in male infants).</li>\n\t<li>Reduced risk for HIV and certain other sexually transmitted infections (eg, human papillomavirus [HPV], syphilis); circumcision does not protect against gonorrhea or chlamydia.</li>\n\t<li>Reduced risk for certain HPV-related cancers; there is a near elimination of penile cancer risk with circumcision due to reduced risk for HPV as well as a reduced risk for cervical cancer in female partners, which is also related to HPV acquisition and transmission.&nbsp; Studies showing this risk reduction were performed prior to routine HPV vaccination, which may have an equally protective effect.</li>\n\t<li>Elimination of potential complications related to having a foreskin, including pathologicphimosis (foreskin constriction preventing retraction), paraphimosis (retracted foreskin that cannot return to its normal position) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L42123.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), and balanoposthitis (inflammation of the glans penis and foreskin).</li>\n\t<li>Increased ease for maintaining penile hygiene; however, in uncircumcised patients, as the foreskin progressively becomes more retractable with age, routine cleansing under the foreskin (retract, cleanse, dry, reduce) can maintain appropriate hygiene.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Most professional medical societies have refrained from recommending routine neonatal circumcision for all male infants.&nbsp; However, they support a thorough presentation of the health benefits and risks to deciding parents so an informed medical decision can be made while taking into account cultural, religious, and personal preferences.</p>\n<h1>Contraindications</h1><br><br><p>The main contraindications for neonatal circumcision include anatomic and general medical conditions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Any current illness or medical condition requiring monitoring.</li>\n\t<li>Bleeding disorders (eg, hemophilia).</li>\n\t<li>Certain congenital genitourinary anomalies (eg, hypospadias (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14403.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), excessive penile curvature [chordee], micropenis, bilateral cryptorchidism, or atypical genital appearance).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Medical management of acute conditions and evaluation for underlying disorders (eg, hemophilia, difference of sex development) should be performed prior to circumcision, and referral to a urologist is recommended.</p>\n<h1>Procedure</h1><br><br><p>In the medical setting, circumcision is frequently performed by an obstetrician, family medicine doctor, or pediatrician.&nbsp; It typically occurs at least 24 hours after birth to ensure that the newborn is stable.</p><br><br><p>After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits, written consent from the parents is obtained.&nbsp; The newborn is then provided comfort with a combination of oral sucrose solutions and injected lidocaine (eg, ring or dorsal penile nerve block), and an antiseptic solution is applied to the surgical site.&nbsp; The foreskin is then manually separated from the glans.&nbsp; With the assistance of a circumcision device such as the Gomco clamp (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99468.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) or Plastibell device (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99484.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), the foreskin is crushed to provide hemostasis and then is excised.&nbsp; Postoperative care includes keeping the area clean with mild soap and water when needed and the frequent application of petroleum jelly to the healing skin.&nbsp; The incision site typically heals within 7 to 10 days.<p></p><br><br><p>Older children and adults who undergo circumcision for elective or medical reasons (eg, persistent phimosis or paraphimosis, recurrent balanoposthitis) tend to have direct incision techniques performed rather than using circumcision devices.&nbsp; In addition, there may be increased postoperative bleeding and healing time in this population.</p>\n<h1>Long-term complications</h1><br><br><p>The overall complication rate for neonatal male circumcision is low (&lt;2%).&nbsp; Potential long-term complications include stenosis of the urethral meatus, development of adhesions or skin bridges, and an unsatisfactory cosmetic outcome.&nbsp; There is no significant effect on sexual function, sensitivity, and satisfaction.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Male circumcision, the surgical removal of penile foreskin, is performed for religious, cultural, and medical reasons and is most commonly an elective decision made by caregivers in the neonatal period.&nbsp; While generally safe, circumcision must be performed by a skilled practitioner with attention to informed consent, procedural technique, and postoperative care.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
