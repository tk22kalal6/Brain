Epispadias can occur in isolation or with bladder exstrophy (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24774.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), a more severe congenital anomaly referred to as the bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex.&nbsp; This article will focus on isolated epispadias.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Epispadias likely results from a defect in the development of the lower (ie, infraumbilical) abdominal wall.&nbsp; The cloacal membrane (ie, cloaca) is composed of ectodermal and endodermal layers and forms a barrier between the developing gut and the amniotic cavity in early embryogenesis.&nbsp; Normally, mesenchymal cells migrate to the cloaca to reinforce the ectodermal and endodermal layers and eventually give rise to the pelvic bone and supporting musculature.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, the urorectal septum descends and fuses with the cloacal membrane, and the cloacal membrane perforates, forming the urogenital membrane (barrier between the urogenital sinus and the amniotic cavity) and the anal membrane (barrier between the hindgut and the amniotic cavity).</p><br><br><p>However, if the mesenchymal cells fail to reinforce the ectodermal and endodermal layers of the cloacal membrane normally (eg, due to overgrowth of the cloacal membrane), premature perforation can occur, resulting in congenital defects that range in severity from isolated epispadias to bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex with complete externalization of the urinary tract.</p><br><br><p>Epispadias is more common in males than females (who present with an anteriorly displaced urethra).&nbsp; There is an increased incidence of bladder exstrophy in patients with a family history of the disorder, suggesting a genetic predisposition.&nbsp; As with most congenital anomalies, exposure to teratogens can increase the risk of epispadias.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>In male patients, epispadias presents at birth with the <strong>urethral meatus</strong> located on the <strong>dorsal surface of the penis</strong>.&nbsp; The penis is typically short and broad with dorsal curvature (due to absent anterior corpora cavernosa tissue and normal posterior corpora cavernosa tissue), and the dorsal foreskin is absent.&nbsp; Proximal positioning of the urethral meatus is associated with <strong>urethral sphincter incompetence</strong>, and persistent urinary incontinence is common.&nbsp; In contrast, distal epispadias may not be apparent until circumcision is performed or until toilet training is attempted (due to persistent incontinence).</p><br><br><p>Female patients with epispadias have an anteriorly displaced urethra with a bifid clitoris and a shortened vagina.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Epispadias is typically apparent at birth.&nbsp; However, a thorough physical examination should be performed to evaluate for associated urogenital tract anomalies.&nbsp; Ultrasonography is required to evaluate for upper urinary tract anomalies (eg, hydronephrosis, collecting system anomalies, renal dysplasia).&nbsp; For example, voiding cystourethrography is often necessary to evaluate for vesicoureteral reflux (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L87924.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Plain radiographs may be indicated to evaluate pubic bone structure due to the association with abnormal pubic bone development (eg, diastasis of the symphysis pubis).<p></p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Hypospadias</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L14403.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Abnormal opening of the urethra on the ventral surface of the penile shaft, often accompanied by chordee (abnormal ventral penile curvature) and a dorsal hood appearance (surplus dorsal foreskin with deficient ventral foreskin).&nbsp; Hypospadias most commonly occurs as an isolated finding but can be associated with a difference of sexual development, WAGR syndrome (<strong>W</strong>ilms tumor, <strong>A</strong>niridia, <strong>G</strong>enitourinary anomalies, and <strong>R</strong>ange of developmental delay), or CHARGE association (<strong>C</strong>oloboma, <strong>H</strong>eart defects, <strong>A</strong>tresia choanae, <strong>R</strong>etardation of growth and development, <strong>G</strong>enital abnormalities, and <strong>E</strong>ar abnormalities).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Urethral fistula</strong>:&nbsp; A second abnormal opening on the ventral aspect of the penile shaft in addition to a normally positioned urethral meatus (rather than a distal blind-ending urethral pit).&nbsp; This can occur as a complication from surgery or, more rarely, as a congenital anomaly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of epispadias involves the <strong>surgical repositioning of the urethra</strong> to restore urinary continence, preserve or restore sexual function, and optimize cosmetic appearance.&nbsp; Significant urinary incontinence may require bladder neck reconstruction.&nbsp; Prior to surgical reconstruction, supportive care includes medical management of urinary incontinence, prompt diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections, and counseling for the patient and family.</p><br><br><p>In contrast to hypospadias (a ventrally positioned urethral meatus), epispadias is not associated with differences of sexual development and does not require karyotype evaluation of sex chromosomes.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for epispadias is generally favorable.&nbsp; Good prognostic indicators include the absence of associated congenital anomalies and prompt surgical reconstruction.&nbsp; In addition, distal epispadias is associated with a more favorable prognosis than proximal epispadias due to the ease of reconstruction.</p><br><br><p>Following surgical correction, the most common complications include persistent urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Epispadias is a rare congenital anomaly in which the urethral meatus is located on the dorsal surface of the penis in males or anterior to its normal anatomic position in females.&nbsp; Epispadias can occur in isolation or with bladder exstrophy (bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex).&nbsp; The diagnosis is generally apparent at birth, and management involves prompt surgical reconstruction to optimize functional and cosmetic outcomes.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
