Oogonia proliferate via mitosis starting at 6 weeks gestation.&nbsp; Around 15-20 weeks gestation, oogonia enter meiosis I and become primary oocytes (diploid), which arrest in prophase I.&nbsp; At 20 weeks gestation, primordial follicles begin to form in the ovarian cortex as a ring of primordial granulosa cells surrounds each oocyte.&nbsp; Early follicular growth continues through fetal life; then some follicles undergo atresia (ie, degradation) and their oocytes undergo apoptosis.&nbsp; The surviving primary oocytes remain dormant, <strong>arrested in prophase I</strong> until puberty (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L122835.png\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Puberty to menopause</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Puberty</strong>:&nbsp;

Groups of primordial follicles periodically undergo recruitment (ie, pulled out of dormancy) to join the pool of growing follicles and undergo maturation through the following phases: primordial follicle → primary follicle → secondary follicle → tertiary follicle (antral follicle).&nbsp; This process takes approximately 300 days and is accompanied by significant growth of the primary oocytes within the growing follicles.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Selection</strong>:&nbsp; With each menstrual cycle, FSH recruits a cohort of tertiary follicles to undergo further development.&nbsp; These follicles continue to grow under FSH stimulation; a single dominant follicle is selected and continues to develop, and the other follicles become atretic and undergo apoptosis.&nbsp; Therefore, typically only 1 oocyte has the potential to ovulate and be fertilized each cycle.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ovulation</strong>:&nbsp; In response to rising LH, the primary oocyte resumes meiosis.&nbsp; Completion of meiosis I causes an unequal division of cytoplasm, forming the first polar body (a small haploid cell with little cytoplasm) and a secondary oocyte (a larger haploid cell with more cytoplasm).&nbsp; The secondary oocyte begins meiosis II and arrests in metaphase II (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L122838.png\" alt=\"figure 10\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 10</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;

As in meiosis I, completion of meiosis II leads to an unequal division of cytoplasm.&nbsp; This forms a small second polar body (which eventually degenerates) and the larger mature ovum that contains intracellular organelles, mitochondria, and adequate cytoplasm and nutrients for the zygote.&nbsp; The genetic material of the oocyte and sperm fuse, forming the <strong>diploid zygote</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L123089.png\" alt=\"figure 13\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 13</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>However, if fertilization does not occur, the secondary oocyte does not resume meiosis II and instead degenerates.</p>\n<h2>Menopause</h2><br><br><p>As ovarian follicles become depleted due to ovulation and atresia, cycles become intermittently anovulatory and eventually cease at an average age of 51.</p>\n<h2>Key features of oogenesis</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Timing</strong>:&nbsp;

The process from initiation of spermatogenesis to ejaculation takes approximately 90 days.&nbsp; However, because groups of spermatogonia begin spermatogenesis asynchronously, the testes include cells at various stages of development.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hormonal control</strong>:&nbsp; LH, FSH, and testosterone are all critical to spermatogenesis, which does not begin until activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis that occurs at puberty.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Maturation sequence</strong>:&nbsp; Undifferentiated primordial germ cell → spermatogonium → primary spermatocyte → secondary spermatocyte → spermatid → spermatozoon.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sperm number</strong>:&nbsp; Approximately 100 million spermatozoa are produced each day and 4 sperm are produced from each primary spermatocyte.&nbsp; Some 25% of germ cells reach the ejaculate (75% are lost to apoptosis or degeneration), and 50% of germ cells in the ejaculate are malformed; therefore, only about 12% of formed germ cells have the potential to fertilize an oocyte.&nbsp; Only 1 sperm can fertilize an oocyte (due to the cortical reaction).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Oogenesis and spermatogenesis are intricate, tightly regulated processes essential for reproduction.&nbsp;
