The mass typically increases in size with standing or Valsalva maneuver and decreases with recumbency.&nbsp; Patients are often asymptomatic, but some experience a dull scrotal ache after prolonged standing or exertion.</p><br><br><p>The diagnosis is usually made clinically but can be confirmed with scrotal ultrasonography.&nbsp; Most cases are managed with reassurance and observation.&nbsp; However, a varicocele can impair fertility, and surgical repair may be necessary to preserve reproductive function.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>A varicocele results from <strong>dilation of the pampiniform plexus</strong>, a network of veins that drain blood from the testicles.&nbsp; It occurs more commonly on the left side due to anatomical differences in the left and right spermatic (gonadal) veins (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19256.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The left spermatic vein is longer, originates at an angle perpendicular to the left renal vein, and is often compressed between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery.&nbsp; This configuration increases intravascular pressure within the left gonadal vein, causing valve incompetence, retrograde blood flow, and venous dilation (especially worse when standing).&nbsp; When the <strong>patient is supine</strong>, much of the blood returns to the systemic circulation, the plexus is decompressed, and the <strong>varicocele diminishes in size</strong>.<p></p><br><br><p>In contrast, the right spermatic vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava (IVC), so right-sided varicoceles are relatively rare.&nbsp; A unilateral right varicocele or one that does not decrease in the recumbent position raises concern for a secondary cause of scrotal venous dilation, such as malignant compression by a renal or retroperitoneal mass (eg, Wilms tumor, renal cell carcinoma) or IVC thrombosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/47784.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>No specific risk factors exist for varicocele development, but the condition most often occurs in young, postpubertal males.&nbsp; Rapid testicular growth during puberty is associated with increased blood flow to the testicles, which may explain the higher incidence of varicocele development at this age.</p>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>Microscopically, a varicocele is characterized by venous distension, thickening of the vein walls, and loss of vascular elasticity.&nbsp; Over time, this condition can lead to testicular hypoperfusion, hypoxia, and testicular atrophy (and infertility) if left untreated.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>A varicocele most often presents with the following clinical features:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Asymptomatic (common) or dull, aching scrotal pain</strong> (which may worsen after physical exertion)</li>\n\t<li>Tortuous enlargement of veins superior to the testis, often described as a <strong>\"bag of worms\"</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Scrotal mass enlarges after standing and diminishes when supine</strong></li>\n\t<li>Mass does not transmit light shined through the scrotum (<strong>no transillumination</strong>)</li>\n\t<li>Infertility, a common cause of reduced sperm production and impaired motility, presumably due to increased blood stasis and higher scrotal temperatures</li>\n\t<li>Testicular atrophy</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of a varicocele is made clinically based on examination that reveals a soft, irregular mass in the left scrotum that does not transilluminate and improves in the supine position.&nbsp; A scrotal ultrasonogram may be helpful if uncertainty exists.</p><br><br><p>However, a varicocele found in a prepubertal male (uncommon), that fails to decrease in size when supine, arises suddenly, or located on the right side is concerning for a secondary cause (eg, mass) and mandates further workup with abdominal ultrasonography or CT scan of the abdomen.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Testicular tumors</strong>:&nbsp; benign and malignant testicular tumors can present as a painless scrotal mass, but tumors are often firm or nodular rather than soft and compressible.&nbsp; Tumors do not change size with Valsalva maneuver or change in position.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hydrocele</strong>:&nbsp; a fluid collection within the tunica vaginalis that causes painless testicular enlargement and reduces with recumbency, but the fluid easily transilluminates on examination.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Spermatocele</strong>:&nbsp; a fluid-filled cyst of the head of the epididymis that presents as a painless mass at the superior pole of the testis.&nbsp; It transilluminates and does not change size with positioning or Valsalva maneuver.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inguinal hernia</strong>:&nbsp; intraabdominal contents protrude through a weakened area in the inguinal canal, producing a painless, soft scrotal mass that increases with Valsalva maneuver and does not transilluminate.&nbsp; However, hernias are often reducible with manipulation and do not have the characteristic \"bag of worms\" texture on palpation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Epididymitis/orchitis</strong>:&nbsp; unlike a varicocele, epididymitis and orchitis typically cause pain with localized tenderness and warmth on examination due to inflammation and infection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Semen analysis to assess sperm count, motility, and morphology should be performed every 1-2 years in postpubertal patients with a varicocele and a desire to maintain fertility.&nbsp; Any observed decline in fertility parameters warrants surgical management of the varicocele to preserve reproductive function.</p>\n<h1>Imaging</h1><br><br><p>Doppler ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for confirming the diagnosis of a varicocele.&nbsp; Findings include dilation of the pampiniform plexus veins, retrograde venous flow, and tortuous, anechoic tubules adjacent to the testis.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management strategies for a varicocele depend on the severity of symptoms and associated complications.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>For most patients with a <strong>primary varicocele</strong>, management is with <strong>observation and reassurance</strong>.&nbsp; An asymptomatic varicocele does not require treatment, especially in adolescents, as it may resolve spontaneously.&nbsp; However, patient follow-up is necessary for signs of testicular atrophy or changes in semen analysis because this often warrants intervention.</li>\n\t<li>For patients with minor pain, symptom management includes scrotal support garments, analgesics (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and avoidance of prolonged standing/heavy lifting to minimize discomfort.</li>\n\t<li>Surgical intervention (ligating or occluding gonadal vein branches to redirect blood and limit backflow into the venous plexus) is indicated if pain persists despite conservative measures.&nbsp; Intervention is also recommended with testicular hypotrophy/atrophy and abnormal semen analysis in patients with a desire to maintain fertility (older patients without fertility concerns do not require surgical intervention).</li>\n\t<li>If clinical findings suggest a secondary cause of a varicocele (eg, right-sided, prepubescent male), a CT scan of the abdomen or abdominal ultrasonogram is indicated to evaluate for a retroperitoneal/pelvic mass or IVC thrombus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for a varicocele is generally good, and conservative management is often adequate.&nbsp; However, a varicocele can result in testicular atrophy, reduced sperm production, and impaired spermatic motility.&nbsp; Patients with a varicocele who desire to maintain fertility should be monitored closely for any decline in sperm number or function.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>A varicocele (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35318.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an abnormal enlargement of the pampiniform venous plexus in the scrotum.&nbsp; Patients may be asymptomatic or experience mild, dull, aching scrotal pain.&nbsp; Characteristic examination findings include a soft, irregular mass (\"bag of worms\") that does not transilluminate, increases in size with standing or Valsalva maneuver, and reduces when supine.&nbsp; The diagnosis is clinical, and most patients can be managed with observation and symptom control.&nbsp; However, patients who desire continued fertility should have the varicocele surgically repaired.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
