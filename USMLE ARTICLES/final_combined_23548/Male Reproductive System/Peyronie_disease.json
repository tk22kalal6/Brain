Distortion of the penis during erection may make sexual intercourse difficult or impossible.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The pathogenesis of Peyronie disease is not fully understood but presumably involves a combination of tissue injury, abnormal healing, and a genetic predisposition.</p><br><br><p>Repeated microtrauma to the penile tissue during sexual activity (often unrecognized) is thought to cause localized injury to the tunica albuginea, the elastic sheath that surrounds the corpus cavernosum (erectile tissue).&nbsp; In response to injury, there is an inflammatory response that involves cytokine release, fibroblast proliferation, and excess collagen deposition.&nbsp; This results in the formation of <strong>inelastic, fibrous plaques</strong> in the <strong>tunica albuginea</strong> that cause <strong>abnormal penile curvature</strong> and <strong>restrict tissue expansion during erections</strong>.&nbsp; Over time, these plaques can become calcified and rigid, further exacerbating the deformity and erectile dysfunction.</p><br><br><p>The course of Peyronie disease is divided into 2 phases:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Early stage (acute phase):&nbsp; The disease is characterized by inflammation and the formation of immature, collagen-rich plaques.&nbsp; This phase typically lasts 1-2 years and is characterized by pain with erections and increasing deformity of the penis.</li>\n\t<li>Late stage (chronic phase):&nbsp; During this stage, pain usually improves and penile curvature is present but no longer progressing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Several risk factors are associated with Peyronie disease:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Age &gt;40</li>\n\t<li>Penile trauma (eg, injury, surgery)</li>\n\t<li>Family history of Peyronie disease or related fibrotic conditions (eg, Dupuytren contracture)</li>\n\t<li>Comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use), likely due to their association with erectile dysfunction</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Peyronie disease presents with the following symptoms that can adversely affect sexual function and quality of life:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Penile curvature</strong> (most common):&nbsp; results from the asymmetric fibrosis of the tunica albuginea.&nbsp; Curvature can be upward, downward, or lateral, depending on the location of the plaque.&nbsp; Distortion may make sexual intercourse difficult or impossible.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Palpable plaque</strong>:&nbsp; hard, fibrous lump can often be felt under the skin.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Penile pain</strong>:&nbsp; primarily during erections, occurs during the acute phase but typically subsides as the disease enters the chronic phase.</li>\n\t<li>Erectile dysfunction:&nbsp; due to impaired blood flow, reduced tissue expansion, penile deformity, or psychological factors.</li>\n\t<li>Penile shortening:&nbsp; due to contracture of the fibrotic tissue.</li>\n\t<li>Psychological distress</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Congenital penile curvature</strong>:&nbsp; a penile deformity present from birth and is not associated with pain or plaque formation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Penile fracture</strong>:&nbsp; a traumatic rupture of the tunica albuginea that typically occurs during vigorous sexual activity, and results in acute loss of erection, swelling, and severe pain.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Penile cancer</strong>:&nbsp; presents as a mass or ulceration on the penis, rather than a fibrous plaque, and is associated with skin color changes, discharge, and/or bleeding.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lichen sclerosus</strong>:&nbsp; a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can cause adhesions/scarring and painful erections.&nbsp; However, it lacks the distinct plaque formation seen in Peyronie disease and there is typically pruritus, bleeding, and fissuring of the skin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of Peyronie disease is primarily clinical, based on a history of progressive changes in penis curvature (± erectile dysfunction) and examination that reveals penile deformity and palpable plaques.&nbsp; The penis should be examined when flaccid and erect to accurately assess the degree of curvature and dysfunction.</p>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory tests are not required when evaluating Peyronie disease, although assessment for comorbid predisposing conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus) may be considered.</p><br><br><p>Imaging can help confirm the diagnosis and assess disease severity.&nbsp; Penile ultrasonography is the most commonly used modality due to its high sensitivity for identifying size, location, and calcification of plaques.&nbsp; Doppler evaluation can evaluate penile vascular flow during erection in patients with erectile dysfunction.&nbsp; MRI may be used in complex cases or when ultrasonography findings are inconclusive.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Treatment options for Peyronie disease vary based on the stage of disease, the curvature severity, and the degree of sexual dysfunction.</p><br><br><p>Observation may be appropriate if pain and curvature are mild and if the patient's condition is stable (not progressing) because a minority of patients improve without treatment.</p><br><br><p>Medical therapy is the initial treatment for those with active, progressive symptoms.&nbsp; Options include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs:&nbsp; used for penile/erectile pain</li>\n\t<li>Pentoxifylline (phosphodiesterase inhibitor):&nbsp; may reduce fibrosis and collagen deposition, but its effectiveness is limited</li>\n\t<li>Intralesional collagenase or verapamil injection:&nbsp; injected directly into the plaque to help hydrolyze collagen and reduce penile curvature</li>\n\t<li>Traction therapy:&nbsp; splints the penis in the opposite direction of the curvature</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Surgery may be considered in patients with symptoms persisting &gt;12 months and whose penile deformity alters sexual function.&nbsp; Options include a plication procedure (tunica albuginea is sutured on the opposite side of curvature to straighten the penis), plaque excision and grafting, and possible penile prosthesis.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of Peyronie disease varies, with some patients achieving spontaneous resolution and others requiring surgical repair.&nbsp; However, with proper treatment, most patients achieve satisfactory curvature correction and restoration of sexual function.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>There are no specific measures to prevent Peyronie disease, but certain strategies may reduce the risk or severity, such as avoiding penile trauma, managing comorbidities (eg, controlling diabetes mellitus and hypertension, smoking cessation).</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Peyronie disease is an acquired disorder characterized by fibrosis of the tunica albuginea of the penis.&nbsp; Manifestations include penile pain, abnormal curvature, penile plaques, and erectile dysfunction.&nbsp; It is primarily a clinical diagnosis.&nbsp; Patients with active or progressive symptoms are treated with oral medications and/or intralesional injections.&nbsp; Surgery may be indicated in refractory cases.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
