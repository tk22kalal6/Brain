The condition presents with testicular pain, tenderness, and swelling.&nbsp; Diagnosis is mostly clinical, but testicular ultrasonography is often used to rule out conditions with similar presentations (eg, testicular torsion).</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Orchitis typically results from a viral or bacterial infection:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Viral</strong>:&nbsp; <strong>Mumps</strong> is the most common cause of viral orchitis (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/64319.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Although mumps infection is usually self-limited, unvaccinated patients are at increased risk for complications, including orchitis and aseptic meningitis (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29018.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Less common causes of viral orchitis include rubella virus, Coxsackievirus, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus.</li><br><br>\t<li><strong>Bacterial</strong>:&nbsp; Most cases of bacterial orchitis occur in patients with concurrent epididymitis, causing <strong>epididymo-orchitis</strong>.&nbsp; The typical causative pathogens of bacterial orchitis mirror those of epididymitis:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>In young men (age &lt;35), sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (eg, <em><strong>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</strong></em>, <em><strong>Chlamydia trachomatis</strong></em>) are the most common causes.</li>\n\t\t<li>In older men (age &gt;35), infection is often associated with urinary or prostate infections, frequently related to bladder outlet obstruction (eg, benign prostatic hyperplasia), which increases the risk for the retrograde flow of infected urine.&nbsp; Typical organisms include <em><strong>Escherichia coli</strong></em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, and other coliform bacteria.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Pathogens reach the testis via 2 main routes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Hematogenous spread:&nbsp; The pathogen (eg, mumps virus) travels through the bloodstream to seed the testicular tissue.</li>\n\t<li>Retrograde ascent of bacteria:&nbsp; Organisms travel from the urethra (eg, STIs) or bladder (eg, urinary infection) through the vas deferens to the epididymis and testes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Concomitant epididymitis.</li>\n\t<li>History of STIs, multiple sexual partners, unprotected sex.</li>\n\t<li>Urinary tract or prostate infection (especially in older men).</li>\n\t<li>Bladder outlet obstruction (eg, benign prostatic hyperplasia).</li>\n\t<li>Chronic indwelling Foley catheter.</li>\n\t<li>Unvaccinated status, especially against mumps.</li>\n\t<li>Immunocompromise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Acute onset of severe testicular pain and tenderness.</li>\n\t<li>Testicular enlargement.</li>\n\t<li>Swelling, erythema, and warmth of the scrotum.</li>\n\t<li>Fever, chills, and malaise.</li>\n\t<li>Dysuria and urethral discharge (in STI-related cases).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Mumps orchitis usually presents with a nonspecific prodrome (eg, fever, malaise, myalgias) followed by parotitis.&nbsp; Orchitis develops 5-10 days after the onset of parotitis but can also occur without salivary gland involvement.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Testicular torsion</strong>:&nbsp; Acute onset of severe unilateral testicular pain, nausea, and a negative cremasteric reflex (testes do not elevate with stroking of the inner thigh).&nbsp; Diagnosis is confirmed by color Doppler ultrasonography that reveals absent blood flow to the affected testicle.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inguinal hernia</strong>:&nbsp; Portion of bowel or omentum protruding through the inguinal canal and sometimes into the scrotal sac.&nbsp; It may present with testicular pain and a scrotal mass that becomes more prominent with provocative measures (eg, cough, Valsalva maneuver).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hydrocele</strong>:&nbsp; Collection of fluid between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis that is generally marked by painless testicular swelling over weeks or months.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Varicocele</strong>:&nbsp; Dilation of the pampiniform plexus that generally presents with a soft, nontender (or mildly tender) testicular mass that is often described as \"a bag of worms\" on palpation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Scrotal abscess</strong>:&nbsp; Localized area of infection in the scrotal skin/soft tissue.&nbsp; The affected area may appear red and feel warm and fluctuant on examination.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Orchitis should be suspected in patients with testicular pain, swelling, and erythema, especially when it occurs with STI risk factors or symptoms (eg, urethral discharge, epididymal tenderness), signs of lower urinary tract infection (eg, dysuria, urgency), or a recent episode of parotitis.</p><br><br><p>Orchitis is mainly a clinical diagnosis based on history and examination findings.&nbsp; However, all patients with a painful, swollen scrotum require urgent ultrasonographic imaging to rule out testicular torsion, a urologic emergency that can mimic orchitis; without prompt intervention, it can lead to ischemia and testicular necrosis.</p>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory testing is not necessary to diagnose orchitis but may help identify the causative agent:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT):&nbsp; NAAT detects <em>C trachomatis</em> and <em>N gonorrhoeae</em> in high-risk individuals.</li>\n\t<li>Urinalysis and urine culture:&nbsp; Urinalysis showing pyuria or bacteriuria suggests orchitis from a urinary or prostatic source, and a urine culture identifies the specific pathogen.</li>\n\t<li>Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for mumps virus DNA:&nbsp; This test is most sensitive when obtained within the first 3 days of parotitis, so it may be falsely negative when evaluating orchitis (which typically develops days later).</li>\n\t<li>Mumps IgM/IgG antibodies:&nbsp; This test may be difficult to interpret in patients with previous vaccination.&nbsp; IgM, which indicates recent or current infection, may not be detectable in previously vaccinated patients.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Imaging studies</h1><br><br><p>Scrotal/testicular ultrasonography with Doppler is the first-line imaging study in patients with presumed orchitis.&nbsp; Ultrasonography can identify concomitant epididymitis (eg, enlarged, hypervascular epididymis) and rule out testicular torsion.&nbsp; Ultrasonographic findings of acute orchitis may include enlarged, hypoechoic testis with increased blood flow (hyperemia).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Supportive measures for alleviating testicular inflammation and discomfort include bed rest, scrotal elevation, cold packs, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><br><br><p>There is no specific antiviral treatment for viral orchitis, and most cases resolve spontaneously within 10 days to several weeks.</p><br><br><p>Bacterial orchitis requires empiric antibiotics.&nbsp; Drug selection is based on the most likely pathogen:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Sexually active men (age &lt;35) with STI risks:&nbsp; Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline.</li>\n\t<li>Men age &gt;35 with presumed urinary tract pathogens:&nbsp; Oral fluoroquinolone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Most cases resolve with appropriate treatment, but complications such as testicular atrophy and infertility can occur.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Strategies to prevent orchitis include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Vaccination against mumps (measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] vaccine):&nbsp; Reduces the risk for developing orchitis with mumps infection.</li>\n\t<li>Safe-sex practices and prompt treatment of STIs.</li>\n\t<li>Avoidance of unnecessary catheterization or instrumentation and appropriately managed bladder outlet obstruction and urinary infections.</li>\n\t<li>Genital hygiene, especially in older or catheterized patients.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Orchitis is inflammation of one or both testicles, most commonly resulting from the hematogenous spread of viral infection (eg, mumps) or ascending bacterial infection leading to epididymo-orchitis.&nbsp; It typically presents with the acute onset of severe testicular pain and swelling.&nbsp; Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but scrotal ultrasonography is often performed to exclude other causes of scrotal pain (eg, testicular torsion).&nbsp; Symptomatic management includes rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and scrotal elevation.&nbsp; Bacterial cases are treated with appropriate antibiotics, whereas viral orchitis generally resolves spontaneously within days to weeks.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
