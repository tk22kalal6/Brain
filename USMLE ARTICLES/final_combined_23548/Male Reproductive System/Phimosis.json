It is a normal finding in infants and young children that is caused by congenital adhesions between the prepuce and glans (physiologic phimosis); it is typically a benign, self-limited condition that resolves by adolescence.&nbsp; However, phimosis is considered pathologic when chronic inflammation leads to scarring and fibrosis of the preputial opening.&nbsp; Pathologic phimosis causes symptoms (eg, painful erection, chronic urinary tract infections) and often requires surgical repair.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1> <h2>Physiologic phimosis</h2><br><br><p>Physiologic phimosis is caused by <strong>congenital adhesions</strong> between the <strong>inner layer of the prepuce and the glans penis</strong>.&nbsp; It is a normal clinical finding at birth and throughout early childhood.&nbsp; Over time, penis enlargement, physiologic erections, and gentle manual retraction loosen these adhesions and allow greater mobility of the prepuce.&nbsp; The time to achieve complete retraction varies, but most physiologic phimosis resolves by puberty.</p>\n<h2>Pathologic phimosis</h2><br><br><p>Pathologic phimosis is the <strong>inability to retract the foreskin</strong> due to <strong>scarring, fibrosis, and stenosis of the preputial orifice</strong>.&nbsp; The condition typically occurs in older children or adults who have chronic inflammation of the prepuce.&nbsp; Risk factors for developing pathologic phimosis include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Poor preputial hygiene:&nbsp; increases the risk for infection and inflammation</li>\n\t<li>Recurrent balanitis/balanoposthitis:&nbsp; inflammation of the glans (balanitis) or the glans and prepuce (balanoposthitis), most often infectious (eg, <em>Candida</em>)</li>\n\t<li>Trauma:&nbsp; repeated or forcible manual retraction that creates microtears in the preputial orifice and leads to scarring</li>\n\t<li>Balanitis xerotica obliterans:&nbsp; chronic inflammatory dermatitis involving the prepuce</li>\n\t<li>Diabetes mellitus:&nbsp; increases the risk for infections</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1> <h2>Physiologic phimosis </h2><br><br><p>Clinical characteristics of physiologic phimosis include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Typically asymptomatic</li>\n\t<li>Ballooning of the foreskin with urination (benign, resolves with time)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pathologic phimosis </h2><br><br><p>Clinical characteristics of pathologic phimosis include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Irritation, erythema, bleeding at preputial opening</li>\n\t<li>Dysuria with recurrent urinary tract infections</li>\n\t<li>Urinary retention, nocturnal enuresis (due to obstructed flow)</li>\n\t<li>Repeat episodes of balanoposthitis</li>\n\t<li>Painful erections and discomfort with intercourse</li>\n\t<li>Stenosis of preputial orifice (the opening is surrounded by a white, fibrotic tissue)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The diagnosis of phimosis is confirmed by an inability to retract the prepuce on examination.&nbsp; Clinical history (eg, age of onset, symptomatology) helps determine physiologic or pathologic phimosis, which is important to guide management.</p><br><br><p>Differential diagnosis includes the following conditions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Balanitis xerotica obliterans</strong>:&nbsp; is a chronic inflammatory condition of the prepuce that causes scarring and sclerosis.&nbsp; It can lead to phimosis over time.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Balanoposthitis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/65322.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; is acute inflammation of the glans and prepuce that causes pain, swelling and difficulty with prepuce manipulation.&nbsp; It is typically infectious in nature and associated with purulent discharge.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Paraphimosis</strong>:&nbsp; refers to entrapment of the retracted foreskin behind the glans,which presents with an edematous glans and a tight band of foreskin constricting the distal penis.&nbsp; The condition can occur with forced manipulation of a tight foreskin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation and imaging</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory testing is not necessary to diagnose phimosis; however, the following tests may identify predisposing conditions or associated complications:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Urinalysis to check for signs of urinary tract infection</li>\n\t<li>Swabs and cultures when discharge or signs of infection (eg, balanoposthitis) are present (eg, assess for candida, group A <em>Streptococcus</em>)</li>\n\t<li>Fingerstick glucose and hemoglobin A1c if diabetes mellitus is suspected</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Imaging is not required in the evaluation of phimosis.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1> <h2>Physiologic phimosis</h2><br><br><p>Physiologic phimosis is typically a <strong>self-limited process</strong> that resolves over time.&nbsp; However, if patients or parents are concerned that complete prepuce retraction has not been achieved by a specific age or if the patient has had recurrent infections, the following are appropriate interventions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Topical corticosteroids (eg, betamethasone) promote skin elasticity to speed retraction.</li>\n\t<li>Gentle manual retraction exercises should be performed several times per day.&nbsp; Patients must be advised that forcible retraction should be avoided (may lead to pathologic phimosis).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pathologic phimosis</h2><br><br><p>Pathologic phimosis often requires <strong>surgical intervention</strong>.&nbsp; Once the preputial opening has become fibrotic, steroids and stretching are often ineffective.&nbsp; Surgical options include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Preputioplasty:&nbsp; surgical widening of the scarred preputial ring</li>\n\t<li>Circumcision:&nbsp; removal of the foreskin in recurrent or severe cases</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Proper hygiene of the uncircumcised penis is essential to prevent infection and inflammation, which increase the risk for phimosis.&nbsp; Patients should be educated about the importance of routine cleaning of the prepuce and the area underneath (once retraction is achieved).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Physiologic phimosis has an excellent prognosis.&nbsp; Most cases spontaneously resolve without the need for intervention, and 95% of patients can retract the prepuce by adolescence.&nbsp; Pathologic phimosis also has a good prognosis with appropriate treatment, although infection or trauma can cause recurrence.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Phimosis is the inability to retract the prepuce.&nbsp; Physiologic phimosis is a normal finding in young children and often resolves spontaneously by adolescence.&nbsp; Pathologic phimosis occurs when the preputial opening becomes scarred and fibrotic from chronic inflammation, infection, or trauma.&nbsp; It typically requires surgical repair to prevent complications such as chronic urinary tract infection or urinary retention.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
