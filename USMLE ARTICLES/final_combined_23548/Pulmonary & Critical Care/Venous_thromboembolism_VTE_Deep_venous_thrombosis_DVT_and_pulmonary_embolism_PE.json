Approximately 50% of patients with DVT have concurrent PE; similarly, ~50% of patients with PE have a concurrent or residual DVT.&nbsp; In addition to acute morbidity and mortality (eg, right ventricular failure), DVT/PE can cause a range of chronic problems (eg, postphlebitic syndrome, pulmonary thromboembolic hypertension).</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis and risk factors</h1><h2>Pathogenesis</h2><br><br><p>The adjective \"deep\" in \"deep venous thrombosis\" refers to formation of clots within the internal venous system of the pelvis and legs (eg, iliac, deep femoral, popliteal, soleal, and gastrocnemius veins).&nbsp;

For this reason, lower extremity orthopedic procedures (eg, femoral fracture and fixation) are a setup for DVT due to direct trauma to the venous system, systemic and local inflammation from surgery, and immobilization.&nbsp; Similarly, any underlying systemic inflammation (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], inflammatory bowel disease) increases the risk of DVT.<p></p><br><br><p>The elements of Virchow triad are interdependent parts of a complex thromboinflammatory web.&nbsp; For example, venous endothelial damage induces:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>release of intrinsic (contact-kinin system) procoagulants (eg, tissue factor, von Willebrand factor).</li>\n\t<li>reduced production of surface anticoagulants (eg, prostaglandin).</li>\n\t<li>imbalance of fibrinolytic-antifibrinolytic system (decreased tPA, increased PAI-1).</li>\n\t<li>exposure of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as extracellular DNA/histones, that activate platelets and leukocytes.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Most clots start as microthrombi in the muscular calf veins and extend proximally (ie, \"clot begets more clot\").&nbsp; Venous clots are made up mostly of fibrin and trapped red blood cells (ie, \"red thrombus\") as opposed to arterial clots, which have high platelet content (ie, \"white thrombus\").&nbsp; This difference in clot composition affects treatment (eg, anticoagulants for DVT, antiplatelet for arterial thrombi).</p>\n<h2>Provoked versus unprovoked</h2><br><br><p>Clinically, VTEs are often classified as provoked versus unprovoked.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Provoked VTE (~70%) can be attributed to a transient (eg, surgery) or persistent (eg, chronic hemiparesis) risk factor.</li>\n\t<li>Unprovoked VTE (~30%) cannot be attributed to any identifying risk factor.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Genetic (inherited) thrombophilias (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/81701.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) play a larger role in unprovoked DVT (eg, factor V Leiden is present in ~25% of cases), especially when recurrent.<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><h2>Manifestations</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>DVT:</strong>&nbsp; presents with acute onset (ie, over days) of unilateral leg fullness, pain, and tenderness, often with increased warmth and erythema.&nbsp; Distal DVTs (eg, popliteal vein) cause calf-limited calf swelling and pain, whereas proximal DVTs (eg, iliac vein) can induce symptoms in the thighs and buttocks.</li>\n\t<li><strong>PE:</strong>&nbsp; presentation may depend on clot burden and location (eg, segmental versus mainstem pulmonary arteries).&nbsp; Segmental PEs often cause dyspnea and chest pain lateralizing to the affected lobes.&nbsp; Chest pain has a pleuritic quality (pleural irritation due to underlying pulmonary infarction).&nbsp; Massive PE (eg, saddle) can present with hypotension, syncope, or cardiac arrest due to obstructive shock.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical examination</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>DVT:</strong>&nbsp; Approximately 50% of concurrent DVTs are asymptomatic (ie, low sensitivity).&nbsp; When present, unilateral calf edema is the most common finding (objective asymmetry &gt;3 cm, measured 10 cm below tibial tuberosity, is more specific) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10080.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Palpable venous cord or dilated superficial veins are occasionally seen.&nbsp; Homan sign (calf pain with foot dorsiflexion), traditionally associated with DVT, is inaccurate.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>PE:</strong>&nbsp; Tachypnea is one of the most common signs.&nbsp; Large PEs can produce signs of right ventricular strain (eg, parasternal heave, loud P2, jugulovenous distension).&nbsp; Massive PEs can produce hypotension and cyanosis.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnostic testing</h1><br><br><p>The following <strong>general</strong> studies are common in the initial evaluation of undifferentiated chest pain and dyspnea.</p>\n<h2>Chest x-ray</h2><br><br><p>Chest x-ray is primarily used to evaluate for alternative diagnoses (eg, pneumothorax).&nbsp; It is usually normal with PE.&nbsp; Pulmonary infarction (wedge-shaped subpleural opacity) or focal decrease in vascular marking (Westermark sign, reflecting diminished blood flow to the affected lobe) is sometimes observed (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L63900.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>ECG</h2><br><br><p>Several findings may be seen on ECG (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L87206.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Sinus tachycardia is the most common finding of acute PE.&nbsp; The acute right ventricle (RV) strain pattern (ie, new ST-T depression-inversion in anterior precordial [V<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font>-V<font size=\"2\"><sub>4</sub></font>] and inferior [II, III, aVF] leads) is more specific.&nbsp; An S<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font>Q<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font>T<font size=\"2\"><sub>3</sub></font> pattern is classic but insensitive (ie, seen in only 15% of cases).&nbsp; Other findings of acute RV strain include new right axis deviation and right bundle branch block.<p></p>\n<h2>Chemistry </h2><br><br><p>Cardiac biomarkers are used for risk stratification.&nbsp; Larger PEs cause microscopic necrosis of the RV (ie, ischemia due to high afterload), reflected as elevated troponin-I.&nbsp; RV dilation also releases elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).</p>\n<h2>Arterial blood gas (ABG)</h2><br><br><p>For segmental PEs, the ABG classically shows hypoxemia and acute respiratory alkalosis (↓PaCO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>).&nbsp;

Some patients can have vague symptoms (ie, generalized weakness).</p>\n<h2>Modified Wells score</h2><br><br><p>For patients presenting to an urgent or emergency care setting with acute chest pain, the first step is to judge the pretest probability of VTE using a standard tool such as the modified Wells score (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/34582.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Patients with high pretest probability (ie, score ≥4):&nbsp; Proceed to confirmatory testing (eg, CTA PE or VQ scanning).</li>\n\t<li>Patients with low or intermediate pretest probability (ie, score &lt;4):&nbsp; Perform additional stratification with D-dimer testing.&nbsp; D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product, generated anytime there is clot anywhere (ie, very high sensitivity).\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Negative (ie, &lt;500 ng/mL) D-dimer:&nbsp;

When leg symptoms prompt venous ultrasound, a positive study (ie, DVT present) is diagnostically equivalent to PE because management is the same.&nbsp; However, the converse is NOT true; in patients with suspected but unconfirmed PE, a negative venous ultrasound has no diagnostic value (eg, the DVT may have embolized or may be located in proximal pelvic veins).&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Presumptive PE via echocardiography:&nbsp; For hemodynamically unstable patients (ie, systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt;90 mm Hg) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L86540.png\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), the concern is for a massive obstructive PE versus other causes of shock.&nbsp; Time is of the essence, and confirmatory imaging may not be safe or possible.&nbsp; In this situation, bedside transthoracic echocardiogram can visualize signs of acute RV dysfunction (eg, dilation, septal flattening, reduced contractility), providing actionable evidence for PE (ie, enough to administer empiric thrombolytics to treat the PE).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Special considerations:&nbsp; PE evaluation in pregnancy </h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>For assessment of pretest probability of PE, scoring instruments (eg, modified Wells) are generally avoided due to lack of validation and high prevalence of baseline sinus tachycardia.&nbsp; Instead, clinical acumen is used.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>D-dimer testing requires caution.&nbsp; D-dimer levels rise throughout gestation and reach &gt;500 ng/mL (the traditional cutoff) by the third trimester in 95% of individuals.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>For confirmatory imaging, CTA is preferred over VQ scintigraphy due to practical considerations (ie, quicker, widely available).&nbsp; The fetal-absorbed radiation dose is equivalent between the 2 modalities, although maternal breast dose is higher for CTA.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Special considerations:&nbsp; PE evaluation with comorbid lung disease</h2><br><br><p>VQ scintigraphy is generally avoided in patients with parenchymal lung abnormalities (eg, pneumonia, emphysema) due to the coexisting ventilation defect, because a corresponding perfusion defect is expected due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.</p>\n<h1>Important VTE variations</h1><h2>Upper extremity DVT</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Primary upper extremity DVT (ie, Paget-Schroetter syndrome) is very rare.&nbsp;

Lipodermatosclerosis refers to acute inflammation superimposed on chronic venous stasis.&nbsp; It is usually bilateral but can be asymmetric.&nbsp; Lower extremities demonstrate atrophic scarring, hyperpigmentation, and a tapered, \"inverted champagne bottle\" appearance due to constrictive fibrosis (from repeated episodes of subcutaneous inflammation) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L8024.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Calf strain:</strong>&nbsp; A gastrocnemius tear causes severe pain that begins immediately after a recollectable traumatic episode (eg, explosive movement).&nbsp; The muscle belly is in spasm (eg, firm to palpation).&nbsp; Ecchymosis and edema are common, but erythema and warmth are not.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Acute right ventricular dilation and failure</h2><br><br><p>PE is the most common cause of acute RV dysfunction.&nbsp; However, 2 other conditions are on the differential:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Pulmonary hypertension (PH)</strong> (acutely decompensated):&nbsp; In the setting of chronic PH, the RV adaptively hypertrophies so it can tolerate the increased afterload.&nbsp; Exacerbations of PH (eg, due to medication nonadherence or excess sodium and fluid intake) causes worsening RV pressure and volume overload, resembling acute PE with reduced RV systolic function and dilation.&nbsp; However, evidence of adaptive RV hypertrophy (eg, RV wall thickening, prominent moderator band) are seen with chronic PH, but not with PE.</li>\n\t<li><strong>RV myocardial infarction:</strong>&nbsp; Can produce a similar picture to massive PE (sudden chest pain, hypotension, jugulovenous distension, clear lungs).&nbsp; However, pulmonary artery pressure is low (rather than elevated), and ECG shows an inferior STEMI pattern, which can be confirmed by right-sided precordial leads (V1-4<font size=\"2\"><sub>R</sub></font>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management:&nbsp; Guiding principles for anticoagulation</h1><br><br><p>Guidelines for anticoagulation are complex.&nbsp; A set of principles is presented below.</p>\n<h2>Necessity of anticoagulation</h2><br><br><p>There are 2 exceptions to anticoagulation:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Distal (ie, below the knee) DVT:&nbsp; Minimally symptomatic calf-limited DVTs (confirmed by ultrasound) can be treated with NSAIDs and close observations (~25% grow into proximal veins)</li>\n\t<li>Incidental subsegmental PE:&nbsp; Subsegmental PEs are detected on ~10% of chest CT obtained for unrelated purposes; they typically require no specific action.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Duration of anticoagulation</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>First and subsequent provoked VTE with transient risk factor (eg, surgery):&nbsp; 3 months each time</li>\n\t<li>First provoked VTE with persistent risk factor (eg, malignancy):&nbsp; ≥3 months (duration of risk factor)</li>\n\t<li>Recurrent provoked VTE with persist risk factor:&nbsp; indefinite</li>\n\t<li>First unprovoked VTE:&nbsp; 3 months</li>\n\t<li>Recurrent VTE with ≥1 unprovoked:&nbsp; indefinite</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Choice of anticoagulation</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>General:&nbsp; Direct oral anticoagulants [DOACs] (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban) are most popular due to easy pharmacokinetics</li>\n\t<li>Cancer:&nbsp; Lower molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or DOACs are preferred over warfarin, with stronger evidence for LMWH</li>\n\t<li>Pregnancy:&nbsp; LMWH is the only safe option, as warfarin and DOACs cross the placenta</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contraindications</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Absolute contraindication to anticoagulation are active major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, high risk of rebleeding, and inability to obtain hemostasis (eg, small bowel arteriovenous malformations)</li>\n\t<li>In these scenarios, IVC filters are used (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L30553.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; They double the risk of DVT (approximately) but halve the risk of PE.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Risk stratification of PE and management implications</h1><br><br><p>PE suddenly increases the RV afterload.&nbsp; Because it is a thin-walled ventricle adapted to a low resistance system, the RV does not tolerate rapid change.&nbsp; Depending on the clot burden, various degrees of acute RV dysfunction can result, allowing stratification into 3 groups (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/87336.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 6\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Low risk PE</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The clot burden is light, usually affecting subsegmental pulmonary arteries.</li>\n\t<li>The patient is normotensive (ie, SBP ≥90 mm Hg).</li>\n\t<li>RV strain is absent (ie, normal size and contractility).</li>\n\t<li>First-line treatment is anticoagulation (eg, heparin bridging to warfarin, DOAC) (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31154.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 7\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;

LV diameter), reduced systolic motion, septal flattening (ie, \"D-shaped\" RV), and tricuspid regurgitation.&nbsp; Cardiac biomarkers (ie, troponin-I, BNP) may be elevated due to myocyte necrosis from high wall stress and relative ischemia.</li>\n\t<li>Treatment is individualized.&nbsp; Anticoagulation is generally sufficient.&nbsp; Local (eg, catheter-directed) thrombolysis, where a fractional dose of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is infused into target pulmonary arteries, is considered for higher risk patients (eg, intermittent hypotension, elevated troponin-I).&nbsp; Close monitoring in the hospital is needed to detect progression to massive PE (ie, hypotension, worsening RV function), especially in patients with significant residual DVT.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Massive PE</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The clot burden is obstructive, usually affecting mainstem pulmonary arteries.</li>\n\t<li>The patient is hypotensive (ie, SBP &lt;90 mm Hg for &gt;15 min, or requiring vasopressors).</li>\n\t<li>RV strain is present and often severely dilated (ie, \"blown RV\").&nbsp; Cardiac biomarkers are elevated.&nbsp; Without treatment, a vicious death spiral ensues in which acute RV dilation compromises LV filling, leading to worsening hypotension and decreased right coronary artery perfusion, inducing RV ischemia and further dilation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108657.png\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>First line treatment is systemic thrombolysis with full-dose tPA, as long as there are no absolute contraindications (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/43022.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 8\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;

Patients with chronic RV failure (eg, pulmonary hypertension due to severe underlying COPD) can quickly decompensate, even with relatively small clots.</p>\n<h1>Complications of PE</h1><h2>Acute complication:&nbsp; Lung infarction and hemoptysis</h2><br><br><p>Despite having a collateral blood supply (from bronchial arteries), PE can cause lung infarction in roughly one-third of patients.&nbsp; When present, infarcts appear as a peripheral (subpleural) wedge-shaped opacity (ie, Hampton hump) on chest x-ray (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L81714.png\" alt=\"image 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The infarcted lung tissue is prone to bleeding.&nbsp; Minor hemoptysis (ie, &lt;100 mL/day) is common, especially after initiating therapeutic anticoagulation.&nbsp; Due to the high risk of recurrent VTE in the first 2 weeks, anticoagulation should not be interrupted for non-life-threatening hemoptysis.<p></p>\n<h2>Chronic complication:&nbsp; Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)</h2><br><br><p>Recurrent PEs (or incomplete anticoagulation) can result in unresolved thrombi that cause vessel scarring.&nbsp; On imaging, acute clots (ie, fresh fibrin) are typically smooth and lumen-filling, whereas chronic clots (ie, recanalized fibrin with endothelial hyperplasia) are typically eccentric and plastered into the vessel wall.&nbsp; Patients present with chronic right heart failure several years after initial VTE.&nbsp; CTEPH is important to identify because it is often surgically curable (eg, pulmonary thromboendarterectomy).</p>\n<h1>Complications of DVT</h1><h2>Acute complication:&nbsp; Venous compartment syndrome</h2><br><br><p>Phlegmasia cerulea dolens (\"inflammatory blue pain\") is a dangerous variant of DVT involving complete obstruction of a proximal (eg, iliofemoral) vein.&nbsp; Total lack of venous outflow causes severe congestion and inflammation, elevating tissue compartment over arterial perfusion pressure.&nbsp; The limb can become gangrenous due to ischemia.&nbsp; Management involves emergent thrombolysis (usually with catheter-directed tPA) and limb decompression (eg, fasciotomy) if necessary.</p>\n<h2>Chronic complication:&nbsp; Postthrombotic syndrome</h2><br><br><p>Chronic venous insufficiency (edema, pain, venous tortuosity, ulceration) can develop up to 2 years after initial DVT.&nbsp; Treatment is focused on mobilizing venous flow (eg, calf pumping exercise and graduated compression stockings) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/63372.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 9\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Primary VTE prevention</h1><br><br><p>Thromboprophylaxis refers to primary prevention of VTE and applies mainly to hospitalized patients who have reduced mobility.&nbsp; Pharmacological prophylaxis (typically with low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH] or unfractionated heparin) is used in most patients.&nbsp; Pneumatic compression devices are used for patients with contraindications to heparin (eg, thrombocytopenia) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L99225.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The rate of breakthrough VTE in these patietns is 10%-15% despite prophylaxis, and critically ill patients (eg, most inflammation) are at highest risk.<p></p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).&nbsp; The pathogenesis involves a triad of venous stasis, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability, which map onto clinical risk factors such as immobility, surgery or trauma, and systemic inflammation.</p><br><br><p>Venous duplex compression ultrasound confirms the presence of DVT.&nbsp; When PE is on the differential (eg, acute chest pain presenting to the emergency department), D-dimer testing is highly sensitive (rules out) and can prevent unnecessary imaging with CT angiography or VQ scan.</p><br><br><p>Management of VTE almost always involves anticoagulation (eg, direct oral anticoagulants), with very few exceptions (eg, distal calf DVT).&nbsp; Duration of anticoagulation is based on whether VTE is provoked or unprovoked, among other factors.&nbsp; Recurrent VTE with persistent risk factors usually require indefinite anticoagulation.&nbsp; Thrombolytic therapy (eg, tPA) is administered for massive PEs (ie, hypotension, acute RV dysfunction).</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
