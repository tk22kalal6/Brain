represents bronchospastic airway disease due to a workplace allergen or pollutant.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Occupational interstitial lung diseases (ILDs):</strong>&nbsp; include occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis (granulomatous ILD due to inhaled organic antigens) and pneumoconiosis (fibrotic ILD due to inhaled inorganic dusts).&nbsp; The 3 pneumoconioses (<em>pneumo</em> = lung, <em>konis</em> = dust) are coal workers' pneumoconiosis (aka \"black lung\") from coal dust, asbestosis from asbestos fibers, and silicosis from silica crystals.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>This article addresses silicosis, the most common form of occupational ILD worldwide.&nbsp; Silicosis is caused by the inhalation of crystalline silica dust from activities such as stonecutting and sandblasting.&nbsp; Exposure over several decades leads to lung inflammation and fibrosis.&nbsp; Silicosis is associated with chronic pulmonary infections (eg, tuberculosis, fungi), systemic autoimmune conditions (eg, rheumatoid arthritis), and lung cancer.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><h2>Risk factors</h2><br><br><p>Silica (SiO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>) is a highly abundant, naturally-occurring mineral in the Earth's crust.&nbsp; Most silica is found in crystalline structures (eg, quartz).&nbsp; Disruption of quartz (and other silica-containing rocks) produces a fine, respirable dust.&nbsp; Occupations at high risk of exposure include <strong>stone cutting</strong> (eg, granite countertops), hydraulic fracturing, and quarry work.&nbsp; Use of power tools (especially sandblasters) is the main driver of silicosis in industrialized nations.</p>\n<h2>Pathogenesis</h2><br><br><p>When inhaled, <strong>silica dust</strong> settles into the terminal alveolar air sacs.&nbsp; The silica particles are <strong>never removed</strong> from the lungs (ie, they penetrate lower than the mucociliary escalator).&nbsp; Instead, they are engulfed and accumulate within <strong>alveolar macrophages</strong>.&nbsp; A desmoplastic tissue response is induced, featuring inflammation (eg, cytokines, reactive oxygen species) which eventually leads to fibrosis.</p><br><br><p>Silicotic <strong>nodules</strong> (a core of silica-laden macrophages surrounded by a hyalinized fibrotic whorl) are the characteristic finding of simple chronic silicosis.&nbsp; The macrophages also migrate through the pulmonary lymphatic system to promote chronic inflammation within hilar lymph nodes, leading to characteristic \"eggshell\" calcification.&nbsp; Over many years (eg, decades), the fibrotic response spreads outward from the core, leading to the coalescence of nodules into larger masses and fibrotic bands (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L68515.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), known as progressive massive fibrosis.<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Silicosis is discussed in terms of 4 major clinical presentations, with the 2 most common being chronic simple silicosis and progressive massive fibrosis:</p>\n<h2>Chronic simple silicosis</h2><br><br><p>Chronic simple silicosis is associated with prolonged low-level silica exposure and a very long delay before onset of lung disease (eg, 10-30 years).&nbsp; Chest imaging shows scattered, smooth, subcentimeter <strong>nodules</strong>, mostly in the upper lung zones, corresponding to areas of greatest silica deposition.&nbsp; The nodules and mediastinal lymph nodes can be peripherally calcified (eg, <strong>\"eggshell\"</strong> appearance) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L48500.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; At this stage, pulmonary function testing is low-normal or shows early restriction.&nbsp; Patients generally have mild symptoms (eg, dry cough, mild exertional dyspnea) because the nodular lung fibrosis has not yet coalesced.&nbsp; Physical findings may be subtle (eg, faint inspiratory crackles) or absent.&nbsp; Over 50% of cases are discovered incidentally.<p></p>\n<h2>Progressive massive fibrosis (PMF)</h2><br><br><p>PMF is a late complication of chronic silicosis.&nbsp; Nodules enlarge and coalesce into fibrotic masses (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L83854.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), which are greatest in the bilateral upper lobes.&nbsp; The apical fibrosis can result in upward retraction (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97903.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) of the lower lobes and diaphragmatic \"tenting.\"&nbsp; Pulmonary function testing shows a restrictive pattern with reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO).&nbsp; As PMF progresses, patients develop activity-limiting dyspnea and potential complications such as cor pulmonale (ie, secondary pulmonary hypertension) and chronic mycobacterial and fungal lung infections.<p></p><br><br><p>At diagnosis, most patients have a mixed picture (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L45577.png\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) of chronic simple silicosis with developing areas of PMF.<p></p><br><br><p>The less common presentations are acute silicoproteinosis and accelerated silicosis.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Acute silicoproteinosis (rare):&nbsp; Patients present with rapid onset of fever and dyspnea weeks to months after brief but high-intensity exposure to silica dust.&nbsp; Alveolar macrophages are suddenly overwhelmed, causing the airspaces to fill with surfactant debris (resembling pulmonary alveolar proteinosis).&nbsp; Chest imaging shows diffuse ground glass opacification.&nbsp; Patients typically require hospitalization for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.</li>\n\t<li>Accelerated silicosis:&nbsp; This rapidly progressing form of chronic simple silicosis (eg, within 5-10 years) occurs mainly in workers with ongoing silica exposure.&nbsp; Compared to chronic simple silicosis, chest imaging shows greater nodularity and more extensive fibrotic changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis is primarily based on silica exposure history and compatible chest imaging.&nbsp; Chest x-ray has low sensitivity for small nodules.&nbsp; <strong>High-resolution chest CT (HRCT)</strong> is preferred due to its improved sensitivity and detailed characterization of lesions.&nbsp; For example, it aids in distinguishing simple silicotic (eg, smooth, sharply demarcated) from potential malignant (eg, spiculated, irregular margin) nodules.&nbsp; Lung biopsy is rarely needed.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management is <strong>supportive</strong> (eg, exposure avoidance, smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, supplemental oxygen, and immunizations).&nbsp; Complete avoidance of respirable silica is always preferred (eg, changing occupations) if possible.&nbsp; A silica-rated NIOSH respirator can be used to limit inhalation.&nbsp; Periodic pulmonary function testing (eg, vital capacity and DLCO) is performed to proactively detect onset of PMF.&nbsp; Patients with PMF and chronic respiratory failure should be referred for lung transplant consideration.</p><br><br><p>Individuals suffering from pneumoconiosis may qualify for certain occupational medicine-based governmental benefits (eg, paid disability, worker's compensation) depending on the level of whole-person impairment.</p>\n<h1>Associated conditions</h1><br><br><p>Silicosis (particularly advanced chronic simple silicosis and PMF) is strongly linked with several comorbidities.</p>\n<h2>Tuberculosis (TB) and other chronic lung infections</h2><br><br><p>Due to suppressed alveolar macrophage function and an inflammatory lung microenvironment, silicosis is an independent risk factor for TB acquisition and reactivation.&nbsp; Most clinical centers implement annual latent TB testing in patients with known silicosis.&nbsp; Active silicotuberculosis is suspected when patients develop constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, night sweats), hemoptysis, or new chest imaging abnormalities (eg, cavitation, consolidation).In addition to TB, silicosis is also associated with high rates of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and fungal lung disease (eg, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and histoplasmosis).</p>\n<h2>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)</h2><br><br><p>Due to continual apoptosis of pulmonary cells, silicosis is associated with molecular mimicry causing loss of self-antigen tolerance.&nbsp; Many patients have rheumatoid factor positivity and antinuclear antibodies and can develop clinical RA, scleroderma, and several other autoimmune conditions (eg, dermatomyositis).&nbsp; <strong>Caplan syndrome</strong> describes the combination of RA and nodular lung disease in silica and coal miners.</p>\n<h2>Lung cancer</h2><br><br><p>Silicosis also increases the risk of non–small-cell lung cancers (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma).&nbsp; Early (ie, curable) primary tumors can be easily overlooked because the new malignant nodule or mass is often mistaken for progressive silicosis or obscured within areas of silicotic lung fibrosis.&nbsp; PET scanning is usually unhelpful because cancerous and silicotic nodules are equally hypermetabolic.&nbsp; Attention to detail (eg, algorithmically tracking each nodule) is the key to detecting early lung cancer against a background of silicosis.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Silicosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/35827.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an occupational interstitial lung disease caused by inhaling crystalline silica dust (eg, stonecutting, sandblasting).&nbsp; Its pathophysiology involves irreversible accumulation of silica in alveolar macrophages, leading to inflammation and fibrosis over many years.&nbsp; Chronic simple silicosis features fibrotic (silicotic) nodules predominantly in the bilateral upper lobes.&nbsp; Progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) occurs as the nodules expand and merge into larger masses, resulting in restrictive lung disease and significant disability.&nbsp; Treatment is supportive, emphasizing avoidance of further silica dust exposure.&nbsp; Lung transplantation is considered in some patients with end-stage PMF.&nbsp; Due to persistent inflammation and immune dysfunction, silicosis is associated with an elevated risk of chronic pulmonary infections (eg, tuberculosis), systemic autoimmune conditions, and non–small-cell lung cancer.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
