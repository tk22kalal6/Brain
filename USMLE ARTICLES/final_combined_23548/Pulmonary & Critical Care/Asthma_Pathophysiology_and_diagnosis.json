This article highlights the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of asthma; management is detailed in a separate article.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The cellular basis of asthma is leukocyte-induced bronchoconstriction (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L41542.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; A combination of host susceptibility (eg, atopic genetic background) and environmental exposure (eg, dust mites, tree pollen) are involved in leukocyte priming, specifically upregulating the Th2 axis (ie, IL-5 primes eosinophils, IL-4 and IL-13 prime IgE production).<p></p><br><br><p>These primed (sensitized) leukocytes are easily activated (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/41998.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) under certain circumstances (eg, reexposure to allergen; upper respiratory infection; cold, dry air).&nbsp; When activated, they release preformed inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes) that cause episodes of bronchoconstriction, airway edema, and mucus hypersecretion.&nbsp; These events are known as asthma exacerbations.<p></p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The 2 strongest risk factors for developing asthma (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/94400.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are family history and atopy (eg, allergic rhinitis, eczema).&nbsp; In addition, risk factors include the following:<p></p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Early childhood respiratory viral-induced wheezing (especially respiratory syncytial virus) increases the risk for asthma in adulthood, likely due to skewing toward a chronic TH<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> immune profile.</li>\n\t<li>Obesity increases systemic inflammation and is associated with gastroesophageal acid reflux, which translates to greater airway irritation and reactivity.</li>\n\t<li>Occupational asthma develops gradually in workers who become sensitized to specific aeroallergens (eg, isocyanates in painters, flour glycoproteins in bakers).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>The prevalence of asthma is increasing around the world, in both children and adults, possibly due to a combination of increased urbanization (eg, pollution exposure), decreased immune tolerance due to lower infectious exposures in childhood (hygiene hypothesis), and increased case detection.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation and diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The cardinal symptoms of asthma are dyspnea, chest tightness, wheezing, and cough.&nbsp; Various classification systems (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31101.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 3\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) attempt to assign severity level (eg, intermittent, mild vs moderate persistent, step 3 vs step 4) based on symptom frequency and exacerbation risk.&nbsp; However, these classification systems tend to be difficult to implement in real-world practice due to reliance on patient recall (eg, symptoms &gt;2 days/week, &gt;1 night/week).&nbsp; A streamlined approach, reflecting real-world clinical presentation is presented here, with brief comments on management decisions, which are described in more detail in a separate article.<p></p>\n<h2>Less severe, better controlled</h2><br><br><p>Milder asthma tends to cause <strong>intermittent</strong> symptoms because airway inflammation is generally lower grade.&nbsp; Bronchial edema and bronchoconstriction are less intense and might come and go throughout the day.</p><br><br><p>Symptoms tend to be more prominent at night due to diurnal fluctuations in cortisol and autonomic tone (eg, higher parasympathetic activity in the evening [acetylcholine is a bronchoconstrictor]).&nbsp; Sputum is generally scanty and clear, reflecting mild airway edema fluid.&nbsp; Patients may also only notice symptoms during exercise or during exposure to extremes of temperature and humidity (eg, cold and dry, hot and humid).</p><br><br><p>The pertinent clinical findings reflect the intermittent nature of the obstruction:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Chest imaging is typically normal.</li>\n\t<li>During active bronchospasm, spirometry shows airflow obstruction (FEV<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font>/FVC &lt;0.7), and the ratio fully reverses (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85935.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (increases to ≥0.7) after administration of a bronchodilator (eg, albuterol).</li>\n\t<li>Between episodes of bronchospasm, spirometry is normal.&nbsp; A methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L66259.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is needed to provoke bronchospasm (a negative challenge argues strongly against asthma [high sensitivity]; a high sensitivity to methacholine is suggestive of asthma [moderate specificity]).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Treatment of mild asthma with intermittent symptoms focuses on acute bronchodilation with a <strong>short-acting beta-2 agonist</strong> (SABA) (eg, albuterol) as needed.&nbsp; Recently, combined <strong>bronchodilator plus inhaled corticosteroid</strong> (ICS) (eg, budesonide-formoterol), for both maintenance and relief, has emerged as a preferred strategy that recognizes the underlying inflammation even with periodic symptoms.</p>\n<h2>More severe, poorly controlled</h2><br><br><p>If asthmatic inflammation is uncontrolled, bronchial edema and constriction tend to be <strong>sustained</strong>, leading to symptoms that are present across multiple days and nights per week.&nbsp; The symptoms are bothersome and begin to interfere with daily activities (eg, missing school or work).&nbsp; Patients may frequently use their rescue inhaler, but with insufficient relief.&nbsp; In occupational asthma, symptoms tend to be persistent during the workweek but improve during weekends and vacations.</p><br><br><p>The pertinent clinical findings reflect the <strong>more persistent</strong> and severe nature of airway inflammation and obstruction:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Chest imaging is usually normal but might show increased bronchial markings (cuffing), indicating airway edema and hypertrophy, and potential hyperinflation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L18423.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (eg, &gt;10 posterior ribs visible, flattened diaphragms).</li>\n\t<li>Spirometry is more likely to show airflow obstruction due to more constant bronchoconstriction.&nbsp; Lung volumes may begin to show <strong>hyperinflation</strong> (↑ total lung capacity) and air trapping (↑ residual volume).&nbsp; Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide can be increased due to bronchial hyperemia.</li>\n\t<li>In occupational asthma, serial peak expiratory flow rate monitoring can show decreases that are specifically linked to the workplace.</li>\n\t<li>There may be laboratory evidence of persistent TH<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> airway inflammation, such as peripheral blood <strong>eosinophilia</strong> (typically &gt;5%) and elevated total IgE.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Treatment of more severe or persistent asthma focuses <strong>on suppressing airway inflammation</strong> to reduce bronchospasm.&nbsp; Combined <strong>ICS plus long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA)</strong> is the backbone of all regimens.&nbsp; The ICS is increased until symptoms are controlled.&nbsp; <strong>Adjunctive medications</strong>, such as leukotriene antagonists (eg, montelukast) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (eg, tiotropium) are added for uncontrolled symptoms.&nbsp; Patients with refractory asthma may need biologic therapy targeting TH<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> cytokines (eg, dupilumab) or even chronic low-dose oral glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) as a last resort.</p>\n<h2>Asthma exacerbations</h2><br><br><p>An asthma exacerbation (attack) is a rapid worsening of baseline symptoms, usually accompanied by a measurable decline in respiratory function (eg, decreased peak expiratory flow rate).&nbsp; Common exacerbation triggers include allergen exposure and viral upper respiratory infections.&nbsp; Patients with more severe and poorly controlled asthma are at higher risk, but exacerbations can occur even in those with previously mild disease.</p><br><br><p>Treatment of asthma exacerbations includes systemic <strong>glucocorticoids</strong> (eg, intravenous methylprednisolone), bronchodilators (eg, nebulized albuterol and ipratropium), and respiratory support (eg, supplemental oxygen and/or noninvasive ventilation).&nbsp; After patients are stabilized, any existing baseline therapy is stepped up (eg, increased dose of ICS-LABA).</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><h2>Episodic dyspnea, cough, and chest tightness</h2><br><br><p>Fluctuating respiratory symptoms could represent asthma with intermittent bronchospasm, but other conditions that have a similar presentation include:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD):&nbsp; Intermittent inspiratory stridor due to VCD is difficult to distinguish from expiratory wheezing.&nbsp; However, VCD results in inspiratory truncation (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L36373.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) rather than expiratory scooping (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L20113.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) on the flow-volume loop.</li>\n\t<li>Exercise-induced bronchospasm:&nbsp; A form of noninflammatory bronchoconstriction that can occur independently of asthma, specifically during exercise, due to more rapid inhalation of dry air.</li>\n\t<li>Upper airway cough syndrome (postnasal drip):&nbsp; Causes paroxysms of coughing that are worsened when allergic rhinitis flares (due to increased posterior sinus drainage).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Chronic dyspnea, cough, and wheezing</h2><br><br><p>Chronic dyspnea, cough, and wheezing could represent asthma with more persistent inflammation and bronchospasm, but other conditions that have a similar presentation include:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</strong>:&nbsp; In contrast to the reversible airflow obstruction of asthma, COPD is defined as constant obstruction (FEV<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font>/FVC remains &lt;0.7 after bronchodilator) that tends to worsen over years (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L94453.png\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; COPD tends to develop in older individuals with a heavier smoking history, but there can be significant overlap between COPD and asthma:<br><br>\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Some patients with COPD have eosinophilia, a significant bronchodilator response (eg, &gt;10% increase in FEV<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> or FVC) on spirometry, and a favorable response to an ICS.&nbsp; Despite these features, airflow obstruction never fully reverses, and there is structural evidence of permanent respiratory tract damage (eg, radiographic emphysema).</li>\n\t\t<li>Patients with years of poorly controlled asthma and recurrent exacerbations can develop permanent airway damage (eg, tracheobronchomalacia, airway fibrosis), resulting in fixation of the airway and diminished bronchodilator responsiveness.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Left heart failure</strong>:&nbsp; Congestion of the pulmonary and bronchial veins can cause reactive bronchoconstriction (cardiac wheezing).&nbsp; This is especially true with diastolic dysfunction, in which left-sided filling pressures can be significantly elevated.&nbsp; However, spirometry typically shows a restrictive pattern (depressed FEV<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font> and/or FVC with a normal ratio).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bronchiectasis</strong>:&nbsp; Repeated infections (eg, immune deficiency, aspiration) can produce chronic inflammation and weakening of the bronchial wall.&nbsp; Spirometry shows obstruction due to the collapsible airways.&nbsp; In contrast to asthma, however, bronchiectasis involves neutrophilic (rather than eosinophilic) inflammation against chronic bacterial colonization; mucus tends to be copious, thick, and yellowish (rather than whitish or clear), and the airways are dilated rather than constricted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Difficult-to-treat asthma</h2><br><br><p>Difficult-to-treat asthma (ie, with refractory symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite optimal treatment) could represent highly persistent endogenous asthma (intrinsic TH<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> airway inflammation).&nbsp; However, several superimposed conditions can mimic or worsen underlying asthma:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</strong>:&nbsp; Repeated microscopic aspiration of gastric acid fumes can irritate and inflame the airways.&nbsp; High airway resistance (eg, from asthma or comorbid obstructive sleep apnea) causes large negative intrathoracic pressure swings during respiratory effort, which can lead to worsening reflux during sleep in the supine position.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)</strong>:&nbsp; Up to 50% of patients with asthma are chronically colonized with <em>Aspergillus</em> spores (due to mucus trapping and dysfunctional airway cilia), and a portion of them can develop profound sensitization (ie, highly specific IgE).&nbsp; ABPA presents with thick (typically brown) mucus, and bronchiectasis may be seen on chest imaging.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other mimickers</strong>:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease:&nbsp; Nasal polyps, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug hypersensitivity.</li>\n\t\t<li>Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis:&nbsp; Eosinophilia, chronic rhinosinusitis (usually with polyps), progresses to multisystem vasculitis.</li>\n\t\t<li>Helminthic lung infection (eg, strongyloidiasis):&nbsp; Eosinophilia and wheezing, but symptoms worsen (rather than improve) in response to corticosteroid therapy.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Asthma is a chronic Th2&nbsp;airway inflammatory disorder causing leukocyte-induced bronchoconstriction.&nbsp; Diagnosis is based on spirometry.&nbsp; In patients with airflow obstruction at baseline (FEV<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font>/FVC &lt;0.7), asthma is confirmed by reversibility after bronchodilator (FEV<font size=\"2\"><sub>1</sub></font>/FVC improves to ≥0.7).&nbsp; In patients with normal baseline spirometry (eg, intermittent symptoms), bronchoprovocation testing (methacholine) can support the diagnosis (positive test at low doses) or rule out asthma (negative test).&nbsp; The severity of asthma exacerbations can range from intermittent to persistent and activity-limiting or even life-threatening and acute.&nbsp; Important triggers include viral upper respiratory infections, allergens (especially house dust mites and tree pollen), and medications (eg, beta blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).&nbsp; Difficult-to-treat asthma (ie, despite excellent medication adherence and technique) raises suspicion for superimposed conditions (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis), asthma mimics (eg, left failure, vocal cord dysfunction), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (irreversible obstruction).</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
