Lung cancer is classified into different histologic subtypes (small cell vs non–small cell) that have implications in terms of presentation and management.</p><h1>Pathogenesis and pathophysiology</h1><h2>Risk factors</h2><p>Risk factors for primary lung cancer include:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Cigarette smoking:&nbsp; Firsthand smoking is linked to 85% of cases (~30-fold risk increase compared to never-smokers).&nbsp; Cigarette smoke contains hundreds of carcinogens (aldehydes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines) that cause DNA damage through covalent adducts or oxidative radical formation.</li><li>Radon exposure:&nbsp; Radon (<font size=\"2\"><sup>222</sup></font>Rn) gas is the second most common cause of lung cancer in the United States.&nbsp; It is a radioactive element found within the Earth (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L77911.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), including residential soil and groundwater.&nbsp; Radon gas emits alpha particles (the most mutagenic type of ionizing radiation), creating genomic damage when inhaled.</li><li>Other established risk factors:&nbsp; Secondhand cigarette smoke, occupational exposures (eg, asbestos in pipe workers, silica dust in miners and quarry workers), and previous chest radiation therapy (eg, breast cancer) are all risk factors.</li></ul><p>Years of genotoxic stress (eg, from cigarette smoke, other carcinogens) overwhelm the intrinsic DNA repair mechanisms, leading to inactivating mutations of tumor suppressor genes (eg, <em>TP53</em>, <em>RB1</em>) or activating mutations in oncogenes (eg, <em>KRAS</em>, <em>BRAF</em>) that normally prevent or promote division respectively.</p><h2>Driver mutations</h2><p>Certain driver (gain-of-function) mutations, repeatedly observed in lung cancer, can drive neoplasia (eg, in never-smokers).&nbsp; They include chromosomal rearrangements resulting in constitutively active receptor tyrosine kinases (eg, EML4-ALK (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L9456.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), CD45-ROS1 fusion proteins).&nbsp; Activating mutations in <em>EGFR</em> and <em>HER2</em> are strongly associated with lung adenocarcinoma in never-smoking Southeast Asian female patients.<p></p><p>These driver (\"actionable\") mutations can be specifically targeted with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, erlotinib for <em>EGFR</em>-positive lung cancer, crizotinib for <em>ALK</em>-rearranged lung cancer), which display selective action and less off-target toxicity (ie, precision medicine).&nbsp; Therefore, dedicated molecular testing (eg, next-generation sequencing) for driver mutations is the standard of care for treatment planning.</p><h2>Carcinogenesis</h2><p>Lung cancer generally emerges from the metaplasia-carcinoma sequence (gradual buildup of mutagenic damage).&nbsp; For example, squamous metaplasia (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27298.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a precancerous lesion that progresses to squamous cell carcinoma.<p></p><h1>Histologic subtypes</h1><p>Primary lung cancer is generally classified (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/44434.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) into small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).<p></p><h2>Small cell lung carcinoma (15% of cases)</h2><p>SCLC arises from pulmonary neuroendocrine (Kulchitsky) cells.&nbsp;

PCT is the most common form of lung cancer in adolescents and young adult never-smokers.&nbsp; Like SCLC, PCT is derived from bronchial neuroendocrine cells.&nbsp; Unlike SCLC, PCT is a well-differentiated neoplasm with a slow, noninvasive growth pattern.&nbsp; It usually originates within the major airways and almost always has an endobronchial component.&nbsp; Histologically, PCT (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L62738.jpg\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) appears as nests of uniform cells, with \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin, embedded in a delicate hypervascular network.&nbsp; Like gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors, PCTs can secrete serotonin and histamine but at insufficient levels needed to produce overt carcinoid syndrome.<p></p><h1>Clinical presentation</h1><h2>Asymptomatic lung cancer</h2><p>The incidence of lung cancer in smokers is approximately 1% per year (~40% over a lifetime).&nbsp; Approximately 25% of new lung cancer cases are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.&nbsp; The only externally visible sign of otherwise asymptomatic lung cancer is digital clubbing (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22666.png\" alt=\"image 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Asymptomatic lung cancers (ie, small focal tumors) are usually caught at an early stage.&nbsp; Given the high incidence of asymptomatic lung cancer in smokers and the potential for curative resection, screening using an annual low-dose CT scan of the chest is offered based on certain characteristics (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/72500.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Screening has a mortality benefit (number needed to screen = 220 to prevent 1 death).<p></p><h2>Local effects of primary tumor</h2><p>In contrast to asymptomatic lung cancer, symptomatic lung cancer tends to be diagnosed at an advanced stage and is rarely curable.&nbsp; The tumor can produce symptoms through direct invasion or compression of airways, vasculature, nerve structures, or pleura and chest wall.</p><p><strong>Airways</strong></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Tumors can cause extraluminal compression or endoluminal obstruction of the trachea and bronchi, resulting in progressive dyspnea, resorptive atelectasis, and/or postobstructive pneumonia.</li><li>Centrally located tumors (eg, SCLC, squamous cell carcinoma) are more likely to cause airway obstruction than peripheral tumors (eg, adenocarcinoma).</li></ul><p><strong>Vasculature</strong></p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Tumors can erode into the pulmonary vessels, causing hemoptysis that ranges from minor (eg, episodes of blood-streaked sputum) to massive (eg, &gt;600 mL/24 hr).&nbsp;

For example, positive cytology (ie, malignant cells) on <strong>pleural fluid</strong> analysis (via thoracentesis) establishes stage IV; positive <strong>lymph node</strong> involvement (via endobronchial ultrasound and transbronchial needle aspiration [UBUS-TBNA]) establishes stages II to III.</li><li>Finally, in patients with a high-risk SPN or mass who have no lymphadenopathy or other lesions suggestive of metastases and are good surgical candidates, a <strong>lobectomy</strong> (or segmentectomy) to remove affected lung regions is performed and&nbsp;allows for simultaneous diagnosis and cure.</li></ul><p>A <strong>core biopsy</strong> is usually preferred over fine needle aspiration or cytology because it preserves tissue architecture, allowing for more detailed histologic characterization, and provides a higher cell yield, enabling molecular testing (eg, driver mutations).</p><h1>Staging, management and prognosis</h1><p>Lung cancer treatment is determined by histologic subtype (SCLC vs NSCLC) and stage.</p><h2>SCLC</h2><p>SCLC has extremely high rates of DNA synthesis and is very responsive to chemotherapy (eg, topoisomerase inhibitors) and radiation.&nbsp; Limited SCLC (ie, confined to one lung) is curable, whereas extensive SCLC has a poor prognosis.</p><h2>NSCLC</h2><p>NSCLC staging is based on the TNM classification system (Tumor size and extent, Nodal involvement, and presence of distant Metastases), with combinations of T, N, and M determining cancer stage (I through IV).&nbsp; Stages I and II are generally early-stage (vs advanced-stage).</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Early-stage</strong> tumors (eg, confined to ipsilateral lung and lymph nodes) can be cured through surgical resection (ie, lobectomy).&nbsp; Adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy are sometimes given to eliminate residual cancer cells.&nbsp; The cure rate is high (&gt;80%).</li><li><strong>Advanced-stage</strong> tumors (eg, spread beyond ipsilateral lymph nodes) are generally treated with chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation).&nbsp; Surgical resection is anatomically impossible due to the size and complexity of the primary mass.&nbsp; The response rate is variable, with a 5-year survival of approximately 20%.</li><li><strong>Metastatic</strong> lung cancer (ie, spread to contralateral lung, pleura/pericardium, or remote organs) is incurable and is treated with palliative chemotherapy to reduce tumor burden and improve quality of life.&nbsp; Malignant pleural effusions typically recur and can be managed with indwelling pleural drainage systems.&nbsp; The prognosis is poor, with 5-year survival &lt;5%.</li></ul><p>In addition, some tumors express antigens that allow them to disable the adaptive immune system.&nbsp; Most notably, the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is an immune checkpoint antigen that arrests proliferation lymphocytes (ie, T-cell exhaustion).&nbsp; Checkpoint immunotherapy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27200.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) with PD-L1 inhibitors (eg, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) reactivates these T cells and can produce dramatic results in NSCLC (possibility for complete remission).<p></p><h1>Oncologic emergencies</h1><p>Lung cancer is generally treated on an outpatient basis.&nbsp; However, some situations warrant hospitalization and aggressive treatment.&nbsp; These oncologic emergencies include metabolic and mechanical emergencies.</p><h2>Metabolic emergencies</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Tumor lysis syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Usually seen during treatment-induced necrosis of rapidly growing tumors (eg, SCLC) but can sometimes occur spontaneously.&nbsp; Treatment involves aggressive intravenous fluid therapy and rasburicase.</li><li><strong>Severe hypercalcemia</strong>:&nbsp; Usually associated with squamous cell NSCLC.&nbsp; Treatment involves aggressive intravenous fluid therapy, possible hemodialysis for renal failure, and bisphosphonates for concurrent bone lesions.</li><li><strong>Severe hyponatremia</strong>:&nbsp; Usually associated with SCLC-induced SIADH.&nbsp; Treatment involves hypertonic saline (if acute encephalopathy or seizures) followed by gradual correction over several days (eg, free water restriction, demeclocycline).</li></ul><h2>Mechanical emergencies</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>SVC syndrome (due to tumor compression)</strong>:&nbsp; SVC syndrome can progress to life-threatening upper airway or cerebral edema.&nbsp; Urgent stenting is required to restore venous drainage from the head and neck.</li><li><strong>Epidural spinal cord compression</strong>:&nbsp; Emergency imaging (spinal MRI) and intervention (eg, surgery and/or radiation, high-dose corticosteroids) are required to decompress the cord and preserve neurologic function.</li><li><strong>Pericardial tamponade</strong>:&nbsp; Pericardial tamponade is treated with pericardiotomy (fenestration) if the patient's hemodynamic status is stable and emergency pericardiocentesis if hemodynamic collapse is imminent (ie, hypotension).</li></ul><h1>Summary</h1><p>Primary lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, develops due to the continuous buildup of mutagenic damage, primarily caused by cigarette smoke and radon exposure.&nbsp; Symptomatic lung cancer is due to local effects, paraneoplastic syndromes (eg, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), or distant metastases.&nbsp; It is rarely curable, emphasizing the importance of screening to detect early-stage disease.&nbsp; Diagnosis requires biopsy for histologic classification (small cell lung cancer versus non–small cell lung cancer [adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma]) and additional testing for targetable driver mutations (eg, <em>EGFR</em> mutation) and immune checkpoint biomarkers (eg, programmed death ligand-1) expression in non–small cell lung cancer.&nbsp; Treatment is determined by disease staging:&nbsp; Early-stage tumors can be cured through surgical resection, advanced-stage tumors are treated with chemotherapy and radiation, and metastatic lung cancer is treated with palliative chemotherapy.</p></div>\n            "
