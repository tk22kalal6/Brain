Therefore, in utero, PVR is greater than SVR, and the majority of blood is shunted from the high-resistance pulmonary circulation into the low-resistance systemic circulation (ie, right-to-left shunting), through the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale.&nbsp; After birth, pulmonary expansion and aeration normally leads to diffuse pulmonary vasodilation and decreased PVR.<p></p><br><br><p>However, in PPHN, <strong>PVR remains persistently elevated</strong> after birth, generally in association with an underlying condition that affects the pulmonary circulation, as follows:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Underdeveloped pulmonary circulation</strong>:&nbsp; results in fewer pulmonary vessels with abnormal branching and differentiation.&nbsp; Risk factors for underdeveloped pulmonary vasculature include causes of pulmonary hypoplasia (eg, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, oligohydramnios, bronchopulmonary dysplasia).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Maldeveloped pulmonary vasculature</strong>:&nbsp; results in an abnormally thickened pulmonary arteriolar muscle layer.&nbsp; Risk factors for maldeveloped pulmonary vasculature include meconium aspiration syndrome and fetal pulmonary overcirculation (eg, premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Maladapted pulmonary vasculature</strong>:&nbsp; results in diffuse vasoconstriction of otherwise normally developed pulmonary vasculature.&nbsp; Risk factors for maladapted pulmonary vasculature include hypoxia, pulmonary parenchymal disease, and bacterial infections (particularly group B streptococcal infections).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Although SVR increases after birth, sufficiently elevated PVR (ie, greater than SVR) can lead to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale, often resulting in differential cyanosis with lower postductal oxygen saturation.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Most patients with PPHN present with <strong>cyanosis</strong> and <strong>respiratory distress</strong> (eg, tachypnea, retractions, nasal flaring, grunting) <strong>within 24 hours of birth</strong>.&nbsp; In PPHN, cyanosis occurs due to <strong>right-to-left shunting</strong> of deoxygenated blood, and may therefore improve (but will not resolve) with supplemental oxygen.&nbsp; Oxygen is a potent vasodilator that can decrease PVR and thereby decrease right-to-left shunting.&nbsp; However, in severe cases, PVR may still be greater than SVR, even with supplemental oxygen at maximal settings.&nbsp; In these cases, a reduction in PVR is directly proportional to a reduction in the volume of shunted blood, resulting in improved (but not resolved) hypoxemia.</p><br><br><p>In general, the pressure gradient across most right-to-left shunts is relatively low; therefore, the shunt itself rarely creates a murmur.&nbsp; In PPHN, a holosystolic murmur may be heard at the left lower sternal border due to tricuspid valve insufficiency (ie, tricuspid regurgitation) in the setting of persistently elevated PVR.&nbsp; In addition, patients with PPHN may have additional physical examination findings related to the underlying condition, such as staining of the skin and nails in meconium aspiration syndrome or flat facies in oligohydramnios (eg, Potter sequence).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>In cases of suspected PPHN, diagnostic evaluation includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Preductal and postductal oxygen saturation</strong>:&nbsp; performed as universal screening for congenital heart disease.&nbsp; In PPHN, there may be a difference of &gt;10% between the preductal (right hand) and postductal (foot) oxygen saturation, consistent with right-to-left shunting through the PDA.&nbsp;<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>This finding is indicative of severe disease and may not always be present.&nbsp; This difference can also be observed when comparing the preductal arterial partial pressure of oxygen (from the right radial artery) to the postductal arterial partial pressure of oxygen (from the umbilical artery) on arterial blood gas.&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chest radiography</strong>:&nbsp; typically normal but may show reduced pulmonary blood flow.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Echocardiography</strong>:&nbsp; the definitive diagnostic test for PPHN.&nbsp; Echocardiography shows <strong>elevated right ventricle pressure</strong> (RVp) with normal cardiac anatomy (ie, excludes congenital heart disease).&nbsp; The elevation in RVp relative to systemic blood pressure determines the severity of disease.&nbsp; In severe cases (ie, RVp is greater than systemic blood pressure), right-to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale can be visualized on echocardiography.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis for PPHN includes other causes of neonatal respiratory distress, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Respiratory distress syndrome</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L57477.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp;

a benign, self-limited (ie, resolves in 48-72 hours) condition that presents with respiratory distress immediately after birth in late preterm and term infants due to delayed resorption of retained fetal alveolar fluid.&nbsp;

Chest radiograph shows focal alveolar densities or consolidations.&nbsp; Pneumonia can coexist with PPHN, as demonstrated by elevated right ventricle pressure on echocardiography.&nbsp; Therefore, in cases of suspected PPHN, patients should be evaluated for infection (eg, complete blood count, blood culture) and given empiric antibiotics.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Congenital heart disease</strong>:&nbsp; can present with cyanosis that does not improve with supplemental oxygen due to right-to-left shunting.&nbsp; Echocardiography is required for differentiation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of PPHN involves supportive care (eg, maintaining normothermia, managing fluids and electrolytes) and specific interventions to improve oxygenation by reducing PVR, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Supplemental oxygen</strong>:&nbsp; variably improves oxygenation, depending on the presence of right-to-left shunting.&nbsp; In addition, oxygen is a potent pulmonary vasodilator.&nbsp; However, exposure to high oxygen concentrations can cause pulmonary injury due to formation of reactive oxygen species, and the fraction of inspired oxygen should be titrated to maintain a goal oxygen saturation of 90% to 95%.&nbsp; Supplemental oxygen should be administered noninvasively (eg, nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) to avoid pulmonary injury (eg, volutrauma, barotrauma).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Inhaled nitric oxide</strong>:&nbsp; selectively dilates pulmonary vasculature by increasing cyclic GMP in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L40510.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Nitric oxygen should be administered noninvasively in patients with adequate ventilation but persistent hypoxemia (despite supplemental oxygen) due to right-to-left shunting.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mechanical ventilation</strong>:&nbsp; may be considered in severe cases in which hypoxemia persists despite noninvasive supplemental oxygen or nitrous oxide.&nbsp; Settings (eg, positive end-expiratory pressure) should be adjusted to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation while minimizing the risk of chronic ventilatory injury and oxygen toxicity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</strong> (ECMO):&nbsp; may be considered for patients with refractory hypoxemia despite maximal medical therapy, including mechanical ventilation</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other pulmonary vasodilators</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Sildenafil:&nbsp; increases cyclic GMP by inhibiting phosphodiesterase-5</li>\n\t\t<li>Milrinone:&nbsp; increases cyclic GMP by inhibiting phosphodiesterase-3</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In addition, management of the underlying condition (eg, surfactant in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, empiric antibiotics in neonatal pneumonia) that is contributing to the pathogenesis of PPHN is essential to avoid disease progression and complications.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of PPHN depends on the underlying cause, severity, and response to treatment.&nbsp; Overall, the mortality rate has improved to 5%-10% with newer treatment modalities, including inhaled nitric oxide and ECMO.&nbsp; However, patients remain at increased risk for neurodevelopmental impairment (eg, cognitive deficit, behavioral problems), especially if there is a history of perinatal asphyxia or ECMO use.&nbsp; Optimal prenatal care and initial resuscitation and stabilization after delivery minimize the risk of developing PPHN as well as the risk of disease progression in patients with predisposing underlying conditions (eg, congenital diaphragmatic hernia).</p>\n<h1>Summary </h1><br><br><p>Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/66634.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is characterized by persistently elevated pulmonary vascular resistance that leads to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood through fetal circulatory pathways.&nbsp;
