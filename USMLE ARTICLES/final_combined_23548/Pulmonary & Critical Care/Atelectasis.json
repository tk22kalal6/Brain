It appears as a region of opacification on chest imaging, which can range from minimal impairment to significant hypoxemia, pneumonia, and other complications if not resolved.</p>\n<h1>Obstructive atelectasis</h1><br><br><p>Obstructive (resorptive) atelectasis is the <strong>most common</strong> form.</p>\n<h2>Pathogenesis</h2><br><br><p>Obstructive (resorptive) atelectasis occurs when a bronchus becomes blocked, resulting in loss of ventilation to the downstream lobe.&nbsp; Because the lobe continues to be perfused, alveolar gas is <strong>reabsorbed</strong> into the bloodstream.&nbsp; As the alveoli become airless, they collapse and appear opaque on chest x-ray (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L120468.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; This form of atelectasis is associated with:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Mucus plugging (eg, bronchial infections, pneumonia).</li>\n\t<li>Aspirated foreign body.</li>\n\t<li>Tumors or mass lesions (eg, lung cancer).</li>\n\t<li>Small airway collapse due to lung hypoinflation (eg, postoperative pain).</li>\n\t<li>Accidental mainstem intubation (ie, no ventilation of the other lung).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Anatomy</h2><br><br><p>Obstructive atelectasis can affect any lobe.&nbsp; However, the right middle lobe (RML) is most susceptible due to its small ostium, sharp takeoff, and propensity for compression by hilar lymph nodes.&nbsp; RML syndrome describes a pattern of recurrent RML atelectasis due to congenital narrowing or bronchiectasis (intermittent mucus plugging).</p><br><br><p>Lobar atelectasis develops more easily than segmental or subsegmental atelectasis.&nbsp; This is due to the presence of microscopic <strong>collateral ventilation</strong> channels (eg, pores of Kohn, canals of Lambert, fenestrae of Boren) in the peripheral airways, allowing air to be shared between neighboring segments but not between different lobes.</p>\n<h2>Effect of hyperoxia</h2><br><br><p>Obstructive (resorptive) atelectasis is exacerbated by breathing at a high FiO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> (eg, &gt;80%)).&nbsp; Normally when breathing room air, oxygen (21%) is absorbed quickly, but nitrogen (79% of molecules) diffuses more slowly across the alveolar membrane, constantly keeping some gas within the alveoli.&nbsp; Conversely, when breathing at a high FiO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font>, far less nitrogen is available to maintain the alveolar volume.</p><br><br><p>High FiO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> may be unavoidable to prevent hypoxemic respiratory failure, but it can lead to the completion of atelectasis in patients with borderline occluded airways (eg, edema, mucus).&nbsp; In such cases, the addition of positive airway pressure (eg, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) can allow FiO<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> to be decreased while simultaneously opening the airways.</p>\n<h1>Nonobstructive atelectasis</h1><h2>Compression</h2><br><br><p>Compressive atelectasis occurs when lung tissue is extrinsically compressed by the pleura, chest wall, or abdomen.&nbsp; Associated conditions include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Space-occurring pleural masses (eg, mesothelioma).</li>\n\t<li>Empyema or loculated pleural effusions.</li>\n\t<li>Blunt chest trauma (especially with flail chest).</li>\n\t<li>Ascites, bowel distension, or marked abdominal obesity.</li>\n\t<li>Hyperinflation of adjacent lobes (eg, bullous emphysema).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Compression atelectasis tends to be localized, limited to the area of lung tissue with impingement (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L119986.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Relaxation (passive)</h2><br><br><p>Relaxation atelectasis occurs due to passive elastic recoil of lung tissue (ie, no extrinsic compression).&nbsp; It develops secondary to processes that allow the lung (visceral pleura) to retract from the chest wall (parietal pleura), such as:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pneumothorax.</li>\n\t<li>Pleural effusion.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Relaxation atelectasis tends to affect the entire lung.</p>\n<h2>Adhesive</h2><br><br><p>Adhesive atelectasis involves <strong>insufficient surfactant</strong>, causing the alveolar walls to cling together due to their surface tension.&nbsp; It is associated with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults.</li>\n\t<li>Neonatal respiratory distress (hyaline membrane disease) in infants.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because it involves widespread depletion of surfactant, adhesive atelectasis affects multiple lobes bilaterally.</p>\n<h2>Contraction</h2><br><br><p>Contraction atelectasis develops due to fibrosis of the surrounding parenchyma or pleura, which restricts lung expansion.&nbsp; It is associated with:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Chronic parenchymal infections (eg, tuberculosis).</li>\n\t<li>Fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF], silicosis).</li>\n\t<li>Pleural scarring (eg, asbestosis, prior empyema).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Special forms</h2><br><br><p>Two named forms of atelectasis are seen in clinical practice.&nbsp; They may be caused by multiple mechanisms, and include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Rounded atelectasis</strong> (Blesovsky syndrome):&nbsp; The atelectasis involves an invagination of lung tissue associated with inflammation or fibrosis of the overlying pleura (eg, asbestos, rheumatic pleurisy).&nbsp; It appears as a well-defined, oval, mass-like opacity (pseudotumor) on imaging.&nbsp; Rounded atelectasis is always subpleural and can display as a comet-tail sign (tapered curve extending centrally, due to whirling of the bronchovascular bundle).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Linear atelectasis</strong> (ie, <strong>plate-like</strong>, or discoid):&nbsp; The atelectasis involves a pancaked lobar subsegment, creating a flat density on chest x-ray.&nbsp; Its mechanism is poorly understood, but it could represent a variant of obstructive atelectasis involving a small bronchus.&nbsp; It is associated with chronic hypoinflation (eg, severe obesity, neuromuscular disease, hemidiaphragm paralysis).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Consequences of atelectasis</h1><h2>Hypoxemia</h2><br><br><p>In areas of atelectasis, ventilation (V) is absent and perfusion (Q) is reduced due to local hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPVC).&nbsp; This natural mechanism constricts pulmonary arterioles in response to local alveolar hypoxia, redirecting blood flow toward better-ventilated regions to help maintain V/Q matching.&nbsp; However, HPVC does not stop perfusion entirely, so there is always a degree of V/Q mismatch and subsequent hypoxemia.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Minor atelectasis (eg, subsegmental) typically causes mild hypoxemia that is readily correctable with a small amount of supplemental oxygen.</li>\n\t<li>More substantial atelectasis (eg, multiple lobes) can cause severe hypoxemia due to the right-to-left shunt effect as blood passes through the collapsed lobes without being oxygenated at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Infection</h2><br><br><p>Atelectasis increases the risk for <strong>pneumonia</strong> due to trapped, stagnant secretions that promote bacterial overgrowth.&nbsp; Pulmonary immune cell function is also inhibited by local hypoxemia and acidosis.&nbsp; The risk for pneumonia is greatest in:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Frail patients with weak cough and prolonged immobility or those who are bedridden.</li>\n\t<li>Postoperative patients, especially following thoracic or abdominal procedures, due to factors such as pain, respiratory splinting, inhibited cough, and low tidal volumes.</li>\n\t<li>Patients with chronic bacterial airway colonization (eg, bronchiectasis).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In immobile or postoperative patients, atelectasis tends to affect the lower (dependent) lobes due to prolonged recumbency.&nbsp; Because atelectasis is so common in hospitals and long-term care facilities, patients are particularly vulnerable to nosocomial organisms such as Enterobacteriace<em>ae</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas</em> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/82104.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Iatrogenesis</h2><br><br><p>Although clinically significant in some contexts, atelectasis can also lead to misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary interventions.&nbsp; Lobar or segmental atelectasis can be misdiagnosed as pneumonia, leading to inappropriate antibiotic use.&nbsp; Bibasilar atelectasis can be misinterpreted as scarring or another interstitial lung disease.&nbsp; Rounded atelectasis can sometimes mimic a neoplastic nodule, leading to invasive diagnostic procedures (eg, biopsy, resection).</p><br><br><p>Conversely, atelectasis can be a convenient but inaccurate explanation for more serious conditions such as infections, parenchymal lung disease, or malignancy.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><h2>Work-up</h2><br><br><p>The work-up of atelectasis depends on whether it is acute or chronic.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Acute atelectasis</strong> (eg, hospitalized or postoperative patients) is typically the result of multiple obstructive mechanisms (eg, immobility, low lung volumes, mucus plugging).&nbsp; It typically resolves with activities that promote alveolar recruitment, such as mobilization, incentive spirometry, huff coughing (breathing in, holding the breath, then actively exhaling), or positive airway pressure (eg, CPAP) to stent open the small airways.&nbsp; Repeat chest imaging is not necessary if respiratory status is improving as expected (eg, oxygen weaned off over several days).&nbsp; For some patients, recovery takes longer (eg, weeks), and they may be discharged on home oxygen with outpatient rehabilitation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic atelectasis</strong> always warrants CT scan of the chest with <strong>potential bronchoscopy</strong> to rule out an obstructing lesion (eg, mass, foreign body).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Obstructive atelectasis</h2><br><br><p>Obstructive (resorptive) atelectasis is treated by reopening the blocked airway(s).</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>For mucus plugging, interventions include airway clearance techniques (eg, flutter valve, chest physiotherapy, postural drainage), bronchodilators, mucolytics, and positive airway pressure (eg, CPAP).&nbsp; Bronchoscopy is indicated in patients with large mucus plugs (eg, significant hypoxemia and multilobar atelectasis) or in patients who are unable to clear their own airways (eg, quadriplegia).</li>\n\t<li>For malignant or foreign body obstruction, interventional bronchoscopy is usually necessary and can assist with endobronchial stenting, tumor debulking, and foreign body retrieval.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nonobstructive atelectasis</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Compression and relaxation atelectasis (eg, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax) are treated by evacuating the pleural space (eg, chest tube).</li>\n\t<li>Adhesive atelectasis in adults with ARDS is treated by optimizing alveolar recruitment with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and, if severe, prone positioning.&nbsp; Neonates with respiratory distress syndrome may be treated with surfactant replacement therapy.</li>\n\t<li>Contraction atelectasis, if due to pleural restriction, can be remediated via surgical decortication of the fibrotic rind.&nbsp; However, atelectasis within areas of parenchymal fibrosis (eg, IPF) is typically irreversible.</li>\n\t<li>Rounded atelectasis typically requires no additional intervention.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Prevention</h2><br><br><p>Preventing atelectasis is a major part of avoiding hospital-acquired pneumonia in medically ill or postoperative patients.&nbsp; Strategies include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Early mobilization</strong>:&nbsp; Involves getting up out of bed, sitting upright, or ambulating at the soonest opportunity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Incentive spirometry</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L23031.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; Encourages deep breaths to reach a goal marker (eg, generally 1,400 mL for a 70 kg [154.3 lb] adult).&nbsp; A standard recommendation is to use the incentive spirometry to take 10 such breaths per waking hour.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Adequate analgesia</strong>:&nbsp; Helps reduce respiratory splinting, preventing lung hypoinflation.&nbsp; However, inappropriate opioid use can cause respiratory depression, potentially worsening atelectasis.&nbsp; This risk is relatively low in monitored settings (eg, surgical ward) in the perioperative period.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Radiographic differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Obstructive atelectasis can cause opacification of a lobe (lobar bronchus) or the whole lung (mainstem bronchus).</p>\n<h2>Lobar opacification</h2><br><br><p>Lobar opacifications can be due to atelectasis, consolidation, or pleural fluid.&nbsp; They can often be differentiated by \"pushes\" and \"pulls\" on the fissures, and the presence or absence of air bronchography.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Obstructive atelectasis:&nbsp; The lobe displays <strong>volume loss</strong>.&nbsp; Adjacent fissures are retracted (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L18422.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), the diaphragm is pulled up, and the mediastinum may be shifted to the side of atelectasis.&nbsp; Air bronchograms (in which air-filled bronchi are seen on radiograph against a background of opaque lung tissue) are <strong>absent</strong> because the bronchi are also gasless (no contrast against the opacified alveoli).</li>\n\t<li>Pneumonic consolidation:&nbsp; The lobe displays <strong>fullness</strong>.&nbsp; Fissures may have a bulging appearance (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/U125522.jpg\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;

Nonobstructive atelectasis includes compression (eg, pleural mass), retraction (eg, pneumothorax), and adhesive (eg, surfactant depletion in neonatal distress syndrome) forms.&nbsp; Complications of atelectasis include hypoxemia (due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunting) and pneumonia (due to stagnant secretions).&nbsp; Most cases of acute postoperative atelectasis can be prevented or treated with interventions that promote lung recruitment, such as early mobilization, appropriate analgesia, incentive spirometry, and chest physiotherapy.&nbsp; Chronic focal atelectasis calls for further investigation with chest imaging and possible bronchoscopy to rule out obstructing lesions (eg, masses, foreign bodies).<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
