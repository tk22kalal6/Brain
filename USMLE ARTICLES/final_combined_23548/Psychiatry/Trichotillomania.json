The hair pulling may be preceded by feelings of anxiety or tension, followed by a sense of relief, or occur without full awareness of the behaviors.&nbsp; The most common sites are the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelids, though any area of bodily hair can be affected.</p><h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><p>The lifetime prevalence of trichotillomania is estimated to be 0.6%-4%.&nbsp; Females are more commonly affected than males (10:1 ratio), and onset is typically during adolescence.</p><p>Several factors may increase the likelihood of developing trichotillomania, including genetic (first-degree relative with obsessive compulsive disorder) and psychologic (other habitual behaviors [eg, thumbsucking], major life stressors [eg, bereavement, trauma]) factors.</p><h1>Clinical presentation</h1><p>Hair-pulling frequency varies (eg, brief periods throughout the day, 2-3 hours continuously once a day), and areas of focus may also change.&nbsp; Common sites include the scalp (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L33634.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), eyebrows (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L96030.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), and eyelashes, though any area of bodily hair can be affected.&nbsp; Hair loss patterns also vary:&nbsp; areas of hair thinning are widely distributed and may contribute to irregular patches of total hair loss (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L95441.png\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Hair-pulling behaviors are not associated with erythema or scaly plaques/patches.<p></p><p>Various emotional and physical states may precede hair pulling, most often anxiety, boredom, tension, or an itching sensation.&nbsp; After pulling, patients may feel relief or gratification, which promotes further hair-pulling behaviors.&nbsp; The behaviors may also occur more automatically with less focus and awareness.</p><p>Additional behaviors may be seen with hair pulling, including pulling hairs of a certain color or texture (eg, gray or coarse hairs), pulling hair in a particular way (eg, at the root), and manipulating hair after pulling (eg, biting into small pieces, rolling between fingers, pulling through teeth, ingesting).</p><p>Ingesting hair after pulling (trichophagia) can lead to the formation of a trichobezoar (mass of hair in the stomach or intestine) and gastrointestinal complications (eg, perforation, obstruction).</p><p>Patients may seek treatment for hair loss but may feel too ashamed or embarrassed to be forthcoming about their behaviors.&nbsp; Hair-pulling is often done in private, and patients may attempt to hide areas of hair loss (eg, wear scarves or hats, fill in eyebrows with makeup).</p><h1>Diagnosis</h1><p>For a diagnosis of trichotillomania, the following criteria must be met:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss</strong></li><li><strong>Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling</strong></li><li><strong>Clinically significant distress or impairment</strong> in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning caused by the hair pulling</li><li>The hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (eg, a dermatological condition)</li><li>The hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (eg, attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder)</li></ul><h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Body dysmorphic disorder</strong> (BDD):&nbsp; can be associated with repetitive hair-pulling behaviors; however, in BDD, hair is pulled in response to perceived defects or flaws in appearance.</li><li><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong> (OCD):&nbsp; can involve repetitive hair pulling as a compulsion; however, the behaviors are in response to obsessions (ie, recurrent, distressing thoughts, urges, or images) or done to reduce anxiety about a dreaded event; trichotillomania can co-occur with OCD, in which case both diagnoses are given.</li><li><strong>Normative hair removal:</strong>&nbsp; very common and performed for cosmetic purposes only; this type of hair removal is not associated with distress or occupational impairment.</li><li><strong>Alopecia areata</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L44760.png\" alt=\"image 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; also characterized by patches of hair loss; however, these areas are circular, smooth, and completely devoid of hair.</li><li><strong>Androgenetic alopecia:</strong>&nbsp; also involves areas of hair thinning; however, this occurs in adults (in females, around the time of menopause) and is characterized by progressive hair thinning at the vertex and frontal hairline.</li><li><strong>Tinea capitis</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L111383.jpg\" alt=\"image 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; a cause of hair loss most common in children; however, erythematous, scaly patches or plaques are characteristic.</li></ul><h1>Evaluation and diagnostic work-up</h1><p>A thorough history and physical examination are necessary for diagnosis and to assess for conditions that may accompany (eg, major depressive disorder, excoriation disorder) or present similarly (eg, traction alopecia) to trichotillomania.</p><p>Skin biopsy and dermoscopy are often not necessary if patients or parents share a history of hair-pulling; however, if the diagnosis is uncertain, a dermoscopy in trichotillomania would show the following:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li><strong>Decreased hair density</strong></li><li><strong>New growth consisting of short hairs with tapered ends</strong></li><li><strong>Broken hairs of varying shaft lengths</strong></li><li><strong>Empty hair follicles</strong></li></ul><h1>Management</h1><p>First-line treatment for trichotillomania consists of psychotherapy with <strong>cognitive-behavioral therapy</strong> (CBT), which focuses on increasing awareness of habitual behaviors, regulating emotions, and developing adaptive coping skills.&nbsp; A specific type of CBT, habit reversal therapy, addresses hair-pulling behaviors in the following way:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Behavior-awareness training:&nbsp; consists of recognizing situations and settings in which hair-pulling occurs as well as improving awareness of urges, signals, and sensations associated with behaviors</li><li>Competing-response training:&nbsp; involves learning how to perform an opposing activity and/or an activity that precludes hair-pulling (eg, clenching fist and pushing it against thigh) when urge is experienced</li></ul><p>Pharmacotherapy with selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is reserved for symptoms that are refractory to psychotherapy.</p><p>Trichotillomania often co-occurs with other psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder; appropriate screening and treatment are recommended.</p><h1>Prognosis</h1><p>Trichotillomania follows a variable course, though if untreated its symptoms are chronic, waxing and waning in intensity.&nbsp; A favorable prognosis is associated with childhood onset and early intervention.</p><h1>Summary&nbsp;</h1><p>Trichotillomania involves recurrent hair pulling to the point of hair loss, accompanied by efforts to decrease or stop the behaviors (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/32007.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp;
