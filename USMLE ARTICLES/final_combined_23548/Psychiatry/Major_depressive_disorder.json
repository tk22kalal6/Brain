Symptoms must be persistent (≥2 weeks) and cause significant distress or functional impairment.&nbsp; MDD may or may not be precipitated by a psychosocial stressor and is highly variable in presentation.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The estimated 12-month prevalence rate of MDD is 5%.&nbsp; This condition is most common in young adults (age 18-29), and its overall prevalence appears to decrease with increasing age.&nbsp; MDD is about twice as common in women than in men, which may be related to reproductive hormonal effects on mood and an increased risk for interpersonal trauma.</p><br><br><p>Several factors increase the risk of developing MDD, including genetics, certain psychologic factors (eg, learned helplessness), and environmental factors (eg, victimization, social isolation, life stressors).&nbsp; In addition, biologic factors such as chronic pain and/or comorbid medical conditions (eg, neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions), exposure to certain medications and substances (eg, corticosteroids, alcohol), and reproductive life stages (premenstrual, peripartum, and perimenopausal periods) increase the risk.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>The pathogenesis of MDD is not completely understood but appears to be multifactorial, involving the interplay of biological, environmental, and psychologic components:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Neuroendocrine dysfunction:&nbsp; increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone in response to stress resulting in hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and excess glucocorticoid levels</li>\n\t<li>Neurotransmitter abnormalities:&nbsp; deficiency of monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine) as well as dysfunctional signaling of monoamines, GABA, and glutamate</li>\n\t<li>Neuroanatomical changes:&nbsp; decreased hippocampal volume and decreased gray matter volume of the amygdala</li>\n\t<li>Inflammatory pathway activation:&nbsp; increased levels of inflammatory markers (eg, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein)</li>\n\t<li>Abnormal neural circuitry:&nbsp; impaired activity of emotional regulation and reward centers of the brain</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Many of the symptoms associated with depression (eg, low mood, changes in sleep and appetite, fatigue) are common in everyday life.&nbsp; Symptom duration (majority of the day for at least 2 consecutive weeks) and severity (at least 5 symptoms) accompanied by significant distress and/or functional impairment provide differentiation from sadness and other emotional responses inherent to the human experience.</p><br><br><p>MDD causes the following emotional, cognitive, and physical changes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Low mood can be described by patients in different ways (eg, down, empty, sad, hopeless) or can be observed (eg, frequent tearfulness); irritability instead of sadness is common in children and adolescents.</li>\n\t<li>Decreased interest or pleasure in activities (anhedonia) may be experienced as not participating or caring about previously enjoyed hobbies/activities; this can include social withdrawal (eg, no longer attending family events) and decreased interest in sex.</li>\n\t<li>Weight or appetite changes vary and can either increase (eg, cravings for carbohydrates with resulting weight gain) or decrease (eg, skipping meals and losing weight).</li>\n\t<li>Sleep changes can include hypersomnia (increased nighttime sleeping and/or daytime naps) or difficulty sleeping (most commonly nighttime awakening with difficulty falling back to sleep).</li>\n\t<li>Psychomotor changes present as either restlessness (eg, pacing, hand-wringing, fidgeting) or retardation (eg, slow thinking and body movements, increased speech latency).</li>\n\t<li>Fatigue or decreased energy is very common in depression; everyday tasks that require minimal exertion are exhausting (eg, checking mailbox, brushing teeth).</li>\n\t<li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt can include negative self-evaluation and feelings of guilt for minor past failings (eg, accidentally denting a car years ago).&nbsp; Thoughts can be delusional (eg, patient believes they are the sole cause of climate change).</li>\n\t<li>Concentration difficulties or indecisiveness can include being easily distracted, experiencing memory issues, having difficulty making minor decisions (eg, what to wear).&nbsp; These may manifest as poor performance at work or school.</li>\n\t<li>Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts may range from passive thoughts of suicide (eg, not wanting to be alive anymore or being better off dead) to having thoughts about killing oneself with a specific plan as well as acting on suicidal thoughts.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Depressive episodes can range in severity from mild (minimum symptoms required for diagnosis with minimal distress or functional impairment) to severe (all or almost all symptoms for diagnosis with marked distress and significant functional impairment).</p><br><br><p>Additional features and timing of depressive episodes can be specified in the following ways:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>With atypical features</strong>:&nbsp; may include mood reactivity (ie, mood brightens in response to positive events), significant weight gain or increase in appetite, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis (ie, heavy sensation in arms or legs), and longstanding pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (ie, intense feelings and thoughts about actual or perceived rejection)</li>\n\t<li><strong>With psychotic features</strong>:&nbsp; delusions and/or hallucinations present, which are either mood-congruent (ie, content consistent with depressive themes such as death or punishment) or mood-incongruent (ie, content not associated with depressive themes such as delusion of having superpowers)</li>\n\t<li><strong>With catatonia</strong>:&nbsp; symptoms such as mutism, purposeless motor activity, maintenance of abnormal postures, and staring</li>\n\t<li><strong>With peripartum onset</strong>:&nbsp; involves onset of a depressive episode during pregnancy or within 4 weeks of delivery; about 50% of peripartum depressive episodes occur during pregnancy; psychotic features can also be present</li>\n\t<li><strong>With seasonal pattern</strong> (referred to as seasonal affective disorder):&nbsp; consists of recurrent depressive episodes that occur and remit during a particular time of the year (eg, onset in fall/winter with remission in spring)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>For a diagnosis of MDD, the following criteria must be met:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>At least 5 of the following symptoms</strong> (SIGECAPS mnemonic) are present during the same <strong>2-week period</strong>, representing a change from previous functioning; at least 1 of the symptoms is either <strong>depressed mood</strong> or loss of interest or pleasure (<strong>anhedonia</strong>):<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (eg, feels sad) or observation made by others (eg, appears tearful).&nbsp; Note: In children and adolescents, MDD can manifest with irritable mood.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>S</strong>leep:&nbsp; Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>I</strong>nterest:&nbsp; Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by subjective report or as observed by others)</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>G</strong>uilt:&nbsp; Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>E</strong>nergy:&nbsp; Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>C</strong>oncentration:&nbsp; Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>A</strong>ppetite:&nbsp; Significant weight loss when not dieting or significant weight gain (eg, a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>P</strong>sychomotor:&nbsp; Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (as observed by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down)</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>S</strong>uicide ideation:&nbsp; Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation, or a suicide attempt</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>\n\t<li>The episode is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance or another medical condition.</li>\n\t<li>At least 1 major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder or other psychotic disorders.</li>\n\t<li>The patient has not experienced a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Sadness</strong>:&nbsp; can also feature intermittent periods of feeling low; however, these episodes are normal and common responses to life stressors and are not persistent (&lt;2 weeks in duration), severe (ie, not associated with at least 4 additional MDD symptoms), or significantly impairing.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bereavement</strong> (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/33354.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):&nbsp; can also be characterized by persistent sadness, sleep disturbances, and concentration difficulties; however, mood symptoms are typically experienced in waves and revolve around thoughts of the deceased with a focus on feelings of emptiness and loss; suicidality and functional impairment are uncommon in grief responses.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Adjustment disorder with depressed mood</strong>:&nbsp; is also associated with low mood, hopelessness, and functional impairment; however, symptoms must develop in response to an identifiable stressor and not be great enough in quantity to be considered a major depressive episode.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Persistent depressive disorder</strong>:&nbsp; is also characterized by prolonged low mood and at least 2 cognitive or physical symptoms of MDD (eg, changes in sleep or appetite, fatigue, poor concentration); however, symptoms must occur most days for at least 2 years.&nbsp; These disorders can be concurrent if symptom quantity becomes sufficient to diagnose MDD.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bipolar disorder</strong>:&nbsp; involves major depressive episodes as well as manic/hypomanic episodes; if there is a history of a manic/hypomanic episode in a patient currently experiencing a major depressive episode, then a diagnosis of bipolar disorder would be given.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder</strong>:&nbsp; also presents with low mood, anhedonia, and other physical and cognitive symptoms of depression; however, there must be evidence on history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of substance/medication use that is capable of causing depression (eg, cocaine withdrawal, corticosteroid use).&nbsp; Remission of symptoms is usually associated with the discontinuation of substance use.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Depressive disorder due to another medical condition</strong>:&nbsp; also involves low mood and additional MDD symptoms; however, clinical findings of a pathophysiologic process known to cause depression must be identified (eg, multiple sclerosis, hypothyroidism).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory evaluation</h1><br><br><p>Laboratory tests are not indicated for the diagnosis of MDD.&nbsp; However, depending on clinical findings, evaluation of underlying medical conditions may be appropriate (eg, TSH for hypothyroidism, complete blood count for anemia, urine drug screen).</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>MDD is associated with a significantly elevated risk for suicide.&nbsp;

Prior history of a suicide attempt greatly increases the risk for suicide.&nbsp; Risk for suicide often determines the appropriate level of care for patients; patients that are at imminent risk of harming themselves (eg, suicidal ideation with a plan and intent) require emergent hospitalization.<p></p><br><br><p>Risk for mortality is also relatively higher in patients with MDD and chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer.&nbsp; Prompt screening and intervention is recommended.</p><br><br><p>Initial evaluation should always include an assessment for prior hypomanic or manic symptoms because management of bipolar disorder differs significantly from that of unipolar depression.</p><br><br><p>Lifestyle changes such as regular physical activity, sleep hygiene measures, and a balanced diet are recommended for all patients with MDD.&nbsp; Mild major depressive symptoms with no or minimal functional impairment often improve spontaneously without medication or psychotherapy, so close monitoring and regular follow-up visits may be sufficient.&nbsp; Moderate to severe symptoms often necessitate pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy:</p>\n<h2>Pharmacotherapy</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>First-line options include <strong>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</strong> (eg, escitalopram, sertraline) and <strong>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</strong> (eg, venlafaxine, duloxetine), which are generally well tolerated and have a decreased risk for adverse effects.</li>\n\t<li>Atypical antidepressants (eg, mirtazapine, bupropion) may be the preferred initial treatment in certain situations:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Bupropion</strong> (norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) is indicated if the patient has significant fatigue or hypersomnia, prefers a medication that is not associated with weight gain, and/or is interested in an antidepressant that is also a smoking cessation aid.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Mirtazapine</strong> (noradrenergic, serotonergic, and histaminergic) is indicated if the patient has experienced weight loss due to depression (can stimulate appetite) or insomnia (can be sedating).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tricyclic antidepressants</strong> (eg, amitriptyline) have efficacy in severe depression; they are less preferable due to the risk for anticholinergic effects, cardiotoxicity, and lethality with overdose.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</strong> (eg, phenelzine) are reserved for severe, treatment-resistant depression due to safety concerns (hypertensive crisis, lethality in overdose).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psychotherapy</h2><br><br><p>Psychotherapy can be used as monotherapy in mild to moderate depressive episodes or in combination with pharmacotherapy in severe MDD; various modalities appear to be equally effective in treating MDD:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</strong> seeks to identify and reframe negative thought patterns to help the patient develop adaptive ways of coping with stressors.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Interpersonal psychotherapy</strong> is appropriate when a specific life situation contributes to symptoms (eg, estrangement, grief, postpartum period); this treatment examines interpersonal conflict and its effects on emotions.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Psychodynamic psychotherapy</strong> explores prior childhood and formative experiences to identify unconscious patterns and conflicts that may be contributing to current depressive symptoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Electroconvulsive therapy</h2><br><br><p>Electroconvulsive therapy (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/34512.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) involves inducing a brief, controlled seizure under general anesthesia and is indicated in patients who have not responded to prior treatment and/or who require a rapid treatment response:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Patients with psychotic features</li>\n\t<li>Patients who have refused food or drink, resulting in malnutrition and/or dehydration</li>\n\t<li>Patients with acute and severe suicidality</li>\n\t<li>Patients with catatonia</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Comorbid anxiety disorders, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders are common and require screening and treatment.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of MDD is variable, ranging from a single episode with complete resolution of symptoms to chronic, debilitating symptoms resistant to treatment.&nbsp; Major depressive episodes can remit quickly (&lt;2 months) and spontaneously without treatment in some patients with mild symptoms.&nbsp; Risk of recurrence increases with subsequent major depressive episodes (eg, recurrence rate after 1 episode is 40%; after 3 episodes, 90%).&nbsp; Poorer prognosis is associated with longer symptom duration, psychotic features, and severe symptoms, as well as comorbid substance use, anxiety, personality, and trauma-related disorders.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Major depressive disorder (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/42287.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 5\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a common condition that involves at least 2 weeks of low mood, a loss of interest in activities, physical symptoms (fatigue, sleep/appetite/psychomotor changes), feelings of worthlessness or guilt, concentration difficulties, or thoughts of death or suicide.&nbsp;
