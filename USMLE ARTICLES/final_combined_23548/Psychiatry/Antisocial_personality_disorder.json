Characteristics of personality disorders are present by early adulthood and are generally stable across time and situations (eg, social, occupational, personal), causing significant functional impairment.</p><br><br><p>Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) involves a pervasive pattern of violating the rights of others accompanied by a lack of remorse.&nbsp; These behaviors are recurrent and generally start before age 15 (ie, evidence of conduct disorder by age 15) and continue throughout adulthood.&nbsp; ASPD is the only personality disorder that cannot be diagnosed in a child (ie, must be at least 18 years old).</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>ASPD is estimated to have a lifetime prevalence rate of 2%-5% among adults and is more common in males than females.</p><br><br><p>Several factors may contribute to the development of ASPD, including environmental influences (eg, abuse, neglect, parental criminality, delinquent peer groups) and neurobiologic factors (eg, abnormalities of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, which may contribute to deficits in emotional regulation and processing as well as impaired impulse control and judgment).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>ASPD is characterized by a pervasive pattern of violating the rights of others and spans from adolescence (ie, evidence of conduct disorder behaviors prior to age 15) to adulthood.&nbsp; ASPD can be <strong>diagnosed only in adults</strong> (age ≥18) who consistently demonstrate at least 3 of the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Unlawful behaviors (eg, theft, arson)</li>\n\t<li>Deceitfulness (eg, lying, defrauding others)</li>\n\t<li>Impulsivity (eg, quitting a job, moving)</li>\n\t<li>Physical aggression and irritability (eg, initiating fights)</li>\n\t<li>Recklessness (eg, driving while intoxicated, engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors)</li>\n\t<li>Irresponsibility (eg, unpaid bills resulting in collections, inability to maintain a job)</li>\n\t<li>Lack of remorse (eg, blaming others or making excuses for behaviors)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>ASPD can overlap with other disorders that also exhibit externalizing behaviors (eg, problematic behaviors directed toward others).</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Conduct disorder</strong>:&nbsp; is typically a childhood diagnosis and is a necessary precursor to ASPD.&nbsp; If conduct disorder behaviors continue into adulthood and become pervasive and enduring, then a diagnosis of ASPD is given.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Borderline personality disorder (BPD)</strong>:&nbsp; overlaps with ASPD in terms of impulsivity, recklessness, and manipulativeness; however, the motivation underlying these behaviors differs.&nbsp; Patients with BPD have marked emotional instability and fears of abandonment that can result in self-injurious behaviors and suicidal threats in an effort to preserve a relationship.&nbsp; This profile is in contrast to ASPD, in which behaviors are motivated by personal/material gain.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Narcissistic personality disorder</strong>:&nbsp; also characterized by exploitation of others and a lack of empathy; however, recurrent illegal activity and physical aggression are not typical.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Substance use disorders</strong>:&nbsp; are often concurrent with ASPD and can cause impulsivity, irresponsibility, and recklessness during intoxication/withdrawal.&nbsp; However, the behaviors in ASPD are pervasive and persistent, occurring both in the presence and absence of substance use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Psychotherapy has not been shown to be effective for ASPD, and insufficient evidence exists to support pharmacological treatment.&nbsp; Therefore, treatment focuses on improving comorbid conditions (eg, substance use disorders, mood disorders, ADHD) while avoiding medications that could cause further harm via dependence/misuse (eg, benzodiazepines, stimulants).</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>ASPD typically has a chronic course, although some behaviors may lessen as individuals enter middle adulthood (eg, age 40-50).&nbsp; ASPD is associated with significant social, occupational, and personal impairment, resulting in various functional consequences:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inability to maintain stable work/income</li>\n\t<li>Legal consequences, incarceration, recurrent criminal behavior</li>\n\t<li>Lack of meaningful relationships and social supports</li>\n\t<li>Comorbidities (eg, substance use disorders, mood disorders)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>ASPD involves a pattern of violating the rights of others, engaging in unlawful behaviors (eg, physical aggression, illegal occupations), and lacking remorse for consequences.&nbsp; Individuals must be at least 18 years old for diagnosis and have evidence of conduct disorder prior to age 15.&nbsp; Insufficient evidence exists to support the benefit of pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic interventions, and management consists of identifying and treating comorbid conditions.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
