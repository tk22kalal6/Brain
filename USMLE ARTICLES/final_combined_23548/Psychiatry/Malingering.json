Malingering involves deliberate behaviors that are meant to deceive others for secondary gain; it is not considered a mental illness.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>The prevalence of malingering is difficult to estimate due to the deceptive nature of the behaviors, which likely contributes to undetected cases and underreporting.&nbsp; Individuals involved in criminal and civil legal proceedings as well as patients with chronic pain receiving financial benefits appear to have higher prevalence rates.</p><br><br><p>Underlying motivations may include poor coping ability regarding significant life stressors, resulting in deception to obtain basic needs (eg, food, shelter); exaggeration of a co-occurring psychiatric or medical condition to control how the individual experiences illness; and a means of reducing legal consequences.</p><br><br><p>Several situational factors are associated with malingering, including lack of housing, financial concerns, and impending legal consequences.&nbsp; Malingering is also associated with antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Malingering can present in many ways and can be associated with different external incentives, including:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Simulated pain to obtain opioid medications</li>\n\t<li>Exaggeration of symptoms resulting from work-related injury to receive compensation</li>\n\t<li>Suicidal ideation to obtain admission into the hospital (for housing and food)</li>\n\t<li>Hyperactivity and/or inattention symptoms to obtain stimulant medications (for personal use and/or selling) or testing accommodations (eg, extended time for exams)</li>\n\t<li>Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (eg, nightmares, hypervigilance, flashbacks) to obtain disability benefits or avoid military duty</li>\n\t<li>Psychotic symptoms to avoid incarceration or be declared incompetent to stand trial</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Characteristics that may be suggestive of malingering include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Patient is uncooperative or defensive during evaluation</li>\n\t<li>Patient frequently responds \"I don't know\" to questions</li>\n\t<li>Reported symptoms are uncommon (eg, psychotic symptoms reported as black-and-white visual hallucinations)</li>\n\t<li>Reported symptoms are inconsistent with known pathophysiology (eg, sensory symptoms that do not follow anatomic distribution of innervation)</li>\n\t<li>Symptoms are endorsed indiscriminately (ie, large number of symptoms reported on review of systems)</li>\n\t<li>Inconsistencies occur within same evaluation (eg, reported symptom characteristics such as location, frequency, or severity change)</li>\n\t<li>Inconsistency with reported findings and clinical examination (eg, report of constant auditory hallucinations though no attentional issues during evaluation)</li>\n\t<li>Conditional statements of aggression or suicide (eg, \"If I don't get admitted, then I'm going to kill myself\")</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Malingering is <u>not</u> a mental illness, and there are no specific diagnostic criteria for this condition; however, malingering should be considered if any combination of the following is observed:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Medicolegal context of presentation (eg, patient referred by attorney for evaluation)</li>\n\t<li>Marked discrepancy between the individual's claimed stress or disability and the objective findings and observations (eg, patient reports blurting out and talking over others although no interruptions are observed during hour-long evaluation)</li>\n\t<li>Lack of cooperation during the diagnostic evaluation and in complying with treatment recommendations</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Factitious disorder</strong>:&nbsp; also involves the intentional falsification of physical or psychological symptoms; however, the underlying motive is to assume the sick role instead of obtaining external incentives; factitious disorder can co-occur with malingering as motivations can change depending on the situation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Functional neurological symptom disorder</strong>:&nbsp; presents with symptoms that are incompatible with recognized neurologic conditions; however, there are no obvious external incentives involved, and symptoms are not intentionally produced.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Medical conditions</strong>:&nbsp; can coexist with malingering; a thorough history and physical examination are necessary in order to avoid missing true pathology; some patients may have difficulty describing clear symptoms that occur in early stage disease (eg, autoimmune conditions, schizophrenia) and should not be assumed to be malingering; malingering is situational and episodic (ie, an individual that is malingering is not always malingering).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Identifying and managing patients who may be malingering is challenging.&nbsp; There are no definitive diagnostic tests or treatment algorithms to follow, and trying to determine whether or not a patient is being truthful runs counter to the ethos of medicine.&nbsp; There may also be uncertainty about missing true pathology and concern for liability.&nbsp; Malingering often elicits strong emotions in health care providers (eg, anger, frustration, fear) that can be detrimental to patient care if not managed appropriately.</p><br><br><p>A thorough history, including prior records and collateral information, and physical examination are crucial to identifying possible discrepancies and may require multiple visits.&nbsp; If malingering is suspected, the provider should:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Remain calm and avoid appearing judgmental or annoyed, as this may cause the patient to become defensive and prevent a thorough evaluation.</li>\n\t<li>Gently follow-up when patients report vague symptoms (eg, \"When people say they are suicidal, it can mean very different things.&nbsp; Help me understand what you experience when you are suicidal\").</li>\n\t<li>Explore inconsistencies carefully (eg, \"Your symptoms, depression and mania, typically do not occur in the way you are describing.&nbsp; Is there anything else going on that I could be missing?\").</li>\n\t<li>Ask open-ended questions to explore possible external incentives for reported symptoms (eg, \"What would help reduce your symptoms?\" or \"What are you hoping I can help you with today?\").</li>\n\t<li>Avoid making direct accusations that the patient is lying, as this could result in irreparable damage to the physician-patient relationship, legal action by the patient, and/or patient aggression.</li>\n\t<li>Clearly discuss objective clinical findings and share reasons why further testing and/or treatment is not indicated.</li>\n\t<li>State that the patient's symptoms can cause stress and result in worsening symptoms; offer appropriate psychosocial resources and/or a psychiatric referral to the patient as a means to improve coping skills and reduce stress.</li>\n\t<li>Avoid referrals to another physician or specialist unless there is uncertainty about the presence of true illness.</li>\n\t<li>Carefully document objective findings, inconsistencies, and clinical reasoning as to why further work-up and/or treatment is not indicated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Malingering involves the intentional falsification or misrepresentation of physical or psychological symptoms to obtain an obvious external reward (eg, money, time off from work, medications, housing) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/73053.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; A thorough evaluation, including review of medical history and collateral information, is necessary for identifying potential discrepancies in reported symptoms and examination findings.&nbsp; Approaching patients suspected of malingering in a calm and non-accusatory manner may lead to a more successful encounter and outcome.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
