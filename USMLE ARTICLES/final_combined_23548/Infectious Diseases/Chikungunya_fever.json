The term \"chikungunya\" comes from a language spoken in Tanzania, where CHIKV was first discovered; it means \"disease that bends up\" in reference to its most prominent symptom (joint pain).&nbsp; Although acute infection is typically self-limited, many patients develop chronic polyarthralgia/polyarthritis that can persist for months to years.<p></p>\n<h1>Epidemiology</h1><br><br><p>The primary vectors of CHIKV are the mosquitos <em>Aedes aegypti</em> and <em>Aedes albopictus</em>.&nbsp; Infections occur in tropical and subtropical regions, with outbreaks occurring typically during the rainy season (when mosquito breeding/vector density is highest).&nbsp; CHIKV has attained a worldwide distribution (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L117832.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) due to both increased human travel and expanded vector habitat.&nbsp; Risk of infection is greatest for travelers returning to endemic areas, but local transmission can occur.&nbsp; Rarely, CHIKV infection can occur by maternal-fetal transmission or blood product exposure.<p></p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagosis</h1><br><br><p>Mosquitoes become infected with CHIKV by feeding on blood from viremic humans or nonhuman primates (CHIKV's main reservoirs).&nbsp; Subsequent blood meals by an infected mosquito transmit CHIKV via saliva into the dermis of victims.&nbsp; The incubation period is usually 3-7 days, with most patients showing symptoms (asymptomatic seroconversion &lt;15%).</p>\n<h2>&nbsp;Acute phase</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Fever</strong>:&nbsp; Viral replication in the blood/lymphoid tissues produces significant viremia causing an intense immune response with high-grade fever (&gt;39 C [102.2 F]), that usually lasts about a week.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Polyarthralgia/polyarthritis</strong>:&nbsp; From the bloodstream, CHIKV directly invades the joints (eg, synovial fibroblasts), causing polyarthralgia in virtually all patients.&nbsp; Symptoms are typically severe, bilateral, and symmetric.&nbsp; CHIKV infection preferentially affects distal joints and most frequently involves the hands, wrists, ankles, and feet (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L117512.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), with lesser involvement of proximal joints (eg, shoulders).&nbsp; Examination often shows swollen, tender joints (synovitis), and swelling/tenderness of flexor tendons (tenosynovitis) may be seen.&nbsp; Imaging findings can be similar (eg, joint effusion, synovial thickening, bony erosions) to other causes of inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rash</strong>:&nbsp; Further replication in the skin often causes a rash that occurs in most patients and is typically erythematous, maculopapular, and generalized (usually starts in the extremities/trunk) (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10082.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ); the rash often appears several days after the onset of fever/arthralgia and usually fades in about a week.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other acute manifestations can include headache, malaise, myalgias, and mild cervical lymphadenopathy.&nbsp; Other laboratory abnormalities may include mild/transient thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.&nbsp; Severe complications and death are rare and usually limited to patients with underlying comorbidities.</p><br><br><p>During the acute phase (1-7 days from onset), diagnosis is confirmed by detection of CHIKV RNA using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.&nbsp; For presentations &gt;7 days after onset, serologic testing should be performed, with diagnosis established by the presence of IgM anti-CHIKV antibodies.</p>\n<h2>Chronic phase:&nbsp; Polyarthralgia/polyarthritis</h2><br><br><p>The exact mechanism of chronic arthralgia is not clear; persistent viral RNA found in synovial macrophages may provoke a prolonged response by immune cells and proinflammatory mediators (eg, IL-6, IL-17), analogous to rheumatoid arthritis.&nbsp; Polyarthralgia/polyarthritis can persist in up to half of patients and typically affects the same joints involved in acute infection (associated morning stiffness is common).&nbsp; The chronic joint symptoms are frequently severe/disabling and may endure for weeks, months, or even years.&nbsp; Although most patients eventually progress to full recovery, up to a quarter of CHIKV infections may result in long-term polyarthralgia.</p><br><br><p>Patients with chronic joint symptoms presumed due to CHIKV should have prior CHIKV infection confirmed (if not previously established) with IgG antibodies (detectable at 2 weeks; persistent for years).</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Acute CHIKV infection (ie, triad of fever, polyarthritis, and rash) can have multiple infectious mimics.&nbsp; Similarly, chronic CHIKV has a similar presentation to several autoinflammatory arthritides.</p>\n<h2>Mimics of acute CHIKV</h2><br><br><p>Dengue and Zika virus infections are the closest mimics of acute CHIKVdue to their shared clinical manifestations, identical mosquito vectors, and overlapping geographic distributions.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Dengue fever</strong>:&nbsp; is more likely to cause significant thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic manifestations, and retroorbital pain, whereas CHIKV infection tends to have only mild thrombocytopenia, more prominent arthritis (often with synovitis), and less common eye symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Zika virus infection</strong>:&nbsp; is usually asymptomatic (~80%) but can sometimes cause symptoms similar to those caused by CHIKV; however, Zika infections usually have less intense fever and arthralgia.&nbsp; In addition, conjunctivitis is common with Zika (~80% of symptomatic cases) and rare with CHIKV.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Given such overlap, patients with suspicious symptoms and relevant exposure should be tested for all 3 viruses to avoid misdiagnosis (coinfection with &gt;1 virus has been described).</p><br><br><p>Other infections that can cause fever, arthritis, and rash (eg, other alphaviruses, parvovirus B19, rubella, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, disseminated gonococcemia) should also be considered.</p>\n<h2>Mimics of chronic CHIKV</h2><br><br><p>Chronic CHIKV arthritis can be difficult to distinguish clinically from classic autoinflammatory causes (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, reactive arthritis), all of which may lead to chronic synovitis, joint erosion, and elevated inflammatory markers.&nbsp; A history of travel-related illness and serologic testing (eg, anti-CHIKV IgG) can often clarify the diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p><strong>Acute disease</strong>No antiviral treatment is available for acute CHIKV infection, so management consists of rest, hydration, and analgesia/antipyresis.&nbsp; Acetaminophen is the preferred initial treatment for CHIKV-induced arthralgia/fever due to possible coinfection with dengue (potential hemorrhage).&nbsp; Once dengue is excluded, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be added.</p>\n<h2>Chronic arthritis</h2><br><br><p>CHIKV patients with joint symptoms that persist after several months typically respond to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (eg, methotrexate), similar to other causes of chronic inflammatory arthritis.&nbsp; Although glucocorticoids are avoided during acute disease (immunosuppression may worsen viremia), they are sometimes used for short periods in postacute/chronic CHIKV patients with evidence of severe synovitis.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for CHIKV infection is generally good, with most patients eventually progressing to full recovery.&nbsp; Severe complications and death are rare and usually limited to patients with underlying comorbidities.&nbsp; However, chronic polyarthralgia/polyarthritis can significantly impact quality of life for weeks/months/years and requires careful management.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Vaccination can be considered in adults at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV (eg, frequent travel to endemic regions, laboratory workers).&nbsp; Mosquito exposure should be minimized, and patients with confirmed CHIKV infection should be counseled to avoid mosquito exposure during active viremia (~1 week) to reduce the risk of local transmission.&nbsp; Several models predict that the habitat of mosquito vectors (eg, <em>Ae aegypti</em>) will expand with climate change (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L88682.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), likely increasing the distribution of CHIKV infection.<p></p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Chikungunya fever describes the acute onset of fever, polyarthralgia, and rash after infection with CHIKV—an alphavirus transmitted to humans by <em>Aedes</em> mosquitoes.&nbsp;
