It is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific.&nbsp; Although most infections are asymptomatic, a small percentage progress to severe neuroinvasive disease, which can be fatal or result in permanent neurologic sequelae.&nbsp; Prevention with vaccination and mosquito control measures can reduce infection rates.</p>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>JEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the <em>Flaviviridae</em> family.&nbsp; JEV is transmitted primarily by <em>Culex</em> mosquitoes (especially <em>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</em>).&nbsp; The virus replicates in various hosts, primarily pigs and wading birds, and is passed to mosquitoes during feeding.&nbsp; Viral accumulation occurs in mosquito salivary glands, and a bite from an infected female mosquito can lead to human transmission.</p><br><br><p>After inoculation, the virus replicates in local tissues and regional lymph nodes.&nbsp; In most cases, the immune system contains the infection.&nbsp; In some individuals, however, the virus crosses the blood-brain barrier and infects neurons.&nbsp; The thalamus, basal ganglia, brainstem, hippocampus, and spinal cord are common sites of involvement.&nbsp; Neuronal damage occurs due to both direct viral cytotoxicity and immune-mediated injury.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Japanese encephalitis is endemic in many parts of <strong>Asia</strong> and the <strong>western Pacific</strong>, particularly in rural or agricultural regions where <em>Culex</em> mosquitoes breed in rice paddies and stagnant water.&nbsp; Peak incidence coincides with increased mosquito activity during monsoon season or rainy months.&nbsp; Risk factors for disease include young age (&lt;15) and lack of prior immunization.&nbsp; Travelers to endemic areas are also at risk if unvaccinated (particularly if traveling for a prolonged period of time during transmission season and spending time in rural regions).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The incubation period for JEV is usually about a week, and mosquito exposure in the endemic area is often known.&nbsp; Most individuals infected with JEV remain asymptomatic or, less commonly, have mild symptoms of viral illness (eg, fever, headache).&nbsp; When severe disease does occur (&lt;1% of cases), it typically begins with a <strong>prodromal phase</strong> characterized by sudden onset of nonspecific symptoms including fever, headache, malaise, and vomiting, which typically last for several days.&nbsp; The <strong>encephalitis phase</strong> follows and is characterized by:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Altered mental status</strong> (eg, confusion, disorientation, acute psychosis).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Seizures</strong> (often generalized tonic-clonic), especially in children.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Focal neurologic deficits</strong> (eg, hemiparesis or cranial nerve palsies).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Extrapyramidal (Parkinsonian) symptoms</strong> (eg tremor, rigidity, and abnormal posturing due to basal ganglia involvement).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Increased intracranial pressure and brainstem involvement may lead to respiratory failure.&nbsp; In some cases, flaccid paralysis may occur due to anterior horn cell involvement, similar to poliomyelitis.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Patients with encephalitis are often evaluated with lumbar puncture, neuroimaging (usually MRI of the brain), and electroencephalography.&nbsp; Diagnosis is supported by laboratory and imaging findings in endemic regions:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis</strong>:&nbsp; Typically reveals a viral pattern with lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal to mildly elevated protein, and normal glucose levels.&nbsp; Elevated opening pressure is often present as well.</li>\n\t<li><strong>JEV-specific IgM antibodies</strong>:&nbsp; Diagnostic in CSF.&nbsp; Serum IgM antibodies can be helpful in the appropriate clinical context but may also be positive in patients with asymptomatic infection or recent vaccination.</li>\n\t<li><strong>MRI of the brain</strong>:&nbsp; May show nonspecific bilateral T2 hyperintensities in the thalami, basal ganglia, midbrain, and hippocampus.</li>\n\t<li><strong>EEG</strong>:&nbsp; May demonstrate nonspecific, generalized slowing or epileptiform discharges consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis includes other viral and nonviral causes of encephalitis, seizures, and acute flaccid paralysis:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Herpes simplex virus</strong>:&nbsp; Commonly causes sporadic encephalitis; it is characterized by confusion, focal neurologic deficits, and seizures.&nbsp; MRI often shows abnormalities in the temporal lobes, and CSF usually shows elevated erythrocytes (in addition to lymphocytic pleocytosis).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cryptococcus neoformans</strong>:&nbsp; Can cause meningoencephalitis.&nbsp; The vast majority of infections occur in individuals with severe immunosuppression (eg, advanced AIDS).&nbsp; Most patients have a slowly progressive headache, lethargy, personality changes, and memory impairment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Guillain-Barré syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; Presents with progressive and symmetric ascending paralysis, paresthesias, decreased to absent reflexes, and possible respiratory distress.&nbsp; Guillain-Barré is not typically associated with fever or altered mental status at the time of symptom onset.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Enteroviruses</strong>:&nbsp; Commonly cause viral meningitis in the summer and early fall and present with severe headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, and low-grade fever.&nbsp; However, enteroviral meningitis does not usually cause mental status changes or Parkinsonian symptoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Poliovirus</strong>:&nbsp; Can cause acute flaccid paralysis from dysfunctional anterior horn cells similar to Japanese encephalitis.&nbsp; However, polio does not usually present with fever, mental status changes, headache, or seizures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>There is no specific antiviral treatment for Japanese encephalitis.&nbsp; Management is supportive and includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Seizure control with antiseizure medications.</li>\n\t<li>Monitoring and management of increased intracranial pressure.</li>\n\t<li>Respiratory support if brainstem involvement or coma is present.</li>\n\t<li>Physical and occupational therapy for rehabilitation in survivors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis of Japanese encephalitis varies by age, immune status, and disease severity.&nbsp; The mortality rate for neuroinvasive disease ranges from 20 to 30%.&nbsp; Among survivors, ~30% are left with significant long-term neurologic sequelae, including cognitive impairment, motor deficits, extrapyramidal symptoms, behavioral changes, and/or seizures.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Prevention is key to decreasing infection rates and includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Vaccination, which is recommended for individuals in endemic areas and travelers at risk (eg, longer travel, time in rural areas, outdoor activities).&nbsp; Childhood vaccination programs in endemic areas have dramatically reduced cases of Japanese encephalitis.</li>\n\t<li>Mosquito control measures (eg, nets, elimination of breeding sites).</li>\n\t<li>Protective clothing and insect repellent during seasons of peak mosquito activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Japanese encephalitis is a potentially severe viral encephalitis endemic to parts of Asia and the western Pacific.&nbsp; Although most infections are asymptomatic, some cases progress to severe encephalitis with mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and Parkinsonian symptoms.&nbsp; Patients with encephalitis can have significant morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; Diagnosis is usually confirmed by Japanese encephalitis virus–specific IgM antibodies in the CSF.&nbsp; There is no specific antiviral therapy, so management remains supportive.&nbsp; Prevention through vaccination and mosquito control measures is key to reducing disease burden.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
