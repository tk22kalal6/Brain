<em>Babesia microti</em> (United States, Asia) and <em>Babesia divergens</em> (Europe) are the leading species.&nbsp; The major environmental reservoir is small vertebrates (eg, white-footed mice).&nbsp; Asymptomatic infection can occur, but patients often develop clinically significant hemolytic anemia with flu-like symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, fatigue).&nbsp; Those with asplenia or immunocompromise are at risk for severe, life-threatening complications.</p>\n<h1>Risk factors</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Exposure to endemic areas (eg, Northeastern/Upper Midwestern United States).</li>\n\t<li>Exposure to tick habitats (eg, high grass, edge of forest).</li>\n\t<li>Nymphal <em>Ixodes</em> tick season (summer months).</li>\n\t<li>Blood transfusion.</li>\n\t<li>Risk for severe disease:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Asplenia/hyposplenism.</li>\n\t\t<li>Immunocompromise (eg, AIDS, malignancy, immunotherapy).</li>\n\t\t<li>Age &gt;50.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>The lifecycle of babesiosis involves vertebrate and invertebrate hosts.&nbsp; Although many mammals (eg, chipmunks, squirrels) can harbor <em>B microti</em>, the most prominent reservoir is the <strong>white-footed mouse</strong>.&nbsp; <em>Ixodes</em> larval ticks feed on mice in the late summer, molt into nymphs over the winter, and then transmit babesiosis to humans during bloodfeeding the following summer (May-September).&nbsp; The reservoir and lifecycle of other <em>Babesia</em> species vary by geographic location and <em>Ixodes</em> vector.</p><br><br><p>Following human transmission during tick bloodfeeding, sporozoites enter the bloodstream, attach to the erythrocyte membrane, and invaginate, leading to the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole.&nbsp; Within the erythrocyte, the sporozoite evolves into a ring-shaped trophozoite, which divides by binary fission into merozoites.&nbsp; Merozoites then lyse the red blood cells and infect new erythrocytes.&nbsp; Erythrocyte lysis increases proinflammatory cytokines, which can result in flu-like symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, headache, rigors).</p><br><br><p>Control of babesiosis is largely undertaken in the spleen, which traps infected erythrocytes as they pass through the red pulp.&nbsp; Activated splenic macrophages then engulf and destroy the infected red blood cells.&nbsp; As such, patients with splenectomy (as well as those with immunocompromise) are at greatest risk for life-threatening infection.</p>\n<h1>Pathology</h1><br><br><p>The parasite can be visualized on a thin smear of peripheral blood with Giemsa or Wright stain.&nbsp; Those with low amounts of parasitemia or patients with early infection may require multiple thin smears to identify an organism.&nbsp; The most common finding is the presence of ≥1 intraerythrocytic ring forms.&nbsp; Although this resembles <em>Plasmodium</em> (malaria), babesiosis is not associated with hemozoin (intraerythrocytic brown pigment) deposition.&nbsp; More rarely, a tetrad formation (<strong>Maltese cross</strong>) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19890.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is visualized, which is pathognomonic for babesiosis.<p></p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The severity of infection is generally related to the level of parasitemia.&nbsp; Patients who are immunocompetent typically have low levels of parasitemia (&lt;4%) and may be asymptomatic or develop mild to moderate disease.&nbsp; In contrast, those with immunocompromise, asplenia, or age &gt;50 are more likely to have significant parasitemia (&gt;4%) and to develop severe disease with complications.</p><br><br><p>Manifestations usually begin 1-4 weeks after transmission and may include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Flu-like symptoms</strong> with intermittent/sustained fever, chills, sweats, and myalgia.</li>\n\t<li>Hepatosplenomegaly (in some cases) due to trapping of infected erythrocytes.</li>\n\t<li>Signs of hemolytic anemia (eg, low hematocrit, high lactate dehydrogenase, low haptoglobin, reticulocytosis).</li>\n\t<li>Elevated indirect and direct bilirubin (scleral icterus is uncommon).</li>\n\t<li>Thrombocytopenia.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with severe disease typically also have nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; they are at greater risk for life-threatening complications, such as:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Renal insufficiency/failure.</li>\n\t<li>Pulmonary failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome).</li>\n\t<li>Congestive heart failure.</li>\n\t<li>Severe anemia.</li>\n\t<li>Shock.</li>\n\t<li>Disseminated intravascular coagulation.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Rash is uncommon and suggests coinfection with <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> (Lyme disease), which is also transmitted by <em>Ixodes</em> ticks.&nbsp; Lymphadenopathy is not a feature of babesiosis.</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Babesiosis is largely a <strong>seasonal disease</strong>; most cases arise at the end of peak nymphal <em>Ixodes</em> tick season in <strong>August and September</strong> (in the United States).&nbsp; Therefore, suspicion should be raised when a patient develops a flu-like illness with signs of hemolytic anemia on laboratory evaluation following exposure to an endemic area (especially during the late summer months).&nbsp; Although far less common, the other major risk factor is <strong>recent blood transfusion</strong> (babesiosis can survive in blood in cold storage for up to 1 year).&nbsp; Because <em>Ixodes</em> ticks can also transmit Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and other infections, patients diagnosed with these infections generally require evaluation for babesiosis.</p><br><br><p>Diagnostic confirmation involves one of the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Blood smear microscopy</strong>:&nbsp; Identifying the organism on <strong>thin blood smear</strong> using microscopy with Giemsa or Wright stain allows rapid confirmation of infection and quantification of parasitemia.&nbsp; Multiple thin smears may be required when parasitemia is minimal.</li>\n\t<li><strong>PCR testing</strong>:&nbsp; This test has high sensitivity and is useful when parasitemia is minimal or if microscopy is unavailable.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Serology can provide retrospective confirmation of babesiosis but has limited utility in the diagnosis of acute disease.&nbsp; All patients with babesiosis require evaluation for other <em>Ixodes</em>-borne tick infections (eg, Lyme disease).</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Malaria</strong>:&nbsp; Patients also develop a flu-like illness with hemolysis and intraerythrocytic ring-shaped forms.&nbsp; However, malaria has a different geographic distribution (eg, Africa, tropical climates) and hemozoin depositions (intraerythrocytic brownish pigment) are seen on microscopy.&nbsp; In addition, Maltese cross patterns are not seen.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lyme disease</strong>:&nbsp; Lyme disease is also transmitted by <em>Ixodes</em> ticks and may cause flu-like symptoms.&nbsp; However, a migrating, annular rash is often present (in early localized disease), patients do not have signs of hemolysis, and no intraerythrocytic parasites are seen on microscopy.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anaplasmosis</strong>:&nbsp; Anaplasmosis can cause flu-like symptoms, thrombocytopenia, and nonhemolyotic anemia.&nbsp; Blood smear can sometimes identify intracytoplasmic inclusions (morulae) in neutrophils, which confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp; Hemolytic anemia and intraerythrocytic parasites are not seen.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Leptospirosis</strong>:&nbsp; This widespread spirochetal infection is typically acquired when humans accidentally ingest the bacterium from contaminated food or water (urine of infected animals).&nbsp; Although patients typically develop flu-like symptoms, conjunctival hyperemia (suffusion) is often seen, hemolysis is uncommon, and no intraerythrocytic parasites are present.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Noninfectious causes of hemolytic anemia</strong>:&nbsp; No intraerythrocytic parasites are seen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Asymptomatic individuals</strong>:<br><br>\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>No antimicrobial treatment is required unless there is persistent parasitemia for &gt;1 month.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mild to moderate disease (typically immunocompetent with parasitemia &lt;4%)</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Oral azithromycin plus atovaquone (first line).</li>\n\t\t<li>Oral clindamycin plus quinone (alternative regimen).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Severe disease (typically parasitemia &gt;4%)</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Intravenous azithromycin plus oral atovaquone (first line).</li>\n\t\t<li>Intravenous clindamycin plus oral quinine (alternative regimen).</li>\n\t\t<li>Patients require hospitalization, supportive care, and (sometimes) red blood cell exchange transfusion.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Relapsed disease (usually severely immunocompromised patients)</strong>:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Reduce immunosuppression if possible.</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeat course of antimicrobial therapy (typically with the same agents previously used).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Complications</h1><br><br><p>Complications are most common in patients who have severe disease in the setting of immunosuppression, asplenia/hyposplenia, or age &gt;50.&nbsp; Common complications include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Severe hemolytic anemia requiring transfusion.</li>\n\t<li>Acute respiratory distress syndrome.</li>\n\t<li>Renal insufficiency/failure.</li>\n\t<li>Congestive heart failure.</li>\n\t<li>Disseminated intravascular coagulation.</li>\n\t<li>Splenic rupture (rare).</li>\n\t<li>Relapsed disease (usually within 1-2 months after treatment discontinuation).</li>\n\t<li>Coinfection with other <em>Ixodes</em> tick pathogens (eg, Lyme disease).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>Patients with asymptomatic infection are typically able to clear the parasite and usually experience no residual complications.&nbsp; Immunocompetent individuals with mild to moderate disease generally have improvement in symptoms within 48 hours of antimicrobial treatment initiation and complete resolution within 1-2 weeks.&nbsp; Patients with severe babesiosis are at greatest risk for life-threatening infection, morbidity, and relapsed disease.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Babesiosis (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/94205.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is an intraerythrocytic parasite infection transmitted primarily by <em>Ixodes</em> ticks.&nbsp;
