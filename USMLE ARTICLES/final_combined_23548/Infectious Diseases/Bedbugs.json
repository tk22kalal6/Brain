Adult bedbugs have flat, red-brown bodies (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L20303.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) and hide in clusters along the periphery and crevices of mattresses, bed frames, and surrounding structures.&nbsp; Bedbugs are nocturnal and attracted to warmth and carbon dioxide, typically feeding while their host sleeps.&nbsp; Bedbugs inject an anticoagulant while feeding, leaving a hemorrhagic punctum at the bite site.&nbsp; A typical blood meal lasts 5-10 minutes, and adult bedbugs can survive for up to a year without feeding.<p></p><br><br><p>Bedbug infestations can occur in any environment but are common in areas with high population density.&nbsp; Transmission occurs between colonized objects (eg, cushions, luggage) within a physical living space; human-to-human transmission is rare.</p><br><br><p>Therefore, risk factors for bedbug infestation include:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Living in multiunit housing (eg, apartments)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Purchasing preowned furniture or clothing</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Traveling to regions where bedbug infestations are common</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>Bedbug bites are typically painless and located on exposed areas (eg, neck, arms).&nbsp; Reactions to bedbug bites vary, and for some patients, the hemorrhagic punctum is the only evidence of a bite.&nbsp; For others, a local inflammatory reaction occurs, causing a small, erythematous papule or wheal with a central hemorrhagic punctum; pruritus is common.&nbsp; A linear series of bites with a \"breakfast, lunch, and dinner\" pattern (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L85957.png\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is characteristic but not always present.&nbsp; Bedbug bites typically heal within a week, although new bites occur with repeated exposures.&nbsp; Bedbugs are not known to transmit diseases.<p></p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis of bedbug infestation is primarily clinical and based on the characteristic appearance of the bites.&nbsp; Direct visualization of live bedbugs or their cast skins, eggs, or fecal stains confirms the diagnosis.&nbsp; Patients may also provide a history of recent travel or exposure to infested environments, including symptomatic household contacts.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>The differential diagnosis of bedbug infestation (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L22630.png\" alt=\"table 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">table 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) includes the following:<p></p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Chiggers</strong>:&nbsp; small mites that live outdoors (eg, grassy fields) and cause intensely pruritic, erythematous papules on exposed areas (eg, ankles, waistline)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Scabies</strong>:&nbsp; small mites that cause intensely pruritic, erythematous papules, often with burrows (fine, serpiginous lines), along intertriginous areas (eg, web spaces, axillae, buttocks)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Lice</strong>:&nbsp; infestation that causes widespread pruritus of the affected area (eg, scalp, body, pubic area) with visible, live lice</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Management of bedbug infestation involves both pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures as follows:</p><br><br><ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Pharmacological measures:&nbsp; Topical corticosteroids and/or oral antihistamines may be required for symptomatic relief until the bites heal.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Nonpharmacological measures:&nbsp; Definitive treatment requires eradication of bedbugs and their eggs with use of insecticides and laundering with high heat.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>To prevent bedbug infestation, travelers should carefully inspect bedding and store luggage on racks away from the bed.&nbsp; In addition, preowned furniture and clothing should be inspected and laundered before use.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis for bedbug infestations is generally favorable with prompt diagnosis and eradication of the infestation.&nbsp; Rarely, pruritus can lead to excessive scratching, secondary bacterial infection, and scarring.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Bedbugs are small parasitic insects that infest human dwellings and rely on blood meals for survival and reproduction.&nbsp; Bedbug bites present with small, erythematous papules or wheals with a central hemorrhagic punctum in a linear pattern on exposed areas.&nbsp; Diagnosis is clinical, with direct visualization of the insects for confirmation.&nbsp; Management is supportive, and eradication of the infestation is definitive.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
