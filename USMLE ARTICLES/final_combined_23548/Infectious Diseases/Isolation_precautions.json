These precautions are designed to protect healthcare workers and prevent the spread of infections within healthcare facilities.</p><h2>Key components</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Hand hygiene:&nbsp; Perform before and after patient contact and after removing gloves.&nbsp; Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred unless hands are visibly soiled.</li><li>Personal protective equipment (PPE):&nbsp; Wear gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection depending on the potential exposure (eg, blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions).</li><li>Respiratory hygiene:&nbsp; Encourage patients to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing and perform hand hygiene afterward.</li><li>Safe injection practices:&nbsp; Use aseptic techniques, sterile needles and syringes, and dispose of sharps safely in puncture-resistant containers.</li><li>Cleaning and disinfection of equipment and environment:&nbsp; Clean and disinfect reusable medical equipment and patient care areas appropriately between patient uses.</li></ul><h2>Examples of infections</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>HIV</li><li>Hepatitis B and C</li><li>Cytomegalovirus</li></ul><h1>Contact precautions </h1><h2>Overview</h2><p>Contact precautions (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L105275.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are used to prevent the spread of infectious agents, such as multidrug resistant bacteria or enteric organisms, that are transmitted by indirect (eg, environmental surfaces) or direct contact with the patient.<p></p><h2>Key components</h2><p>In addition to the standard precautions, encounters with these patients require:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Gloves and gown:&nbsp; Wear gloves and a gown upon entering the patient's room.&nbsp; Remove them before exiting and perform hand hygiene immediately.</li><li>Disposable equipment:&nbsp; Use medical equipment (eg, stethoscope) that is disposable (or dedicated to the patient) to avoid spreading infection via objects/materials.</li><li>Patient isolation:&nbsp; Place the patient in a single room when possible.&nbsp; If not available, cohort patients with the same infection.</li></ul><h2>Examples of infections</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA)</li><li>Vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em></li><li>Scabies</li><li>Impetigo</li><li><em>Clostridioides difficile</em> (<em>C&nbsp;difficile</em>):&nbsp; Handwashing with soap and water is required, as alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not kill <em>C&nbsp;difficile</em> bacterial spores.</li></ul><h1>Droplet precautions </h1><h2>Overview&nbsp;</h2><p>Droplet precautions (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L105274.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are used to prevent the spread of infectious respiratory droplets that are generated when a patient coughs, sneezes, or talks.&nbsp; Droplets, which are typically 30-50 µm in size, can remain suspended in the air for a limited period of time and travel short distances (usually 3-6 feet [0.9-1.8 m]).<p></p><h2>Key components</h2><p>In addition to the standard precautions, encounters with these patients require:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Surgical mask:&nbsp; Wear a surgical mask upon entering the room, especially when in close proximity to the patient (eg, &lt;6 feet [&lt;1.8 m]).&nbsp;</li><li>Patient isolation:&nbsp; Place the patient in a single room when possible.&nbsp; If not available, cohort patients with the same infection.</li><li>Limit patient transport:&nbsp; If transportation is necessary, the patient should wear a mask.</li></ul><h2>Examples of infections</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Influenza virus</li><li>Respiratory syncytial virus</li><li><em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em></li><li>Whooping cough (<em>Bordetella pertussis</em>)</li><li>Meningococcal meningitis (<em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>)</li></ul><h1>Airborne precautions </h1><h2>Overview&nbsp;</h2><p>Airborne precautions (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L105276.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are used to prevent transmission of microscopic (eg, ≤5 µm) aerosolized respiratory particles, which can remain suspended in the air for extended periods and travel long distances.<p></p><h2>Key components</h2><p>In addition to the standard precautions, encounters with these patients require:</p><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>N95 respirator masks:&nbsp; can filter out particles ≤0.3µm when properly fit; should be used during patient transport (which should be limited)</li><li>Airborne infection isolation room:&nbsp; uses negative pressure ventilation with a high-efficiency particulate filter to prevent airborne particles from escaping patient's room (door must always remain closed).</li></ul><h2>Examples of infections</h2><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\"><li>Tuberculosis (<em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>)</li><li>Measles (Rubeola)</li><li>Varicella zoster:&nbsp; Only in disseminated disease or an immunocompromised host.&nbsp; Contact precautions are also required.</li><li>Varicella (chickenpox):&nbsp; Only when uncrusted lesions are present.&nbsp; Contact precautions are also required.</li></ul><h1>Summary </h1><p>Isolation precautions (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/81907.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) are used to prevent the spread of infection among healthcare providers and patients.&nbsp; Standard precautions, which include hand hygiene and personal protective equipment, should be used for all patient encounters.&nbsp; Contact precautions involve the use of a gown and gloves to prevent infections that spread by direct or indirect contact.&nbsp; Respiratory droplets are infectious particles produced by coughing and talking, and can travel short distances.&nbsp; A surgical mask is recommended to prevent droplet transmission, particularly when in close proximity to the patient.&nbsp; Airborne particles remain suspended in the air, so an N95 respirator mask and a negative pressure ventilation room is necessary to limit spread.<p></p></div>\n            "
