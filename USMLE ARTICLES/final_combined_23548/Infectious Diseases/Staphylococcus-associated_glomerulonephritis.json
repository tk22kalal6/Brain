It is primarily seen in adults, in contrast to poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), which is more commonly seen in children (although it is occasionally seen in adults).&nbsp; SAGN occurs during infection or shortly after infection resolution, whereas PSGN arises several weeks following infection.&nbsp; Other causes of infection-related glomerulonephritis (GN)—including endocarditis-associated GN and GN due to nonbacterial infections (eg, hepatitis C virus infection)—are discussed in separate articles.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>SAGN arises when antibodies form <strong>immune complexes</strong> with staphylococcal <strong>bacterial antigens</strong>, depositing in glomeruli and activating the complement cascade (primarily the alternative pathway).&nbsp; This triggers inflammation, leukocyte infiltration, and glomerular injury.&nbsp; SAGN occurs concurrently with active infection from a variety of sources, most commonly cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia.&nbsp; Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, heavy alcohol use, and immunosuppression (eg, HIV, chemotherapy), all of which increase the risk for bacterial infections.</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>SAGN and PSGN differ in both patient demographics and timeline of infection:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>SAGN:&nbsp; More common in <strong>adults</strong>, occurring concurrently with <strong>active</strong> infection (usually from <em>S aureus</em>) with a variety of infectious sources (eg, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia).</li>\n\t<li>PSGN:&nbsp; More common in children, occurring several weeks after group A <em>Streptococcus</em> infection (eg, erysipelas, pharyngitis).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In SAGN, systemic signs of infection, including fever, malaise, and localized symptoms (eg, erythema, ulceration, productive cough), are often present.&nbsp; As with other types of GN, <strong>nephritic syndrome</strong>, including hematuria (gross or microscopic), proteinuria, hypertension, and acute kidney injury, is usually present.&nbsp; Occasionally, proteinuria exceeds 3.5 g/day (ie, nephrotic range), resulting in mixed nephrotic-nephritic syndrome.</p><br><br><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p><br><br><p>SAGN should be suspected in adults with signs of GN (eg, hematuria, proteinuria, elevated serum creatinine) alongside a confirmed or suspected concurrent or recent staphylococcal infection.</p>\n<h2>Laboratory testing</h2><br><br><p>A key laboratory clue is <strong>low serum complement</strong>, particularly low serum C3, reflecting complement consumption from an immune complex–mediated process (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L78734.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; However, hypocomplementemia is not universally present.&nbsp; Other forms of GN, including the following conditions (with some associated findings), should be excluded:<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Lupus nephritis:&nbsp; Antinuclear antibodies and anti–double stranded DNA autoantibodies.</li>\n\t<li>Goodpasture disease:&nbsp; Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies.</li>\n\t<li>Viral and malignancy:&nbsp; Hepatitis B/C and HIV antibodies, serum cryoglobulins, and protein electrophoresis showing free light chains.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Kidney biopsy</h2><br><br><p>Diagnosis often requires kidney biopsy for confirmation and for ruling out other causes of hypocomplementemic GN.&nbsp; However, biopsy can be deferred if GN coincides temporally with a confirmed active <em>S aureus</em> infection.&nbsp; Histologic findings include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Light microscopy</strong>:&nbsp; Diffuse endocapillary proliferation with neutrophils; crescentic or membranoproliferative patterns may occur.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Immunofluorescence</strong>:&nbsp; Dominant C3 with or without IgA/IgG deposits (starry sky or garland patterns).&nbsp; IgA dominance distinguishes SAGN from poststreptococcal GN.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Electron microscopy</strong>:&nbsp; Subepithelial hump-like deposits, although these overlap with C3 GN.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Definitive diagnosis hinges on clinical improvement after infection clearance, although residual renal dysfunction may persist.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>Treatment is dependent on <strong>infection eradication</strong> with culture-guided antibiotics.&nbsp; Supportive care includes loop diuretics for edema, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for proteinuria to treat hypertension, and, in severe cases, dialysis.&nbsp; Immunosuppression is generally avoided.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p><em>Staphylococcus</em>-associated glomerulonephritis is an immune-mediated kidney injury triggered primarily by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infection.&nbsp; Unlike poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, which typically affects children after infection resolution, <em>Staphylococcus</em>-associated glomerulonephritis occurs mainly in adults during infection or soon after resolution (eg, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia).&nbsp; Pathogenesis involves immune complex deposition in glomeruli, complement activation, inflammation, and glomerular injury.&nbsp; Clinical features include nephritic syndrome with hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and acute kidney injury.&nbsp; Diagnosis is suggested by concurrent staphylococcal infection, hypocomplementemia (particularly low C3), and characteristic biopsy findings.&nbsp; Management focuses on treating the underlying infection and using supportive measures, and immunosuppression is generally avoided.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
