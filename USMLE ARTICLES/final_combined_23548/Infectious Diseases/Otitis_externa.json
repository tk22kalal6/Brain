An allergic reaction to neomycin, a topical aminoglycoside, is a common cause.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chronic suppurative otitis media with perforation:</strong>&nbsp; The tympanic membrane appears inflamed, perforated, and immobile with pneumatic insufflation due to purulent fluid accumulation in the middle ear space.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The first step in management of otitis externa (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L108418.png\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is to remove any discharge or debris from the external ear canal, which promotes healing and allows topical medications to reach the site of infection and inflammation.&nbsp; Further treatment is based on disease severity (\n                                <div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/36890.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ), as well as whether the tympanic membrane is intact; perforation is often due to prior, unrelated disease (eg, otitis media).<p></p>\n<h2>Mild disease with intact tympanic membrane</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Topical acetic acid is effective in mild cases because its acidity inhibits bacterial growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Moderate to severe disease with intact tympanic membrane</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Topical fluoroquinolones</strong> (eg, ciprofloxacin) are first-line treatment because they are effective against <em>P aeruginosa</em> and <em>S aureus</em>; antibiotic resistance is rare because topical medications deliver a high concentration of antibiotic directly to the infection site.&nbsp; In addition, unlike systemic fluoroquinolones, topical fluoroquinolones have minimal adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients.</li>\n\t<li>Topical aminoglycosides (eg, neomycin) are effective but ototoxic and may cause iatrogenic hearing loss if spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane occurs.</li>\n\t<li>Topical glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone) are often added to treat inflammation in patients with severe pain or occlusive edema.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nonintact tympanic membrane (eg, perforated, tympanostomy tube)</h2><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Topical fluoroquinolones are preferred because they are not acidic or ototoxic and do not damage middle ear structures.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>In all cases, water exposure should be avoided until the infection has resolved.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>A full recovery is expected with topical antibiotics.&nbsp; Rare complications include periauricular cellulitis and necrotizing otitis externa as the infection spreads to surrounding soft tissue and bone at the base of the skull.&nbsp; These complications occur most commonly in immunocompromised patients and present with severe otalgia that appears out of proportion to findings from the physical examination.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Otitis externa may be prevented by wearing ear plugs while swimming and avoiding the use of cotton swabs.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Otitis externa (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31222.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) (swimmer's ear) is an inflammatory condition of the external ear canal that typically occurs due to bacterial infection (eg, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>).&nbsp; Water exposure is the most common risk factor.&nbsp; Patients develop otalgia, erythema, edema, and discharge or debris in the external ear canal.&nbsp; Diagnosis is clinical and treatment is topical antibiotics.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
