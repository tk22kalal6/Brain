In utero, the thyroid gland forms from an outpouching of pharyngeal epithelium at the base of the tongue (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L41298.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; It then descends to the base of the anterior neck via the thyroglossal duct, which extends from the foramen cecum at the base of the tongue to the superior midline border of the thyroid (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27547.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Normally, the duct then atrophies.&nbsp; Occasionally, failure of normal migration can leave residual deposits of ectopic thyroid tissue along the route of descent, and residual patency of the duct can manifest as a thyroglossal duct cyst.<p></p><br><br><p>As the cells migrate to the lower neck, they also fuse with parafollicular C cells from the ultimobranchial body of the 4th pharyngeal arch to form the mature thyroid glandular structure (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L92012.jpg\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h1>Anatomy</h1><br><br><p>The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland that sits on the midline in the lower neck, anterior to the trachea and inferior to the thyroid cartilage (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L32858.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; It is composed of 2 lobes with a central isthmus; most patients have a posterior extension from each lobe (tubercle of Zuckerkandl).&nbsp; The gland is supported by the trachea via the lateral suspensory ligament and is typically mobile, rising with the thyroid cartilage during swallowing.&nbsp; The parathyroids are a set (usually 4) of small glands that lie immediately posterior to the thyroid lobes.<p></p><br><br><p>Blood supply to the thyroid is primarily via the paired superior and inferior thyroidal arteries (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L28037.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Innervation to the thyroid is scant, primarily consisting of small sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers that regulate blood flow to the thyroid.&nbsp; However, the recurrent laryngeal nerve passes through the thyroid, and the superior laryngeal nerve runs in close proximity; these nerves can be injured during thyroid dissection or thyroidectomy.<p></p><br><br><p>The fundamental unit of thyroid microanatomy is the thyroid follicle (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L63636.png\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), spherical structures consisting of a core of glycoprotein colloid, which serves as substrate for synthesis of thyroid hormone, surrounded by cuboidal epithelium.&nbsp; The reticular tissue between follicles is highly vascular with a dense network of capillaries.&nbsp; The interfollicular space also contains the parafollicular C cells, which secrete calcitonin.<p></p>\n<h1>Thyroid hormone physiology </h1><br><br><p>Synthesis of thyroid hormone begins with thyroglobulin, a large glycoprotein produced in thyroid follicular cells and secreted into the follicular lumen (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L19012.jpg\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; The follicular cells also transport inorganic iodide from the bloodstream into the lumen.&nbsp; There, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) oxidizes iodide to iodine, and covalently links it to tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin (ie, organification), forming mono- and diiodotyrosine.&nbsp; TPO then couples the iodinated tyrosine residues to form triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4, also referred to as thyroxine), which are collectively termed thyroid hormone.<p></p><br><br><p>Thyroid hormone is stored in the thyroid follicles while still bound to thyroglobulin.&nbsp; In preparation for release, it is taken up into follicular cells, liberated from thyroglobulin by proteolytic enzymes, and transported into the follicular capillaries.&nbsp; Most thyroid hormone is released in the form of T4, with only a small amount of T3 released.&nbsp; T3 (the more active form of thyroid hormone) is then produced by deiodination of T4 in peripheral tissues.&nbsp; Most thyroid hormone in circulation is bound to plasma proteins, primarily thyroxine-binding globulin, transthyretin, and albumin.&nbsp; A much smaller free thyroid hormone pool is metabolically active.</p><br><br><p>Thyroid hormone acts on an intranuclear receptor that is ubiquitous in tissues throughout the body.&nbsp; It acts to stimulate the basal metabolic rate, increasing energy consumption and thermogenesis.&nbsp; It also increases expression of catecholamine receptors, amplifying adrenergic effects.</p>\n<h1>Regulation of thyroid endocrine function </h1><br><br><p>Thyroid hormone synthesis and release are regulated primarily by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is secreted by thyrotroph cells of the anterior pituitary (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26395.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Release of TSH is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus.&nbsp; Production of both TRH and TSH is suppressed by negative feedback from thyroid hormone.<p></p><br><br><p>In addition to T4 and T3, a small amount of thyroid hormone is released as reverse T3 (rT3), an inactive isomer.&nbsp; Conversion of T4 to rT3 also occurs in peripheral tissues; increased rT3 conversion, as can occur in severe illness, leaves less T4 available for deiodination to active T3, which serves as a secondary check on thyroid hormone status.</p>\n<h1>Effect of pregnancy </h1><br><br><p>Pregnancy requires increased thyroid hormone production to meet metabolic demands.&nbsp; Alterations to thyroid hormone levels occur through 2 primary mechanisms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Estrogen stimulates the synthesis of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and decreases TBG clearance, leading to higher circulating TBG levels and an increased pool of bound thyroid hormone.&nbsp; T4 production subsequently increases to maintain free hormone levels (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L39742.jpg\" alt=\"figure 9\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 9</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n\t<li>hCG (which shares a common alpha subunit with TSH and a similar beta subunit) directly stimulates thyrotropin receptors on thyroid follicular cells, resulting in increased T4 production.&nbsp; TSH levels typically fall due to negative feedback of thyroid hormone on pituitary TSH release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Laboratory testing </h1><h2>TSH</h2><br><br><p>Serum TSH is the primary laboratory test used in diagnosis and management of thyroid conditions.&nbsp; Abnormalities include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>TSH is increased in primary hypothyroidism, central/secondary hyperthyroidism, and under-replacement in thyroid hormone therapy.</li>\n\t<li>TSH is decreased/suppressed in primary hyperthyroidism, central hypothyroidism, and over-replacement in thyroid hormone therapy.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Because the pituitary response to changes in thyroid physiologic status is rapid and vigorous, TSH is generally the most sensitive marker in thyroid disease, with levels rising or falling before thyroid hormone levels are outside their laboratory reference ranges.&nbsp; The correlation between serum TSH and thyroid metabolic status is logarithmic, with changes at the lower end of the reference range representing a greater change in status than a proportional change at the upper end of the range.</p>\n<h2>Thyroxine (T4), free and total</h2><br><br><p>The bulk of circulating thyroid hormone is in the form of T4.&nbsp; Levels are elevated in primary and central hyperthyroidism, and decreased in primary and central hypothyroidism.&nbsp; Because free T4 is the metabolically active fraction and is less affected by plasma binding protein levels, many experts prefer free T4 over total T4 measurement for clinical decision making.</p>\n<h2>Triiodothyronine (T3)</h2><br><br><p>Serum T3 is often used in evaluation of hyperthyroidism; elevated levels serve to confirm an elevated T4 measurement.&nbsp; However, TSH, which is elevated in primary hypothyroidism, increases the share of thyroid hormone released as T3, and serum T3 levels are often normal in mild to moderate hypothyroid states.&nbsp; Therefore, T3 is not recommended in evaluation of hypothyroidism.</p>\n<h2>Thyroglobulin</h2><br><br><p>A small amount of thyroglobulin is released with thyroid hormone from thyroid follicular cells.&nbsp; Excessive thyroid hormone production in hyperthyroidism (eg, Graves disease) is typically associated with elevated serum levels of thyroglobulin.&nbsp; Thyroglobulin levels can be strikingly elevated when hyperthyroidism is due to destruction of thyroid follicles with release of preformed thyroid hormone (eg, painless thyroiditis, subacute [granulomatous] thyroiditis).&nbsp; Also, because thyroglobulin is made exclusively in the thyroid, patients who undergo total thyroidectomy (eg, for thyroid cancer) should have no detectable thyroglobulin in circulation; measurable levels suggest the presence of residual or recurrent neoplastic tissue.</p>\n<h2>Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies (Anti-TPO)</h2><br><br><p>Anti-TPO is classically used as a marker for chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis and related conditions (eg, painless and postpartum thyroiditis).&nbsp; In these disorders, high anti-TPO levels are associated with increased risk for progression of subclinical hypothyroidism (ie, elevated TSH with normal free T4 levels) to overt hypothyroidism.&nbsp; Anti-TPO is not specific to these disorders, however, and also can be seen in Graves disease and other autoimmune endocrinopathies.</p>\n<h2>Thyrotropin (TSH) receptor antibodies (TRAb)</h2><br><br><p>Autoantibodies against the TSH receptor can activate the receptor independent of TSH (ie, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin).&nbsp; These antibodies are the hallmark of Graves disease and are a sensitive marker for diagnosis.</p>\n<h1>Imaging</h1><h2>Ultrasound</h2><br><br><p>Because the thyroid occupies a relatively superficial position in the anterior neck, it is readily accessible to ultrasound imaging.&nbsp; Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice in evaluating thyroid nodules, and ultrasound characteristics (eg, size, echotexture, calcification) can be used to determine the risk for malignancy and need for tissue sampling.&nbsp; Ultrasound is also commonly used to guide fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid.</p><br><br><p>Ultrasound with Doppler can assess blood flow in the thyroid, which correlates roughly with metabolic activity and can clarify the differential diagnosis in hyperthyroidism.&nbsp; Graves disease, which is characterized by increased thyroid hormone synthesis, typically shows increased blood flow; destructive thyroiditis, which causes release of preformed hormone with decreased new hormone synthesis, shows decreased flow.&nbsp; Thyroid scintigraphy (see below) is usually preferred for this purpose but is contraindicated in pregnant women, in whom ultrasound is preferred.</p>\n<h2>Nuclear medicine</h2><br><br><p>Radioactive iodine uptake scintigraphy is widely used in the evaluation of hyperthyroidism.&nbsp; This imaging modality uses a radioiodine tracer to assess uptake and organification of iodine in the thyroid.&nbsp; Typical patterns include the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Diffusely increased uptake (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L97111.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) throughout the thyroid gland suggests Graves disease.</li>\n\t<li>Focal uptake (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L101695.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) with decreased uptake in the remainder of the gland suggests hypermetabolic thyroid nodules (toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter).</li>\n\t<li>Decreased uptake (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/U101685.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) throughout the gland suggests destructive thyroiditis or exogenous thyroid hormone intake.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Summary </h1><br><br><p>The thyroid gland synthesizes hormones that regulate the body's metabolic rate.&nbsp; These hormones are produced through a multi-step process that utilizes iodine, and their release is controlled via a feedback loop involving the pituitary gland.&nbsp; Thyroid-stimulating hormone, produced by the pituitary, is the primary screening tool for diagnosing thyroid conditions.&nbsp; Imaging techniques such as ultrasound and radioactive iodine uptake scans can further pinpoint the cause of the thyroid dysfunction, such as Graves disease or thyroid nodules.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
