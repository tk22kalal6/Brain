The nucleus contains and regulates access to the genetic code.&nbsp; The cytoplasm surrounds the nucleus and serves as the site of translation, metabolism, and signaling.&nbsp; Within the cytoplasm, membrane-bound organelles have specific roles in biosynthesis, degradation, and energy production.</p>\n<h2>Nucleus</h2><br><br><p>The nucleus is the command center of the cell, containing the nuclear genome and regulating gene expression.&nbsp; It consists of the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The <strong>nuclear envelope</strong>, the outer membrane of the nucleus, is a double-membrane structure perforated by small pores that regulate transport between the nuclear matrix and the cytoplasm (eg, of RNAs, nuclear proteins, and transcription factors).&nbsp; Its outer membrane is contiguous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which has ribosomes attaches to its cytoplasmic surface.</li>\n\t<li>The <strong>nucleosome</strong> contains DNA wrapped around histone octamers (chromatin).&nbsp; Chromatin, which helps modulate gene transcription (DNA to RNA), exists as unpacked euchromatin (transcriptionally active) and densely packed heterochromatin (transcriptionally inactive).</li>\n\t<li>The <strong>nucleolus</strong> is a dense intranuclear region where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed and ribosomal subunits are assembled.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Nucleoplasm</strong>, the internal fluid matrix of the nucleus, provides the medium for diffusion and contains:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Nucleotides (building blocks of DNA and RNA), S-phase enzymes (eg, DNA polymerase, helicase, topoisomerase), DNA repair enzymes, and DNA-associated proteins (eg, transcription factors).</li>\n\t\t<li>Pre-mRNA processing enzymes (eg, spliceosome proteins, poly-A polymerase, 5′ methyl capping transferases).</li>\n\t\t<li>Cell cycle checkpoint proteins (eg, cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases) that participate in cell cycle regulation.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cytoplasm</h2><br><br><p>Whereas gene expression and genome maintenance occur in the nucleus, most biosynthetic reactions, protein translation, and intracellular signaling occur in the cytoplasm, both in the cytosol and in membrane-bound organelles.&nbsp; The cytoplasm contains:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The <strong>cytosol</strong>, which is the aqueous intracellular solution where many biochemical reactions (eg, glycolysis, nucleotide synthesis), RNA processing and degradation, and signal transduction (eg, second messengers) take place.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Free ribosomes</strong>, which are complexes of rRNA and protein that synthesize soluble cytosolic proteins.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cytosolic inclusions</strong>, which are normal temporary storage compartments for nutrients (eg, glycogen, lipid droplets) or secretory granules for preformed bioactive mediators (eg, histamine granules, neurotransmitter vesicles).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Subcellular organelles</h2><br><br><p>Organelles are membrane-bound or protein-complex compartments with specialized roles.&nbsp; They include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Secretory pathway organelles (<strong>endoplasmic reticulum</strong> and <strong>Golgi apparatus</strong>) for synthesis, posttranslational modification, and trafficking of membrane-bound or secreted proteins to their correct location.</li>\n\t<li>Disposal pathway organelles (<strong>proteasomes</strong>, <strong>lysosomes</strong>, <strong>endosomes</strong>, <strong>peroxisomes</strong>) for degradation of proteins, damaged organelles, cellular debris, and ingested pathogens.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mitochondria</strong>, which contain their own genomes (mitochondrial DNA) and ribosomes, for oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid beta-oxidation, and apoptosis regulation via cytochrome c release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cytoskeleton</h2><br><br><p>The cytoskeleton is an array of filamentous proteins that determine cell shape, motility, and intracellular transport.&nbsp; It includes:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Microfilaments</strong> (actin) for cell motility and shape shifting.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Intermediate filaments</strong> (various proteins) for structural reinforcement.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Microtubules</strong> (tubulin) for intracellular transport, cell division (eg, mitotic spindle), and cilia.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cell surface</h2><br><br><p>The cell surface consists of the plasma membrane and associated structures that mediate barrier function, molecular transport, and cell surface signaling.&nbsp; It includes the:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Glycocalyx</strong>, which is an outer carbohydrate-rich coat that protects cells from chemical or mechanical injuries (eg, extracellular enzymes, shear stress), mediates adhesion, and regulates innate immune recognition (eg, ABO antigens).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Plasma membrane</strong>, which is a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins such as receptors, ion channels, transporters, and junctional proteins (eg, occludins, cadherins, connexins).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Membrane microdomains</strong>, which are tiny regions for receptor clustering, endocytosis, or focused signaling compartmentalization.&nbsp; They include:\n\t<ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t\t<li>Lipid rafts (eg, Fc epsilon receptor–IgE [FCεR-IgE] clustering in mast cells).</li>\n\t\t<li>Clathrin-coated pits (eg, internalization of transferrin).</li>\n\t\t<li>Caveolae (eg, insulin receptor and GLUT4 translocation).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Integrated systems</h1><br><br><p>Most cell processes span multiple locations.&nbsp; Some examples are listed.</p>\n<h2>Metabolic pathways</h2><br><br><p>Major biochemical pathways have dual cytosolic and mitochondrial phases:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Amino acid catabolism</strong> involves transamination in the cytosol (eg, alanine transaminase) and deamination in mitochondria (eg, glutamate dehydrogenase) to release free ammonia.</li>\n\t<li>The <strong>urea cycle</strong> involves mitochondrial enzymes (eg, ornithine transcarbamylase) that initiate ammonia detoxification and cytosolic enzymes (eg, arginase) that complete the conversion of ammonia to urea for excretion.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gluconeogenesis</strong> begins in mitochondria (eg, pyruvate carboxylase) and continues in cytosol (eg, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) to generate free glucose.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Heme synthesis</strong> involves mitochondrial (eg, aminolevulinic acid synthase) and cytosolic steps.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Pyrimidine synthesis</strong> occurs primarily in the cytosol but requires a key mitochondrial enzyme (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Beta-oxidation</strong> involves fatty acyl-CoA activation in the cytosol, transport into mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle, and beta-oxidation within the mitochondrial matrix.&nbsp; Separately, very-long-chain fatty acids are initially shortened in peroxisomes before entering mitochondria.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Metabolic processes confined to the cytosol include <strong>glycolysis</strong> and the pentose phosphate pathway.&nbsp; Red blood cells (RBCs), which lack nuclei and mitochondria, use these pathways to generate ATP and NADPH (which regenerates reduced glutathione for antioxidant defense), respectively.&nbsp; Lack of mitochondrial metabolism makes RBCs uniquely susceptible to pyruvate kinase deficiency (hemolysis due to ATP depletion) and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency (hemolysis due to hemoglobin oxidation).</p>\n<h2>Corticosteroid hormones</h2><br><br><p>Corticosteroid hormone <strong>synthesis</strong> (eg, cholesterol to pregnenolone) begins in the mitochondria and then proceeds largely in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (eg, additional modifications to produce cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone, estrogen, and others).&nbsp; Corticosteroid hormone <strong>signaling</strong> begins with cytosolic receptors, followed by nuclear translocation to regulate gene transcription.</p>\n<h2>Apoptosis</h2><br><br><p>Apoptosis begins in the mitochondria (eg, cytochrome c release), amplifies in the cytoplasm (eg, caspase cascade), and culminates in the nucleus (eg, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation.</p>\n<h2>Gene expression</h2><br><br><p>Gene expression begins with transcription and pre-mRNA processing in the nucleus, followed by translation of mRNA by cytoplasmic ribosomes (for soluble cytosolic proteins) or rough endoplasmic reticulum–bound ribosomes (for secreted or membrane-bound proteins)</p>\n<h2>Cell cycle</h2><br><br><p>Cyclins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus at key transitions in the cell cycle to activate cyclin-dependent kinases.&nbsp; For instance, cyclin B accumulates in the cytoplasm during the G<font size=\"2\"><sub>2</sub></font> phase and enters the nucleus only at the M phase (mitosis) to trigger nuclear envelope breakdown.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>The nucleus is the central regulatory hub for gene expression and cell cycle control, which are coordinated via chromatin states, the nucleolus (ribosomal RNA), and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport.&nbsp; The cytoplasm contains free ribosomes dedicated to synthesizing soluble cytosolic proteins, whereas specialized inclusions provide temporary storage for nutrients or bioactive compounds.&nbsp; Membrane-bound organelles are organized into distinct systems:&nbsp; Secretory organelles (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus) process and traffic secreted or membrane-bound proteins, disposal organelles (lysosomes, proteasomes, and peroxisomes) degrade macromolecules and damaged structures, and mitochondria drive energy production and regulate apoptosis.&nbsp; The cytoskeleton maintains cell shape, facilitates intracellular transport, and enables mitotic division.&nbsp; At the cell surface, the glycocalyx and plasma membrane microdomains enable receptor signaling.&nbsp; Many essential cellular processes span multiple compartments.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
