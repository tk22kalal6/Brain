Over time, these substrates cause clinically significant cellular and tissue dysfunction.</p>\n<h1>Pathophysiology</h1><br><br><p>Lysosomes are cytoplasmic organelles that contain enzymes (ie, acid hydrolases) required for the degradation of various macromolecules (eg, mucopolysaccharides, sphingolipids).&nbsp; In lysosomal storage diseases, enzyme deficiencies result in impaired metabolism of these macromolecules, allowing them to accumulate within the lysosome.&nbsp; Over time, accumulation of these substrates results in cellular dysfunction.&nbsp; Patients are typically asymptomatic at birth but develop symptoms as the substrate accumulates.&nbsp; The clinical presentations of each lysosomal storage disease vary, but common features include dysmorphic features, hepatosplenomegaly, progressive neurodegeneration, neuropathy, abnormal tone, and ataxia.</p><br><br><p>Lysosomal storage diseases are categorized by the type of substrate that accumulates.&nbsp; This article will discuss the major categories of lysosomal storage diseases, including mucopolysaccharidoses, sphingolipidoses, and inclusion cell (I-cell) disease.</p>\n<h1>Mucopolysaccharidoses</h1><br><br><p>Mucopolysaccharidoses are characterized by a deficiency in the enzymes required for the metabolism of mucopolysaccharides, which are long, unbranched polysaccharides attached to a protein core.&nbsp; They are primarily found in mucus, joint fluid, and the extracellular matrix of certain types of connective tissues (eg, vitreous humor of the eye).&nbsp; The most common mucopolysaccharidoses include Hurler and Hunter syndromes (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/70819.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p>\n<h2>Hurler syndrome</h2><br><br><p>Hurler syndrome (type I mucopolysaccharidosis) occurs due to impaired metabolism of dermatan and heparan sulfate.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inheritance pattern:&nbsp;

Hepatosplenomegaly and <strong>coronary artery disease</strong> (due to deposition of dermatan and heparan sulfate within the vessels) are common.&nbsp; Death typically occurs in early childhood (age &lt;10) due to cardiac complications (eg, myocardial infarction).</p>\n<h2>Hunter syndrome</h2><br><br><p>Hunter syndrome (type II mucopolysaccharidosis) occurs due to impaired metabolism of dermatan and heparan sulfate.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inheritance pattern:&nbsp;

Clinical features include aggressive behavior but not corneal clouding.&nbsp; Death typically occurs in adolescence or early adulthood.</p>\n<h1>Sphingolipidoses</h1><br><br><p>Sphingolipidoses are characterized by deficiencies in the enzymes required for the metabolism of sphingolipids (eg, glycosphingolipids, phosphosphingolipids) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L10571.png\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), complex lipids that are essential components of cell membranes.&nbsp;

Angiokeratomas and telangiectasias often develop in late adolescence.&nbsp; Multiorgan involvement occurs in adulthood, and patients are at increased risk for <strong>cardiac disease</strong> (eg, left ventricular hypertrophy) and <strong>cerebrovascular disease</strong> (eg, transient ischemic attack, stroke).&nbsp; In addition, globotriaosylceramide accumulation in the glomerulus and distal renal tubule can cause proteinuria and polyuria, respectively, and can progress to renal failure.</p>\n<h2>Tay-Sachs disease</h2><br><br><p>Tay-Sachs disease occurs due to impaired metabolism of GM2 ganglioside.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inheritance pattern:&nbsp;

However, by age 6 months excess GM2 ganglioside leads to <strong>loss of previously achieved developmental milestones</strong> (eg, no longer able to roll over or sit independently).&nbsp; Other clinical findings include macrocephaly, <strong>seizures</strong>, spasticity, and an exaggerated startle reflex.</p><br><br><p>Ganglioside accumulation occurs in the retina but spares the fovea, which lacks ganglion cells.&nbsp; As a result, the retina appears opaque, whereas the unaffected fovea remains bright red due to the underlying choroid, leading to the classic fundoscopic finding of a <strong>cherry-red spot at the macula</strong> (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L11939.png\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Patients have poor vision, and <strong>progressive neurodegeneration</strong> typically leads to death at age 2-5.<p></p>\n<h2>Gaucher disease</h2><br><br><p>Gaucher disease occurs due to impaired metabolism of glucocerebroside (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/31630.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 4\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inheritance pattern:&nbsp;

Foam cells accumulate in the liver, spleen, and CNS, leading to hepatosplenomegaly and progressive neurologic symptoms (eg, hypotonia, absent reflexes, neurodegeneration).<p></p><br><br><p>After a period of normal development in early infancy, patients lose previously achieved developmental milestones (eg, no longer able to roll over or sit independently).&nbsp; In addition, sphingomyelin accumulation in the retinal ganglion cells leads to retinal opacification, which gives the appearance of a <strong>cherry-red macula</strong>.&nbsp; Niemann-Pick disease is progressive, and death usually occurs by age 3.</p>\n<h2>Krabbe disease</h2><br><br><p>Krabbe disease occurs due to impaired metabolism of galactolipids formed during white matter myelination.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Inheritance pattern:&nbsp;

In I-cell disease, acid hydrolase enzymes are transported to the extracellular space, rather than the lysosomes.&nbsp; Normally, acid hydrolase enzymes undergo posttranslational modification in the Golgi apparatus, including phosphorylation of mannose residues by a phosphotransferase enzyme.&nbsp; This mannose-6-phosphate tag marks the enzyme for transport to the lysosome.&nbsp; In I-cell disease, a defect in the phosphotransferase enzyme results in enzyme transfer to the extracellular space, and various substrates accumulate in the lysosomes, forming the characteristic <strong>inclusion bodies</strong>.</p><br><br><p>I-cell disease demonstrates an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, and the clinical presentation includes <strong>failure to thrive</strong>, <strong>recurrent respiratory tract infections</strong>, and <strong>cognitive deficits</strong> in the first year of life, along with characteristic physical features (eg, <strong>coarse facies</strong>, corneal clouding, hepatosplenomegaly).</p>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Diagnosis involves a thorough history (including birth history and family history) and physical examination.&nbsp; Certain conditions are associated with specific histologic features, and further evaluation depends on the suspected disease.&nbsp; Enzyme assays may be necessary to measure enzyme activity in leukocytes or fibroblasts.&nbsp; Genetic testing is often performed to identify the underlying mutation.</p>\n<h1>Management and prognosis</h1><br><br><p>In general, the prognosis for lysosomal storage disease is poor, with death occurring in childhood or adolescents for most patients.&nbsp; Management is generally supportive (eg, physical therapy, vision/hearing support), but enzyme replacement therapy is available for patients with Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Hurler syndrome, and Hunter syndrome.&nbsp; These therapies improve symptoms and slow progression, leading to a more favorable prognosis.&nbsp; Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may prevent disease progression in some conditions.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Lysosomal storage diseases are inherited metabolic disorders that occur due to lysosomal enzyme deficiencies, resulting in the accumulation of various metabolic substrates within the lysosome.&nbsp; Clinical presentation varies, but common features include dysmorphic features, hepatosplenomegaly, progressive neurodegeneration, and ataxia.&nbsp; Prognosis is poor overall, and management involves supportive care.&nbsp; Enzyme replacement therapies are available for certain diseases.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
