Over time, this damage can result in glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and eventual chronic kidney disease (CKD) that may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).&nbsp; In addition, kidney injury exacerbates hypertension, creating a vicious cycle.</p>\n<h1>Epidemiology and risk factors</h1><br><br><p>Hypertensive renal disease is a leading cause of CKD and ESRD worldwide, mirroring the prevalence of primary hypertension (~1/3 of adults in many developed regions).&nbsp; Key risk factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Severity and duration of hypertension:&nbsp; These factors both directly correlate with degree of kidney injury.</li>\n\t<li>Older age:&nbsp; Age-related vascular stiffness exacerbates the deleterious effects of hypertension on renal microcirculation.</li>\n\t<li>Genetic predisposition:&nbsp; Specific polymorphisms may increase the likelihood of hypertension-related kidney damage, even with modest hypertension (eg, <em>APOL1</em> variants in Black patients).</li>\n\t<li>Chronic comorbidities:&nbsp; Conditions such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, or dyslipidemia (ie, metabolic syndrome) often coexist, contributing to an accelerated decline in kidney function.</li>\n\t<li>Birth weight and nephron number:&nbsp; Low birth weight and reduced nephron count at birth can increase susceptibility to hypertensive kidney damage later in life.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pathogenesis</h1><br><br><p>Hypertensive renal disease results from an interplay between hemodynamic stress and pathological remodeling of the renal microvasculature.</p><br><br><p>Chronic systemic hypertension places stress on the small arterioles of the nephron, leading to thickening of vessel walls with hyaline deposits (ie, hyaline arteriolosclerosis).&nbsp; This vessel narrowing and stiffening impairs blood flow, reducing perfusion and triggering adaptive hyperfiltration in unaffected nephrons to compensate for the reduced function.&nbsp; Although hyperfiltration temporarily maintains overall kidney function, sustained overwork eventually damages these nephrons.</p><br><br><p>As the number of functioning nephrons declines, the kidney's ability to regulate blood pressure is compromised by sodium retention, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and increased sympathetic nervous system activity, perpetuating renal and cardiovascular damage.</p><br><br><p>The spectrum of hypertensive renal disease ranges between:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Benign nephrosclerosis, a slowly progressive, often asymptomatic decline in kidney function typically detected incidentally.</li>\n\t<li>Acute hypertensive nephrosclerosis (malignant nephrosclerosis), where a sudden and severe blood pressure elevation (typically &gt;180/120 mm Hg) triggers acute endothelial injury, fibrinoid necrosis, and rapid renal impairment, constituting a medical emergency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Clinical presentation and diagnosis</h1><h2>Benign nephrosclerosis</h2><br><br><p>Benign nephrosclerosis generally develops insidiously in the setting of longstanding hypertension and often presents with minimal or no symptoms.&nbsp; Physical examination may reveal subtle clues of chronic hypertension such as an S<font size=\"2\"><sub>4</sub></font> heart sound and early retinal changes (eg, arteriovenous nicking).&nbsp; Laboratory findings include a gradual rise in serum creatinine and microalbuminuria, which can gradually progress to overt proteinuria (usually &lt;1 g/day); hyperuricemia is often an early finding caused by renal hypoperfusion.</p><br><br><p>Diagnosis is based on a history of chronic hypertension, corresponding clinical findings, and the exclusion of other causes of CKD.&nbsp; Renal ultrasonography may show symmetric kidney atrophy.&nbsp; Biopsy is usually not necessary; if performed, it would show the following (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L76901.jpg\" alt=\"image 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Vascular component:&nbsp; Intimal thickening (due to hypertrophy in response to chronic hypertension) and deposits of hyaline-like substances (eg, inactive complement component) in the intima and medial of damaged small arteries and arterioles, a pattern known as hyaline arteriolosclerosis (due to injury-mediated leakage across the endothelium, with extracellular matrix production).</li>\n\t<li>Glomerular component:&nbsp; Global glomerulosclerosis (due to ischemia) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (due to glomerular enlargement).</li>\n\t<li>Tubulointerstitial component:&nbsp; Varying degrees of tubulointerstitial fibrosis (due to immunologic responses to ischemia).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Acute hypertensive nephrosclerosis (malignant nephrosclerosis)</h2><br><br><p>In contrast to the gradual course of benign nephrosclerosis, acute hypertensive nephrosclerosis (malignant nephrosclerosis) often presents abruptly during a hypertensive emergency (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/43920.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; Symptoms include headache, vision changes, encephalopathy, angina (from coronary ischemia), and shortness of breath (from heart failure).&nbsp; Physical examination may reveal signs of acute end-organ damage (eg, retinal hemorrhage with papilledema, crackles from pulmonary edema).<p></p><br><br><p>Laboratory findings often show a sudden rise in serum creatinine, significant proteinuria, and sometimes microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (eg, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low haptoglobin, schistocytes on peripheral blood smear).&nbsp; In patients with heart failure, serum brain natriuretic peptide elevation and pulmonary edema on chest x-ray are characteristic.&nbsp; Although a biopsy is typically not required, malignant nephrosclerosis is characterized by 2 distinct histopathologic patterns:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Fibrinoid necrosis:&nbsp; Cell death and excessive fibrin deposition within the arteriolar walls is visible as circumferential, amorphous, pink material with smudged, necrotic endothelial cells that lack cytologic detail.</li>\n\t<li>Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis:&nbsp; Over time, activated platelets and injured endothelial cells release growth factors, which induce concentric hyperplasia and layering of smooth muscle cells and collagen, resulting in intimal thickening and an \"onion-skin\" appearance (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L9426.jpg\" alt=\"image 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hypertensive nephrosclerosis versus atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis</h2><br><br><p>Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) can resemble hypertensive nephrosclerosis in its presentation but differs in mechanism.&nbsp; In RAS, an atherosclerotic plaque narrows the lumen of (most commonly) one or both renal arteries, most often at the ostium, reducing perfusion pressure to the affected kidney.&nbsp; The resulting ischemia activates the RAAS, producing systemic vasoconstriction and sodium retention.&nbsp; Therefore, the hypertension is secondary to reduced renal blood flow, not a primary small-vessel process.&nbsp; Because of this pathophysiology, RAS is characterized by the following:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Minimal proteinuria</strong>:&nbsp; Glomeruli remain structurally intact until advanced ischemia, so the urine sediment is typically bland.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Rise in creatinine after ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)</strong>:&nbsp; These agents reduce efferent arteriolar tone; in a kidney already perfusion-limited by RAS, this further lowers intraglomerular pressure and transiently decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Asymmetric kidney size</strong>:&nbsp; When RAS is unilateral, the chronically underperfused kidney becomes atrophic from ischemic parenchymal loss, whereas the contralateral kidney may experience hypertrophy in compensation.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Imaging findings</strong>:&nbsp; Vascular studies (eg, Doppler duplex ultrasonography, CT/magnetic resonance angiography) show focal, eccentric narrowing at the ostium or proximal third of the renal artery (often with calcifications) and a shrunken, atrophic kidney (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L66025.jpg\" alt=\"image 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">image 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>By contrast, hypertensive nephrosclerosis reflects intrinsic small-vessel and glomerular injury from sustained high pressure, producing low-grade proteinuria, symmetric atrophy, and a gradually progressive course.</p><br><br><p>RAS is discussed in detail in a separate article.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The cornerstone of management is strict blood pressure control to halt or slow the progression of renal damage.&nbsp; Target blood pressure goals are individualized, generally aiming for &lt;130/80 mm Hg in patients with established CKD.</p>\n<h2>Lifestyle modifications</h2><br><br><p>Lifestyle recommendations parallel that of the general population with hypertension and include the following (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/37075.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 2\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ):<p></p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Dietary changes:&nbsp; Reduce sodium intake, increase potassium consumption, and adhere to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.</li>\n\t<li>Weight loss:&nbsp; Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight (BMI 18-25 kg/m<font size=\"2\"><sup>2</sup></font>).</li>\n\t<li>Physical activity:&nbsp; Engage in regular aerobic exercise (eg, 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week).</li>\n\t<li>Alcohol intake:&nbsp; Limit intake to ≤2 drinks per day for men and ≤1 drink per day for women.</li>\n\t<li>Smoking:&nbsp; Cessation is strongly advised for all patients.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pharmacotherapy</h2><br><br><p>Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive renal disease focuses on stringent blood pressure control and renoprotection, with particular emphasis on agents that block the RAAS.</p><br><br><p>First-line therapy includes an ACE inhibitor or ARB to reduce intraglomerular pressure via RAAS blockade.&nbsp; These agents lead to a small decrease in glomerular filtration but protect the kidneys in the long term by slowing hyperfiltration and nephrosclerosis.&nbsp; They also provide cardiovascular protection (eg, prevent pathologic cardiac remodeling), which is critical given the high risk of comorbid cardiovascular disease in these patients.</p><br><br><p>Adjunctive medications include thiazide diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone), calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine, diltiazem), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone), and loop diuretics (eg, furosemide).</p>\n<h2>Monitoring and follow-up</h2><br><br><p>Patients require regular assessment of blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes, and urinary protein excretion.&nbsp; Frequent medication adjustments may be necessary to achieve target blood pressure and minimize complications.&nbsp; Patients with advanced CKD (GFR &lt;30 mL/min) benefit from multidisciplinary care, including nephrologist consultation for timely interventions—such as dialysis planning when GFR drops to &lt;15 mL/min.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The progression in hypertensive renal disease varies, largely determined by the severity and duration of high blood pressure, presence of concomitant diseases (eg, diabetes), and genetic factors.&nbsp; With adequate blood pressure control and lifestyle modifications, many patients experience a slow decline in GFR over years.&nbsp; However, individuals with malignant hypertension can rapidly progress to ESRD if urgent measures are not taken.</p><br><br><p>The key prognostic determinant is the degree of vascular and glomerular damage at the time of diagnosis.&nbsp; Aggressive management can stabilize or modestly improve renal outcomes but once extensive scarring ensues, the damage is typically irreversible.</p>\n<h1>Special considerations: Pediatric and young adult patients</h1><br><br><p>Although hypertensive renal disease is classically associated with older adults, young individuals with severe or secondary hypertension (eg, coarctation of the aorta) may develop hypertensive kidney damage.&nbsp; Children require a thorough evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension.&nbsp; Aggressive lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy, where indicated, can mitigate the long-term renal and cardiovascular consequences.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Hypertensive renal disease results from chronic high blood pressure that damages renal arterioles, leading to progressive kidney injury.&nbsp; It is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease, particularly among high-risk populations (eg, <em>APOL1</em> mutations).&nbsp; The disease spectrum ranges from benign nephrosclerosis—characterized by hyaline arteriolosclerosis, compensatory hyperfiltration, and gradual glomerulosclerosis—to malignant nephrosclerosis, which presents as a hypertensive emergency with acute end-organ damage.&nbsp; Diagnosis is based on clinical history, laboratory findings, and imaging, whereas management focuses on strict blood pressure control, predominantly using ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, along with lifestyle modifications.&nbsp; Regular monitoring is essential, and the prognosis is largely determined by the severity of vascular and glomerular damage, the presence of comorbidities, and genetic factors.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
