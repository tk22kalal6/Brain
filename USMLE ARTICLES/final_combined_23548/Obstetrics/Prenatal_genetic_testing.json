Commonly tested conditions include aneuploidies (ie, extra or missing chromosomes) and inherited single gene disorders (eg, cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease).&nbsp; These tests can yield information to help guide reproductive decisions as well as newborn care.&nbsp; All testing is accompanied by adequate counseling regarding the limitations, possible outcomes, and significance of testing.</p>\n<h1>Overview of prenatal genetic testing</h1><br><br><p>Prenatal genetic testing includes both screening and diagnostic procedures.&nbsp; Screening tests assess a fetus's risk for certain genetic conditions but are unable to determine whether or not the fetus is actually affected.&nbsp; Diagnostic testing (ie, prenatal diagnosis) provides a definitive diagnosis by directly analyzing fetal genetic material obtained via chorionic villus sampling (CVS) (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L23927.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) or amniocentesis (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L23793.jpg\" alt=\"figure 2\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 2</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).<p></p><br><br><p>Genetic counseling is an essential component of the prenatal testing process.&nbsp; It helps patients understand:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>The purpose and implications of each test.</li>\n\t<li>Risks and benefits of testing.</li>\n\t<li>Possible outcomes and decisions following results.</li>\n\t<li>The possibility of uninformative results (eg, test failure, identification of gene variants with unknown clinical implications).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Parental carrier screening</h1><h2>Approach to screening</h2><br><br><p>Carrier screening <strong>tests parental DNA</strong> to determine whether one or both parents carry a gene (ie, are heterozygous) for a <strong>recessive inherited disorder</strong>.&nbsp; It is typically offered before conception or early in pregnancy.&nbsp; A common approach is to test the female partner first; the male partner is then tested for any conditions for which the female partner is determined to be a carrier.&nbsp; Because parental DNA does not change, further carrier screening is not needed in subsequent pregnancies.</p><br><br><p>Historically, carrier screening was offered to individuals according to their estimated carrier status risk based on family history and ethnicity.&nbsp; Currently, the following approaches to carrier screening are acceptable:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Risk-based approach:&nbsp; Offer screening for a small panel of conditions to individuals in high-risk ethnic groups (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish or French-Canadian descent) or with a family history of a genetic condition.</li>\n\t<li>Panethnic approach:&nbsp; Offer screening for a small panel of conditions regardless of ethnicity or family history.</li>\n\t<li>Expanded carrier screening:&nbsp; Offer screening for additional, less common genetic conditions (potentially hundreds).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tested conditions</h2><br><br><p>Because of their relatively high carrier frequency in many populations, carrier screening for the following conditions is recommended for all pregnant women or women considering pregnancy:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Spinal muscular atrophy</strong> (SMA):&nbsp; Mutations in the <em>SMN1</em> gene cause degeneration of motor neurons, leading to impaired mobility, respiratory dysfunction, and death from childhood to early adulthood.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cystic fibrosis</strong>:&nbsp; Mutations in the <em>CFTR</em> gene cause progressive pulmonary disease and pancreatic insufficiency.&nbsp; The severity of the phenotype can vary because there are many pathogenic variants of the gene; most panels test only for the most common mutations.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias</strong>:&nbsp; Various gene mutations or deletions in the globin genes can lead to anemia.&nbsp; All patients should be screened with a complete blood count.&nbsp; Hemoglobin electrophoresis is also performed for patients belonging to high-risk ethnic groups (eg, African, Southeast Asian, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern) or who have a low mean corpuscular volume or mean corpuscular hemoglobin.&nbsp; An alternative approach is to perform hemoglobin electrophoresis on all patients.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Additional conditions that are commonly included on screening panels include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Fragile X syndrome</strong>:&nbsp; This X-linked disorder is caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L29098.png\" alt=\"figure 3\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 3</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), leading to increased transcription of the <em>FMR1</em> gene.&nbsp; The length of the expansion results in various manifestations: The \"premutation\" is due to 55-200 trinucleotide repeats and can cause tremor and ataxia or primary ovarian insufficiency, whereas &gt;200 repeats causes fragile X syndrome (eg, characteristic facial features (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L26380.jpg\" alt=\"figure 4\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 4</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ), large ears and testicles, mitral valve prolapse, intellectual disability) in males and variable expression in females.&nbsp; Screening should be performed in individuals who have primary ovarian insufficiency or a family history of intellectual disability.</li>\n</ul><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Inborn errors of metabolism</strong>:&nbsp; Enzyme deficiencies lead to symptoms such as hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and neurologic dysfunction that frequently present in infancy or early childhood.&nbsp; Many of these disorders (eg, Gaucher disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, maple syrup urine disease, Niemann-Pick disease) are more common in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Management of results</h2><br><br><p>If one parent is found to be a carrier and the other is not, further testing is not indicated because the fetus is not at risk for disease.&nbsp; However, if both parents are carriers of the same condition, there is a 25% chance that the fetus will be affected, and patients should be offered genetic counseling (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L21320.jpg\" alt=\"figure 5\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 5</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ).&nbsp; If conception has already occurred, diagnostic testing (CVS or amniocentesis) can determine if the fetus is affected.&nbsp; If carrier screening is performed prior to pregnancy, the use of assisted reproductive technologies can be considered to implant an unaffected embryo.<p></p><br><br><p>Universal newborn screening panels are recommended regardless of parental carrier screening results.&nbsp; These panels are performed within days of birth and typically include cystic fibrosis, hemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiencies, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and certain inborn errors of metabolism.</p>\n<h1>Fetal aneuploidy screening</h1><h2>Tested conditions</h2><br><br><p>The risk for aneuploidy increases with maternal age, however, all patients should be offered screening early in pregnancy regardless of the risk.&nbsp; Most screening tests include the following aneuploidies:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27964.jpg\" alt=\"figure 6\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 6</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).</li>\n\t<li>Trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L27965.png\" alt=\"figure 7\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 7</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).</li>\n\t<li>Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome (\n                                <div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L24588.jpg\" alt=\"figure 8\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 8</div>\n                                </div>\n                                )).</li>\n\t<li>Sex chromosome aneuploidies (eg, Turner syndrome (45,X), Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY).</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Other aneuploidies are possible, but these almost always end in first-trimester spontaneous abortion and are generally not included in screening tests.</p>\n<h2>Cell-free DNA screening</h2><br><br><p>Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), also called noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), detects fragments of fetal DNA (from placental trophoblasts and fetal erythroblasts) present in the maternal circulation.&nbsp; This test can be performed at ≥10 weeks gestation and is the most sensitive and specific screening test for fetal aneuploidies.&nbsp; cfDNA can also be used to determine fetal sex and to screen for select microdeletions (eg, DiGeorge syndrome).&nbsp; However, test performance for microdeletions is poorer than for aneuploidies, and screening is generally not recommended.</p>\n<h2>Serum and ultrasonographic screening</h2><br><br><p>There are various tests that use maternal factors (eg, age, weight, race), maternal serum analytes (compared to the gestational age–specific median levels in unaffected pregnancies), and fetal ultrasonography to estimate fetal risk of the most common aneuploidies.&nbsp; These tests have largely been replaced by cfDNA because of its superior performance but may still be performed if access to cfDNA is limited.&nbsp; The most commonly used tests include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Nuchal translucency (NT)</strong>:&nbsp; Measures the hypoechoic, fluid-filled space at the back of the fetal neck at 10-13 weeks gestation.&nbsp; An enlarged nuchal translucency is associated with increased risk of trisomy 21 and structural malformations (eg, cardiac anomalies).&nbsp; Nuchal translucency can be performed alone but is more often used in combination with serum analytes.</li><br><br>\t<li><strong>First-trimester combined test</strong>:&nbsp; Screens for trisomies 18 and 21 at 10-13 weeks gestation using NT combined with maternal serum β-hCG and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Second-trimester (quadruple) screen</strong>:&nbsp; Analyzes 4 maternal serum analytes (β-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], inhibin A, and unconjugated estriol) at 15-22 weeks gestation to screen for trisomy 18 and trisomy 21.&nbsp; AFP can also be elevated due to certain structural fetal malformations (eg, open neural tube defects, abdominal wall defects) that may occur independently or along with aneuploidy.</li><br><br>\t<li><strong>Sequential screen</strong>:&nbsp; Combines the first-trimester combined test with the quadruple screen.&nbsp; Patients with the highest-risk results from the first-trimester screening are offered diagnostic testing (CVS), whereas other patients undergo second-trimester quadruple screening.&nbsp; Combining the tests improves detection rates compared to performing either test alone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fetal anatomy ultrasonography</h2><br><br><p>A sonographic survey of fetal anatomy is routinely performed in all pregnancies around 20 weeks gestation, regardless of the results of previous screening studies.&nbsp; Fetal anomalies detected on first and second-trimester ultrasonography are associated with an increased risk of fetal aneuploidy and other chromosomal abnormalities.&nbsp; Up to 18% of fetuses with an isolated anomaly and up to 35% of fetuses with multiple anomalies have a chromosomal abnormality.</p><br><br><p>Ultrasonography in aneuploid fetuses often shows soft markers (ie, nonpathologic sonographic findings that are seen more frequently in aneuploid fetuses) such as increased nuchal translucency, absent or hypoplastic nasal bone, single umbilical artery, and an echogenic intracardiac focus.&nbsp; Fetal growth restriction is also a common sonographic finding among aneuploid fetuses.&nbsp; Structural malformations associated with aneuploidy include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Trisomy 13:&nbsp; Neural tube defects, holoprosencephaly (ie, incomplete division of the forebrain into two hemispheres), cyclopia and other facial anomalies, clubbed or rocker bottom feet, renal anomalies, omphalocele, diaphragmatic hernia.</li>\n\t<li>Trisomy 18:&nbsp; Limb abnormalities (eg, clubbed or rocker bottom feet, clenched hands with overlapping fingers), cardiac anomalies (eg, septal defects, valve anomalies), neural tube defects, omphalocele, diaphragmatic hernia, facial abnormalities (eg, clefts, low-set ears, micrognathia), brain abnormalities.</li>\n\t<li>Trisomy 21:&nbsp; Cardiac anomalies (eg, atrial and/or ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot), duodenal atresia, hydrops fetalis.</li>\n\t<li>Turner syndrome:&nbsp; Large septated cystic hygroma (ie, fluid collection along the posterior neck), hydrops fetalis, cardiac anomalies (eg, coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Management of results</h2><br><br><p>Positive results on these screening tests can indicate whether a fetus is at increased risk for aneuploidy but are not diagnostic, and patients should be counseled about the possibility of false positive results.&nbsp; Abnormal findings should prompt a comprehensive ultrasonography if not already performed and consideration of diagnostic testing (eg, amniocentesis).&nbsp; Patients who decline diagnostic testing and elect to continue the pregnancy are managed according to the suspected diagnosis based on the screening test result and sonographic findings.&nbsp; Genetic testing can be performed following delivery to confirm the diagnosis.</p><br><br><p>Patients with negative results should be counseled that there is still a residual risk for tested aneuploidies (ie, false negative result) and chromosomal abnormalities not included in screening test panels.</p>\n<h1>Prenatal diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Prenatal diagnosis examines fetal DNA to establish a definitive diagnosis, typically following a positive screening test result.&nbsp; Depending on the suspected condition, the following tests may be performed:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Karyotype</strong>:&nbsp; Microscopic view of an individual's entire chromosome complement.&nbsp; Karyotyping can detect aneuploidy, translocations, inversions, and large (&gt;3-10 Mb) copy number changes (eg, deletions, duplications).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Chromosomal microarray</strong>:&nbsp; Detection of gains or losses of genetic material compared to the expected amount in a genetically normal individual.&nbsp; Microarray can detect aneuploidy and copy number changes that are large or submicroscopic (eg, microdeletions, microduplications).&nbsp; Microarray cannot detect balanced translocations or inversions because there is no net change in genetic material.</li>\n\t<li><strong>DNA sequencing</strong>:&nbsp; Sequencing of a portion of the genome to detect mutations associated with single gene disorders.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Fetal DNA for prenatal diagnosis can be collected via the following ultrasonography-guided procedures:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Chorionic villus sampling</strong> (CVS):&nbsp;

These conditions typically cause significant disability, and the information obtained from genetic testing can help families prepare for and make decisions regarding affected pregnancies.&nbsp; There are multiple approaches to determining which types of tests to perform, which conditions to test for, and which patients to test; testing decisions must respect patient autonomy, and counseling is essential to help patients make informed decisions.</p>\n</div>\n\n            "
