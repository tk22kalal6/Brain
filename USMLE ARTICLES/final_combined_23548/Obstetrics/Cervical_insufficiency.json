Most commonly, cervical insufficiency is caused by prior injury or trauma to the cervix, which compromises its structural integrity and decreases the cervical tensile strength.&nbsp; Therefore, the major risk factors include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Prior cervical excisional procedure</strong> (eg, cervical conization, loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP]) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prior obstetric trauma</strong> (eg, cervical laceration)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients with prior second-trimester pregnancy loss or extremely preterm birth are also at risk, particularly if the prior delivery was associated with spontaneous, painless cervical dilation.&nbsp; In rare cases, cervical insufficiency can be caused by inherent collagen disorders (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) or congenital uterine abnormalities (eg, septate or bicornuate uterus).</p>\n<h1>Clinical presentation</h1><br><br><p>The classic presentation of cervical insufficiency is cervical dilation in the absence of painful uterine contractions (ie, <strong>painless cervical dilation</strong>).&nbsp; Patients may be completely asymptomatic or have the following mild symptoms:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>Pelvic pressure or backache (due to fetal parts distending the upper vagina)</li>\n\t<li>Change in vaginal discharge (increased discharge due to loss of the mucus plug)</li>\n\t<li>Light vaginal bleeding (due to cervical dilation and effacement)</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Depending on the timing of patient presentation, examination findings may include:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>A soft, closed cervix (early) or dilated cervix ≥1 cm (later)</li>\n\t<li>No uterine contractions on tocodynamometry (Occasionally, irregular contractions may be seen on tocodynamometry, but they are usually imperceptible to the patient.)</li>\n\t<li>Bulging or prolapsing amniotic membranes into the endocervical canal or vagina</li>\n\t<li>Rupture of membranes</li>\n\t<li>Fetal parts in the upper vagina</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Cervical insufficiency can be diagnosed by obstetric history or abnormal findings in the current pregnancy.&nbsp; Patients have a diagnosis of cervical insufficiency if they meet any of the following criteria:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>History-based</strong>:&nbsp; ≥2 prior consecutive, painless second-trimester losses/extremely preterm births</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ultrasonography based</strong>:&nbsp; ≥1 prior painless second-trimester losses/extremely preterm birth PLUS a short cervix (≤2.5 cm) on transvaginal ultrasonography at &lt;24 weeks gestation in the current pregnancy</li>\n\t<li><strong>Examination based</strong>:&nbsp; painless cervical dilation in the current pregnancy at 14-27 weeks gestation</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>An examination-based diagnosis is usually made in patients with mild symptoms (eg, pelvic pressure, vaginal bleeding).&nbsp; These patients require evaluation with both physical examination and transvaginal ultrasonography.&nbsp; However, the cervix can appear to have no dilation or effacement on digital cervical examination early in the course of cervical insufficiency.&nbsp; Therefore, all patients require transvaginal ultrasonography; findings associated with cervical insufficiency include a short cervix, debris or sludge in the amniotic fluid, and cervical funneling.</p>\n<h1>Differential diagnosis</h1><br><br><p>Cervical insufficiency must be differentiated from both miscarriage (or spontaneous abortion) and preterm labor, which have different management strategies for current and future pregnancies.</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li><strong>Miscarriage</strong> (or <strong>spontaneous abortion</strong>):&nbsp; also presents with cervical dilation at &lt;20 weeks gestation, but typically, vaginal bleeding and cramping progress to painful contractions</li>\n\t<li><strong>Preterm labor</strong>:&nbsp; causes cervical dilation but is differentiated from cervical insufficiency by the presence of regular, painful contractions</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Patients should also be evaluated for a urogenital tract infection (eg, group B <em>Streptococcus</em>, chlamydia, gonorrhea); inflammation can cause cervical change and light vaginal bleeding.&nbsp; In addition, particularly for gonorrhea and chlamydia, the infection should be treated prior to management of cervical insufficiency to prevent creating a nidus for further infection.</p>\n<h1>Management</h1><br><br><p>The primary goal of management in patients with cervical insufficiency is to prevent a preterm birth, this is accomplished with <strong>cerclage placement</strong>.&nbsp; A cerclage (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-8\">\n                                    <img src=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/L18691.jpg\" alt=\"figure 1\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-white border-opacity-20 shadow-lg\">\n                                    <div class=\"text-sm text-center text-white text-opacity-60 mt-2 italic\">figure 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is a permanent suture placed around the cervix to add tensile strength and maintain cervical length to prevent spontaneous cervical dilation.&nbsp; The suture is removed at term to allow vaginal delivery.<p></p><br><br><p>The timing of cerclage placement depends on the clinical presentation:</p><br><br><ul class=\"article-body-unordered-list\">\n\t<li>In patients with a history-based diagnosis, prophylactic cerclage is placed at 12-14 weeks gestation to decrease the risk for recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss.&nbsp; Routine cervical length screening is not necessary after cerclage placement.</li>\n\t<li>In patients with an ultrasonography-based diagnosis (ie, prior preterm birth plus short cervix in the current pregnancy), a therapeutic cerclage can be placed at up to 24 weeks gestation.</li>\n\t<li>In patients with an examination-based diagnosis, \"rescue\" or \"emergency\" cerclage may be attempted.&nbsp; Before placement of the cerclage, contraindications such as intraamniotic infection or ruptured membranes should be evaluated for as infection increases maternal morbidity.&nbsp; In patients with prolapsed or bulging membranes, rescue cerclage placement has a high risk for iatrogenic membrane rupture and intraamniotic infection.&nbsp; In addition, placing or maintaining a cerclage in patients at risk for imminent delivery can lead to cervical laceration.</li>\n</ul><br><br><p>Interventions that are no longer recommended because they do not decrease the rates of spontaneous preterm birth include pessary placement (insertion of a vaginal device to support the cervix) and strict activity restriction (ie, bed rest).&nbsp; Pelvic rest (ie, avoidance of sexual activity) may be recommended after cerclage placement.</p>\n<h1>Prognosis</h1><br><br><p>The prognosis depends on patient presentation and use of cerclage or progesterone supplementation.&nbsp; Cerclage placement, particularly history-indicated cerclage placement at 12-14 weeks gestation, increases the likelihood of carrying the pregnancy to ≥34 weeks gestation.&nbsp; However, significant cervical dilation and prolapsing of the amniotic membranes on examination are factors associated with a poor prognosis (ie, likely imminent delivery).</p><br><br><p>In subsequent pregnancies, the risk remains high for recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss or an extremely preterm birth due to cervical insufficiency; either is likely to occur at earlier gestations.</p>\n<h1>Prevention</h1><br><br><p>Primary prevention of cervical insufficiency avoids acquired causes of structural weakness of the cervix (eg, surgical or obstetric trauma to the cervix).&nbsp; In general, vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended for all women because excisional procedures are a major risk factor for cervical insufficiency.</p><br><br><p>Secondary prevention (ie, spontaneous preterm birth prevention) begins with a thorough review of obstetric history at the initial prenatal visit to identify patients with a history of spontaneous preterm birth and those who meet the criteria for a history-based diagnosis of cervical insufficiency.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1><br><br><p>Cervical insufficiency (\n                                </p><div class=\"my-6\">\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.uworld.com/media/85249.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glass-button w-full py-4 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform\">\n                                        <span class=\"mr-2\">📊</span> View Table: table 1\n                                    </a>\n                                </div>\n                                ) is structural weakness of the cervix predisposing to painless cervical dilation, which can lead to second-trimester pregnancy loss or preterm birth characterized by the absence of uterine contractions.&nbsp; A common risk factor is prior cervical trauma (eg, excisional procedure, obstetric trauma).&nbsp; Management is with cerclage placement.<p></p>\n</div>\n\n            "
