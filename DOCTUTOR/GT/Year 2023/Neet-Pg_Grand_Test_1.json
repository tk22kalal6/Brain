Although lowering the intraocular pressure in the patient with an edematous cornea from Fuchs' dystrophy may temporarily help the edema, elevated intraocular pressure is not a consistent feature of the disorder. Specular microscopy early in the disease demonstrates pleomorphism, polymegathism, and a disruption of the endothelial monolayer by Descemet's membrane excrescences. Vesicular endothelial changes are seen more characteristically in posterior polymorphous dystrophy.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Kanski clinical ophthalmology, 9th edition, page no 259</p>",
