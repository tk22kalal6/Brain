The cap structure is added to the 5' end of the newly transcribed mRNA precursor in the nucleus very soon after synthesis and prior to transport of the mRNA molecule to the cytoplasm. The 5' cap of the RNA transcript is required both for efficient translation initiation and protection of the 5' end of mRNA from attack by 5' &rarr; 3' exonucleases. The secondary methylations of mRNA molecules, those on the 2'-hydroxy and the N7 of adenylyl residues, occur after the mRNA molecule has appeared in the cytoplasm.</p><p>Option C: Eukaryotic mRNAs also have a poly(A) tail at the 3' terminus. Poly(A) tails are added to the 3' end of mRNA molecules in a posttranscriptional processing step. Following nuclear transport, cytoplasmic enzymes in mammalian cells can both add and remove adenylyl residues from the poly(A) tails; this process has been associated with an alteration of mRNA stability and translatability.</p><p>Option D: Attachment of the CCA terminal at the 3' end is <strong>done in tRNA, not in mRNA</strong>. The characteristic CpCpAOH terminal at the 3' end of the tRNA is attached by the enzyme nucleotidyl transferase. The 3' OH of the A ribose is the point of attachment for the specific amino acid that is to enter the polymerization reaction of protein synthesis. The methylation of mammalian tRNA precursors probably occurs in the nucleus, whereas the cleavage and attachment of CpCpAOH are cytoplasmic functions, since the terminal nucleotides turn over more rapidly than do the tRNA molecules themselves. Specific aminoacyl tRNA synthetases within the cytoplasm of mammalian cells are required for the attachment of the different amino acids to the CpCpAOH residues.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Harper's illustrated biochemistry, 32<sup>nd</sup> edition, CH 36, PN 390</p>",

Patients with Gilbert's syndrome have mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with serum levels almost always &lt;6 mg/dL. The serum levels may fluctuate, and jaundice is often identified only during periods of stress, concurrent illness, alcohol use, or fasting. Unlike both Crigler-Najjar syndromes, Gilbert's syndrome is <strong>very common.</strong></p><p><strong><u>Crigler-Najjar type I</u></strong>is an exceptionally rare condition found in neonates and characterized by severe jaundice (bilirubin&gt;20 mg/dL) and neurologic impairment due to <strong>kernicterus</strong>, frequently leading to death in infancy or childhood.

Patients live into adulthood with serum bilirubin levels: 6-25 mg/dL. In these patients, mutations in the bilirubin UDPGT gene cause the reduction-<strong>typically &le;10%</strong>-of the<strong> enzyme's activity</strong>. Bilirubin UDPGT activity can be induced by the administration of phenobarbital, which can reduce serum bilirubin levels in these patients.

While maize consumption alone does not directly cause beriberi, diets predominantly consisting of polished grains like rice can lead to thiamine deficiency.</li><li><strong>Megaloblastic anaemia</strong>: Megaloblastic anaemia is primarily caused by deficiencies in vitamin B12 or folate. It is not directly associated with maize consumption. However, if a diet high in maize lacks sources of vitamin B12 and folate, it could contribute to the development of megaloblastic anaemia.</li><li><strong>Pellagra:</strong> Pellagra is caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency. Maize is a staple food in many regions, particularly where it is consumed as a major dietary component. Unfortunately, maize lacks sufficient amounts of niacin, and it also contains compounds like niacinamide that interfere with niacin absorption. Therefore, populations relying heavily on maize as a dietary staple are at risk of developing pellagra due to insufficient niacin intake.</li><li><strong>Night blindness:</strong> Night blindness is primarily associated with vitamin A deficiency. While maize consumption alone does not directly cause night blindness, diets deficient in vitamin A can lead to this condition. Maize itself is not a significant source of vitamin A, so populations relying heavily on maize may be at risk of vitamin A deficiency if their diet lacks other sources of this essential nutrient.</li></ol><p>In summary, pellagra (option c) is the correct answer because it directly relates to niacin deficiency, which can occur in populations with a heavy reliance on maize as a staple food due to its inadequate niacin content and bioavailability.</p><p><strong>Reference: </strong>Park's Preventive and social medicine, 27th EDITION Pg 734</p>",

The methylene blue reduction test is commonly employed to evaluate the quality of raw milk and detect the presence of bacteria that are capable of reducing methylene blue dye. However, it is not specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of pasteurization in killing harmful microorganisms.</p><p><strong>Why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>a. Phosphatase test: </strong>Phosphatase is an enzyme naturally present in raw milk. Pasteurization should effectively destroy phosphatase activity, as it is a heat-sensitive enzyme. Therefore, testing for the presence of phosphatase in milk after pasteurization can indicate whether the milk has been adequately pasteurized. If phosphatase is detected, it suggests that the milk may not have been heated sufficiently to kill harmful microorganisms.</p><p><strong>b. Coliform count: </strong>Coliform bacteria are a group of bacteria commonly used as indicators of sanitation and faecal contamination in food and water. While coliform bacteria are not harmful themselves, their presence in milk can indicate poor sanitation during milk production or processing. Testing for coliform counts after pasteurization helps ensure that the milk has been effectively treated to kill any harmful bacteria present.</p><p><strong>c. Standard plate count: </strong>The standard plate count measures the total number of viable bacteria present in a sample of milk. This count includes both beneficial and harmful bacteria. After pasteurization, the number of viable bacteria should be significantly reduced, indicating that the milk has been adequately heated to kill harmful pathogens. Therefore, testing the standard plate count can help verify the effectiveness of pasteurization.</p><p>In summary, option D (Methylene blue reduction test) is the correct answer because it is not commonly used for testing the adequate pasteurization of milk.

      "solution": "<p>During the post-disaster period, particularly in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intestines) is often the most commonly reported disease. This is due to several factors:</p><ul><li>Contaminated water sources: Disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis can disrupt water and sanitation systems, leading to contamination of drinking water sources with sewage, bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. As a result, individuals may consume contaminated water, leading to gastrointestinal infections such as gastroenteritis.</li><li>Poor sanitation: Disasters often result in the displacement of populations, overcrowding in temporary shelters, and inadequate sanitation facilities. These conditions increase the risk of faecal-oral transmission of pathogens, as individuals may not have access to proper toilets or hygiene facilities, leading to the spread of gastroenteritis-causing microorganisms.</li><li>Food contamination: Disasters can also disrupt food supply chains, leading to food shortages, spoilage of perishable food items, and improper storage of food. Consuming contaminated or spoiled food can result in foodborne illnesses, including gastroenteritis.</li><li>Poor hygiene practices: In the chaotic aftermath of a disaster, individuals may face challenges in maintaining proper hygiene practices such as handwashing with clean water and soap. Lack of access to hygiene facilities and limited availability of clean water can further exacerbate the risk of gastrointestinal infections.</li></ul><p><strong>Explanation for why the other options are not correct:</strong></p><p><strong>A. Acute respiratory infections:</strong>While respiratory infections can occur in the post-disaster period, they are typically not as prevalent as gastroenteritis, especially in situations where water and sanitation systems are disrupted, leading to an increased risk of waterborne and foodborne diseases.</p><p><strong>C. Tetanus: </strong>Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani, which enters the body through wounds contaminated with soil, dust, or faeces containing the bacterium. While injuries and wounds may occur during disasters, tetanus is not as commonly reported as gastroenteritis in the immediate post-disaster period.</p><p><strong>D. Malaria:</strong>Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. While malaria may be a concern in disaster-affected regions where stagnant water accumulates and provides breeding grounds for mosquitoes, it is typically not the most commonly reported disease in the immediate post-disaster period, especially in regions where malaria transmission is not endemic. Gastroenteritis, on the other hand, is more directly linked to disruptions in water and sanitation systems following disasters.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Park's Preventive and social medicine, 27th EDITION, Pg 924</p>",

      ],
      "solution": "<p>This is the correct answer. According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the management of acute diarrhoea with dehydration in children, ORS should be administered to replace fluid losses and correct dehydration.</p><p>The recommended volume of ORS for children with mild to moderate dehydration is 75-100 ml/kg over 4 hours.</p><p>For a 9 kg baby, this translates to 675-900 ml of ORS over 4 hours. However, considering that the child is described as feeding well and thirsty, a volume at the lower end of the range (400-700 ml) may be appropriate.</p><p>The child's ability to feed and thirst indicate mild dehydration, and the skin pinch return time of 4 seconds suggests moderate dehydration. Therefore, administering 400-700 ml of ORS in the first 4 hours would be appropriate to rehydrate the child and correct dehydration.</p><p><strong>Explanation to why other options are not correct: </strong></p><p><strong>(A) 200-400 ml of ORS to be given in the first 4 hours:</strong></p><p>This option suggests administering a relatively lower volume of oral rehydration solution (ORS) in the first 4 hours. However, the child's weight, thirst, and skin pinch return time indicate mild to moderate dehydration, which may require a higher volume of fluid replacement to adequately rehydrate the child.</p><p><strong>(C) 700-900 ml of ORS to be given in the first 4 hours:</strong></p><p>This option suggests administering a relatively higher volume of ORS in the first 4 hours. While aggressive fluid replacement may be necessary for children with severe dehydration, it may lead to overhydration in children with mild to moderate dehydration. Overhydration can potentially exacerbate electrolyte imbalances and increase the risk of fluid overload complications.</p><p><strong>(D) In addition to the usual fluid intake, 100-200 ml should be given after each loose stool:</strong></p><p>This option suggests a strategy of replacing fluids lost through diarrhoea by administering additional fluid after each loose stool. While this approach may help prevent dehydration, it may not provide sufficient fluid replacement to address existing dehydration or prevent its progression.</p><p>In summary, option (B) 400-700 ml of ORS to be given in the first 4 hours is the most appropriate treatment for the 9 kg baby with diarrhea described in the scenario. This volume of ORS provides adequate fluid replacement to address the child's dehydration while minimizing the risk of overhydration.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Park's Preventive and social medicine, 27th EDITION Pg 266</p>",

These are subdivided into C1, in which the local pararectal lymph nodes alone are involved, and C2, in which the nodes accompanying the supplying blood vessels to their origin from the aorta are involved. This does not take into account cases that have metastasised beyond the regional lymph nodes or by way of the venous system. The prognosis is poor (40% 5-year survival).<ul><li>A stage D is often included, which was not described by Dukes. This stage signifies the presence of widespread metastases, usually hepatic. Other staging systems have been developed (e.g. Astler-Coller, TNM) to improve prognostic accuracy, with the tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) classification now recognised internationally as the optimum staging classification.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Bailey &amp; Love's short practice of surgery, chapter 79, Edition 28th, Pg: 1407</p>",
