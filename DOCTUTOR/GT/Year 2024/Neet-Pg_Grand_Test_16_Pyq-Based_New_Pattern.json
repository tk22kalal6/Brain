Once the diagnostic criteria are established, they should not be altered or changed till the study is over.</li><li>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The second criterion is that of eligibility. A criterion customarily employed is the requirement that only newly diagnosed (incident) cases within a specified period of time are eligible than old cases or cases in advanced stages of the disease (prevalent cases).</li></ol><p>Sources of cases: The cases may be drawn from hospitals, or general population.</p><p><strong><u>SELECTION OF CONTROLS</u></strong></p><ul><li><strong>The controls must be free from the disease under study. They must be as similar to the cases as possible, except for the absence of the disease under study. </strong></li><li>As a rule, a <strong>comparison group is identified before a study is done, comprising of persons who have not been exposed to the disease or some other factor whose influence is being studied. </strong></li><li>Sources of controls: The possible sources from which controls may be selected include hospitals, relatives, neighbor's and general population.<ol><li>HOSPITAL CONTROLS: The controls may be selected from the same hospital as the cases, but with different illness other than the study disease. For example, if we are going to study cancer cervix patients, the control group may comprise patients with cancer breast, cancer of the digestive tract, or patients with non-cancerous lesions and other patients.</li><li>RELATIVES: The controls may also be taken up from relatives (spouses and siblings).

We must use great care in the selection of controls to be certain that they accurately reflect the population that is free of the disease of interest.</li></ul><p><strong>MATCHING</strong></p><ul><li>Matching is defined as the process by which we select controls in such a way that they are similar to cases with regard to certain pertinent selected variables (e.g., age) which are known to influence the outcome of disease and which, if not adequately matched for comparability, could distort or confound the results.</li><li>A \"confounding factor\" is defined as one which is associated both with exposure and disease, and is distributed unequally in study and control groups. More specifically a \"confounding factor\" is one that, although associated with \"exposure\" under investigation, is itself, independently of any such association, a \"risk factor\" for the disease.</li><li>This \"confounding\" effect of age can be neutralized by matching so that both the groups have an equal proportion of each age group.</li></ul><p><strong>MEASUREMENT OF EXPOSURE </strong></p><ul><li>Definitions and criteria about exposure (or variables which may be of etiological importance) are just as important as those used to define cases and controls. Information about exposure should be obtained in precisely the same manner both for cases and controls.</li><li>This may be obtained by interviews, by questionnaires or by studying past records of cases such as hospital records, employment records, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></p><ul><li>The final step is analysis, to find out<ul><li>Exposure rates among cases and controls to suspected factor</li><li>Estimation of disease risk associated with exposure (Odds ratio)</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>In this case, controls has to be without disease, i.e without ALL and should not be exposed to the risk factor i.e chemicals.</strong></p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27<sup>th</sup> edition, pg 79</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong><u>AIR TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT</u></strong></p><p>Thermometers are instruments used for measuring temperature. Mercury thermometers are widely used, as mercury boils at a high temperature, has a regular expansion and its level can be easily seen. Alcohol thermometers are also used. Alcohol has the advantage of not solidifying even at the lowest known temperature. The essential conditions for the use of the thermometers are that:</p><ol><li>The air should have free access to the bulbs of the thermometers and</li><li>The thermometer should be protected against radiant heat.</li></ol><p>These conditions are fulfilled by mounting the thermometers on a special approved screen called the \"Stevenson Screen\" which is used in all the meteorological observatories in India.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\"><li><strong>Dry bulb thermometer:</strong> This is an ordinary thermometer which measures the air temperature. For accurate readings, it is mounted on the 'Stevenson Screen', at a height of 1.20 to 1.80m above the ground level. The screen protects against radiant heat, direct sun and rain.</li><li><strong>Wet bulb thermometer:</strong> The wet bulb thermometer is precisely the same as the dry bulb thermometer except that the bulb is kept wet by a muslin cloth fed by water from a bottle through a wick. The evaporation of water from the muslin cloth lowers the temperature of the mercury. The wet bulb thermometer therefore shows a lower temperature reading than the dry bulb thermometer. The drier the air, the lower the wet bulb reading. If the wet and dry bulb thermometers record the same temperature, it means that the air is completely saturated with moisture, which is rare.</li><li><strong>Maximum thermometer:</strong> This is a mercury thermometer so designed that there is a very fine constriction near the neck of the bulb. When the temperature rises, mercury expands; when the temperature falls, mercury cannot get back into the bulb. The end of the mercury thread at the distal end gives the maximum temperature reached. The thermometer is set each time by swinging briskly when the mercury retreats into the bulb.</li><li><strong>Minimum thermometer:</strong> The liquid inside the minimum thermometer is spirit, in which is immersed a dumb-bell shaped index. When the temperature falls, the spirit drags the index towards the bulb end; when the temperature rises, the spirit expands and runs past the index.</li><li><strong>Six's maximum and minimum thermometer:</strong> This is combination of the maximum and minimum thermometers. This instrument is not used in the Indian Meteorological Observatories.</li><li><strong>Globe thermometer:</strong> The globe thermometer is used for the direct measurement of the mean radiant temperature of the surroundings. The instrument consists of a hollow copper bulb 6 inches(15 cm) in diameter and is coated on the outside with mat black paint which absorbs the radiant heat from the surrounding objects. A specially calibrated mercury thermometer is inserted, with its bulb at the centre of the globe. The globe thermometer registers a higher temperature than the ordinary air temperature thermometer because it is affected both by the air temperature and radiant heat. The difference between the globe thermometer temperature and that of the ordinary dry bulb is a measure of the radiant heat. The globe thermometer is also influenced by the velocity of air movement. The standard globe instrument reaches equilibrium with its environment in 15 to 20minutes.</li><li><strong>Wet globe thermometer:</strong> It consists of a dial thermometer with the heat sensing portion enclosed by a blackened copper sphere that is completely covered with wet black cloth. The Wet Globe exchanges heat with the surroundings by conduction, convection, evaporation and radiation similar to the way a perspiring man does, so the equilibrium temperature of the globe provides a comprehensive measure of the cooling capacity of the work environment</li><li><strong>Silvered thermometer:</strong> The bright metallic surface reflects as much of the incident radiant heat as possible. This gives a more accurate reading of the air temperature.</li><li><strong>Kata thermometer:</strong> The Kata thermometer is an alcohol thermometer with a glass bulb 4cm long and 1.8cm in diameter. The readings on the stem are marked from 100 deg.F to 95 deg.F. Two instruments are used, the bulb of one is covered with a wet muslin cloth, the wet kata and the other dry kata. Before taking the readings, the bulbs are immersed in hot water to warm them slightly above 130 deg.F, when the alcohol rises into a small reservoir at the top of the instrument. The bulb of the dry Kata Is wiped dry. Then both the instruments are suspended in air at the point of observation. The time in seconds required for the spirit to fall from 100 deg. to 95 deg.F is noted with a stop watch. This is repeated at least 4 times. The first reading is discarded and the average of the last three is taken. The length of time depends upon the <strong>\"cooling power\"</strong> of the air. Each Kata has a \"factor\" called the Kata Factor marked on the stem. This factor is determined for each instrument by the manufacturers. This factor, divided by the average cooling time gives the rate of cooling in millicalories per sq. centimetre per second. The Kata thermometer was originally devised for <strong>measuring the \"cooling power\" of the air. A dry Kata reading of 6 and above, and a wet Kata reading of 20 and above were regarded as indices of thermal comfort.</strong> The Kata thermometer is now largely <strong>used as an anemometer for recording low air velocities</strong> rather than the cooling power of the air. Kata thermometers are available to cover the following 5 deg.F cooling ranges:<ul><li>The standard Kata-cooling range between 100 &deg; -95 &deg;F.</li><li>The High Temperature Kata-cooling range between 130 &deg; -125 &deg;F. and</li><li>The Extra High Temperature Kata-cooling range between 150 &deg; -145 &deg;F.</li></ul></li></ol><p>The three types of Kata are readily distinguished by the colour of the alcohol. The standard Kata is coloured red; the high temperature instrument dark blue; and the extra high instrument magenta. Kata thermometers have silvered bulbs to reduce the errors due to radiation.</p><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V2LBNEETPG/QuizAug2024/PYQGT04082024/19E.png\"><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V2LBNEETPG/QuizAug2024/PYQGT04082024/19E1.png\"><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27<sup>th</sup> edition, Pg:874</p>",

      "solution": "<p>SUPERFECUNDATION: It means the fertilisation of two ova which have been discharged from the ovary at the same period, by two separate acts of coitus committed at short intervals. The incidence of twin pregnancies is about one-and half percent and of these about 70% are binovular twins resulting from separate fertilisation of two ova formed in the same menstrual cycle.</p><p>Development of twins in utero is parallel but not equal, depending on the relative blood supplies from the separately formed placentae. Both ova do not always develop to maturity.</p><p>One fetus may be aborted early or die and retained until the labour that expels the other. The dead fetus may be flattened by pressure and may not be recognizable and is referred to as fetus compressus or fetus papyraceus. The spermatozoa causing fertilization may be from different men. The rare cases wherein two ova are fertilised by a white and black person or persons with entirely different blood groups are the only certain examples of this condition.</p><p>SUPERFOETATION: This means the fertilization of a second ovum in a woman who is already pregnant. Ovulation may occur during first trimester of pregnancy until decidua vera comes into apposition with decidua reflexa and decidual cavity gets obliterated. Fertilization of newly released ovum may occur following coitus.</p><p>Later, two fetuses are born either at the same time showing different stages of development or two fully developed fetuses are born at different periods varying from one to three months.</p><p>Cases where a second fully developed child was born a considerable time after the first have been explained on the assumption of twin pregnancy, in which the second child did not develop either due to diminished blood supply or some other cause. On the birth of the normally developed child, the second fetus received proper nourishment and is born later as mature child.</p><p>SUPPOSITITIOUS CHILDREN: It means fictitious children. A woman may pretend pregnancy and delivery and later produce a living child as her own or she may substitute a male child for female child born of her or for an abortion. This is done for obtaining money or for the purpose of claiming property.</p><p>Other legal issues involved are blackmailing a man or bringing a charge of breech of promise of marriage against a man. In such cases, the woman should be examined for signs of pregnancy and delivery. The medical evidence is useful only when the age of the supposititious child does not correspond to the date of the pretended delivery. DNA fingerprinting will be conclusive.</p><p>ATAVISM: The child does not resemble its parents but resembles its grandparents. This is due to inheritance of characteristics from remote instead of from immediate ancestors, due to a chance recombination of genes. Any mental or physical characteristic or tendency or disease peculiar to a remote ancestor may be inherited.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> The Essentials of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology, KS Narayan Reddy, 35th edition, Page No. 370</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Nephrotic syndrome is a constellation of features in different diseases having varying pathogenesis; it is characterised by findings of massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, oedema, hyperlipidaemia, lipiduria, and hypercoagulability.</p><ol><li>Heavy proteinuria (protein loss of more than 3 gm per 24 hrs) is the chief characteristic of nephrotic syndrome (nephrotic range proteinuria). In children, protein loss is correspondingly less. A small amount of protein (20 to 150 mg/day) normally passes through the glomerular filtration barrier and is reabsorbed by the tubules. But in case of increased glomerular permeability to plasma proteins, excess of protein is filtered out exceeding the capacity of tubules for reabsorption and, therefore, appears in the urine. Another feature of protein loss is its 'selectivity'. A highly-selective proteinuria consists mostly of loss of low molecular weight proteins, while a poorly selective proteinuria is loss of high molecular weight proteins in the urine. In nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria mostly consists of loss of albumin (molecular weight 66,000) in the urine.</li><li>Hypoalbuminaemia is produced primarily consequent to urinary loss of albumin, and partly due to increased renal catabolism and inadequate hepatic synthesis of albumin. Often, the plasma albumin level is 1 to 3 gm/dl (normal 3.5 to 5.5 gm/dl) and there is a reversed albumin-globulin ratio. The concentration of other proteins in the plasma such as immunoglobulins, clotting factors and antithrombin may fall rendering these patients more vulnerable to infections and thrombotic and thromboembolic complications.</li><li>Oedema in nephrotic syndrome appears due to fall in colloid osmotic pressure consequent upon hypoalbuminemia. Sodium and water retention further contribute to oedema. Nephrotic oedema is usually peripheral but in children facial oedema may be more prominent.</li><li>Hyperlipidaemia is a frequent accompaniment of nephrotic syndrome. The exact mechanism of its genesis is not clear. It is hypothesised that the liver, faced with the stress of massive protein synthesis in response to heavy urinary protein loss, also causes increased synthesis of lipoproteins. There are increased blood levels of total lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL and LDL but decrease in HDL. Low blood level of HDL is partly due to its loss in the urine</li><li>Lipiduria occurs following hyperlipidaemia due to excessive leakiness of the glomerular filtration barrier.</li><li>Hypercoagulability Patients with nephrotic syndrome may develop spontaneous arterial or venous thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to various factors. These include: increased urinary loss of antithrombin III, hyperfibrinogenemia from increased synthesis in the liver, decreased fibrinolysis, increased platelet aggregation and altered levels of protein C and S.</li></ol><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Textbook of Pathology, Harsh Mohan, 7<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 648</p>",

The major function of &alpha;1AT is to inhibit proteases, particularly neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3, which are released from neutrophils at sites of inflammation. &alpha;1AT deficiency leads to the development of pulmonary emphysema because the activity of destructive proteases is not inhibited. It also causes liver disease as a consequence of hepatocellular accumulation of the misfolded &alpha;1AT protein. &alpha;1AT is a small 394amino acid plasma glycoprotein synthesized predominantly by hepatocytes. The gene, located on chromosome 14, is very polymorphic. At least 75 &alpha;1AT variants have been identified, denoted alphabetically by their relative migration on an isoelectric gel. The general notation is \"Pi\" for \"protease inhibitor\" and an alphabetic letter for the position on the gel; two letters denote the genotype of the two alleles. The most common genotype is PiMM, occurring in 90% of individuals (the \"wild-type\").</p><p><strong>Reference:&nbsp;</strong>Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 658</p>",

Such a curve is called a normal distribution or normal curve.</li><li>It is useful to note that in a normal curve:<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\"><li>The area between one standard deviation on either side of the mean ( x &plusmn; 1 &sigma;) will include approximately 68% of the values in the distribution,</li><li>The area between two standard deviations on either side of the mean (x &plusmn; 2&sigma;) will cover most of the values, i.e., approximately 95% of the values and</li><li>The area between (x &plusmn; 3&sigma; ) will include 99. 7% of the values.</li></ol></li><li>These limits on either side of the mean are called \"confidence limits\"</li><li>Supposing we are considering the 95% confidence limits (x &plusmn; 2&sigma;). When we say this, we mean that 95% of the area of the normal curve, and hence 95% of the values in the distribution will be included between the limits x &plusmn; 2&sigma; . Therefore, the probability of a reading falling outside the 95% confidence limits is 1 in 20 (P = 0.05).</li></ul><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V2LBNEETPG/QuizAug2024/PYQGT04082024/52E.jpg\"><p><strong><u>Standard normal curve </u></strong></p><ul><li>The standard normal curve is a smooth, bell-shaped, perfectly symmetrical curve, based on an infinitely large number of observations.</li><li>The total area of the curve is 1; its mean is zero; and its standard deviation is 1. The mean, median and mode all coincide.</li><li>The distance of a value(x) from the mean(x) of the curve in units of standard deviation is called \"relative deviate or standard normal variate\" and is usually denoted by Z.</li><li>The standard normal deviate or Z is given by the formula: Z= x - x / &sigma;</li><li>A random variable (x) is said to have been standardized when it has been adjusted so that its mean is zero and its standard deviation is 1.</li><li>Standardization can be effected by subtracting the mean of x, from x and dividing the resulting difference by &sigma;, the standard deviation of x. Thus x - x / &sigma; is a standardized variable.</li><li>An important concept of &sigma; mathematical statistics is that the new variate \"Z\" like the variate \"x\" also follows a normal distribution. The mean of the transformed distribution is zero (0) and the standard deviation (&sigma;) is 1. Areas under the standard normal curve are frequently needed.

Early detection of SIL is the rationale for the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, in which cells are scraped from the transformation zone and examined microscopically.</li><li>The Pap smear remains the most successful cancer-screening test ever developed. This test is highly sensitive but has lower specificity than the Pap smear, and specific guidelines for its use have not been well established.</li><li>One consideration is that while most women acquire HPV infections in their early 20s, these are usually cleared by the immune system and never progress to SIL, a process that occurs over many years. For this reason, HPV DNA screening is only recommended for women aged 30 or older, as a positive test at this age is more likely to identify an individual with a persistent infection that may lead to cervical neoplasia.</li><li>LSIL is characterized by dysplastic changes in the lower third of the squamous epithelium and koilocytotic change in the superficial layers of the epithelium. In HSIL (CIN II), dysplasia extends to the middle third of the epithelium in the form of variation in cell and nuclear size, heterogeneity of nuclear chromatin, and the presence of mitoses, some atypical, above the basal layer extending into the middle third of the epithelium.</li><li>The superficial layer of cells in CIN II still shows differentiation and occasional koilocytotic changes HSIL (CIN III) is marked by almost complete loss of differentiation, even greater variation in cell and nuclear size, chromatin heterogeneity, disorderly orientation of the cells, and abnormal mitoses, changes that affect virtually all layers of the epithelium. Koilocytotic change usually is absent. These histologic features correlate with the cytologic appearances shown in Fig.</li></ul><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V2LBNEETPG/QuizAug2024/PYQGT04082024/66E.jpg\"><ul><li>Cytologic features of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) in a Papanicolaou smear.

The receptor defect results in insensitivity to androgen.</li><li>Consequently, androgen-induced wolffian duct development cannot proceed normally; the presence or absence of wolffian duct derivatives (epididymis, vas deferens) varies with the type of mutation.</li><li>Whereas remnants can be observed (adjacent to the testes) in those having point mutations in the ligand-binding domain of otherwise normally expressed receptors, which may permit a very limited response to high local androgen concentrations in utero, wolffian structures are completely absent in those having mutations that yield premature stop codons or frameshift mutations that prevent androgen receptor expression.</li><li>The normal testes produce normal amounts of AMH, which effectively suppress m&uuml;llerian duct development. Therefore, the uterus and fallopian tubes typically are absent, although vestiges also have been observed.</li><li>The testes may be found in the abdomen but, more commonly, are located in the inguinal canals or in the labia majora, probably because AMH normally mediates their descent; their histology resembles that of undescended testes, with a normal or increased number of Leydig cells and absent spermatogenesis.</li><li>The external genitalia are clearly female, due to androgen insensitivity, although the labia and clitoris may be slightly underdeveloped. The vagina is either blind and short or altogether absent, reflecting only the developmental contribution of the urogenital sinus.</li><li>Axillary and pubic hair is scant or absent, again due to androgen insensitivity.

      "solution": "<p>Above mentioned clinical features are suggestive of Neurolathyrism which is due to excessive intake of khesari dal, hence dietary history has to be asked.</p><p><strong><u>LATHYRISM </u></strong></p><p>Lathyrism is a paralyzing disease of humans and animals. In the humans it is referred to as neurolathyrism because it affects the nervous system and in animals as osteolathyrism(odoratism) because the pathological changes occur in the bones resulting in skeletal deformities. Neurolathyrism is a crippling disease of the nervous system characterized by gradually developing spastic paralysis of lower limbs, occurring mostly in adults consuming the pulse, Lathyrus sativus in large quantities. The pulse Lathyrus sativus is commonly known as \"Khesari dhal\". It is known by local names such as Teora dhal, Lak dhal, Batra, Gharas, Matra etc. It is eaten mostly by the poor agricultural labourer because it is relatively cheap. Studies have shown that diets containing over 30% of this dhal if taken over a period of 2-6months will result in neurolathyrism. The toxin present in lathyrus seeds has been identified as Beta oxalyl amino alanine(BOAA). It has been isolated in crystalline form and is water soluble; this property has been made use of in removing the toxin from the pulse by soaking it in hot water and rejecting the soak water.</p><p>The disease affects mainly young men between the age of 15 to 45 years and manifests itself in stages:</p><ol><li><strong>Latent stage</strong>: The individual is apparently healthy, but when subjected to physical stress exhibits ungainly gait. Neurological examination shows characteristic physical signs. This stage is considered important from the preventive aspect, since at this stage, if the pulse is withdrawn from the diet, it will result in complete remission of the disease.</li><li><strong>No-stick stage</strong>: the patient walks with short jerky steps without the aid of a stick. A large number of patients are found in this stage.</li><li><strong>One-stick stage</strong>: The patient walks with a crossed gait with a tendency to walk on toes. Muscular stiffness makes it necessary to use a stick to maintain balance.</li><li><strong>Two-stick stage</strong>: The symptoms are more severe. Due to excessive bending of knees and crossed legs, the patient needs two crutches for support. The gait is slow and clumsy and the patient gets tired easily after walking a short distance.</li><li><strong>Crawler stage</strong>: Finally the erect posture becomes impossible as the knee joints cannot support the weight of the body. There is atrophy of the thigh and leg muscles. The patient is reduced to crawling by throwing his weight on his hands.</li></ol><p><strong>INTERVENTIONS</strong></p><p>The possible interventions for the prevention and/or control of lathyrism are:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\"><li><strong>Vitamin C prophylaxis</strong>: Although this condition is believed to be irreversible, in certain instances the damages could be repaired by the daily administration of 500-1000mg of ascorbic acid for a week or so. The damage could also be prevented by generous provision of ascorbic acid in the lathyrogenic diet</li><li><strong>Banning the crop:</strong> This is an extreme step not feasible for immediate implementation. The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act in India has banned lathyrus in all forms whole, split or flour.</li><li><strong>Removal of toxin: </strong><ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-roman;\"><li><strong>Steeping method:</strong> Since the toxins are water soluble, they can be removed by soaking the pulse in hot water. A large quantity of water is boiled and the pulse is soaked in hot water for 2 hours; after which the soaked water is drained off completely. The pulse is washed again with clean water, then drained off and dried in the sun. The pulse is then used for consumption. The drawback with this method is that it entails loss of vitamins and minerals.</li><li><strong>Parboiling</strong>: An improved method of detoxicating the pulse is \"parboiling\" as is done in the case of parboiled rice. This technique is suitable for large scale operation. Simple soaking in lime water overnight followed by boiling is credited to destroy the toxin. This treatment also destroys trypsin inhibitiors. Lime is easily available as it is used with betel leaves.</li><li><strong>Education</strong>: The public must be educated on the dangers of consuming this pulse and the need for removing its toxin before consumption.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Genetic approach</strong>: Certain strains of lathyrus contain very low levels of toxin(0.1%). The selective propagation and cultivation of such strains may be the most effective way to eradicate lathyrism without any drastic change in the food habits of the people. Low toxin varieties can be obtained from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi.</li><li><strong>Socio-economic changes</strong>: In the final analysis, it is only socio-economic changes or overall development that can root out lathyrism.</li></ol><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 27<sup>th</sup> edition, pg no 759</p>",

Substances that induce fever are called pyrogens. The increase in body temperature is caused by prostaglandins that are produced in the vascular and perivascular cells of the hypothalamus. Bacterial products, such as LPS (called exogenous pyrogens), stimulate leukocytes to release cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF (called endogenous pyrogens) that increase the enzymes (cyclooxygenases) that convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. In the hypothalamus, the prostaglandins, especially PGE2, stimulate the production of neurotransmitters that reset the temperature set point at a higher level. NSAIDs, including aspirin, reduce fever by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Robbins, 10<sup>th</sup> ed, Pg- 86</p>",

Prostate cancers exhibit heterogeneity within tissue and so two histological areas of the prostate are each scored between 3 and 5. Grades 1 and 2 are now not reported as their outcome is similar to grade 3. Grade 3 cancers almost never metastasise. The scores are added to give an overall Gleason score of between 6 and 10; this(and the volume of the cancer) appears to correlate well with the likelihood of spread and the prognosis. The International Society of Urological Pathology(ISUP) and WHO have recommended a simplified grading system composed of five prognostic grade groups.

      "solution": "<p>The described symptoms of intense cravings for food followed by recurrent vomiting are characteristic of bulimia nervosa. Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder that primarily affects young females and is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating. During these episodes, individuals consume large amounts of food in a short period, often feeling a loss of control during the process. To compensate for the excessive food intake and prevent weight gain, individuals with bulimia nervosa engage in behaviors like self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, fasting or excessive exercise.</p><p>Other options:</p><p>A. Anorexia nervosa: Anorexia nervosa is another eating disorder, but it involves a different pattern of behavior. Individuals with anorexia nervosa have a fear of gaining weight and they restrict their food intake significantly, leading to severe weight loss and potentially dangerously low body weight.</p><p>C. Atypical depression: Atypical depression is a subtype of major depressive disorder(MDD), characterized by mood reactivity(ability to experience improved mood in response to positive events), increased appetite or weight gain, excessive sleep and feeling of heaviness in the limbs. While appetite changes are present, the described pattern of intense cravings followed by recurrent vomiting is not typical for atypical depression.</p><p>D. Binge eating disorder: While the term \"binge eating\" is present in this option, it is important to distinguish binge eating disorder from bulimia nervosa. In binge eating disorder, individuals have recurrent episodes of binge eating similar to bulimia nervosa, but without compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. The absence of compensatory behaviors is a key distinction between the two disorders.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> A Short Textbook of Psychiatry, Seventh Edition, by Niraj Ahuja, Page: 144</p>",

Thus, there is a continuous cycle of lipolysis and reesterification within the tissue.</li><li>However, when the rate of reesterification is not sufficient to match the rate of lipolysis, FFAs accumulate and diffuse into the plasma, where they bind to albumin and raise the concentration of plasma-free fatty acids.</li><li>The principal action of insulin in adipose tissue is to inhibit the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase, reducing the release not only of FFA but also of glycerol.

The mass is firm, movable, approximately 2 cm in length, olive shaped, hard, best palpated from the left side, and located above and to the right of the umbilicus in the mid-epigastrium beneath the liver's edge. The olive is easiest palpated after an episode of vomiting.
