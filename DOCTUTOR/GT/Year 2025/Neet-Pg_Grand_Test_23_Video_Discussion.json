      "solution": "<p><strong>a) External cephalic version and trial of vaginal delivery</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> External cephalic version (ECV) is a procedure performed at or after 37 weeks of gestation to turn the fetus from a breech position to a cephalic (head-down) position. <strong>The goal of ECV is to enable a vaginal delivery, reducing the need for a Caesarean section</strong>. If the ECV is successful and there are no contraindications, a trial of vaginal delivery can be offered. This option is ideal as it aims to promote a vaginal birth, which has fewer risks of complications associated with surgery. However, the success rate of ECV is variable, and it requires careful monitoring.</li></ul><p><strong>b) External cephalic version followed by Caesarean section</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This option is less commonly recommended because if the ECV is successful, the primary goal is to proceed with a vaginal delivery. Planning a Caesarean section after a successful ECV is contradictory, as the intent of ECV is to avoid a surgical delivery. Caesarean section would be reserved if the ECV fails or if other complications arise that necessitate surgery.</li></ul><p><strong>c) Spontaneous vaginal delivery</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> While some breech presentations can be delivered vaginally, it requires careful selection of cases and an experienced team. Most guidelines recommend against spontaneous vaginal breech delivery in uncomplicated cases at term because of the increased risks for both mother and fetus, such as cord prolapse, head entrapment, and traumatic injury.</li></ul><p><strong>d) Caesarean section straightaway</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This option is generally preferred in term breech pregnancies to avoid the complications associated with breech vaginal deliveries. While Caesarean section provides a controlled environment to reduce risks, it is not the ideal initial management if ECV is available and there are no contraindications to attempting a vaginal delivery.</li></ul><p><strong>Key takeaway</strong>: The <strong>ideal management</strong> for a 37-week uncomplicated breech pregnancy would be to <strong>attempt an External Cephalic Version (ECV) followed by a trial of vaginal delivery if successful</strong>. This approach provides an opportunity to avoid surgery and promotes natural birth, assuming the ECV is successful and there are no other contraindications for vaginal delivery.</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> Must know</p><p><strong>Topic:</strong> Singleton Breech Delivery</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Williams Obstetrics 26<sup>th</sup> edition, Page no. 1353</p>",
