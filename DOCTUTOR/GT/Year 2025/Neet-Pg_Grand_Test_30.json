      "solution": "<p>The described symptoms of intense cravings for food followed by recurrent vomiting are characteristic of bulimia nervosa. Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder that primarily affects young females and is characterised by recurrent episodes of binge eating. During these episodes, individuals <strong>consume large amounts of food in a short period, </strong>often feeling a loss of control during the process. To compensate for the excessive food intake and prevent weight gain, individuals with bulimia nervosa <strong>engage in behaviours like self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, fasting or excessive exercise.</strong></p><p><strong>Other options:</strong></p><ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\"><li><strong>Binge eating disorder: </strong>While the term \"binge eating\" is present in this option, it is important to distinguish binge eating disorder from bulimia nervosa. In binge eating disorder, individuals have recurrent episodes of binge eating similar to bulimia nervosa, but <strong><em>without compensatory&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>behaviours </em></strong>such as vomiting. The absence of compensatory behaviours is a key distinction between the two disorders.</li><li><strong>Atypical depression: </strong>Atypical depression is a subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD), characterised by mood reactivity (ability to experience improved mood in response to positive events), increased appetite or weight gain, excessive sleep and feeling of heaviness in the limbs. While appetite changes are present, the described pattern of intense cravings followed by recurrent vomiting is not typical for atypical depression.</li><li><strong>Anorexia nervosa: </strong>Anorexia nervosa is another eating disorder, but it involves a different pattern of behaviour. Individuals with anorexia nervosa have a <strong>fear of gaining weight </strong>and they <strong>restrict their food intake significantly, </strong>leading to severe weight loss and potentially dangerously low body weight.</li></ol><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Bulimia nervosa </strong>is marked by <strong>binge eating </strong>followed by <strong>compensatory behaviors </strong>(e.g., vomiting, laxative use).</li><li><strong>Binge eating disorder </strong>lacks the compensatory behaviors seen in bulimia nervosa.</li><li><strong>Atypical depression </strong>and <strong>anorexia nervosa </strong>have different patterns of symptoms and are not characterized by the specific combination of binge eating and purging seen in bulimia nervosa.</li></ul>",

Patients between the ages of 30 and 60 with sialolithiasis typically present with cyclical postprandial swelling (meal time syndrome) of the major salivary glands and dryness possibly due to decreased salivary flow. Duct abnormality, inflammation and increased calcium content of the saliva may contribute to an increased risk of sialolithiasis. Chronic dehydration and pharmacological causes of decreased salivary flow are often implicated. </p><p>The submandibular gland is most commonly affected (85%) owing to the ascending course of its duct, predisposing it to stagnation of the mucinous as well as the more viscous saliva it produces. The alkaline saliva precipitates calcium and phosphate and predisposes to stone formation. On examination, there is an asymmetrical enlargement of the gland and a large proximal stone may be palpated in certain cases. Submandibular gland duct stones are mainly proximal and parotid gland duct stones are mainly distal. </p><p>Sialolithiasis complicated by a secondary bacterial infection may present with an abscess.

The optic nerve transmits input from only one eye, so field loss would not be homonymous (same side in both eyes). Also, it typically produces a full field loss in the affected eye, not a hemianopia.</p><p><strong>Optic radiations</strong>: Lesions in the optic radiations (especially temporal and parietal lobes) can cause <strong>homonymous hemianopia</strong>, but the defects are usually <strong>more congruous</strong> as the fibers are more organized. These lesions <strong>do not produce Wernicke's pupil</strong>.</p><p><strong>Visual cortex</strong>: Lesions here also produce <strong>congruous homonymous hemianopia</strong> due to precise retinotopic mapping.

Postpartum blues, also known as \"<strong>baby blues</strong>\", is a common and <strong>mild condition </strong>that affects many women after giving birth.

Despite the presence of metastases, few patients progress to have clinically meaningful disease and the role of elective nodal surgery is in question.</p><p>Distant metastases are uncommon in PTC.</p><p>Recently, increasing interest has focused on 'papillary microcarcinoma'. <strong>This term is used to describe a PTC that is &lt;10 mm </strong>in size.

Changes occur in both the synovial along with ligamentous (superior and posterior) parts of the sacroiliac joints. The earliest radiographic findings occur in the subchondral cortex which appears blurred or lost. Later, small (rat-bite) erosions appear which are worse along the iliac aspect of the joint. These cause widening of the joint space with hazy margins. This is followed by larger erosions, subjacent sclerosis and joint space narrowing as irregular new bone bridges the joint space with eventual ankylosis and resolution of the sclerosis. The modified New York criteria is used for grading of sacroiliitis and was established in 1994.</p><p><strong>Spine</strong>: Spinal involvement classically starts at the dorsolumbar or lumbosacral junction . Erosions initially occur at the vertebral margins at the site of attachment of the outer fibers of the annulus fibrosus (<strong>Romanus lesions</strong>) with adjacent sclerosis (<strong>shiny corner sign</strong>). Healing of these erosions or laying down of bone beneath the anterior longitudinal ligament causes \"<strong>squaring\" of the vertebral bodies, </strong>best appreciated on lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine. Exuberant new bone formation may even cause anterior convexity of the vertebral body (barrel- shapedvertebrae).</p><p><strong>ossifications may be seen in the interspinous ligaments and facet joints causing the dagger and tram-track signs respectively</strong>.
