Dehydration or drying and shriveling of the cadaver occurs from water's evaporation, but the body's natural appearance and general facial features are preserved. It begins in the exposed parts of the body like the face, hands, and feet. Then it extends to the entire body including the internal organs which may later disappear due to putrefaction and maggot activity. During the process of mummification, the whole body loses weight up to 60 to 70% and all the internal organs become a single mass.</li><li>Factors necessary for the production of mummification are the absence of moisture in the air and the continuous action of dry or warm air. It occurs in bodies buried in shallow graves in dry sandy soils, where evaporation of body fluids is very rapid due to the hot dry winds in summer. Chronic arsenic or antimony poisoning<sup> 1 </sup>favors the process.</li><li>Differential decomposition is a condition in which some parts of the body show mummification and other parts show adipocere formation.</li></ul>",

Continuous watery vaginal discharge after TLH is highly suggestive of a vesicovaginal fistula (VVF), caused by unrecognized injury to the bladder during surgery.

Nevertheless, injuries at the TMT joint are named <strong>\"Lisfranc injuries\"</strong> due to their anatomical location.</p><p><strong>Clinical Overview</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Prevalence</strong>: Acute Lisfranc injuries are <strong>rare</strong>, accounting for only <strong>0.1% to 0.4%</strong> of all fractures and dislocations.</li><li><strong>Diagnostic Challenges</strong>: Despite advancements in diagnostic techniques, Lisfranc injuries are frequently <strong>missed or overlooked</strong>, emphasizing the need for careful assessment.</li></ul><p><strong>Radiographic Sign: The Fleck Sign</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Definition</strong>: The <strong>\"Fleck Sign\"</strong> refers to an <strong>avulsion fracture</strong> of the base of the second metatarsal or medial cuneiform.</li><li><strong>Significance</strong>: It is <strong>pathognomonic</strong> for a Lisfranc injury and indicates a bony fragment from the Lisfranc ligament.</li><li><strong>Appearance</strong>: The Fleck Sign is typically seen on radiographs as a small bony fragment at the base of the second metatarsal, confirming the diagnosis of a Lisfranc injury.</li></ul>",
