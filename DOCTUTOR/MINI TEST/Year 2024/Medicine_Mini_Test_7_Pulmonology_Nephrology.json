      "solution": "<p><strong>Clinical diagnosis: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</strong></p><p><strong>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</strong> is characterized by <strong>irreversible airflow obstruction</strong>. The hallmark of COPD is a persistent reduction in airflow, as seen on pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with a <strong>reduced FEV1/FVC ratio</strong> that does not normalize significantly with bronchodilators. While some patients may show minimal improvement after bronchodilator use, it is typically not enough to be classified as <strong>reversible</strong>, which is a key feature of <strong>asthma</strong>, not COPD.</p><p><strong>Option A: Increased total lung capacity (TLC):</strong> In COPD, <strong>hyperinflation</strong> occurs due to air trapping, leading to an increase in total lung capacity (TLC). This is often due to the destruction of alveolar walls in emphysema, one of the major components of COPD. Hyperinflation is one of the key physiological findings in advanced COPD and is associated with the characteristic <strong>barrel chest</strong> appearance.</p><p><strong>Option B: Decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO):</strong> The <strong>DLCO</strong> measures the ability of gases to diffuse across the alveolar-capillary membrane. In <strong>emphysematous</strong> COPD, destruction of the alveoli and capillary beds reduces the surface area for gas exchange, leading to a <strong>decreased DLCO</strong>. In contrast, <strong>chronic bronchitis</strong> (another form of COPD) may have a normal DLCO unless severe emphysema develops.</p><p><strong>Option C: Reversible airflow obstruction on bronchodilator challenge:</strong> COPD is defined by <strong>irreversible</strong> or only partially reversible airflow obstruction. In <strong>asthma</strong>, there is reversible airflow obstruction, where lung function improves significantly after bronchodilator administration. COPD does not usually show this level of reversibility, even after bronchodilator use, which helps differentiate it from asthma. Reversibility is defined as a <strong>&ge;12% increase in the FEV1</strong> and an absolute <strong>increase of &ge;200 mL</strong> at least <strong>15 min</strong> after administration of a <strong>&beta;2-agonist</strong> or after several weeks of corticosteroid therapy.</p><p><strong>Option D: Flattened diaphragm on chest X-ray:</strong> A <strong>flattened diaphragm</strong> on imaging is a classic radiographic finding in patients with COPD, especially in emphysema. This is due to <strong>hyperinflation</strong> of the lungs, which causes the diaphragm to lose its normal dome shape. This finding correlates with increased total lung capacity and reduced lung elasticity.</p><p><strong>Key Features of COPD:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Airflow limitation</strong> that is not fully reversible.</li><li><strong>Chronic productive cough</strong> with dyspnea.</li><li><strong>Hyperinflation</strong> with increased TLC and <strong>flattened diaphragm</strong> on imaging.</li><li><strong>Decreased DLCO</strong> in emphysema.</li><li><strong>Irreversible airflow obstruction</strong> on PFT (FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 70%).</li><li><strong>Pursed-lip breathing</strong> and <strong>accessory muscle use</strong> in advanced disease.</li></ul><p><strong>Mnemonic to Differentiate COPD from Asthma:</strong></p><p><strong>COPD:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>C</strong>hronic,</li><li><strong>O</strong>bstruction (irreversible),</li><li><strong>P</strong>roductive cough,</li><li><strong>D</strong>ecreased DLCO.</li></ul><p><strong>Asthma:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A</strong>irflow reversible,</li><li><strong>S</strong>hortness of breath episodic,</li><li><strong>T</strong>riggers (allergies),</li><li><strong>H</strong>yperresponsiveness,</li><li><strong>M</strong>arked bronchodilator response,</li><li><strong>A</strong>llergic history.</li></ul><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V3/LBNEETPG/QuizDec2024/MedicineMiiVIII14122024/1E.jpg\"><p><strong>Common abnormalities of pulmonary function</strong></p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V3/LBNEETPG/QuizDec2024/MedicineMiiVIII14122024/1E1.jpg\"><p><strong>Tags:</strong></p><p><strong>Topic:</strong> COPD</p><p><strong>Difficulty Level:</strong> May Know</p><p><strong>PYQ:</strong> FMGE June 2021,2022/INI CET 2020</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Harrision's, 21<sup>st</sup> edition, principles of internal medicine, page number 2138, 2139, 2154, 2182</p>",
