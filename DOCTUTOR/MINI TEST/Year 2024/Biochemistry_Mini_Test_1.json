      "solution": "<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Lipid chemistry</p><p>Option A: Above characteristic clinical features at birth, and the radiological findings suggest a diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).</p><p>The underlying lesion in this disorder is deficiency of pulmonary surfactant, dipalmitoyl lecithin (lecithin also known as phosphatidyl choline) that prevents the collapse of alveoli.</p><p>It is after the 30th week of gestation that the fetus starts producing substantial amounts of dipalmitoyl lecithin and the optimum quantity required to prevent the collapse is reached at term.</p><p>In premature infants, sufficient levels of dipalmitoyl lecithin are not reached and at the time of birth there is a relative deficiency of the surfactant.</p><p>This results in lack of adequate alveolar expansion. Alveolar collapse and ventilation-perfusion abnormalities are the natural con sequences, which in turn cause respiratory distress.</p><p>Maturity of fetal lungs can be predicted in ante natal period by measuring the lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio in the amniotic fluid.</p><p>The ratio begins to show a sharp increase at the 31st or 32nd week of gestation because of enhanced fetal production of dipalmitoyl lecithin. Soon it reaches to about 2.0.</p><p>Thus, a ratio of 2.0 or above in the amniotic fluid specimen is characteristic of the term infants. It indicates pulmonary maturity.</p><p>However, these results are unreliable if amniotic fluid specimen is contaminated by blood or meconium.</p><p>The sphingomyelin exerts no significant detergent activity in the lungs. It is measured only as convenient reference point for lecithin.</p><p>Option B: Phosphatidylinositol is a precursor of second messengers.</p><p>Phosphoinositides may have 1, 2, or 3 phosphate groups attached to the inositol ring.</p><p>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PiP2 ), for example, is cleaved into diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate upon stimulation by a suitable hormone agonist, and both of these act as internal signals or second messengers.</p><p>Phosphorylated phosphatidyl inositols (phosphoinositides) are minor components of cell membranes, but play an important part in cell signaling and membrane trafficking.</p><p>Option C: Cardiolipin is found in mitochondria and is essential for the mitochondrial function.</p><p>Decreased cardiolipin levels or alterations in its structure or metabolism cause mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and in pathologic conditions including heart failure, hypothyroidism, and Barth syndrome (cardioskeletal myopathy)</p><p>Option D: Sphingomyelins are found in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane lipid bilayer and are particularly abundant in specialized areas of the plasma membrane known as lipid rafts.</p><p>They are also found in large quantities in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. They are believed to play a role in cell signalling and in apoptosis.</p><p>Sphingomyelins contain no glycerol, and on hydrolysis they yield a fatty acid, phosphoric acid, choline, and sphingosine.</p><p>The combination of sphingosine plus fatty acid is known as ceramide, a structure also found in the glycosphingolipids.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Harper's illustrated biochemistry 31<sup>st</sup> edition Chapter 21, page number. 200</p>",
