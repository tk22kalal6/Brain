      "solution": "<p>Negative feedback mechanism maintains the level of substances in a normal range.</p><p>Positive feedback mechanism produces change in one direction.</p><p>Option a: During pregnancy in the last trimester, oxytocin causes uterine contraction. It increases further stretch on the uterus which further increases the oxytocin secretion. This cycle goes on till baby delivery. It is a positive feedback mechanism.</p><p>Option b: When shock becomes severe and various types of positive feedback mechanisms develop, they cause a vicious cycle of progressively decreasing cardiac output and functioning. (Na+, K+, Mitochondria, Lysosome change in activity)</p><p>Option c: Baroreceptors mechanism regulates the blood pressure. When blood pressure increases, the increase in baroreceptor discharge reduces the blood pressure and vice versa. Change occurs in both directions. It is an example of a negative feedback mechanism.</p><p>Option d: Generation of action potential due to increase in activation of sodium channels is an example of positive feedback mechanism.</p><p><strong>Tag: Feedback regulation</strong></p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 26<sup>th</sup> Edition, Page Number 93, 224, 1336.</p>",
