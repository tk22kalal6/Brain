      "solution": "<p><strong>OPTION C) Creating a toxic environment for sperm:</strong></p><p>This is the <strong>primary mechanism of action for the Copper T 380A IUD</strong>. The <strong>copper ions released by the IUD create an inflammatory reaction within the uterine cavity that is toxic to sperm</strong>. This reaction impairs sperm motility and viability, reducing their ability to fertilize an egg. Additionally, the copper ions <strong>disrupt the sperm's ability to undergo capacitation and the acrosome reaction</strong>, which are critical for fertilization. As a result, the Copper T 380A IUD effectively prevents pregnancy through this non-hormonal mechanism</p><p><strong>OPTION A) Suppression of ovulation:</strong></p><p>This mechanism is associated with hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, patches, and hormonal IUDs. These methods work primarily by suppressing the release of eggs from the ovaries (ovulation). However, <strong>Copper T 380A IUD is non-hormonal and does not affect the ovulation process.</strong> Therefore, this option is incorrect for the Copper T 380A IUD.</p><p><strong>OPTION B) Thickening of cervical mucus:</strong></p><p>Thickening of cervical mucus is another mechanism utilized by hormonal contraceptives, particularly those containing progestin. Thicker mucus creates a barrier that makes it difficult for sperm to travel through the cervix and reach the egg. However, the Copper T 380A IUD does not contain hormones, so it does not work by altering cervical mucus.</p><p><strong>OPTION D) Inhibition of implantation through hormonal release:</strong></p><p>Hormonal IUDs, such as those containing levonorgestrel, may partially prevent pregnancy by inhibiting implantation through the hormonal effects on the endometrium. However, the Copper T 380A IUD does not release hormones and thus does not inhibit implantation through hormonal means. It primarily works by affecting sperm function rather than by altering the uterine lining in a hormonal way. This option is incorrect for the Copper T 380A IUD.</p><p><strong><em>Key takeaway: The Copper T 380A IUD primarily prevents pregnancy by releasing copper ions that create an inflammatory and toxic environment for sperm within the uterine cavity, impairing their motility and function, thus preventing fertilization.</em></strong></p><p>Reference: Shaw's Gynaecology 17<sup>th</sup> edition, Page number:261</p>",
