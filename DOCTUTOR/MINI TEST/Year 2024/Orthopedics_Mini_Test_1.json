Moreover, had it been an open fracture then he would have primarily consulted an orthopaedic surgeon in view of the severity of injury due to the bleeding from open fracture.</p><p>Most common cause of non-union is inadequate immobilisation.</p><p>Factors affecting fracture union are:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\"><li>Age of the patient - More the age, poorer the bone quality, more chances of delayed/non union</li><li>Type of bone - Flat and cancellous bones unite faster than tubular and cortical bones.</li><li>Pattern of fracture - Spiral fractures unite faster than oblique fractures, which in turn unite faster than transverse fractures.</li><li>Disturbed pathoanatomy - Changes may occur at the fracture site, and may hinder the normal healing process. These are: (i) soft tissue interposition; and (ii) ischaemic fracture ends.</li><li>Type of reduction - Good apposition of the fracture results in faster union.</li><li>Inadequate immobilisation - Most common cause of non-union</li><li>Open fractures - Fracture hematoma drains and hence high chances of delayed/non-union</li><li>Compression at fracture site - Compression enhances the rate of union in cancellous bone. In cortical bones, compression at the fracture site enhances rigidity of fixation, and possibly results in primary bone healing.</li></ol><p><strong>Topic:</strong> Principles of fracture healing</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> J.
