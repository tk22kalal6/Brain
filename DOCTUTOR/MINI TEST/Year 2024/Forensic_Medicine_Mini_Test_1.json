      "solution": "<ul><li>Epidermal Burns: The affected part is erythematous (red). There is capillary dilatation and transudation of fluid into the tissues causing swelling. A split may occur in the epidermis or at the epidermal-dermal junction to form a blister (vesicle or bulla), which is covered by white, avascular epidermis, bordered by red, hyperaemic skin usually 5 to 20 mm. across. The base is bright red when burst.Singeing of the hair is present. The blister contains gas and fluid containing protein. When epidermis is lost, the dermis becomes reddened, inflamed and exudes plasma and tissue fluid. These burns are very painful. Repair is complete without scar formation.</li><li>Heat hematoma occurs when the head has been exposed to intense heat, sufficient to cause charring of the skull. It has the appearance of extradural haemorrhage, but is not accompanied by any signs of injury by blunt force. It consists of a soft, friable clot of light chocolate colour, and may be pink, if the blood contains CO. The clot has a honeycomb appearance due to bubbles of steam produced by heat.</li><li>Absence of CO: CO may be absent in blood due to various reasons, such as rapid death, convection air currents, low production of CO, flash fire (as in the conflagration of a chemical plant), inhalation of superheated air resulting in death by suffocation, in warfare, or in an explosion when death is instantaneous.</li><li>Heat fractures usually do not involve the sutures of the skull even in young persons with un-united sutures. Heat fracture may cross a suture line.
