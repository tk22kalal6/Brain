It is characterized by <strong>the absence or malfunction of an enzyme called aspartoacylase</strong>, leading to the <strong>accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA)</strong> in the brain. This accumulation results in <strong>progressive damage to the white matter of the brain</strong>. Radiological findings in Canavan disease are often evident on imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here are the typical radiological findings associated with Canavan disease:</li></ul><p><strong><u>White Matter Abnormalities:</u></strong> MRI of the brain typically reveals abnormal signal intensity in the white matter, especially in the cerebral hemispheres. This abnormal signal is often hyperintense on T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images.</p><p><strong>Lack of Myelin</strong>: Canavan disease is characterized by a lack of myelin, the protective covering of nerve fibers. <strong>This lack of myelin is often seen as increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images</strong> in areas where myelin should normally be present.</p><p><strong>Globular Appearance:</strong> The white matter abnormalities can give a <strong>globular or spongy appearance</strong> on imaging, which is characteristic of Canavan disease.</p><p><strong>Frontal Lobe Predominance</strong>: The abnormalities are often more pronounced in the frontal lobes of the brain. The involvement of the <strong>subcortical white matter</strong> is a distinguishing feature.</p><p><strong>Enlarged Ventricles:</strong> As the white matter degenerates, there may be an increase in the size of the lateral ventricles, a phenomenon known as ventriculomegaly.</p><p>It's important to note that these radiological findings are not specific to Canavan disease, and other conditions affecting the white matter of the brain may have similar imaging features.
