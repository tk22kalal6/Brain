      "solution": "<p>Adenylyl kinase is important for the <strong>maintenance of energy homeostasis in cells</strong> because it allows:</p><p>1. The <strong>group transfer potential in ADP</strong> to be used in the synthesis of ATP.</p><p>2. The AMP formed as a consequence of activating reactions involving ATP to be <strong>rephosphorylated to ADP.</strong></p><p>3. AMP to increase in concentration when ATP becomes depleted so that it is able to act as a <strong>metabolic (allosteric) signal to increase the rate of catabolic reactions,</strong> which in turn lead to the generation of more ATP</p><p>Adenylyl cyclase plays a crucial role in cell signaling and energy homeostasis but does not directly contribute to the synthesis of ATP.</p><p><strong>Option A (Synthesis of ATP from ADP):</strong> Adenylyl cyclase <strong>does not participate in generating ATP from ADP.</strong> The synthesis of ATP from ADP is primarily carried out by <strong>mitochondrial enzymes</strong> during cellular respiration, particularly through oxidative phosphorylation. <strong>Adenylyl cyclase primary role is unrelated to ATP generation directly.</strong></p><p><strong>Option B (Re phosphorylation of ATP):</strong> This is also indirectly relevant to Adenylyl cyclase, as energy levels (reflected by ATP and cAMP) help regulate metabolic processes. However, <strong>Adenylyl cyclase itself doesn&rsquo;t add phosphate groups back to ADP to form ATP but is part of signaling that influences these processes indirectly.</strong></p><p><strong>Option C (To convert ATP to cAMP):</strong> This is the <strong>main function of Adenylyl cyclase.</strong> It catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP), a key <strong>second messenger</strong> that regulates various cellular processes related to energy balance, such as glycogen breakdown and lipolysis.</p><p><strong>Option D (Breakdown of cAMP):</strong> Though not directly involved in breaking down cAMP, <strong>Adenylyl cyclase indirectly affects cAMP levels.</strong> Phosphodiesterases are the enzymes that degrade cAMP, <strong>but the activity of adenylyl cyclase influences the concentration of cAMP within the cell.</strong></p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry 32nd Edition, Chapter 11, page number: 113 </p>",
