Subacute thyroiditis presents with a painful thyroid gland, initial hyperthyroidism, and elevated ESR. It is self-limiting and may progress to hypothyroidism before resolving spontaneously.</p><p>Option C (Riedel's thyroiditis): Incorrect. Riedel's thyroiditis presents with a painless, hard thyroid gland and is not associated with hyperthyroidism or elevated ESR.</p><p>Option D (Grave's disease): Incorrect. Grave's disease is painless and associated with hyperthyroidism due to autoimmune stimulation of TSH receptors but does not involve a painful thyroid gland or elevated ESR.</p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V3/LBNEETPG/QuizJan2025/SurgMiniIII05012025/1E.jpg\"><p>Tags:</p><p>Topic: Inflammatory Thyroiditis</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Bailey &amp; Love's Short Practice of Surgery, Chapter-55, page no. 872.</p>",
