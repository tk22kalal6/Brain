      "solution": "<p>Explanation of Options:</p><p>Option A (Primary CBD stone; more common in developing countries): Incorrect. Primary CBD stones are formed inside the common bile duct, and while they may be more common in developing countries due to worm infestations, they are typically brown stones. This answer does not fit with the formation in the gallbladder.</p><p>Option B (Primary CBD stone; most common type is cholesterol stone): Incorrect. Primary CBD stones are usually brown stones, not cholesterol stones. Cholesterol stones are more commonly associated with gallbladder formation.</p><p>Option C (Secondary CBD stone; most common type is brown stone): Incorrect. Secondary CBD stones are formed in the gallbladder and pass into the common bile duct. Cholesterol stones are the most common in secondary CBD stones.</p><p>Option D (Secondary CBD stone; formed in the gall bladder and more common in developed countries): Correct. Secondary CBD stones are formed in the gallbladder, often cholesterol stones, and are more common in developed countries. These stones pass into the common bile duct, leading to complications like jaundice and biliary colic.</p><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d10ehao5y6v0v4.cloudfront.net/V3/LBNEETPG/QuizJan2025/SurgMiniIV06012025/1E.jpg\"><p><strong>Tags:</strong></p><p><strong>Topic:</strong> Biliary Tract Diseases, Gallbladder Stones</p><p><strong>References:</strong> Bailey &amp; Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 28th Edition, Chapter 71, page no. 1243</p>",
