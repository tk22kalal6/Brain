In prokaryotes (like <em>E. coli</em>), SSB proteins stabilize the single-stranded DNA during replication.</p><p><strong>Option A) Replication Protein A (RPA)</strong> <strong>Function</strong>: RPA is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that stabilizes the unwound DNA strand after helicase separates the two strands. Its primary role is to prevent the single-stranded DNA from reannealing or forming secondary structures, which could hinder replication.</p><p><strong>Process</strong>: When the DNA is unwound by helicase, RPA binds to the exposed single strands, keeping them in an extended and stable form so that DNA polymerase can efficiently copy the template strand.</p><p>RPA is involved not only in replication but also in other DNA metabolic processes such as repair and recombination.</p><p><strong>Mechanism</strong>: RPA forms a trimeric complex that binds cooperatively to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). It recruits other replication factors to ensure proper processing of the ssDNA.</p><p><strong>Option B) Replication Factor C (RFC)</strong>: RFC is a <strong>clamp loader</strong> protein complex that plays a key role in loading PCNA (the sliding clamp) onto DNA. It is an ATP-dependent process.</p><p><strong>Structure</strong>: RFC is composed of five subunits (RFC1-RFC5). It is highly conserved across eukaryotes and is essential for the assembly of the replication machinery.</p><p><strong>Process</strong>: RFC recognizes the primer-template junction (where a short RNA primer is laid down on the DNA template by primase). Once RFC binds, it opens the ring structure of PCNA and positions it around the DNA. After the clamp is loaded, RFC disengages, allowing the polymerase to bind and start synthesizing DNA.</p><p><strong>Role in DNA Repair</strong>: RFC also participates in other processes like DNA repair, where it loads PCNA during repair synthesis.</p><p><strong>Option C) Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA)</strong>: PCNA acts as a <strong>sliding clamp</strong>, tethering DNA polymerase to the DNA strand, ensuring high processivity (continuous replication without the polymerase dissociating).</p><p><strong>Structure</strong>: PCNA is a homotrimer, forming a ring-like structure that encircles the DNA. This allows it to slide along the DNA, guiding DNA polymerase during replication.</p><p><strong>Process</strong>: PCNA is loaded onto the DNA by RFC at the primer-template junction. It then recruits and stabilizes DNA polymerase &delta; and &epsilon;, which are responsible for synthesizing the lagging and leading strands, respectively.</p><p><strong>Post-Translational Modifications</strong>: PCNA can be modified (e.g., ubiquitinated or sumoylated), which regulates its role in processes like DNA repair and replication fork restart.</p><p><strong>Reference: Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry 32<sup>nd</sup> Edition Chapter 35, Page number:377</strong></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Energy Requirement is estimated by measurement of energy expenditure.</p><p><strong>Physical Activity Level (PAL):</strong> The overall physical activity level (PAL) is the sum of the PAR of different activities, multiplied by the time taken for that activity, divided by 24 hours</p><p><strong>Respiratory Quotient:</strong> Measurement of the ratio of the volume of carbon dioxide produced: volume of oxygen consumed (respiratory quotient [RQ]) is an indication of the mixture of metabolic fuels being oxidized</p><p><strong>Basal metabolic rate (BMR)</strong> is the energy expenditure by the body when at rest, but not asleep, under controlled conditions of thermal neutrality, measured about 12 hours after the last meal.</p><p><strong>BMR depends on weight, age, and gender.</strong> Total energy expenditure depends on the BMR, the energy required for physical activity, and the energy cost of synthesizing reserves in the fed state.</p><p><strong>The most useful way of expressing the energy cost of physical activities is as a multiple of BMR.</strong> This is known as the physical activity ratio (PAR) or metabolic equivalent of the task (MET). <strong>Sedentary activities use only about 1.1 to 1.2 &times; BMR.</strong></p><p><strong>Vigorous exertion</strong>, such as climbing stairs, cross-country walking uphill, etc, may use <strong>6 to 8 &times; BMR.</strong></p><p><strong>Specific Dynamic Action:</strong> There is a considerable increase in metabolic rate after a meal <strong>(diet-induced thermogenesis).</strong> A small part of this is the energy cost of secreting digestive enzymes and of active transport of the products of digestion.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry 32nd Edition, Chapter 43, Page number:532</p>",
