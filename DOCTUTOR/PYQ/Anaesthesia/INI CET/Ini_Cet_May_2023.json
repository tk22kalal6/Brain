      "solution": "<p>In this scenario, the patient is being mechanically ventilated for <strong>acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</strong>, and the ABG values show that <strong>PaO2</strong> is <strong>110 mmHg</strong> with a <strong>FiO2 of 1 (100%)</strong>. This suggests that the patient has adequate oxygenation despite being on a high level of oxygen.</p>\r\n<p>Given this, the necessary change would be to <strong>decrease FiO2</strong> to prevent <strong>oxygen toxicity</strong>, as FiO2 levels higher than 60% can lead to lung damage over time (especially in ARDS patients).</p>\r\n<P><strong>Other options explanation:</strong></P>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>B) Increase PEEP</strong>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>PEEP (Positive End-Expiratory Pressure) </strong>is often increased to improve oxygenation in ARDS, but in this case, <strong>PaO2 (110 mmHg)</strong> is already within an acceptable range, and further increasing PEEP might not be necessary. It's more important to decrease FiO2 to avoid oxygen toxicity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>C) Increase RR</strong>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <strong>respiratory rate (RR) </strong>of 17 breaths per minute is within the normal range (12-20 breaths per minute), and the <strong>PaCO2 (38 mmHg)</strong> is also normal, indicating that ventilation is adequate. Increasing the RR is unnecessary in this case.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>D) Increase Tidal Volume</strong>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In ARDS, the goal is to use a <strong>low tidal volume strategy</strong>(typically 6-8 mL/kg of ideal body weight) to avoid <strong>barotrauma</strong> and <strong>volutrauma</strong>. Increasing tidal volume could worsen these complications.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<P><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></P>\r\n<p>In ARDS patients with <strong>adequate oxygenation</strong> (PaO2 &gt; 60 mmHg on FiO2 &le; 60%), the goal is to <strong>reduce FiO2</strong> to minimize the risk of oxygen toxicity, while maintaining safe levels of ventilation and oxygenation.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The <strong>Allen's test</strong> is used to evaluate the patency of the <strong>radial and ulnar arteries</strong> before performing procedures like <strong>arterial blood gas sampling</strong> or inserting a <strong>central venous catheter</strong>. The test is performed by compressing both the <strong>radial and ulnar arteries</strong> at the wrist, then asking the patient to clench their fist. After releasing the pressure on one artery, the color of the palm is observed. If the hand rapidly returns to a normal pink color, the artery is patent; if not, it suggests compromised blood flow in that artery.</p>\r\n<P><strong>Other options explanation:</strong></P>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>B) Roos Test</strong>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This test is used to diagnose <strong>Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS)</strong>. The patient opens and closes their hands rapidly for 3 minutes while the arms are held overhead, and symptoms like numbness, tingling, or pain are monitored.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>C) Elevated Arm Test</strong>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This is another test used for diagnosing <strong>Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS)</strong>.

It helps evaluate <strong>subclavian artery compression</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<P><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></P>\r\n<p>Allen's test is primarily used to assess the patency of the <strong>radial and ulnar arteries</strong> before procedures like <strong>arterial blood gas sampling</strong>. It helps ensure that blood flow to the hand will remain adequate if one of the arteries is compromised.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The <strong>correct CPR guidelines</strong> based on the <strong>American Heart Association (AHA)</strong> are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Rate of chest compressions</strong>: It should be between <strong>100 to 120 compressions per minute</strong>. This ensures that blood circulation is maintained effectively.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Depth of chest compressions</strong>: The depth should be at least <strong>5 cm (2 inches) </strong>but no more than <strong>6 cm</strong> for adults. This depth ensures that the heart is compressed enough to maintain circulation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Allow adequate chest recoil</strong>: After each compression, the chest must <strong>fully recoil </strong>to allow the heart to refill with blood.
