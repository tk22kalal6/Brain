The brain and red blood cells continue to rely on glucose at a constant rate.</li>\r\n<li>Any surplus glucose is stored, with <strong>plasma insulin rising</strong> to promote glycogen and fat storage, and to inhibit lipolysis.</li>\r\n<li>Dietary fats appear in circulation as chylomicrons and are stored in adipose tissue or oxidised.</li>\r\n<li>Amino acids from protein intake are partly taken up by the liver for <strong>protein synthesis</strong>, while the rest are used by peripheral tissues.

The liver's ability to synthesise and release glucose is therefore essential in both short- and long-term fasting.</li>\r\n<li>During fasting, circulating ketone bodies rise significantly, providing an alternative fuel for many tissues, including the brain, once their levels are sufficient.

These cells contain <strong>glucose transporters</strong> that allow glucose entry proportional to its blood concentration.</li>\r\n<li>Inside the cell, glucose is phosphorylated by <strong>glucokinase</strong> to glucose-6-phosphate, a key regulatory step. The metabolism of glucose-6-phosphate generates ATP, which inhibits <strong>ATP-sensitive potassium channels</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Their closure depolarises the beta-cell membrane, opening voltage-gated calcium channels. The resulting <strong>calcium influx</strong> triggers fusion of insulin-containing vesicles with the membrane, releasing insulin into the bloodstream by exocytosis.</li>\r\n<li>While glucose concentration is the primary regulator, amino acids and other factors also influence insulin release. At fasting glucose levels (80-90 mg/100 ml), insulin secretion is minimal.</li>\r\n<li>When glucose rises <strong>two to three times above normal</strong>, insulin secretion <strong>sharply increases in two phases</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>The first occurs within 3-5 minutes, due to the release of preformed insulin, but falls back within 5-10 minutes.</li>\r\n<li>The second phase begins after about 15 minutes, peaks in 2-3 hours, and involves both <strong>additional release</strong> of stored insulin and <strong>new insulin synthesis</strong>. <strong>(Options A, B, and C ruled out)</strong></li>\r\n<li>This is shown in the illustration given below.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGUPDATEDMCQ/202509101747e23d-ee9c-4a42-8248-d082684cb6c1.png\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When glucose levels fall back, insulin secretion quickly declines, often within 3-5 minutes.</li>\r\n<li>This <strong>rapid feedback</strong> ensures glucose homeostasis: elevated glucose triggers insulin release, which increases glucose uptake into tissues, thereby lowering blood glucose toward normal.</li>\r\n<li>Insulin directs tissues to use carbohydrates for energy while suppressing fat utilisation. In low glucose states, insulin secretion falls and <strong>fat</strong> becomes the primary energy source, except for the brain.</li>\r\n<li>With high glucose, insulin secretion rises, shifting metabolism to glucose use and promoting storage of excess glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscle, and as fat. Thus, insulin determines whether glucose or fat is used for energy at any given time.</li>\r\n</ul>",

Clinically, they present with anaemia,<strong> jaundice</strong>, and<strong> splenomegaly due</strong> to increased red cell destruction, while intravascular hemolysis additionally produces <strong>hemoglobinemia</strong>, hemoglobinuria, and hemosiderinuria. Excess bilirubin from ongoing hemolysis contributes to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and persistent cases may result in gallstone formation from heme pigment deposits.</p>",

Affected individuals have very low blood acylglycerols and experience <strong>fat malabsorption</strong> along with fat accumulation in the intestine and liver. Without treatment, it may lead to early death. However, supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins, especially <strong>vitamin E</strong>, can prevent severe outcomes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency I(Option D): </strong>Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (Type I) arises from defective or absent lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, often due to <strong>LPL abnormalities </strong>or lack of<strong> apo C-II</strong>. This leads to impaired clearance of chylomicrons and VLDL, resulting in markedly elevated triglycerides with reduced LDL and HDL levels, but it does not increase coronary artery risk.</p>",
