Galactose and fructose are readily converted to glucose in the liver.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Hepatic Gluconeogenesis provides a source of glucose 18 hours after fasting, when glycogen is depleted.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Liver glycogen functions as a reserve to maintain the blood glucose concentration in the fasting state. The liver concentration of glycogen is about 450 mmol/L glucose equivalents after a meal, falling to about 200 mmol/L after an overnight fast; after 12 to 18 hours of fasting, liver glycogen is almost totally depleted.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Muscle glycogen provides a readily available source of glucose-1-phosphate for glycolysis within the muscle itself.</p>\r\n<p>Although muscle glycogen does not directly yield free glucose(because muscle lacks glucose-6-phosphatase), pyruvate formed by glycolysis in muscle can undergo transamination to alanine, which is exported from muscle and used for gluconeogenesis in the liver.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Option A: Vitamin B1(Thiamin) deficiency can result in three distinct syndromes: a chronic peripheral neuritis, beriberi, which may or may not be associated with heart failure and edema; acute pernicious(fulminating) beriberi(Shoshin beriberi), in which heart failure and metabolic abnormalities predominate, without peripheral neuritis; and Wernicke encephalopathy with Korsakoff psychosis, which is associated especially with alcohol and narcotic abuse. The role of thiamin diphosphate in pyruvate dehydrogenase means that in deficiency there is impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. In subjects on a relatively high carbohydrate diet, this results in increased plasma concentrations of lactate and pyruvate, which may cause life-threatening lactic acidosis.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Although Vitamin B2(riboflavin) is centrally involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and deficiency occurs in many countries, it is not fatal, because there is very efficient conservation of tissue riboflavin. Riboflavin released by the catabolism of enzymes is rapidly incorporated into newly synthesized enzymes. Deficiency is characterized by cheilosis, desquamation and inflammation of the tongue, and seborrheic dermatitis. Riboflavin nutritional status is assessed by measurement of the activation of erythrocyte glutathione reductase by FAD added in vitro.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Vitamin B3(Niacin) deficiency can lead to pellagra. It is characterized by photosensitive dermatitis. As the condition progresses, there is depressive psychosis and possibly diarrhea. Untreated pellagra is fatal.</p>\r\n<p>Although the nutritional etiology of pellagra is well established, and either tryptophan or niacin prevents or cures the disease, additional factors, including deficiency of riboflavin or vitamin B6, both of which are required for synthesis of nicotinamide from tryptophan, may be important. In most outbreaks of pellagra, twice as many women as men are affected, probably the result of inhibition of tryptophan metabolism by estrogen metabolites.</p>\r\n<p>When the staple diet is maize(corn), tryptophan content is low &amp; niacin is in bound form, so unavailable to the body, leading to pellagra.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Although clinical deficiency disease is rare, there is evidence that a significant proportion of the population has marginal vitamin B6 status. Moderate deficiency results in abnormalities of tryptophan and methionine metabolism. Increased sensitivity to steroid hormone action may be important in the development of hormone-dependent cancer of the breast, uterus and prostate and vitamin B6 status may affect the prognosis. The most widely used method of assessing vitamin B6 status is by the activation of erythrocyte transaminases by pyridoxal phosphate added in vitro, expressed as the activation coefficient. Measurement of plasma concentrations of the vitamin is also used.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Option A: This molecule is present in a proteoglycan found on many extracellular cell surfaces. It contains GlcN with fewer N-sulfates than heparin and unlike heparin, its predominant uronic acid is GlcUA. Heparan sulfates are associated with the plasma membrane of cells, with their core proteins actually spanning that membrane. In this, they may act as receptors and may also participate in the mediation of the cell growth and cell-cell communication.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: The keratan sulfates consist of repeating Gal-GlcNAc disaccharide units containing sulfate attached to the 6&prime;position of GlcNAc or occasionally of Gal.</p>\r\n<p>Keratan sulfate I was originally isolated from the cornea, while keratan sulfate II came from cartilage. The two GAGs differ in the structural links to the core proteins, and as I or II, the classification is based on the different linkage to the core protein. In the eye, they lie between collagen fibrils and play a critical role in corneal transparency. Changes in proteoglycan composition found in corneal scars disappear when the cornea heals.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Hyaluronic acid consists of an unbranched chain of repeating disaccharide units containing GlcUA and GlcNAc. It is present in bacteria and is found in the ECM of nearly all animal tissues, but is especially high in concentration in highly hydrated types such as skin and umbilical cord and in bone, cartilage, joints(synovial fluid) and in vitreous humor in the eye, as well as in embryonic tissues. It is thought to play an important role in permitting cell migration during morphogenesis and wound repair. Its ability to attract water into the ECM triggers loosening of the matrix, aiding this process. The high concentrations of hyaluronic acid together with chondroitin sulfates present in cartilage contribute to its compressibility.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Proteoglycans linked to chondroitin sulfate by the Xyl-Ser O-glycosidic bond are prominent components of cartilage. The repeating disaccharide is similar to that found in hyaluronic acid, containing GlcUA but with GalNAc replacing GlcNAc. The GalNAc is substituted with sulfate at either its 4&prime; or its 6&prime; position, with approximately one sulfate being present per disaccharide unit. Chondroitin sulfates have an important role in maintaining the structure of the ECM. They are located at sites of calcification in endochondral bone and are a major component of cartilage. They are found in high amounts in the ECM of the central nervous system and in addition to their structural function, are thought to act as signaling molecules in the prevention of the repair of nerve endings after injury.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/20250411cc89066a-142a-41a7-bd03-e2fc4f230884.jpg\">",

      "solution": "<p>Option A: Vitamin B1(Thiamine) deficiency can result in three distinct syndromes: a chronic peripheral neuritis, beriberi, which may or may not be associated with heart failure and edema; acute pernicious(fulminating) beriberi (Shoshin beriberi), in which heart failure and metabolic abnormalities predominate, without peripheral neuritis; and Wernicke encephalopathy with Korsakoff psychosis, which is associated especially with alcohol and narcotic abuse. The role of thiamine diphosphate in pyruvate dehydrogenase means that in deficiency there is impaired conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. In subjects on a relatively high carbohydrate diet, this results in increased plasma concentrations of lactate and pyruvate, which may cause life-threatening lactic acidosis.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Niacin deficiency can lead to pellagra. Pellagra is characterized by photosensitive dermatitis. As the condition progresses, there is depressive psychosis and possibly diarrhea. Untreated pellagra is fatal.</p>\r\n<p>Pellagra is common when the staple diet is maize, due to low tryptophan content &amp; bound form of niacin which is unavailable to the body.</p>\r\n<p>Pellagra is a multifactorial disease. Although the nutritional etiology of pellagra is well established, and either tryptophan or niacin prevents or cures the disease, additional factors, including deficiency of riboflavin or vitamin B6, both of which are required for synthesis of nicotinamide from tryptophan, may be important.</p>\r\n<p>In most outbreaks of pellagra, twice as many women as men are affected, probably the result of inhibition of tryptophan metabolism by estrogen metabolites.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Zinc deficiency can lead to Acrodermatitis Enteropathica. It is a genetic condition where Zn absorption is defective, which leads to Zn deficiency. Characterized by acrodermatitis(inflammation around mouth, nose, fingers etc), diarrhea, alopecia(loss of hair in discrete areas), ophthalmoplegia and hypogonadism.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Although clinical deficiency disease is rare, there is evidence that a significant proportion of the population has marginal vitamin B6 status. Moderate deficiency results in abnormalities of tryptophan and methionine metabolism. Increased sensitivity to steroid hormone action may be important in the development of hormone-dependent cancer of the breast, uterus and prostate and vitamin B6 status may affect the prognosis. The most widely used method of assessing vitamin B6 status is by the activation of erythrocyte transaminases by pyridoxal phosphate added in vitro, expressed as the activation coefficient. Measurement of plasma concentrations of the vitamin is also used.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Option A: Vitamin D deficiency remains the most common cause of rickets globally. Vitamin D deficiency most frequently occurs in infancy because of a combination of poor intake and inadequate cutaneous synthesis. The clinical features are typical of rickets, with a significant minority presenting with symptoms of hypocalcemia. Prolonged laryngospasm is occasionally fatal. These children have an increased risk of pneumonia and muscle weakness leading to a delay in motor development. Children with nutritional vitamin D deficiency respond well with vitamin D supplementation.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Among the genetic disorders causing rickets because of hypophosphatemia, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets(XLH) is the most common, with a prevalence of 1/20,000. The defective gene is on the X chromosome, but female carriers are affected, so it is an X-linked dominant disorder. Pathophysiology The defective gene is called PHEX because it is a phosphate-regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on the X chromosome. The product of this gene appears to have an indirect role in inactivating FGF-23. Mutations in PHEX lead to increased levels of FGF-23. Because the actions of FGF-23 include inhibition of phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, phosphate excretion is increased. FGF-23 also inhibits renal 1&alpha;-hydroxylase, leading to decreased production of 1,25-D.</p>\r\n<p>These patients have rickets, but abnormalities of the lower extremities and poor growth are the dominant features. Delayed dentition and tooth abscesses are also common. Some patients have hypophosphatemia and short stature without clinically evident bone disease. Laboratory Findings Patients have high renal excretion of phosphate, hypophosphatemia and increased ALP; PTH and serum calcium levels are normal. Hypophosphatemia normally upregulates renal 1&alpha; hydroxylase and should lead to an increase in 1, 25-D, but these patients have low or inappropriately normal levels of 1, 25-D.</p>\r\n<p>Patients respond well to a combination of oral phosphorus and 1,25-D(calcitriol). But it does not respond to vitamin D only.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Children with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A, an autosomal recessive disorder, have mutations in the gene encoding renal 1&alpha;-hydroxylase, preventing conversion of 25-D into 1, 25-D. These patients normally present during the 1st 2 yr of life and can have any of the classic features of rickets, including symptomatic hypocalcemia. They have normal levels of 25-D but low levels of 1,25-D. Occasionally, 1, 25-D levels are at the lower limit of normal, inappropriately low given the high PTH and low serum phosphorus levels, both of which should increase the activity of renal 1&alpha;-hydroxylase and cause elevated levels of 1, 25-D. As in nutritional vitamin D deficiency, renal tubular dysfunction can cause a metabolic acidosis and generalized aminoaciduria. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1B is secondary to a mutation in the gene for a 25-hydroxylase. Patients have low levels of 25-D but normal levels of 1, 25-D. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1A responds to long-term treatment with 1,25-D(calcitriol).</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A have mutations in the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor, preventing a normal physiologic response to 1, 25-D. Levels of 1, 25-D are extremely elevated in this autosomal recessive disorder. Most patients present during infancy, although rickets in less severely affected patients might not be diagnosed until adulthood. Less severe disease is associated with a partially functional vitamin D receptor. Approximately 50&ndash;70% of children have alopecia, which tends to be associated with a more severe form of the disease and can range from alopecia areata to alopecia totalis. Epidermal cysts are a less common manifestation. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2B appears to result from overexpression of a hormone response element-binding protein that interferes with the actions of 1, 25-D. Alopecia may be present. Treatment Some patients respond to extremely high doses of vitamin D2(25-D or 1,25-D), especially patients without alopecia.</p>",
