The urine darkens on exposure to air due to oxidation of excreted homogentisate. Late in the disease, there is arthritis and connective tissue pigmentation(ochronosis) due to oxidation of homogentisate to benzoquinone acetate, which polymerizes and binds to connective tissue</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Genetic deficiency of Phenylalanine Hydroxylase enzyme leads to phenylketonuria, which characterized by mentally retarded with an low IQ, Agitation, hyperactivity, tremors and convulsions(because phenylalanine interferes with neurotransmitter synthesis), hypopigmentation(Inhibition of tyrosinase enzyme by Phenylalanine) and accumulation of phenyl ketones in blood and excreted in urine. Phenyl lactic acid in sweat gives mousy body odour as well as also mousy odour to urine.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Defect in tyrosinase leads to albinism, which leads to defective synthesis of melanin. Skin has low pigmentation and is sensitive to UV rays, prone for melanomas and skin cancer, Hair is also white, Ocular fundus is hypopigmented, associated with photophobia, nystagmus &amp; decreased visual acuity.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: The probable metabolic defect in type I tyrosinemia(tyrosinosis) is at fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. Therapy employs a diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine. Untreated acute and chronic tyrosinosis leads to death from liver failure. Alternate metabolites of tyrosine are also excreted in type II tyrosinemia(Richner-Hanhart syndrome), a defect in tyrosine aminotransferase, and in neonatal tyrosinemia, due to lowered activity of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate hydroxylase. Therapy employs a diet low in protein.</p>",

In such cases, the coding sequence of the mRNA differs from that in the cognate DNA. </p>\r\n<p>An example is the apolipoprotein B(apoB) gene and mRNA. In the liver, the single apoB gene is transcribed into an mRNA that directs the synthesis of a 100-kDa protein, apoB100. In the intestine, the same gene directs the synthesis of the identical mRNA primary transcript; however, a cytidine deaminase converts a CAA codon in the mRNA to UAA at a single specific site. Rather than encoding glutamine, this codon becomes a termination signal and hence production of a truncated 48-kDa protein(apoB48) results. ApoB100 and apoB48 have different functions in the two organs. </p>\r\n<p>A growing number of other examples include a glutamine to arginine change in the glutamate receptor and several changes in trypanosome mitochondrial mRNAs, generally involving the addition or deletion of uridine. </p>\r\n<p>The exact extent of RNA editing genome wide is unknown, but current estimates suggest that perhaps 0.01% of mRNAs are edited in this fashion. Recently, editing of miRNAs has been described suggesting that these two forms of post-transcriptional control mechanisms could cooperatively contribute to gene regulation.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: RNA interference(RNAi) or Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing(PTGS) is<strong> a conserved biological response to double-stranded RNA that mediates resistance to </strong>both<strong> endogenous parasitic and exogenous pathogenic nucleic acids and</strong> regulates the expression of protein-coding genes.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Tissue-specific regulation of gene expression can be provided by alternative splicing.

      "solution": "<p>Option A: There is only a limited capacity to metabolize vitamin A and excessive intakes lead to accumulation beyond the capacity of intracellular binding proteins; unbound vitamin A causes membrane lysis and tissue damage. Symptoms of toxicity affect the central nervous system(headache, nausea, ataxia, and anorexia, all associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure); the liver(hepatomegaly with histological changes and hyperlipidemia); calcium homeostasis(thickening of the long bones, hypercalcemia and calcification of soft tissues); and the skin (excessive dryness, desquamation, and alopecia).</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Some infants are sensitive to intakes of vitamin D as low as 50 &mu;g/d, resulting in an elevated plasma concentration of calcium. This can lead to contraction of blood vessels, high blood pressure and calcinosis-the calcification of soft tissues.</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Vitamin E toxicity is rare, but occasionally high dose causes risk of bleeding, muscle weakness, fatigue, nausea. </p>\r\n<p>Option D: Nicotinic acid has been used to treat hyperlipidemia when of the order of 1 to 6 g/d are required, causing dilation of blood vessels and flushing, along with skin irritation. Intakes of both nicotinic acid and nicotinamide in excess of 500 mg/d cause liver damage.</p>\r\n<p>Also high doses of niacin led to cystoid macular edema of the retina, which is fluid in the macula that causes swelling.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Vitamin K is the cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues in the postsynthetic modification of proteins to form the unusual amino acid &gamma;-carboxyglutamate(Gla) Initially, vitamin K hydroquinone is oxidized to the epoxide, which activates a glutamate residue in the protein substrate to a carbanion, which reacts nonenzymically with carbon dioxide to form &gamma;-carboxyglutamate. Vitamin K epoxide is reduced to the quinone by a warfarin-sensitive reductase, and the quinone is reduced to the active hydroquinone by either the same warfarin-sensitive reductase or a warfarin-insensitive quinone reductase. In the presence of warfarin, vitamin K epoxide cannot be reduced, but accumulates and is excreted. If enough vitamin K(as the quinone) is provided in the diet, it can be reduced to the active hydroquinone by the warfarin-insensitive enzyme and carboxylation can continue, with stoichiometric utilization of vitamin K and excretion of the epoxide. A high dose of vitamin K is the antidote to an overdose of warfarin. </p>\r\n<p>Option A: Prothrombin(also known as factor II) and several other proteins of the blood clotting system(factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C and S) each contain 4 to 6 &gamma;-carboxyglutamate residues. &gamma;-Carboxyglutamate chelates calcium ions, and so permits the binding of the blood-clotting proteins to membranes. In vitamin K deficiency, or in the presence of warfarin, an abnormal precursor of prothrombin(preprothrombin) containing little or no &gamma;-carboxyglutamate and incapable of chelating calcium, is released into the circulation.</p>\r\n<p>Option B, Option C &amp; Option D: Factor 11, Tissue factor &amp; Factor 5 do not contain gamma carboxyglutamate residue, so not dependent on vitamin K.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/202504124570350d-f1cf-47f4-aa4a-265b72db25ec.jpg\">",
