      "solution": "<p>During ketosis in type 1 DM, metabolic changes leading to</p>\r\n<p>Option A: increased beta oxidation of fatty acids, not decreased.</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Increased mobilization of free fatty acids from adipocytes</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Decreased acetyl CoA entering the TCA cycle due to lack of oxaloacetate.</p>\r\n<p>A fall in the concentration of oxaloacetate, particularly within the mitochondria, can impair the ability of the citric acid cycle to metabolize acetyl-CoA and divert fatty acid oxidation toward ketogenesis. Such a fall may occur because of an increase in the (NADH)/(NAD+) ratio caused when increased &beta;-oxidation alters the equilibrium between oxaloacetate and malate so that the concentration of oxaloacetate is decreased, and also when gluconeogenesis is elevated due to low blood glucose levels. The activation by acetyl-CoA of pyruvate carboxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, partially alleviates this problem, but in conditions such as starvation and untreated diabetes mellitus, ketone bodies are overproduced and cause ketosis.</p>\r\n<p>Option D: Increased synthesis of &beta; hydroxybutyrate by ketogenesis</p>\r\n<p>DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA) </p>\r\n<p>This condition is caused by increased fatty acid metabolism and the accumulation of ketoacids (acetoacetate and &beta;-hydroxybutyrate).</p>\r\n<p>DKA usually occurs in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in association with cessation of insulin or an intercurrent illness such as an infection, gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, or myocardial infarction, which increases insulin requirements temporarily and acutely, and is characterized by hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and a high-AG acidosis.</p>\r\n<p>In poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients may become hyperglycemic, both as a result of lack of insulin to stimulate uptake and utilization of glucose, and because in the absence of insulin to antagonize the actions of glucagon, there is increased gluconeogenesis from amino acids in the liver. At the same time, the lack of insulin to antagonize the actions of glucagon results in increased lipolysis in adipose tissue, and the resultant nonesterified fatty acids are substrates for ketogenesis in the liver. Utilization of the ketone bodies in muscle (and other tissues) may be impaired because of the lack of oxaloacetate (all tissues have a requirement for some glucose metabolism to maintain an adequate amount of oxaloacetate for citric acid cycle activity). In uncontrolled diabetes, the ketosis may be severe enough to result in pronounced acidosis (ketoacidosis); acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate are relatively strong acids. Coma results from both the acidosis and also the considerably increased osmolality of extracellular fluid (mainly as a result of the hyperglycemia, and diuresis resulting from the excretion of glucose and ketone bodies in the urine).</p>",

This undergoes a further reaction over a period of hours to form cholecalciferol, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. In temperate climates, the plasma concentration of vitamin D is highest at the end of summer and lowest at the end of winter. Beyond latitudes about 40&deg; north or south, there is very little ultraviolet radiation of the appropriate wavelength in winter.</p>\r\n<p>Cholecalciferol, either synthesized in the skin or from food, undergoes two hydroxylations to yield the active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or calcitriol. Ergocalciferol from fortified foods undergoes similar hydroxylation yield calcitriol. In the liver, cholecalciferol is hydroxylated to form the 25-hydroxy derivative, calcidiol. This is released into the circulation bound to a vitamin D&ndash;binding globulin, which is the main storage form of the vitamin. In the kidney, calcidiol undergoes either 1-hydroxylation to yield the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), or 24-hydroxylation to yield a probably inactive metabolite, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24-hydroxy calcidiol). Some tissues, other than those that are involved in calcium homeostasis, take up calcidiol from the circulation and synthesize calcitriol that acts within that cell</p>\r\n<p>So Option A is the correct option.</p>",

These vesicles vary from one another in their size and the way in which they are formed. Collectively, noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) (comprising miRNAs, long noncoding RNAs [lncRNAs], and circular RNAs [circRNAs]; can be loaded into EVs, which are then secreted. Such EV associated ncRNAs have been shown to exert paracrine effects on surrounding cells thereby facilitating intercellular communication. EVs have been shown to transfer information to target cells by mechanisms such as receptor ligand binding, direct fusion of the EV with the plasma membrane of recipient cells, or by endocytosis. Transfer of ncRNAs in this way has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases; cancer is one such condition, where laboratory studies have shown that EVs can modulate expression of crucial genes that are involved in tumorigenesis.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/2025041447866b7d-cbaf-4c9e-8a20-1bf4199ea971.jpg\">\r\n<p>Option C: Peroxisomes are small spherical structures containing granular matrices, prominent in leucocytes &amp; platelets.

Glycogen phosphorylase requires pyridoxal phosphate as its coenzyme.</p>\r\n<p>Regulation of Glycogenolysis</p>\r\n<p>1) The principal enzymes controlling glycogen metabolism (Glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase) are regulated in opposite directions by allosteric mechanisms and covalent modification by reversible phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of enzyme in response to hormone action.</p>\r\n<p>Phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase increases its activity; phosphorylation of glycogen synthase reduces its activity.</p>\r\n<p>Phosphorylation is increased in response to cyclic AMP (cAMP) formed from ATP by adenylyl cyclase in response to hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and glucagon. cAMP is hydrolysed by phosphodiesterase in response to hormone insulin, so terminating hormone action; in liver insulin increases the activity of phosphodiesterase.</p>\r\n<p>2) Glycogen phosphorylase regulation is different in liver &amp; muscle. In liver, the role of glycogen is to provide free glucose for export to maintain the blood concentration of glucose; in muscle, the role of glycogen is to provide a source of glucose 6-phosphate for glycolysis in response to the need for ATP for muscle contraction. So In both tissues, the enzyme is activated by phosphorylation catalyzed by phosphorylase kinase and inactivated by dephosphorylation catalyzed by phosphoprotein phosphatase, in response to hormonal and other signals.</p>\r\n<p>Active phosphorylase a in both tissues is allosterically inhibited by ATP and glucose-6-phosphate.

The &alpha; and &beta; subunits contain serine residues that are phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The &delta; subunit is identical to the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin and binds four Ca2+. The binding of Ca2+ activates the catalytic site of the &gamma; subunit even while the enzyme is in the dephosphorylated state; the phosphorylated a form is only fully activated in the presence of high concentrations of Ca2+</p>",
