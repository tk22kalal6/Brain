      "solution": "<p>Targeted Gene Regulation by Disruption or Knockout, Knockin, Editing, and Controlled Expression</p>\r\n<p>Various technical advances have allowed for the precise, targeted modification of mammalian genes. The exact methods used for genetically engineering mammalian genomes have evolved from tedious, low-efficiency methods based on positive and negative drug selections and homologous recombination (Knockout/Knockin) to the recently described CRISPR-Cas9 system. The goal of all of these methods is ultimately to generate a family of genetic variants of a gene of interest that are (a) a null, or complete loss-of-function allele; (b) recessive, loss-of-function alleles; and (c) ideally, dominant gain-of-function alleles. These genetic alterations are generated in pluripotent stem cells, which ultimately allow for introduction and propagation in whole model organisms (flys, fish, worms, rodents, etc). Having all three of these genetic variants allows one to precisely dissect the mechanism of action of any gene. However, complicating genetic analyses of many genes is the fact that their function(s) are essential for viability. To get around this problem, cell-type or tissue-specific genetic variants must be generated. This hurdle has been overcome through the use of cell- and tissue-specific enhancers that can drive the conditional (ie, experimentally controlled) expression of the targeting recombinases (ie, CRE-lox) and/or or nuclease (CRISPR-Cas9) that generate the altered genes, either null or loss- or gain-of-function alleles.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, <strong>selected loss-of-function alleles can be generated through equivalent siRNA expression to knock down production of a specific gene product</strong>. Collectively, these methods allow for sophisticated genetic and biochemical tests of gene function and allow scientists to probe the structure and function of mammalian genes in physiologic contexts. Tremendous molecular mechanistic insights have been, and will continue to be, obtained into the molecular etiology of human disease through these and other biochemical approaches.</p>\r\n<p>So option B is correct.</p>",

It has been found in heart, adipose tissue, spleen, lung, renal medulla, aorta, diaphragm, and lactating mammary gland, although it is not active in adult liver.

Although the life span of red blood cells is approximately 120 days, HbA1c levels represent a &ldquo;weighted&rdquo; average of glucose levels, with the youngest erythrocytes contributing to a greater extent than older ones. Approximately 50% of the HbA1c level is determined by plasma glucose levels over the previous month and 75% during the previous 2 months.</p>\r\n<p>Testing methods have been standardized to the HbA1c assay, which is now the preferred test to use to assess glycemic control. To avoid confusion for the general public, the American Diabetes Association, the American College of Endocrinology, and the National Diabetes Education Program recommend using the term A1c testing when referring to HbA1c equivalent (GHb) or HbA1c results. The National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) began in 1996, with the goal of standardizing GHb tests to the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method reported as HbA1c or HbA1c equivalent, as used in the DCCT. Several types of certified methods are available for measuring hemoglobin A1c: immunoassay, ion exchange HPLC, electrophoresis, boronate affinity HPLC, and enzyme methods. Reliable benchtop point-of-care analyzers, such as the one that uses a cassette-based immunoassay method, also are available.</p>",
