This effect of competitive inhibition can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration by which maximum velocity can still be achieved. Therefore, <strong>Vmax is unaltered in this type of inhibition. </strong>However, the concentration of the substrate required to achieve half of the maximum velocity is increased. Therefore, <strong>Km is increased in this condition.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Non-competitive inhibition</strong> is by binding <strong>inhibitors to enzymes in locations other than the active site.</strong> Increasing the concentration of the substrate does not overcome non-competitive inhibition Thus <strong>noncompetitive inhibitors decrease the Vmax of the reaction.</strong> They do not interfere with the binding of the substrate to the enzyme. Thus, the <strong>enzyme shows the same Km in the presence or absence of noncompetitive inhibitors.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Uncompetitive inhibition</strong> is a type of enzyme inhibition in which the inhibitor can only bind to the enzyme-substrate complex. As a result, uncompetitive inhibition Vmax decreases but it does not change the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. the inhibitors typically bind to an allosteric site on the enzyme which changes the shape of the enzyme and makes it more difficult for the substrate to bind.</p>\r\n<p>For example, the drug <strong>methotrexate is an uncompetitive inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of DNA</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Suicidal inhibition</strong>, also known as irreversible inhibition or mechanism-based inhibition, is a type of enzyme inhibition in which the inhibitor irreversibly binds to the active site of the enzyme, causing permanent inactivation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Inhibitor A is Non-Competitive, and Inhibitor B is Competitive.</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Competitive inhibition</strong>: Inhibitor binds to the active site, increasing Km but not affecting Vmax.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Non-competitive inhibition</strong>: Inhibitor binds to an allosteric site, decreasing Vmax but not affecting Km.</li>\r\n</ul>",

This is useful in cancer diagnosis, such as detecting HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer, which guides targeted therapy decisions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice C: Deletion - Detectable by FISH<br /> </strong>FISH can identify chromosomal deletions, including microdeletions that may not be visible on standard karyotyping. It is used to diagnose conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Williams syndrome, which result from small chromosomal deletions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></p>\r\n<p>FISH is effective for detecting large-scale chromosomal abnormalities such as translocations, amplifications, and deletions, but it cannot detect point mutations, which require molecular techniques like PCR or sequencing.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Active Form of Folic Acid is THFA. For formation of THFA Vitamin B12 is required or else Folic Acid will be trapped in Methyl THFA and not used for its biological actions. </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>As In folate Deficiency, </strong>transfer of the formimino group is impaired, and Figlu is excreted. Excretion of Figlu following a dose of histidine thus can be used to detect folic acid deficiency.</p>\r\n<p>When acting as a methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine forms homocysteine, which may be methyltetrahydrofolate by methionine synthase, a vitamin B12-dependent enzyme. So Homocysteine level is increased along with increased level of Methyl Malonic acid in urine. So Vitamin B12 deficiency will also lead to folate trap. Thus Vitamin B12 Supplementation is recommended along with folate.</p>\r\n<p>In absence of Folic Acid &amp; THFA formation, which is involved in one carbon metabolism also affects Vitamin B12 level. As folic acid also involved in Purine Nucleotide synthesis as N10 Formyl THF. Absence of its leads to inability of cells to make DNA, protein synthesis continue. . This will affects rapidly developing cells like bone marrow and RBC leading to Macrocytosis &amp;- Megaloblastic Anemia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice A: Low homocysteine and high methylmalonic acid - Incorrect<br /> </strong>Folate deficiency leads to an increase in <strong>homocysteine</strong> levels because folate is required for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. However, <strong>methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels remain normal</strong> in folate deficiency because MMA metabolism depends on vitamin B12, not folate. In contrast, vitamin B12 deficiency causes both <strong>elevated homocysteine and MMA levels</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice B: Hemolytic anemia is a feature - Incorrect<br /> </strong>Folate deficiency primarily causes <strong>megaloblastic anemia</strong>, which results from impaired DNA synthesis, leading to large, immature red blood cells. Hemolytic anemia, which involves increased destruction of RBCs, is not a primary feature of folate deficiency.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice D: Purine and pyrimidine synthesis are affected - Incorrect<br /> </strong>Folate plays a key role in DNA synthesis by participating in <strong>one-carbon metabolism</strong> for purine (via N10-formyl-THF) and pyrimidine (via N5, N10-methylene-THF) synthesis. However, in folate deficiency, pyrimidine synthesis <strong>can still proceed</strong>, while purine synthesis is <strong>more severely impaired</strong>. This makes this statement incomplete as the primary issue is purine synthesis rather than both purine and pyrimidine equally.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></p>\r\n<p>Folate deficiency leads to increased homocysteine levels, megaloblastic anemia, and impaired DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 supplementation is recommended alongside folate to prevent masking of underlying B12 deficiency, which can lead to irreversible neurological damage.</p>",
