      "solution": "<p><strong>Urea cycle is the major disposal form of amino groups</strong> derived from amino acids, 90% of the nitrogen containing components of urine. Hyperammonemia is either by a<strong>cquired or genetic condition</strong>. Acquired causes like alcoholism leading to damaged liver, fatty liver and cirrhosis, commonly seen in adults. <strong>Genetic cause including deficiency of enzymes of Urea cycle like CPS 1 deficiency, NAGS Deficiency, OTC deficiency</strong> etc.</p>\r\n<p>Ammonia transport from peripheral tissue to liver for conversion to urea <strong>involves Glutamine Synthase to combine ammonia with Glutamate</strong>. Thus glutamine provides non toxic storage and transport of ammonia. In urea cycle disorders, use of Phenylbutyrate is one of the treatment options.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Phenylbutyrate is converted into phenylacetate</strong> which combines with <strong>Glutamine to form Phenylacetylglutamine</strong>. It contains two nitrogen atoms,<strong> excreted in Urine thereby clearance </strong>of Nitrogenous waste.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></h3>\r\n<p><strong>Choice A (Arginine):</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Arginine</strong> is involved in the <strong>urea cycle</strong> as a <strong>substrate for arginase</strong>, producing <strong>urea and ornithine</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>It <strong>does not donate ammonia for phenylbutyrate conjugation</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Arginine supplementation is sometimes used for <strong>argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) or argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiencies</strong>, but it is not the key provider of ammonia for phenylbutyrate therapy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Choice C (Aspartate):</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Aspartate</strong> donates nitrogen in the <strong>urea cycle</strong> by contributing an amino group to form <strong>argininosuccinate</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>However, <strong>it does not contribute directly to phenylbutyrate-mediated ammonia removal</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Choice D (Glycine):</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Glycine is involved in alternative nitrogen excretion pathways</strong>, such as conjugation with <strong>benzoate</strong> to form <strong>hippuric acid</strong>, another treatment for hyperammonemia.</li>\r\n<li>However, <strong>it is not the primary donor for phenylbutyrate conjugation</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Glutamate is the key amino acid that provides ammonia in the urea cycle</strong> by forming <strong>glutamine</strong>, which then reacts with <strong>phenylacetate</strong> to form <strong>phenylacetylglutamine</strong>, facilitating <strong>ammonia excretion</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Phenylbutyrate therapy</strong> is effective in <strong>urea cycle disorders</strong> by bypassing the defective enzymatic steps and <strong>removing excess nitrogen</strong> in a non-urea pathway.</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Genomic instability is frequently used to refer to two abnormalities seen in many cancer cells: microsatellite instability (MSI) and chromosomal instability (CIN)</strong>. CIN refers to gain or loss of chromosomes caused by abnormalities of chromosomal segregation during mitosis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>An important aspect of CIN is aneuploidy</strong>, a very common feature of solid tumors. Aneuploidy exists when the chromosomal number of a cell is not a multiple of the haploid number. The <strong>degree of aneuploidy often correlates with a poor prognosis suggesting that abnormalities of chromosomal seggregation</strong> contribute to tumor progression by increasing genetic diversity</p>\r\n<p><strong>Using highly sensitive fluorescent labeled hybridization probes, specific gene sequences can be mapped, or \"painted</strong>,\" within the nuclei of human cells, even without polytene chromosome formation, using fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH techniques</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conventional Cytogenetics technique</strong> involves the study of Chromosomes under Microscope - Karyotyping. The analysis helps to identify large chromosomal abnormalities such as aneuploidy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sanger Sequencing - It uses Chain termination</strong> to identify the exact sequence of nucleotide in a DNA molecule</p>\r\n<p><strong>PCR</strong> - It amplifies specific DNA sequences. Quantify target nucleic acid sequence within a sample. Also used for Aneuploidy detection.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Chromosomal aneuploidy</strong> can be detected using multiple techniques, including <strong>FISH, karyotyping, Sanger sequencing, and PCR</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>FISH and conventional cytogenetics</strong> are the <strong>gold standard</strong> for detecting large chromosomal abnormalities.</li>\r\n<li><strong>PCR and sequencing methods</strong> provide <strong>molecular-level detection</strong> of aneuploidy-related genetic variations.</li>\r\n</ul>",
