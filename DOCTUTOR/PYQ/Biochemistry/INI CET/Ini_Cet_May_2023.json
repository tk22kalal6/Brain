      "solution": "<p>While tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan are all amino acids that can serve as precursors for hormone synthesis, glycine does not directly participate in hormone synthesis pathways. Instead, glycine is important for other biochemical processes in the body, including protein synthesis and as a component of various metabolic pathways.</p>\r\n<p>Among the amino acids listed, glycine (option d) is the amino acid that is not directly used for the synthesis of hormones. Here's an explanation for each option:</p>\r\n<p><strong>a. Tyrosine</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid that serves as a precursor for the synthesis of several important hormones such as thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine), catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine), and melanin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>b. Phenylalanine</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid that can be converted to tyrosine in the body through the action of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Tyrosine, in turn, serves as a precursor for hormone synthesis as mentioned above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>c. Tryptophan</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and serves as a precursor for the synthesis of several hormones and neurotransmitters, including serotonin and melatonin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>d. Glycine</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Glycine is a non-essential amino acid that is not directly involved in the synthesis of hormones. Instead, glycine is primarily involved in protein synthesis and serves as a precursor for the synthesis of other substances such as heme (part of hemoglobin) and glutathione.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Therefore, glycine (option d) is the amino acid that is not used for the synthesis of hormones among the options provided</p>",

Phosphatidic acid is a precursor of phosphatidylglycerol, which in turn gives rise to cardiolipin. Decreased cardiolipin levels or alterations in its structure or metabolism cause mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and in pathologic conditions including heart failure, hypothyroidism, and Barth syndrome (cardioskeletal myopathy).</p>\r\n<p>Option B: Phosphatidylethanolamine (cephalin) and phosphatidylserine (found in most tissues) are also found in cell membranes and differ from phosphatidylcholine only in that ethanolamine or serine, respectively, replaces choline. Phosphatidylserine also plays a role in apoptosis (programmed cell death).</p>\r\n<p>Option C: Phosphatidylcholines, commonly called lecithins are the most abundant phospholipids of the cell membrane and represent a large proportion of the body&rsquo;s store of choline. Choline is important in nervous transmission, as acetyl choline, and as a store of labile methyl groups.</p>\r\n<p>Dipalmitoyl lecithin (Dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline) is a very effective surface-active agent and a major constituent of the surfactant preventing adherence, due to surface tension, of the inner surfaces of the lungs.

These are phosphoacylglycerols containing only one acyl radical, for example, lysophosphatidylcholine (lysolecithin), which is important in the metabolism and interconversion of phospholipids. This compound is also found in oxidized lipoproteins and has been implicated in some of their effects in promoting atherosclerosis.</p>\r\n<p>Sphingomyelins are found in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane lipid bilayer and are particularly abundant in specialized areas of the plasma membrane known as lipid rafts. They are also found in large quantities in the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. They are believed to play a role in cell signaling and in apoptosis. Sphingomyelins contain no glycerol, and on hydrolysis they yield a fatty acid, phosphoric acid, choline, and sphingosine. The combination of sphingosine plus fatty acid is known as ceramide, a structure also found in the glycosphingolipids.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Option A &amp; Option B: The process by which RNA is synthesized from the DNA is called Transcription.</p>\r\n<p>The strand that is transcribed or copied to the mRNA is referred to as Template strand. The opposite strand is referred to as Coding strand or Non-template strand.</p>\r\n<p>Primary transcript (mRNA) is complementary to the template strand. So sequence of coding strand is similar to nascent mRNA except in the case of Thymine replaced by Uracil.</p>\r\n<p>Here</p>\r\n<p>Template strand sequence is: 5' CATTCAATATCGATC 3'</p>\r\n<p>Coding strand sequence will be: 3' GTAAGTTATAGCTAG 5'</p>\r\n<p>mRNA transcript will be: 3' GUAAGUUAUAGCUAG 5'</p>\r\n<p>It can also be written as, 5' GAUCGAUAUUGAAUG 3'</p>\r\n<p>Option C &amp; Option D: Here we have to find resulting mRNA sequence after transcription, so all option containing T (thymine) cannot be answer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the case of a double-stranded DNA molecule containing many genes, the template strand for each gene will not necessarily be the same strand of the DNA double helix. Genes can be transcribed off both strands of DNA. Thus, a given strand of a double stranded DNA molecule will serve as the template strand for some genes and the coding strand of other genes. The information in the template strand is read out in the 3&prime;-5&prime; direction.</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/202504122fbdeb34-392e-43c4-865f-de38cd1fd715.jpg\">",
