      "solution": "<p>PCR is a method of amplifying a target sequence of DNA. The development of PCR has revolutionized the ways in which both DNA and RNA can be studied. PCR provides a sensitive, selective, and extremely rapid means of amplifying any desired sequence of DNA. Specificity is based on the use of two oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to complementary sequences on opposite strands of DNA and flank the target sequence.</p>\r\n<p>The DNA sample is first heat <strong><u>denatured</u></strong> (&gt;90&deg;C) to separate the two strands of the template DNA containing the target sequence; the primers, added in excess, are allowed to <strong><u>anneal</u></strong> to the DNA (typically at 50-75&deg;C) in order to generate the required template-primer complex. Subsequently, each strand is copied by a DNA <strong><u>polymerase</u></strong>, starting at the primer sites in the presence of all four dXTPs. The two DNA strands each serve as a template for the synthesis of new DNA from the two primers.</p>\r\n<p>Repeated cycles of heat denaturation, annealing of the primers to their complementary sequences, and extension of the annealed primers with DNA polymerase result in the exponential amplification of DNA segments of defined length. Product DNA doubles with each PCR cycle. DNA synthesis is catalyzed by a heat-stable DNA polymerase purified from one of a number of different thermophilic bacteria, organisms that grow at 70 to 80&deg;C. Thermostable DNA polymerases withstand short incubations at over 90&deg;, temperatures required to completely denature DNA. These thermostable DNA polymerases have made automation of PCR possible. DNA sequences as short as 50 to 100 bp and as long as 10 kb can readily be amplified by PCR. Twenty cycles provide an amplification of 106 (ie, 220) and 30 cycles, 109 (230). Each cycle takes &le;5 to 10 minutes so that even large DNA molecules can be amplified fairly rapidly.</p>\r\n<p>So the correct sequence is Denaturation &rarr; Annealing &rarr; Elongation, so option B is correct.</p>",
