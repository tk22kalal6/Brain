      "solution": "<p>Formal ether technique is a widely used technique for stool examination. Concentration procedure separate parasite from fecal debris and increase the chances of detecting parasitic organisms when these are in small numbers.</p>\n<p>They are divided into flotation technique and sedimentation technique.</p>\n<p>Procedure mix small portion of stool about the size of marble, in 10 ml 5 -10 % formalin in a test tube. Allow to stand 30 min for fixation. Strain about 10 ml of this suspension through a small funnel containing wet gauze into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Use two layers of gauze.</p>\n<p>The suspension should yield about 0.75 ml of sediment for fresh specimens and 0.5 ml for formalinized feces.</p>\n<p>Decant the supernatant and wash the sediment with 10 ml of saline solution. Centrifuge again and repeat washing until supernatant is clear.</p>\n<p>After the last wash, decant the supernatant and add 10 ml of 10 % formalin to the sediment. Mix and let stand for 5 min to effect fixation.</p>\n<p>Add 1 to 2 ml of ethyl acetate, stopper the tube and shake vigorously,</p>\n<p>Centrifuge at 450 g RCF ( about 1500 rpm) for 10 min. Four layers should result as follow</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A top layer of ethyl acetate</li>\n<li>Plug of debris</li>\n<li>Layer of formalin</li>\n<li>Sediment</li>\n<li>Free the plug of debris from the side of the tube by ringing with an applicator stick.

      "solution": "<p>Mite life cycle is as follow.</p>\n<p>Mites develops in four stages.

These mites reside in specific ecological zones known as <strong>\"mite islands,\"</strong> where they act as vectors for the disease.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice B: Lymphadenopathy is a feature &ndash; Correct<br /> </strong>Scrub typhus commonly presents with <strong>fever, eschar formation at the bite site, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms like headache, myalgia, and rash</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice D: Man is an accidental host &ndash; Correct<br /> </strong>Humans are <strong>accidental hosts</strong> of <em>Orientia tsutsugamushi</em>. The <strong>natural reservoir</strong> consists of mites and small mammals. Humans acquire the infection <strong>when bitten by infected chiggers in mite-infested areas</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:<br /> </strong>Scrub typhus is an <strong>intracellular bacterial infection transmitted by chiggers</strong>. It <strong>does not grow on MacConkey agar</strong> as it is <strong>not a lactose-fermenting bacterium</strong>. The disease is <strong>characterized by eschar formation, fever, and lymphadenopathy</strong>, with <strong>humans serving as accidental hosts</strong>.</p>",

Examples include <strong>BCG, MMR, and oral polio vaccine (OPV)</strong>. Diphtheria does not use a live attenuated vaccine.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice B: Killed &ndash; Incorrect<br /> </strong>Killed (inactivated) vaccines contain pathogens that have been <strong>killed by heat, chemicals, or radiation</strong>. Examples include <strong>inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), rabies vaccine, and hepatitis A vaccine</strong>. The diphtheria vaccine does not fall into this category.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice D: Polysaccharide &ndash; Incorrect<br /> </strong>Polysaccharide vaccines use <strong>purified capsular polysaccharides</strong> to induce immunity, often requiring conjugation to a protein carrier for better immunogenicity (e.g., <strong>pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines</strong>). Diphtheria is caused by a <strong>toxin</strong>, not a capsular polysaccharide, so this category is incorrect.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:<br /> </strong>The diphtheria vaccine is a <strong>toxoid vaccine</strong>, meaning it contains an <strong>inactivated form of the diphtheria toxin</strong> that induces an immune response without causing disease.</p>",

So option B is correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Choice A: Globally the most common species among them to cause diarrhea is C. parvum &ndash; Incorrect<br /> </strong>While <strong>C. parvum</strong> is a well-known cause of diarrhea, the most common species causing <strong>cryptosporidiosis globally is actually C. hominis</strong>. <strong>C. parvum</strong> is more commonly associated with zoonotic transmission, while <strong>C. hominis is more frequently transmitted human-to-human</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice C: Obligate intracellular &ndash; Incorrect<br /> </strong>Cryptosporidium species are <strong>not strictly obligate intracellular parasites</strong>. While they attach to and invade intestinal epithelial cells, they remain <strong>extracytoplasmic</strong>, enclosed within a specialized <strong>parasitophorous vacuole</strong> that allows them to survive while still interacting with the host cell.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice D: They do not have the property of internal autoinfection &ndash; Incorrect<br /> </strong>Cryptosporidium <strong>does exhibit internal autoinfection</strong>, which is a key feature allowing <strong>persistent infection</strong> in immunocompromised patients. This occurs when <strong>thin-walled oocysts rupture within the host intestine</strong>, leading to reinfection without the need for external transmission.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Cryptosporidium species, particularly <strong>C. hominis and C. parvum</strong>, cause <strong>severe chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients</strong>. The <strong>oocysts are immediately infective upon excretion</strong>, contributing to rapid transmission. Unlike Cyclospora, <strong>they do not require maturation in the environment</strong> and can undergo <strong>internal autoinfection</strong>, making infections difficult to clear in immunosuppressed individuals.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>This is the ELISA test. ELISA stands for Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.</p>\n<p>Principle of ELISA is antigen antibody interaction. Here the specific antibodies associate or bind to its target antigen. Only when the interaction takes place the substrate can bind to the enzyme. There by substrate conversion can be observed. Hense positive result Is obtained.</p>\n<p>There are many types of ELISA. <br />Sandwich ELISA,</p>\n<p>Direct ELISA<br /> Indirect ELISA<br /> competitive ELISA</p>\n<p>In given Image B is enzyme conjugate.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>In an <strong>ELISA</strong>, the <strong>enzyme conjugate</strong> is the antibody or antigen that is linked to an enzyme, which, when the substrate binds, catalyzes a reaction that produces a detectable signal. The presence of this signal indicates a positive result in the test.</p>",
