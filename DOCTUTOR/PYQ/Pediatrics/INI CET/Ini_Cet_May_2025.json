When reflux causes esophagitis, the infant can show irritability, back-arching, choking, gagging, or refusal to feed, leading to <strong>failure to thrive</strong>. Some babies also develop airway symptoms such as stridor, obstructive apnea, or lower respiratory issues when reflux aggravates underlying airway conditions like laryngomalacia or bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</p>\r\n<p>Most infants outgrow reflux spontaneously by 12-24 months. Management depends on age and symptom severity: avoid overfeeding, burp the infant well during and after feeds, and consider thickened feeds to both increase caloric density and lessen visible regurgitation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Explanations for other Options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS)(Option A):</strong> Typically causes <strong>forceful, projectile</strong> non-bilious vomiting beginning at 3&ndash;6 weeks of age and often reveals an olive-shaped mass or visible gastric peristalsis on abdominal exam, findings absent in this child.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cow milk protein allergy (Option C):</strong>More often presents with blood-streaked stools, diarrhea, eczema, or vomiting that may be bilious or accompanied by other allergic symptoms, not isolated effortless regurgitation with normal abdominal findings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intestinal obstruction (Option D):</strong>Generally produces <strong>bilious</strong> vomiting (if distal to the duodenum) or marked abdominal distension and abnormal bowel sounds, which are not seen here.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>A deficiency of <strong>sphingomyelinase</strong> leads to <strong>Niemann-Pick disease type A</strong>, a lysosomal storage disorder. It causes <strong>accumulation of sphingomyelin in macrophages and other tissues</strong>, resulting in <strong>hepatosplenomegaly</strong>. The <strong>cherry-red spot</strong> occurs due to storage in retinal ganglion cells, while the <strong>startle reflex remains normal</strong> initially. Neurological deterioration develops gradually, distinguishing it from other storage disorders like Tay-Sachs.</p>\r\n<p>This inherited lysosomal storage disorder usually appears in early infancy. Although newborns are healthy at birth, they soon develop failure to thrive, progressive hepatosplenomegaly, and marked psychomotor delay. Over time, affected infants experience profound motor decline and intellectual deterioration, with death typically occurring by 2-3 years of age.</p>\r\n<p>The disease results from absent or markedly reduced activity of acid sphingomyelinase, leading to accumulation of sphingomyelin within cells of the monocyte-macrophage system. Examination of bone marrow or lymph nodes often reveals lipid-laden foam cells, and the diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating low sphingomyelinase activity in peripheral leukocytes.</p>\r\n<p>Management is largely supportive-such as physical therapy and assisted feeding-but <strong>olipudase alfa</strong> has recently been approved to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disorder.</p>\r\n<p>conditions associated with a cherry-red spot on the retina include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Commotio retinae</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Central retinal or cilioretinal artery occlusion</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Metabolic storage disorders</strong>, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>GM1 gangliosidosis</li>\r\n<li>Mucolipidosis type I (sialidosis)</li>\r\n<li>GM2 gangliosidosis (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease)</li>\r\n<li>Farber disease</li>\r\n<li>Niemann-Pick disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Drug or toxin exposure</strong>, for example from quinine, dapsone, gentamicin, carbon monoxide, or methanol.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/FMGEMCQ/2025092956c192b9-0562-4210-8cf7-f0322c9deab6.png\">\r\n<p><strong>Explanations for other Options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Glucocerebrosidase</strong> <strong>(Option A):</strong> <strong>Gaucher disease</strong> results from <strong>glucocerebrosidase deficiency</strong> and is characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal involvement such as bone pain or fractures.
