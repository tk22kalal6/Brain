      "solution": "<p>Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that involves widespread damage to the brain's white matter. It typically occurs due to rapid acceleration or deceleration, such as in high-impact accidents. DAI often results in coma or severe cognitive dysfunction. One of the key characteristics of DAI is that it may not be immediately visible on non-contrast CT scans (NCCT), especially in the early stages, since it primarily affects the axons and the white matter rather than causing large, identifiable masses or hemorrhages.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rule Out:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong> EDH (Epidural Hematoma):</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An epidural hematoma typically shows up as a lens-shaped hyperdensity on CT scans, typically located between the skull and the dura mater.
