      "solution": "<p>A shotgun with no choke (also referred to as a \"cylinder bore\") has no constriction at the end of the barrel. This results in the most rapid spread of pellets, as the barrel does not restrict the shot pattern at all.</p>\r\n<p>For a no choke gun, a 30-inch pellet spread is typically achieved at 20 yards.</p>\r\n<p>Without any choke, the pellets begin dispersing immediately upon exiting the barrel, creating a wider pattern at shorter ranges compared to choked shotguns.</p>\r\n<p>This characteristic makes no choke guns ideal for close-range shooting, such as home defense or certain types of hunting, where wide coverage at short distances is advantageous.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rule Out:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>b) 30 yards:</strong> At 30 yards, the pellet spread for a no choke gun would exceed 30 inches, often reaching 40-45 inches. The given spread is too narrow for this distance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>c) 40 yards:</strong> At 40 yards, the spread would increase even further, often exceeding 50-60 inches for a no choke gun. This range is too far to match the described spread.</p>\r\n<p><strong>d) 60 yards: </strong>At 60 yards, the spread would be extremely large and erratic for a no choke gun, well beyond the 30-inch pattern described in the question. This range is impractical for such a wide-open bore.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<p>No Choke Characteristics: A no choke (cylinder bore) gun produces the widest and most rapid pellet spread, making it suitable for short-range applications.</p>\r\n<p>30-Inch Spread Matches 20 Yards: A 30-inch spread is typically observed at 20 yards for a no choke shotgun, due to the absence of constriction.</p>\r\n<p>Spread Increases Rapidly with Distance: Unlike choked shotguns, no choke guns have an exponentially increasing spread with range, making them ineffective for long-distance shooting.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Paradoxical undressing is a phenomenon observed in the advanced stages of hypothermia, where individuals experiencing severe cold exposure begin to remove their clothing despite the dangerously low body temperatures.</p>\r\n<p>This behavior occurs due to the failure of the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms. In severe hypothermia, vasoconstriction (the narrowing of blood vessels to conserve heat) starts to fail, causing sudden vasodilation. This leads to a sensation of intense heat in the skin, prompting individuals to undress.</p>\r\n<p>It is a hallmark sign of the terminal stage of hypothermia, often preceding unconsciousness or death.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Rule Out:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>b) Datura poisoning:</strong> Datura poisoning typically causes symptoms such as delirium, hallucinations, dry mouth, and hyperthermia (increased body temperature). There is no link between datura poisoning and paradoxical undressing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>c) Immersion syndrome:</strong> This condition occurs when someone is suddenly immersed in cold water, causing a rapid drop in core temperature and possible cardiac arrest (cold shock).
