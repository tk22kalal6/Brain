Although the victim may display asphyxial features and signs of struggle, examination of the neck often reveals no visible injuries, since the pressure is applied by the soft tissues of the arm or leg. In some cases, death may also result from vagal inhibition.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Garroting (Option D): </strong>Garroting is a method in which a <strong>thin cord</strong> is quickly looped around the neck of an unsuspecting person from behind, and the ends are tightened forcefully using two sticks, causing strong neck constriction.</p>",
