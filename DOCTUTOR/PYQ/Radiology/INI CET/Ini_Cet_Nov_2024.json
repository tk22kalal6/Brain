Noncontrast CT has the highest sensitivity among all imaging modalities for renal calculus.

      "solution": "<p>Pyogenic pneumonia refers toa type of bacterial pneumonia, characterized by the production of pus in the lungs, commonly caused by bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae</p>\n<p>Pneumococcal pneumonia is caused by <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. It is the commonest communityacquired pneumonia and can occur at any age. The clinical presentation is in form of abrupt onset offever, chills, cough and chest pain, often associated with bloody or rusty sputum. The organism tends to affect the terminal airways first and then disseminates to the surrounding segments giving rise to the classical unilateral airspace pneumonia An air bronchogram is commonly present andthis is a characteristic feature. The volume of the lobe usually remains unchanged. Classically,it causes a lobar pattern of consolidation but may sometimes even have a bronchopneumonic orinterstitial pattern. Occasionally, early during the disease, a spherical or round pneumonia may beseen, particularly in children. One study that investigated the radiographic appearance in 81 inpatients with culture documented pneumococcal pneumonia, demonstrated a lobar pattern of consolidation in 81% of patients. Lobar consolidation was focal in 48% and multifocal in 33%. A bronchopneumonic pattern was seen in 19% cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation :</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Choice B</strong> :- Interstitial infiltrates are seen in mycoplasma pneumonia</p>\n<p><strong>Interstitial Pneumonia, </strong>the infection results in diffuse edema of the airway walls along withinflammatory cellular infiltration which extends from the peri-bronchial tissues into the interlobularsepta. The usual causes of <strong>acute interstitial pneumonia are viral or <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae </em>infection.</strong></p>\n<p>The chest radiographs show <strong>generalized hyperaeration</strong>, <strong>widespread peribronchial thickening</strong>,<strong>increased reticular markings or small ill-defined nodules</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice C</strong>:- Hilar lymphadenopathy with lung infiltrates are seen in malignancy</p>\n<p>Hilar lymphadenopathy with lung infiltrate is commonly seen with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Adenocarcinoma usually presented with unresolving consolidation and lymphadenopathy. It can also be seen with the tuberculosis infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Choice D</strong>:- Aspiration pneumonia is more common in posterior segment of upper lobes and superior segment of lower lobes.</p>\n<p><em>Aspiration pneumonia: </em>Occurs in patients with impaired consciousness, chronic debilitatingdiseases, structural abnormalities of the pharynx and esophagus, neuromuscular disorders,impaired swallowing mechanisms, indwelling tracheal or esophageal/gastric tubes and inpostoperative patients, due to inhalation of bacteria, food, gastric contents, etc. leading toparenchymal inflammation or edema. It has several different pathophysiologicalaspects-bacterial pneumonia caused by the oral flora, chemical pneumonitis by gastric acid orexogenous lipids such as paraffin liquid and granulomatous reaction to foreign bodies<strong>. It occurs in</strong><strong>the gravity dependent portions of the lung, so in recumbent patient it involves the posterior</strong><strong>segment of the upper lobes and the superior segment of the lower lobes whereas in an erect</strong><strong>patient, </strong>aspiration is more likely to involve bilateral basal segments, middle lobe, and lingular lobe.</p>\n<p>On imaging, it is often seen as a bronchopneumonia or bronchiolitis pattern.</p>\n<p>Aspirated material may sometimes be seen in the bronchial lumen. A lung abscess may also beseen in bacterial aspiration.</p>\n<h3>Key Takeaway:</h3>\n<p>Lobar consolidation (not patchy infiltrates) is the hallmark of pyogenic pneumonia (e.g., pneumococcal pneumonia).</p>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> https://images.app.goo.gl/RkJsRM9ngribXLx29</p>",
