      "solution": "<p>Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which excess copper builds up in the body. Symptoms are typically related to the brain and liver. Liver-related symptoms include vomiting, weakness, fluid build up in the abdomen, swelling of the legs, yellowish skin and itchiness. Brain-related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble in speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and psychosis.</p>\n<p>Wilson's disease is caused by a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. This protein transports excess copper into bile, where it is excreted in waste products. The condition is autosomal recessive; for a person to be affected, they must inherit a mutated copy of the gene from both parents. Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing may be used to screen family members of those affected.</p>\n<p>Wilson's disease is typically treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low-copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer and kidney problems. A liver transplant may be helpful to those for whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.</p>\n<p>Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible in the cornea of the eyes, either directly or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper form a ring around the cornea. This is due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. These rings can be either dark brown, golden, or reddish-green, are 1 to 3 mm wide, and appear at the corneal limbus. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease and may be seen in people with chronic cholestasis. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither causes significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).</p>\n<p>Diagnosis</p>\n<p>Location of the basal ganglia, the part of the brain affected by Wilson's disease</p>\n<p>Wilson's disease may be suspected on the basis of any of the symptoms mentioned above, or when a close relative has been found to have Wilson's. Most have slightly abnormal liver function tests such as a raised aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and bilirubin level. If the liver damage is significant, albumin may be decreased due to an inability of damaged liver cells to produce this protein; likewise, the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation) may be prolonged as the liver is unable to produce proteins known as clotting factors. Alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with Wilson's-related acute liver failure. If there are neurological symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is usually performed; this shows hyperintensities in the part of the brain called the basal ganglia in the T2 setting. MRI may also demonstrate the characteristic \"face of the giant panda\" pattern.</p>\n<p>There is no totally reliable test for Wilson's disease, but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in the blood, as well of the amount of copper excreted in urine during a 24-hour period, are together used to form an impression of the amount of copper in the body. The gold standard-or most ideal test-is a liver biopsy.</p>\n<p>Ceruloplasmin</p>\n<p>Ceruloplasmin</p>\n<p>Levels of ceruloplasmin are abnormally low (&lt;0.2 g/L) in 80-95% of cases. It can, however, be present at normal levels in people with ongoing inflammation as it is an acute phase protein. Low ceruloplasmin is also found in Menkes disease and aceruloplasminemia, which are related to, but much rarer than Wilson's disease.</p>\n<p>The combination of neurological symptoms, eye signs and a low ceruloplasmin level is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. In many cases, however, further tests are needed.</p>\n<p>Serum and urine copper</p>\n<p>Serum copper is low, which may seem paradoxical given that Wilson's disease is a disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 &mu;g/24h (1.6 &mu;mol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 &mu;g/24h (0.6 &mu;mol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).</p>\n<p>In children, the penicillamine test may be used. A 500 mg oral dose of penicillamine is administered, and urine collected for 24 hours. If this contains more than 1600 &mu;g (25 &mu;mol), it is a reliable indicator of Wilson's disease.[clarification needed] This test has not been validated in adults.</p>\n<p>Slit-lamp examination</p>\n<p>The eyes of the patient are examined using a slit-lamp to look for Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are strongly associated with Wilson's Disease and are caused by copper deposition on the inner cornea in Descemet's membrane.</p>\n<p>Liver biopsy</p>\n<p>Once other investigations have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is the removal of a small amount of liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 &mu;g of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.</p>\n<p>In the earlier stages of the disease, the biopsy typically shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Genetic testing</p>\n<p>Mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene, as well as other genes linked to copper accumulation in the liver, may be performed. Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the disease as part of clinical genetics family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries like the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as they tend to have more mixed populations.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the joints. However, rheumatoid arthritis occasionally affects other parts of the body - including the eyes.</p>\n<p>The most common eye-related symptom of rheumatoid arthritis is dryness. Dry eyes are prone to infection, and if untreated, severe dry eyes can cause damage to the cornea, the clear, dome-shaped surface of the eye that helps your eye focus. Dry eyes can also be a symptom of Sjogren's syndrome - an autoimmune disorder that's often associated with rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n<p>More rarely, rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation in the white part (sclera) of your eyes, which can result in redness and pain.</p>\n<p>ocular Manifestations of SLE</p>\n<p>Ocular complaints affect somewhere between 33-50% of patients with SLE. The ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE are varied, ranging from mild irritation to vision threatening retinopathy. The most common ophthalmologic manifestation of SLE is keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome), affecting about a third of patients. The etiology of keratoconjunctivitis sicca in SLE patients is thought to be multifactorial, involving the development of secondary Sjogren's syndrome. While dry eye may be the most common complaint, the most common vision threatening ocular manifestation is that of lupus retinopathy, ranging from 3-29% of patients affected, depending on disease control. Such retinopathy is considerably less prevalent with available steroids and immunosuppressants; however, there is the possible sequela of blindness. Of note, uveitis is not commonly associated with SLE; if uveitis is present, alternative etiologies should be explored.</p>\n<p>An expanded discussion of the most common ocular manifestations in patients with SLE is included below, and a more extensive list of ophthalmologic presentations is outlined in Table 2.</p>\n<p>Table 2.

Up to 20% of SLE patients will manifest discoid lesions at some point during their disease process. Discoid lesions are most commonly found on the scalp, face, anterior neck and extensor surfaces of the arms. Additionally, these lesions can affect the eyelids, resulting in cicatricial entropion or ectropion.</p>\n<p>Signs and Symptoms</p>\n<p>Discoid lesions start as a scaly, purple macule or papule that expands into a discoid plaque. Scaling and hyperpigmentation may be seen in the periphery while the center is atrophic. These lesions may coalesce and a significant percentage of patients, over 50%, will develop scarring. When discoid lesions affect the eyelids, cicatricial entropion or ectropion can develop as a consequence of this scarring.</p>\n<p>Uveitis is not a single disease. Similar to arthritis (joint inflammation), uveitis can be a part of many different disease processes. Different types of uveitis often follow characteristic patterns that are distinguished by factors such as what part of the eye is affected, if the inflammation involves one or both eyes, if the inflammation began suddenly or gradually, if the inflammation completely resolves with treatment which can be stopped (acute or recurrent acute), or if it recurs off therapy (chronic) disease. Of these many subsets, the most common presentation for uveitis is undoubtedly acute anterior uveitis or AAU.</p>\n<p>Anterior means that the front portion of the uvea, the iris and ciliary body, are primarily affected by the inflammation. The anterior part of the uvea is the iris that surrounds the pupil and the adjacent ciliary body that synthesizes aqueous humor, the fluid that fills the front of the eye. Inflammatory cells in anterior uveitis may therefore be seen in the anterior chamber (iritis), and sometimes the anterior vitreous (behind the lens, in iridocyclitis).</p>\n<p>Acute disease is characterized by a sudden onset and limited duration. The symptoms of acute anterior uveitis are pain, redness, and photophobia (sensitivity to light), that typically develop rapidly, over a few days. The symptoms will resolve with appropriate anti-inflammatory therapy. If therapy can be tapered and inflammation does not recur for at least three months off of treatment, the disease is said to be of limited duration. The episode may be a single episode, or may be recurrent, with symptoms and signs recurring after at least three months of absence of inflammation off of all therapy. This is in contrast to chronic disease, where inflammation (with or without symptoms) recurs when medication is tapered and stopped.</p>\n<p>Etiology</p>\n<p>AAU may occur as an isolated medical problem without any association with illness or inflammation elsewhere in the body. It might also arise as part of a localized infection such as that due to the virus that causes cold sores, herpes simplex. It can occur rarely as an adverse reaction to a medication. AAU may also be associated with an illness affecting multiple parts of the body. The most common illnesses associated with AAU are also associated with a genotype known as HLA-B27. A detailed explanation of HLA-B27 and those diseases associated with HLA-B27 is found elsewhere on this website, but the most common association with AAU is ankylosing spondylitis, an inflammatory arthritis associated with HLA B27. Most diseases of other organs that are linked to AAU are apparent from associated symptoms. For example, bowel inflammation or colitis can be associated with AAU. A patient who has this association would usually have abdominal problems such as crampy abdominal pain, weight loss, and/or diarrhea. Some of the less common diseases associated with AAU include sarcoidosis, interstitial nephritis (a rare kidney inflammation), relapsing polychondritis (a rare autoimmune disease), and vasculitis (an inflammation of the blood vessel wall).</p>\n<p>Risk Factors</p>\n<p>HLA-B27 allele, anklyosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, certain medications</p>\n<p>Pathophysiology</p>\n<p>Unknown. A leading theory is that exposure of an individual with a genetic predisposition to an infectious agent results in cross reactivity with ocular specific antigens (molecular mimicry) with resultant iritis.</p>\n<p>Primary prevention</p>\n<p>None available. There is evidence from animal literature that the gut microbiome is important in the risk of developing HLA B27 related disease</p>\n<p>Diagnosis</p>\n<p>Characteristic disease in the setting of known risk factors (HLA-B27), with exclusion of other possible causes. All patients should have a work up with at a minimum syphilis titers. Depending on presentation and review of systems other diagnostic tests may be warranted including ocular fluid testing for viruses such as HSV,CMV, and VZV.</p>\n<p>Physical Examination</p>\n<p>The symptoms of AAU are generally eye redness, pain, and sensitivity to light (photophobia). Sometimes the vision is reduced, but this varies. Tearing, lid puffiness, and some drooping of the eyelid may also be present. Inflammation or infection in other parts of the eye may produce similar symptoms. For example, an ophthalmologist must distinguish AAU from diseases of other eye structures such as conjunctivitis (pink eye), keratitis (inflammation of the cornea), or scleritis (inflammation of the white part of the eye). The slit lamp is the most important tool that is used in distinguishing these entities. In AAU, white blood cells accumulate in the fluid filled space in the front of the eye. They are readily detectable by the slit lamp. AAU requires these cells to be present in the anterior chamber in order for the diagnosis to be made. All patients with AAU should initially undergo a dilated eye examination. This permits the examiner a view toward the back of the eye. The possible cause of AAU changes considerably if the inflammation in the front of the eye is accompanied by marked inflammation in the back of the eye.</p>\n<p>Anterior chamber cell</p>\n<p>Keratic Precipitates</p>\n<p>Flare</p>\n<p>Hypopyon</p>\n<p>Iris nodules</p>\n<p>Posterior synechiae</p>\n<p>Fibrin</p>\n<p>Pupillary miosis</p>\n<p>Band keratopathy</p>\n<p>Diagnostic procedures</p>\n<p>The basic workup for acute anterior uveitis includes HLA-B27 and syphilis testing. For bilateral granulomatous disease one should also consider testing for sarcoid (CXR at least-the utility of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and lysozyme testing is debated among uveitis specialists as many factors impact the level.) Other laboratory testing can be performed based on clinical suspicion for various diseases. Ocular fluid testing may be warranted in patients who present with a hypertensive anterior uveitis to test for herpetic etiology (although many providers treat empirically based on exam findings).</p>\n<p>Differential diagnosis</p>\n<p>Infectious</p>\n<p>Syphilis</p>\n<p>Tuberculosis</p>\n<p>HSV</p>\n<p>CMV</p>\n<p>Toxoplasmosis</p>\n<p>Rubella</p>\n<p>VZV</p>\n<p>Inflammatory</p>\n<p>HLA-B27 Associated</p>\n<p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease</p>\n<p>Psoriatic arthritis</p>\n<p>Sarcoidosis</p>\n<p>Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis</p>\n<p>Post-infectious</p>\n<p>Malignancy</p>\n<p>Lymphoma</p>\n<p>Retinoblastoma</p>\n<p>Other</p>\n<p>Idiopathic</p>\n<p>Medication-induced</p>\n<p>Management</p>\n<p>Medical Therapy</p>\n<p>The mainstay of therapy for AAU is topical drops. These usually include a topical corticosteroid drop such as prednisolone acetate 1% and often a dilating drop such as cyclopentolate. The corticosteroid drop treats the underlying inflammation. The dilating drop reduces pain and helps to prevent the complication of the pupil sticking to the adjacent lens. The frequency of the drops depends primarily on the intensity of the inflammation. Some forms of AAU are associated with an infection such as herpes and will also require therapy directed at the known infectious cause. Other patients may have an illness of other organs that will also impact the treatment recommendations. On occasion AAU is severe enough to warrant treatment by the local injection (shot) of corticosteroid near the eye itself or by oral therapy such as prednisone. Any treatment, including eye drops, may result in adverse effects; these must be balanced with potential benefits in recommending therapies. Complications of inflammation such as an elevated intraocular pressure and cystoid macular edema may also affect treatment choices.</p>\n<p>For recurrent or chronic disease and flares that are vision threatening despite local therapy, systemic immunosuppression therapy may be indicated that sometimes requires the expertise of a rheumatologist or uveitis specialist.</p>\n<p>Surgery</p>\n<p>There is no specific surgical treatment for uveitis. Surgery is reserved for dealing with the complications of uveitis. Typically intraocular surgery is only performed when the eye has been quiet for 3 months.</p>\n<p>Complications</p>\n<p>AAU may have complications such as the formation of posterior synechiae, band keratopathy or a rise in intraocular pressure, which may lead to glaucoma. AAU can also cause fluid to accumulate in the portion of the retina responsible for central vision, the macula. This complication is known as cystoid macular edema (CME). Patients may also develop a cataract either from inflammation or corticosteroids. These complications may affect the choices for treatment.</p>",

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li>Glaucoma describes a group of conditions in which there is characteristic cupping of the optic disc with corresponding visual field defects, due to retinal ganglion cell loss. It is a progressive condition and is the most common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a subset of the glaucomas defined by an open, normal appearing anterior chamber angle and raised intraocular pressure (IOP), with no other underlying disease. If there is an identifiable underlying cause for raised IOP, this is termed secondary glaucoma. If the IOP is within normal limits, this is termed normal tension glaucoma (NTG). Secondary glaucoma and NTG are not discussed in this section.</li>\r\n<li>Etiology</li>\r\n<li>The final common pathway for all potential etiologies of POAG is optic nerve head damage. This is thought to be secondary to primarily ganglion cell axon loss, although loss of blood vessels and glial cells has also been observed. There are many postulated mechanisms of ganglion cell damage.</li>\r\n<li>IOP related etiology</li>\r\n<li>There is good evidence that IOP related mechanisms of optic nerve damage are very important in the pathogenesis of POAG. By definition, patients with POAG have raised IOP. Raised IOP is an important risk factor for the progression to POAG from ocular hypertension (OHT), and is the only common clinical finding in a wide variety of secondary glaucomas. IOP seems to be important even in NTG, as reduction of IOP was shown to reduce the risk of progression in these patients in the Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma Study. In animal models, raised IOP always precedes glaucomatous nerve damage. It is thought that raised IOP primarily affects the optic nerve via the mechanical changes at the lamina cribrosa. There is consensus that the etiology of raised IOP is due to reduced aqueous outflow, rather than over-production of aqueous. Several theories exist as to the cause of reduced aqueous outflow (see below).</li>\r\n<li>Non-IOP related etiology</li>\r\n<li>A proportion of patients develop glaucoma and continue to progress despite low IOP. Equally, a proportion of patients with elevated IOP never develop POAG. This supports the theories of IOP independent mechanisms of glaucomatous nerve damage. These include ischemia, loss of neurotrophic factors, neurotoxicity, and failure of cellular repair mechanisms.</li>\r\n<li>Risk Factors</li>\r\n<li>IOP</li>\r\n<li>IOP is considered the most important risk factor for the development of POAG, and remains the only known modifiable risk factor. Raised IOP in animal models results in glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Population studies have shown increased prevalence of glaucoma with increasing IOP. In patients with OHT (raised IOP but no signs of glaucomatous optic disc or visual field changes), higher IOP is associated with a higher risk of developing POAG. This has been shown in the OHTS (Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study) and the EGPS (European Glaucoma Prevention Study). IOP is also thought to be a risk factor for NTG, despite IOP never being higher than the normal range.</li>\r\n<li>Age</li>\r\n<li>The prevalence of POAG increases with age, even after compensating for the association between age and IOP. Age was also found to be an important risk factor for the conversion of OHT to POAG in both OHTS and EGPS.</li>\r\n<li>Race</li>\r\n<li>Several studies have shown POAG to be more prevalent in people of African-Caribbean descent compared with Caucasians. Not only is POAG more prevalent in black race, its onset is earlier, and disease progression has been shown to be faster and more refractory to treatment. Black patients with OHT have been found to be more likely to progress to POAG. The prevalence of POAG in Hispanics is thought to be between that of African-Caribbean and Caucasian populations.</li>\r\n<li>Refractive error</li>\r\n<li>Myopia has been shown to be a risk factor for POAG in several studies. However, it can be difficult to diagnose true POAG in myopic patients and controversy exists over whether it is real risk factor. Myopic optic discs are notoriously difficult to assess, and myopic patients may have visual field defects unrelated to any glaucomatous process.</li>\r\n<li>Central corneal thickness</li>\r\n<li>A thinner cornea has been shown to be a risk factor for OHT patients developing POAG. This may be in part due to IOP measurement error (IOP tends to be read lower in patients with thinner corneas), but there are also theories that a thinner cornea may indicate less rigid support structures around the optic nerve head, and a resultant increased propensity to damage.</li>\r\n<li>Family history</li>\r\n<li>A first-degree relative with POAG is a risk factor for the development of POAG. This has been reported in several studies with the odds ratio varying from 3 to 13. The risk is thought to be higher still if the affected relative is a sibling. Several genes associated with POAG have been identified, though these account for less than 5% of all POAG in the general population. It is therefore thought that the hereditary aspect of POAG is likely to be polygenic and that gene-environment interactions are important.</li>\r\n<li>Other risk factors</li>\r\n<li>A high prevalence of POAG has been found in diabetic patients, and a high prevalence of diabetes has been found in POAG patients. However, controversy exists as to whether diabetes truly is a risk factor for POAG, as several large population studies have found no association. The role of blood pressure in the development of POAG is complicated and there is no consensus. Hypertension may predispose to glaucomatous damage via increased peripheral vascular resistance in small vessels, while a low blood pressure may reduce the perfusion pressure of the optic disc. There is a relative paucity of data regarding the lifestyle and nutritional epidemiology of POAG. There is a suggestion that exercise and a diet high in green collards and with a high omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acid ratio are protective against POAG.</li>\r\n<li>Diagnosis</li>\r\n<li>Diagnosis of POAG requires assessment of :</li>\r\n<li>Intraocular pressure</li>\r\n<li>Open- normal appearing anterior chamber angle</li>\r\n<li>Characteristics signs of optic disc damage</li>\r\n<li>Visual function loss on perimetry</li>\r\n<li>Frequently, the diagnosis is not clear-cut and the patient may present with some risk factors and signs, but not others. In such cases, the patient may be labeled as a glaucoma suspect. These patients require repeat assessments at regular intervals with the frequency of visits dependent upon index of suspicion.</li>\r\n<li>History</li>\r\n<li>The majority of patients with POAG are asymptomatic. Typically, patients are only symptomatic in late disease, when they may become aware of constricted visual field or blurred vision. Occasionally, patients become aware of earlier visual field defects when performing monocular tasks (such as using the viewfinder of a camera). More frequently, patients are usually diagnosed as part of a routine eye test or as an incidental finding when presenting with another ophthalmic condition (e.g. diabetic retinopathy). A detailed general history would reveal any causes of secondary glaucomas (and therefore refuting POAG), such as steroid usage.</li>\r\n<li>Physical examination</li>\r\n<li>Physical examination consists of assessment of IOP, anterior chamber angle, optic disc and visual field.</li>\r\n<li>IOP</li>\r\n<li>The gold standard for IOP measurement is Goldmann Applanation Tonometry (GAT). This is not available in all instances, and non-contact tonometry is also frequently used. In the UK, this is certainly true in the community where optometrists' preferred method of IOP measurement is non-contact.</li>\r\n<li>Almost standard now, in conjunction with tonometry, is the measurement of central corneal thickness (CCT). Theoretically, a thinner cornea may lead to measurements that under-estimate true IOP and vice versa. However, the effect of CCT on IOP measurement is not predictable, and there is no consensus as to the degree of under- or over-estimation of IOP that occurs with thinner or thicker corneas. Moreover, CCT is only one biomechanical attribute of a cornea. For example, a thin cornea that is very stiff may still result in over-estimation of IOP.</li>\r\n<li>Newer methods of IOP measurement aim to overcome variations in corneal biomechanics and give a more accurate estimate of true IOP. These include the Reichert Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA) and the Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer (DCT). The ORA is a non-contact tonometer that measures a biomechanical attribute of the cornea termed hysteresis. The DCT uses uses principle of contour matching instead of applanation to reduce the effect of corneal biomechanics.</li>\r\n<li>For more information on tonometry, please see the section Intraocular Pressure and Tonometry.</li>\r\n<li>Anterior chamber angle</li>\r\n<li>The anterior chamber angle is assessed clinically using the slit lamp (Van Herick technique) and with gonioscopy. Newer techniques for angle assessment include UBM (Ultrasound Biomicroscopy) and AS-OCT (Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography).</li>\r\n<li>Optic disc</li>\r\n<li>Clinical examination of the optic disc is a very important part of the assessment of patients with POAG. Direct ophthalmoscopy offers the most magnified view of the optic disc, but the view is not stereoscopic. Slit lamp biomicroscopy with a lens that offers large magnification (e.g. 60 dioptre or super 66) has the advantage of giving a stereoscopic view. Stereoscopic disc photographs offer a useful documentation of optic disc status, and also allow masked assessment in trials. Clinical assessment of an optic disc is still considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of POAG, though the inter-observer agreement is notoriously variable. Therefore, there is a drive for more objective optic disc assessment such as Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT) and Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT). Assessment of the nerve fiber layer surrounding the disc by the GDx is also useful.</li>\r\n<li>Visual field</li>\r\n<li>Automated static threshold perimetry (e.g. Humphrey field analysis) is the gold standard for diagnosis and monitoring of POAG. Various testing algorithms have been validated for POAG and allow reduced testing time for patients (e.g. Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm, SITA). Patients with early POAG may have normal visual fields on testing, and it has been estimated that 50% of ganglion cells need to be lost before a field defect becomes apparent. This rationale has led to development of new perimetric tests such as short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) and frequency doubling technology (FDT), which may be able to enhance earlier detection of functional loss by targeting a specific subset of ganglion cells that have sparse distribution.</li>\r\n<li>Signs</li>\r\n<li>IOP</li>\r\n<li>The International Society for Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology has published a consensus definition for POAG. This definition does not include IOP - i.e. POAG is diagnosed based on signs of glaucomatous optic neuropathy regardless of the level of IOP. Patients can be classified as normal tension glaucoma (NTG) or high tension glaucoma (HTG) based on the IOP. Sometimes an IOP spike may be missed in a clinical setting. In these cases, if HTG is suspected, measurement of IOP at hourly intervals throughout the day, beginning in the early morning, may be indicated. This is termed phasing. If a patient has all the features of POAG but consistently normal IOPs (less than or equal to 21 mmHg), this is considered NTG (discussed further in another section).</li>\r\n<li>Anterior chamber angle</li>\r\n<li>By definition, the anterior chamber angle of POAG patients is open. The Van Herick test provides an estimate of anterior chamber depth peripherally and reveals an irido-corneal distance of greater than 25% of corneal thickness. Gonioscopy is essential to make the diagnosis of POAG and should be performed on the initial visit.&nbsp; Various classifications systems have been described to assess the extent of an open angle.&nbsp; Gonioscopy helps to differentiate POAG from secondary open angle glaucomas (such as pigment dispersion in pigmentary glaucoma&nbsp; or neovascularization of the angle in neovascular glaucoma).</li>\r\n<li>Optic disc</li>\r\n<li>Optic disc changes seen on clinical examination of patients with POAG include:</li>\r\n<li>High cup:disc ratio (Figures 1 and 2)</li>\r\n<li>Cup:disc ratio asymmetry between eyes (usually considered significant if greater than 0.2)</li>\r\n<li>Vertical elongation of cup</li>\r\n<li>Focal neuro-retinal rim thinning or notching (Figure 1)</li>\r\n<li>Vessel bayoneting (Figure 2)</li>\r\n<li>Beta-zone peripapillary atrophy</li>\r\n<li>Disc hemorrhage</li>\r\n<li>Diagnostic procedures</li>\r\n<li>Optic disc</li>\r\n<li>Diagnostic procedures such as HRT, OCT and GDx are useful objective adjuncts to clinical optic disc assessment. Quantitative measures such as neuro-retinal rim area or volume and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness are useful for monitoring and assessing progression. Also, when compared with normal population values, they may give some indication of diagnosis (e.g. Moorfields Regression Analysis for HRT). This is discussed in more detail in the section Optic Nerve and Retinal Nerve Fiber Imaging.</li>\r\n<li>Visual Field</li>\r\n<li>Features of visual field defects, detected on automated threshold perimetry, that are characteristic of POAG include:</li>\r\n<li>Localized defects respecting the horizontal meridian</li>\r\n<li>Nasal step</li>\r\n<li>Arcuate scotoma</li>\r\n<li>Generalized depression</li>\r\n<li>Abnormal Glaucoma Hemifield Test</li>\r\n<li>Medical therapy</li>\r\n<li>Medical therapy may be topical or systemic. However, it is important to appreciate that topical medication may cause significant systemic side effects, especially beta-blockers.</li>\r\n<li>Topical therapy</li>\r\n<li>Alpha-agonists (apraclonidine, brimonidine)</li>\r\n<li>Beta-blockers (timolol, betaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol,etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (brinzolamide, dorzolamide)</li>\r\n<li>Miotics (pilocarpine,etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Prostaglandins (latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>The most efficacious class of drops is the prostaglandin analogues. They are also the most convenient drops with once nightly dosage. Side effects are mainly local and include hyperemia, lengthening of lashes, darkening of iris color and peri-ocular skin pigmentation. These are reversible on stopping the medication. The second most efficacious class of drops is the beta-blockers. Topical alpha-agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and miotics are much less efficacious, rarely achieving a drop in IOP of greater than 3 mmHg.</li>\r\n<li>The best locally tolerated drops are the beta-blockers, with very few patients experiencing ocular discomfort or redness. However, beta-blockers also cause the most systemic side-effects. There is a significant amount of systemic absorption following passage through the nasolacrimal duct. Side effects include breathlessness, reduced exercise tolerance and falls. This is especially true for elderly patients, which is a significant proportion of the POAG population. Therefore, non-selective beta blockers are contraindicated in patients with respiratory diseases and some cardiac conditions.</li>\r\n<li>Typical first line therapies are prostaglandin analogues and beta-blockers. Prostaglandin analogues are more efficacious and have less systemic side effects. Beta-blockers may be preferred in younger patients due to less local side effects, or in unilateral glaucoma to avoid cosmetically undesirable asymmetrical side-effects (such as lash growth).=</li>\r\n<li>Systemic therapy</li>\r\n<li>Includes acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor given orally or intravenously) and the hyperosmotic agents (glycerin, mannitol). Oral beta-blockers lower IOP, though are not used for this indication. However, it is important to appreciate that a patient taking an oral beta-blocker, for hypertension for example, may have masked ocular hypertension. Furthermore, there may be little additional benefit in prescribing a topical beta-blocker for someone already taking an oral beta-blocker, though this may cause significantly worse side-effects.</li>\r\n<li>Please see section Medical Management for Primary Open Angle Glaucoma for more detailed information.</li>\r\n<li>Medical follow up</li>\r\n<li>Once the diagnosis of POAG has been established, it is important to carefully counsel the patient. They need to be informed of the natural history of the condition,&nbsp; initial asymptomatic presentation of the disease with irreversible visual loss in cases which are not treated or under treated. When starting a topical medication, the patient needs to understand the probability of life-long therapy, potential side-effects, the need to use the drops every day, and the fact that they will not notice any benefit - the treatment is preventative. It is important to teach patients how to administer drops effectively.</li>\r\n<li>It is popular practice to define a target IOP for IOP lowering. This would be based on current evidence, the stage of the patient's POAG and other risk factors for progression. A reasonable initial target is for at least 20%-30% reduction in IOP. A larger reduction may well be needed for patients presenting with advanced disease. AGIS showed reduced risk of progression for patients who's IOPs were consistently below 18 or largely below 15.</li>\r\n<li>First review after commencing a new therapy should occur within 6-8 weeks, though the patient should understand to present sooner if they develop any side-effects. Thereafter, 3-4 monthly review is sufficient if the patient remains stable. At each review, the patient needs the following assessed:</li>\r\n<li>Any subjective change in vision or any side-effects</li>\r\n<li>IOP - is it within target?</li>\r\n<li>Signs of progression - standard automated perimetry, optic disc assessment (clinical +/- HRT, OCT)</li>\r\n<li>If the patient has no side effects, the IOP is within target level and there are no signs of progression, then a routine 3-4 month review can be arranged. If the initial therapy was not at all effective, it should be swapped for an alternative class of drop. If the initial therapy significantly reduced IOP, but not to target level, then an additional drop should be prescribed (or a combination drop used). If there are signs of progression despite target IOP, the target should be lowered further, and the patient more closely followed. If target IOP is not reached despite fully tolerated topical medications, laser or surgical therapy should be considered.</li>\r\n<li>Surgery</li>\r\n<li>Non-medical interventions for POAG include:</li>\r\n<li>Laser trabeculoplasty (see Laser Trabeculoplasty: ALT vs SLT)</li>\r\n<li>Trabeculectomy +/- augmentation (see Trabeculectomy)</li>\r\n<li>Non-penetrating drainage surgery</li>\r\n<li>Shunt procedures (see section Glaucoma Drainage Implant Surgery)</li>\r\n<li>Cyclodestructive procedures (cyclodiode, cyclocryotherapy)</li>\r\n<li>All these therapies aim to lower IOP. Laser trabeculoplasty is a reasonable initial therapy, especially for patients in whom compliance may be an issue. It is particular effective in patients with pigmented drainage angles, though its long term success rate is limited. With the advent of anti-scarring agents (5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C) for augmentation, trabeculectomy remains a successful surgical treatment for POAG. Some studies comparing trabeculectomy to drainage device implantation suggest improved outcomes for drainage devices, though the evidence is still somewhat equivocal and shunt surgery is generally reserved for patients with high risk of failure from trabeculectomy (e.g. previous trabeculectomy, uveitis, aphakia). Non-penetrating drainage surgery is thought to be safer that standard trabeculectomy, but less efficacious in IOP lowering. Cyclodestructive procedures are generally reserved for eyes in which all other measures have failed, or in eyes with poor visual potential. This is due to the risk of long-term hypotony.</li>\r\n<li>Surgical follow up</li>\r\n<li>Early surgical follow up is discussed in the individual sections on the surgical procedures. Longer term surgical follow up is similar to the assessment described above under Medical follow up. Essentially, 3-4 month review is sufficient for patients with target IOP and no signs of progression. If target IOP is not reached, or there are signs of progression, further therapy is required.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> First-degree relatives of POAG patients have a higher risk of developing <strong>steroid-induced glaucoma</strong> due to genetic predisposition. However, <strong>trabecular meshwork appears normal on gonioscopy</strong>, and pupil dilation does not exacerbate intraocular pressure in POAG.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>https://eyewiki.aao.org/Primary_Open-Angle_Glaucoma</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Adie tonic pupil, known as Adie's Syndrome or Holmes-Adie Syndrome, is a disorder in which there is parasympathetic denervation of the afflicted pupil resulting in a poor light but better and tonic near constriction. The affected pupil, either unilateral or bilateral typically initially appears abnormally dilated at rest and has poor or sluggish pupillary constriction in bright light. Constriction is typically more notable with the near reaction and typically remains tonically constricted with slow re-dilation with segmental paralysis of the iris sphincter. Patients may also present with decreased deep tendon reflexes in the full Holmes-Adie Syndrome. The entity is named after William John Adie, an Australian neurologist who extensively described the features. However, it may be noted that the tonic pupil was initially described in 1931 nearly synchronously by Adie, Morgan, Symonds, and Holmes in</p>\n<p>Epidemiology</p>\n<p>Adie tonic pupil has a prevalence of 2 per 1000 population and occurs in a 2.6:1 female to male ratio with an average age of onset of 32 years. While 80 percent of Adie tonic pupils are unilateral, bilateral involvement typically has an incidence of 4 percent per year.</p>\n<p>General Pathology</p>\n<p>Damage to the parasympathetic ciliary ganglion may result in a tonic pupil. The parasympathetic fibers of the eye travel with the third cranial nerve to synapse at the ciliary ganglion before innervating the iris and the ciliary body. Typically, there are 30 times the number of axons supplying the ciliary body compared to those for the iris. After damage to the ciliary ganglion occurs, a process known as denervation supersensitivity occurs by which postsynaptic receptors are upregulated to facilitate reinnervation. However, the reinnervation process is often aberrant and fibers intended for the ciliary body may end up targeted to the pupil, a process known as aberrant regeneration. As a result, patients develop Light-Near dissociation of the pupil by which the near accommodation produces more miosis compared to response to light, the reaction which is tonic. The tonic reaction is the result of the iris sphincter supersensitivity to acetylcholine. Roughly 80% of cases are unilateral but can become bilateral (4% chance per year).</p>\n<p>Causes</p>\n<p>Most cases of the tonic pupil are idiopathic and referred to as the Adie tonic pupil. However, a tonic pupil can also be caused by viral infection, trauma, vasospasm due to migraine, ocular surgery, and tumors, among other potential causes. The ciliary ganglion can also be affected in other systemic autonomic or peripheral neuropathies to result in the tonic pupil such as Ross syndrome and Harlequin syndrome</p>\n<p>Diagnosis</p>\n<p>Exam</p>\n<p>Typical patients with Adie tonic pupil present with incidental finding of anisocoria. Initially, the tonic pupil appears larger than the unaffected eye. However, it is important to note that the affected pupil tends to become smaller over time in the chronic Adie tonic pupil. Slit lamp examination of the pupil often shows sectoral palsy of the iris sphincter, with vermiform movements of the pupillary margin (AAO, 4). To correctly form a diagnosis, it is important to examine the degree of anisocoria in the light and in the dark and to examine the pupillary reaction to light and to accommodation. Examination reveals anisocoria greater in the light compared to in the dark indicating dysfunction of the parasympathetically innervated iris sphincter muscle in the affected eye (large pupil is abnormal). Upon initial exam, patients with Adie tonic pupil will demonstrate increased pupillary constriction to accommodation compared to light, also known as the light-near dissociation. However, this finding is not specific to Adie tonic pupil and can also be found in patients with bilateral anterior afferent visual pathway disease, Argyll Robertson pupil, diabetes, or dorsal midbrain lesions. The affected pupil can be distinguished from these other causes by testing the tonicity of the constriction. In Adie tonic pupil, due to the acetylcholine sensitivity developed during the reinnervation process, typically has a strong and tonic pupillary response with a slow and sustained relaxation after constriction compared to the normal eye</p>\n<p>Symptoms</p>\n<p>Patients with Adie tonic pupil may present with symptoms relating to their sphincter dysfunction such as ranging from photophobia and difficulty to adapting to the dark. Ciliary muscle dysfunction may also present with symptoms of blurry vision both for near and far vision and during transitions and anisocoria.</p>\n<p>Diagnostic procedures</p>\n<p>The denervated sphincter muscles can show increased sensitivity to diluted pilocarpine (0.125%) due to up regulation of receptors in about 80% of cases. Dilute pilocarpine (0.125 or 0.1 percent) can be made by diluting readily available commercial 1% solution with sterile saline. After 30-60 minutes the affected pupil will constrict more than the normal pupil. This test, however, is not specific for the Adie tonic pupil where there is postganglionic parasympathetic denervation. Supersensitivity has also been demonstrated in some preganglionic oculomotor nerve disorders. Absent supersensitivity does not necessarily rule out diagnosis of Adie tonic pupil especially if it is in the acute setting as regeneration of nerves may not have yet occurred.</p>\n<p>Differential diagnosis and additional tests</p>\n<p>Adie tonic pupil is most commonly an idiopathic condition. It is important when faced with a picture of anisocoria, tonic pupil, or light-near dissociation to rule out other potentially more serious diagnoses::</p>\n<p>Orbital trauma</p>\n<p>Orbital tumor</p>\n<p>Intracranial hemorrhage/stroke with third nerve palsy</p>\n<p>Varicella-zoster infection (ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve)</p>\n<p>Syphilis (Argyll Robertson pupil, generally bilateral, small, brisk redilation)</p>\n<p>Miller Fisher syndrome</p>\n<p>Charcot Marie Tooth disease</p>\n<p>Systemic dysautonomia (Ross syndrome)</p>\n<p>Diabetes</p>\n<p>Chronic alcoholism</p>\n<p>Multiple sclerosis</p>\n<p>Herpes zoster</p>\n<p>Neurosarcoidosis</p>\n<p>When considering these additional potential diagnoses, it may be valuable to obtain syphilis serologies and check for history of diabetes, trauma, neurologic diseases</p>\n<p>Management</p>\n<p>Treatment and Prognosis</p>\n<p>The Adie tonic pupil is a benign condition and generally patients only require reassurance. However, patients may experience photophobia and blurry vision. Accommodative paresis may resolve with time, ranging from months to years. However, patients may experience increased light-near dissociation over time since the pupil's reaction to light does not typically recover (UpToDate, Lee, 5) While in general treatment is not required for Adie tonic pupil, dilute topical pilocarpine or physostigmine can be used for symptomatic relief in cases with severe photophobia. It must be noted that these medications can precipitate ciliary spasm, brow ache, worsen anisocoria, or induce nearsightedness. In patients with persistent accommodative paresis, frosted bifocal segments may be used to correct for vision. If an underlying systemic cause for the tonic pupil is suspected, patients should have treatment directed towards their systemic neuropathies.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The causes of a <strong>dilated pupil</strong> can be differentiated using <strong>pilocarpine testing</strong>-<strong>0.1% pilocarpine</strong> is used to confirm <strong>Adie's tonic pupil</strong> due to denervation hypersensitivity. Other pharmacologic agents like <strong>phenylephrine, cocaine, and epinephrine</strong> help distinguish between different causes of anisocoria, but <strong>pilocarpine remains key for diagnosing parasympathetic dysfunction.</strong></p>\n<p>https://eyewiki.org/Adie_Pupil</p>",
