      "solution": "<p>Capsulorhexis or capsulorrhexis, and the commonly used technique known as continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC), is a surgical technique used to remove the central anterior part of the capsule of the lens from the eye during cataract surgery by shear and tensile forces. It generally refers to removal of the central part of the anterior lens capsule, but in situations like a developmental cataract a part of the posterior capsule is also removed by a similar technique.</p>\n<p>In order to remove a cataract by extracapsular techniques, the capsule of the lens must be opened. In earlier intracapsular cataract extraction, the whole lens and capsule was removed at the same time. This was done to prevent the inflammatory response to leftover lens material. Since it was all removed en-bloc, there was no residual lens material. With effective aspiration practically all the material can be removed while leaving the posterior capsule intact. This provides a barrier between the front and back chambers of the eye, and prevents the vitreous from moving forwards. It also provides the artificial intraocular lens with the ideal place to be located in the eye, away from contact with other structures yet securely held in place.</p>\n<p>Prior to the advent of the CCC, a \"can opener\" approach was used for capsulorhexis, with a small bent needle making small incisions around the anterior surface of the lens, forming a roughly continuous cut hole in the capsule that the lens could be removed through. However, the ragged edges were stress raisers and could promote a tear that could proceed outwards. A CCC when done correctly, does not have any edge notches, and forces applied to the capsule during surgery are better distributed and less likely to result in a tear.</p>\n<p>The usual method is to use the same bent needle to begin a tear in the capsule, and then guide the edge of the tear around the anterior surface with either the same needle or Utratas forceps. There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches, and most surgeons will use both instruments as the situation requires.</p>\n<p>In children younger than 7 years, in addition to the anterior capsulorhexis, a posterior capsulorhex is commonly made, since the posterior capsule becomes cloudy even more commonly in children than adults. Since a simple office procedure using a Nd:YAG laser commonly performed on adults is difficult with a child (since they cannot sit still at the machine), it is better to deal with the posterior capsule at the time of surgery. Since the vitreous in children is much more stable, the loss of vitreous is less common (since as a solid it stays put), though often an anterior vitrectomy is still performed.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Lens Aspiration</strong> - This step involves removing the cataractous lens material after capsulorhexis, typically done using phacoemulsification or manual aspiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C: Hydrodissection</strong> - This is performed after capsulorhexis, where fluid is injected between the lens nucleus and capsule to separate them for easier removal.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: IOL Implantation</strong> - Intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is the final step, where an artificial lens is placed inside the intact capsular bag after cataract removal.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>Capsulorhexis is the <strong>first crucial step in extracapsular cataract extraction</strong>, allowing safe removal of the lens while preserving the posterior capsule for IOL implantation. A well-executed CCC minimizes the risk of complications.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsulorhexis\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsulorhexis</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an ongoing global health crisis that is caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of March 12, 2022, there have been over 450 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 6 million deaths around the world. Although most research and therapeutic efforts are directed toward the respiratory complications of the disease, COVID-19 can also lead to significant ophthalmic manifestations. The most commonly reported of these is conjunctivitis, which in some patients may be the only manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While eyelid, ocular surface, and anterior segment manifestations of COVID-19 are well documented, posterior segment involvement is less common and has mainly been described in the form of case reports. In this article, we will provide an overview of the most commonly reported retinal manifestations of COVID-19.</p>\n<p><strong>Retinal Manifestations of COVID-19</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Microvascular Changes</strong></p>\n<p>The most common retinal manifestations of COVID-19 are microvascular changes like cotton wool spots and retinal microhemorrhages. Many of these patients had preserved visual acuity and pupillary reflexes, but there have also been instances where patients developed visual field defects. The SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been associated with new-onset paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) and acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN), although a true relationship between these conditions and COVID-19 is yet to be established. Increased tortuosity of retinal vessels is another finding that has been documented in patients with COVID-19. However, many of these retinal findings can also be seen in septic patients and patients with conditions like diabetic retinopathy, making it difficult to establish a true causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and microvascular retinal changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Retinal Vein Occlusion</strong></p>\n<p>Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) has been identified as an important complication of COVID-19, as early detection and treatment are necessary for improved prognosis. SARS-CoV-2 infection is known to cause endothelial disruption, complement activation, and inflammation, leading to a hypercoagulable state that increases the risk of thrombus formation. Decreased vision and blurred vision are the most common presenting symptoms of CRVO and can start anytime from 5 days to 6 weeks after the initial onset of fever. Although CRVO is classically associated with risk factors like age, hypertension, glaucoma, and diabetes, COVID-19 may be associated with CRVO irrespective of patient age or comorbidities. Because timely diagnosis and management are crucial for vision preservation, clinicians should be vigilant about monitoring for signs of CRVO in patients with a history of COVID-19.</p>\n<p><strong>Retinal Artery Occlusion</strong></p>\n<p>Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a medical emergency that can lead to complete vision loss if not treated promptly and has also been documented in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In case reports, patients developed sudden, unilateral, and painless vision loss two to six weeks after the initial onset of COVID-19 symptoms and were found to have mild-to-significant retinal whitening on fundus exam. However, it is important to note that most of these patients had additional underlying conditions like hypertension, obesity, and coronary artery disease, which may have placed them at a higher risk of developing CRAO. Regardless, because rapid identification and treatment are necessary to restore visual acuity, clinicians should consider CRAO in patients with a history of COVID-19 who present with sudden and painless vision loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Acute Macular neuroretinopathy</strong></p>\n<p>Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy is a rare condition marked by a wedge-shaped reddish-brown lesion reaching toward the fovea and resulting in a rapid onset of one or more paracentral scotomas. There are reports of a surge in the incidence of AMN during the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, AMN was detected as the first sign of COVID-19 infection who later developed fever and cough while testing positive for COVID-19. Etiology is unconfirmed. One theory is that microvascular ischemia of the choriocapillaris leads to hypoxic insult to the middle and outer retinal layers. This mechanism is particularly pertinent to recent reports of microthrombi found in patients with COVID-19.</p>\n<p><strong>Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy (PAMM)</strong></p>\n<p>Paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) is an optical coherence tomography (OCT) finding characterized by the parafoveal hyper-reflective band at the level of the inner nuclear layer (INL). Although the exact etiopathogenesis of PAMM is not understood completely, ischemia of the retinal intermediate and deep capillary plexus has been shown to have a significant role. It is critical for physicians to recognize the signs and symptoms for an accurate diagnosis to ensure work-up. Optical coherence tomography angiography shows perivascular hyper-reflectivity and hyper-reflective spots in the retinal deep capillary layer.</p>\n<p><strong>Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR)</strong></p>\n<p>COVID-19 infection could be established as a risk factor for the development of CSCR, although the relationship remains ambiguous. A proposed mechanism can be mediated by the proven link between COVID-19 and the activation of the sympathetic system leading to choroidal leak and predisposing to CSCR. Such patients usually presented with a sudden blurring of vision in one eye, symptoms started 2 weeks to several months following COVID-19 infection. The diagnosis was confirmed using OCT. Most of the cases resolved spontaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Fungal endogenous endophthalmitis (EE)</strong></p>\n<p>Various hypotheses have been put forward to the sudden surge of endogenous endophthalmitis cases in COVID-19 patients. Many of the patients had diabetes and required a high dose of systemic corticosteroid and/or further immunomodulation to combat the \"cytokine storm\". Thus, a state of immunosuppression and the presence of systemic comorbidity were the prime suspects in such patients with EE. A decrease in the peripheral distribution of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells has been reported in COVID-19 patients. Diagnosis of fungal EE requires a high index of suspicion. Irrespective of immune status, the ophthalmologist should investigate and explore the possibilities of dissemination of fungus in the bloodstream of patients with fungal EE. The contaminated intravenous fluid remains an important source of fungal EE in India. Microbiological investigation of the vitreous aspirates showed Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, and Mucor. Timely diagnosis and management with intravitreal antifungals could salvage the eye in such patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Candida retinitis</strong></p>\n<p>Candida retinitis has been reported after COVID-19. Its diagnosis can be challenging in the initial stage with only chorioretinal involvement. Best-corrected visual acuity in such patients can be as bad as counting fingers close to face. Fundus examination may reveal clear vitreous, with multiple, yellowish-white, fluffy lesions, predominantly across the posterior pole. The foveal center can also be involved with the retinitis lesion. The diagnosis was confirmed by vitreous tap and blood culture. Intravitreal Voriconazole injection (100 micrograms in 0.1 ml) was given in most of the cases. Retinitis lesions and choroidals had regressed significantly and OCT showed regression of lesions. For this reason, candidemia should prompt a thorough evaluation of patients including an ophthalmologic exam.</p>\n<p>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Retinal vein occlusion:</strong> While central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) has been reported in COVID-19 patients due to the hypercoagulable state induced by the virus, it is not the most common ocular manifestation. CRVO usually presents with sudden, painless vision loss rather than conjunctival symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Viral kerato-conjunctivitis:</strong> Although COVID-19 can cause viral conjunctivitis, it more commonly presents as <strong>follicular conjunctivitis</strong> rather than kerato-conjunctivitis. The latter is more commonly associated with adenoviral infections rather than SARS-CoV-2.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: Pseudomonas conjunctivitis:</strong> Pseudomonas infections typically cause a <strong>severe, purulent conjunctivitis </strong>associated with contact lens use or corneal trauma. It is a bacterial infection and is not a common manifestation of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaway:</p>\n<p>COVID-19 can present with ocular manifestations, with <strong>follicular conjunctivitis</strong> being the most frequently reported. While retinal vascular complications like CRVO and CRAO are associated with COVID-19, they are less common than conjunctival involvement. Recognizing these symptoms is crucial for early identification and infection control.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\"https://eyewiki.aao.org/Retinal_Manifestations_of_Covid_19\">https://eyewiki.aao.org/Retinal_Manifestations_of_Covid_19</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>vossius ring is a well-circumscribed complete or incomplete ring of pigment deposition on the anterior lens capsule surface, usually as a result of significant blunt eye trauma. The disease was first described by Vossius in 1903, at which time he discussed both a pigmented variety of the ring and a non-pigmented variety that he thought was the result of degeneration of anterior lens epithelial cells. The non-pigmented form is no longer considered to be a Vossius ring.</p>\n<p><strong>Etiology</strong></p>\n<p>A Vossius ring is a result of compression of the pigmented posterior iris epithelial cells and/or pupillary ruff against the anterior lens capsule with abrupt blunt force to the eye. Rupture of the cells causes deposition of a circular line of melanin pigment on the lens capsule. The ring of pigment is generally the same diameter as the undilated pupil. Interestingly, when evaluating a series of injured combat soldiers who sustained injury at various times of day and night, Gunderson noted in 1945 that the rings were of fairly uniform in size despite variable pupil size at the time of injury. Although his measurement system was relatively crude (a transparent ruler held close to the cornea while looking through a direct ophthalmoscope with +8.00 sphere), the rings in all of his patients were a consistent 2.25 to 2.75 mm in diameter.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\n<p>The major risk factor for Vossius ring formation is sudden, blunt trauma to the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>General Pathology</strong></p>\n<p>Deposition of melanin and cellular debris, from ruptured iris epithelial cells in a concentric ring on the anterior lens capsule.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></p>\n<p>Compression of pigmented iris epithelium and/or pupillary ruff cells during blunt compression of the eye results in cellular rupture with deposition of cellular contents and melanin pigment onto the lens capsule surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Diagnosis is made at the slit lamp by observing a complete or incomplete ring of pigment on the anterior lens capsule. The ring is seen most easily with a dilated pupil.</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p>A history of blunt eye trauma is critical to making this diagnosis. The shortest interval between injury and appearance of a Vossius ring was two hours, but typically it is not observed until four or more days post injury</p>\n<p>Previously, there was some debate as to the origin of the pigment. Some authors believed that the pigment was a result of hemoglobin deposition on the lens surface as hyphema and vitreous hemorrhage were frequently associated with the condition. These theories are no longer widely accepted as Vossius rings are known to form without hemorrhage, and a Vossius ring does not form after an atraumatic vitreous hemorrhage.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs</strong></p>\n<p>A thin, circular line of pigment on the lens capsule is observed. The circle may be incomplete depending on the vector of the blunt trauma.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>A Vossius ring is asymptomatic and generally will improve or resolve with time.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>The diagnosis is made by clinical examination only.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnostic procedures</strong></p>\n<p>Dilation can assist in making the diagnosis. Generally, no other procedures are necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Laboratory test</strong></p>\n<p>No laboratory tests are typically indicated in the evaluation of a Vossius ring.</p>\n<p><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Anterior lens capsule pigment deposition can be observed in other conditions without a history of trauma and can mimic the appearance of a Vossius ring. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXS) is characterized by a defect in the LOXL-1 gene at locus 15q22, which results in deposition of fibrillar, exfoliative material on the pupillary margin, lens capsule and zonules. The fibrillar material can be differentiated from Vossius ring by absence of trauma by history as well as lack of pigmentation. Additionally, pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is characterized by release of pigment granules by the iris pigment epithelium. The granules distribute throughout the anterior segment including the lens surface where they can form a ring of posterior pigment peripherally known as a Scheie stripe or line. Location of the line, iris transillumination defects and increased pigment on other anterior segment structures differentiates PDS from Vossius ring.</p>\n<p>Uveitis is another well-known cause of pigment deposition on the lens surface. Intraocular inflammation can result in formation of posterior synechiae. With resolution of inflammation or pharmacologic mydriasis, the synechiae can leave patchy clumps and fragments of pigment on the anterior lens capsule. Uveitis can be distinguished from Vossius ring based on history and presence of other ocular signs of inflammation including cell and flare in the anterior chamber, hypopyon, keratic precipitates, presence of systemic inflammatory disease, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong></p>\n<p>No medical or surgical treatment is necessary for a Vossius ring, which is usually of little clinical significance but can be an important diagnostic tool if history of blunt trauma is in question</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(Option A) Kayser-Fleischer Ring:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Found in <strong>Wilson's disease</strong>, caused by <strong>copper deposition</strong> in <strong>Descemet's membrane of the cornea</strong>, not the lens.</li>\n<li>It appears as a <strong>golden-brown</strong> ring around the cornea, unlike the <strong>pigmented ring on the anterior lens capsule</strong> seen in a Vossius ring.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>(Option C) Fleischer's Ring:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seen in <strong>Keratoconus</strong>, due to <strong>iron deposition</strong> at the base of the cone-shaped cornea.</li>\n<li>It is a <strong>brownish ring</strong> located in the <strong>corneal epithelium</strong>, not on the lens.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>(Option D) Weiss Ring:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seen in <strong>posterior vitreous detachment (PVD)</strong>.</li>\n<li>It is a <strong>circular, white or grayish floater</strong>, representing <strong>detachment of the vitreous from the optic nerve head</strong>.</li>\n<li>Unlike the Vossius ring, it is <strong>not attached to the lens and is visible in the vitreous cavity</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vossius ring</strong> is caused by <strong>blunt trauma</strong> and results in <strong>pigment deposition</strong> on the <strong>anterior lens capsule</strong>.</li>\n<li>It is <strong>asymptomatic</strong> and <strong>requires no treatment</strong> as it <strong>fades over time</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Other rings (Kayser-Fleischer, Fleischer, Weiss)</strong> are <strong>not related to trauma</strong> and occur in different conditions affecting the <strong>cornea or vitreous</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Diagnosis</strong> is made using a <strong>slit lamp examination</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\"https://eyewiki.aao.org/Vossius_Ring\">https://eyewiki.aao.org/Vossius_Ring</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Vossius ring is a well-circumscribed complete or incomplete ring of pigment deposition on the anterior lens capsule surface, usually as a result of significant blunt eye trauma. The disease was first described by Vossius in 1903, at which time he discussed both a pigmented variety of the ring and a non-pigmented variety that he thought was the result of degeneration of anterior lens epithelial cells. The non-pigmented form is no longer considered to be a Vossius ring.</p>\n<p><strong>Etiology</strong></p>\n<p>A Vossius ring is a result of compression of the pigmented posterior iris epithelial cells and/or pupillary ruff against the anterior lens capsule with abrupt blunt force to the eye. Rupture of the cells causes deposition of a circular line of melanin pigment on the lens capsule. The ring of pigment is generally the same diameter as the undilated pupil. Interestingly, when evaluating a series of injured combat soldiers who sustained injury at various times of day and night, Gunderson noted in 1945 that the rings were of fairly uniform in size despite variable pupil size at the time of injury. Although his measurement system was relatively crude (a transparent ruler held close to the cornea while looking through a direct ophthalmoscope with +8.00 sphere), the rings in all of his patients were a consistent 2.25 to 2.75 mm in diameter.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\n<p>The major risk factor for Vossius ring formation is sudden, blunt trauma to the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>General Pathology</strong></p>\n<p>Deposition of melanin and cellular debris, from ruptured iris epithelial cells in a concentric ring on the anterior lens capsule.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></p>\n<p>Compression of pigmented iris epithelium and/or pupillary ruff cells during blunt compression of the eye results in cellular rupture with deposition of cellular contents and melanin pigment onto the lens capsule surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Diagnosis is made at the slit lamp by observing a complete or incomplete ring of pigment on the anterior lens capsule. The ring is seen most easily with a dilated pupil.</p>\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\n<p>A history of blunt eye trauma is critical to making this diagnosis. The shortest interval between injury and appearance of a Vossius ring was two hours, but typically it is not observed until four or more days post injury</p>\n<p>Previously, there was some debate as to the origin of the pigment. Some authors believed that the pigment was a result of hemoglobin deposition on the lens surface as hyphema and vitreous hemorrhage were frequently associated with the condition. These theories are no longer widely accepted as Vossius rings are known to form without hemorrhage, and a Vossius ring does not form after an atraumatic vitreous hemorrhage.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs</strong></p>\n<p>A thin, circular line of pigment on the lens capsule is observed. The circle may be incomplete depending on the vector of the blunt trauma.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>A Vossius ring is asymptomatic and generally will improve or resolve with time.</p>\n<p><strong>Clinical diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>The diagnosis is made by clinical examination only.</p>\n<p><strong>Diagnostic procedures</strong></p>\n<p>Dilation can assist in making the diagnosis. Generally, no other procedures are necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Laboratory test</strong></p>\n<p>No laboratory tests are typically indicated in the evaluation of a Vossius ring.</p>\n<p><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>Anterior lens capsule pigment deposition can be observed in other conditions without a history of trauma and can mimic the appearance of a Vossius ring. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXS) is characterized by a defect in the LOXL-1 gene at locus 15q22, which results in deposition of fibrillar, exfoliative material on the pupillary margin, lens capsule and zonules. The fibrillar material can be differentiated from Vossius ring by absence of trauma by history as well as lack of pigmentation. Additionally, pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is characterized by release of pigment granules by the iris pigment epithelium. The granules distribute throughout the anterior segment including the lens surface where they can form a ring of posterior pigment peripherally known as a Scheie stripe or line. Location of the line, iris transillumination defects and increased pigment on other anterior segment structures differentiates PDS from Vossius ring.</p>\n<p>Uveitis is another well-known cause of pigment deposition on the lens surface. Intraocular inflammation can result in formation of posterior synechiae. With resolution of inflammation or pharmacologic mydriasis, the synechiae can leave patchy clumps and fragments of pigment on the anterior lens capsule. Uveitis can be distinguished from Vossius ring based on history and presence of other ocular signs of inflammation including cell and flare in the anterior chamber, hypopyon, keratic precipitates, presence of systemic inflammatory disease, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Management</strong></p>\n<p>No medical or surgical treatment is necessary for a Vossius ring, which is usually of little clinical significance but can be an important diagnostic tool if history of blunt trauma is in question</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A: History of Antiglaucoma Drugs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Antiglaucoma drugs, such as <strong>prostaglandin analogs</strong>, can cause <strong>iris pigmentation</strong> but do not cause a well-circumscribed ring of pigment on the lens.</li>\n<li><strong>Pilocarpine</strong>, a miotic agent, can lead to anterior subcapsular cataracts but does not cause a Vossius ring.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option C: History of Exposure to Radiation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Radiation exposure can cause <strong>radiation-induced cataracts</strong>, typically <strong>posterior subcapsular opacities</strong>, but it does not lead to <strong>pigment deposition on the anterior lens capsule</strong> like a Vossius ring.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Option D: History of Atopic Dermatitis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Atopic dermatitis is associated with <strong>keratoconus, cataracts (shield cataract), and chronic blepharoconjunctivitis</strong>, but it does not cause a Vossius ring.</li>\n<li><strong>Shield cataracts</strong> present as anterior or posterior subcapsular opacities, <strong>not pigment deposition on the anterior lens capsule</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>Vossius ring</strong> is a pigment ring on the anterior lens capsule caused by <strong>blunt trauma</strong> to the eye.</li>\n<li>It results from <strong>compression of the iris pigment epithelium</strong> against the lens, leading to melanin deposition.</li>\n<li><strong>Diagnosis</strong> is made clinically using a <strong>slit-lamp examination</strong>, especially with pupil dilation.</li>\n<li>It is <strong>asymptomatic</strong> and typically resolves over time without treatment.</li>\n<li>The presence of a Vossius ring is a <strong>clue to previous ocular trauma</strong>, even if the patient does not recall an injury.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\"https://eyewiki.aao.org/Vossius_Ring%5C\">https://eyewiki.aao.org/Vossius_Ring\\</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Diplopia Charting</strong></p>\r\n<p>Diplopia chart is the record of separation of the diplopic or double images in the nine positions of gaze. It can be plotted charted in patients who cooperate and can appreciate the double vision and with incomitant or comitant deviation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The method</strong></p>\r\n<p>The patient should be comfortable with his head erect and should preferably be still throughout the examination. The test is preferably carried out in a dark room. Red glass is put in front of one of the eyes (red in front of right, R for R, is a convention). It is desirable to use Armstrong goggles since these are shaped to fit the orbital margin and therefore patient would be looking only through the colored medium. The examiner holds the torch (vertical source of light) at around 1/2 m or 1 m (It is important to mention the distance on the chart). This source of light could be horizontal if the complaint is of vertical separation of images</p>\r\n<p>The light is held directly in front of the patient at first.</p>\r\n<p>If the patient sees a single image, the examiner must establish whether it is a fused image, if suppression is present or if one image is obscured, for example by the patient's nose bridge. If there is no double vision in the primary position, the position in which double vision appears and is maximal is to be noted.</p>\r\n<p>If the patient notes a double image, the relative position of these images is noted. The light is now carried to the right and then to the other 8 positions of gaze. In each gaze position the patient must be asked whether the images are parallel or tilted; if the torsion is present colored pencils can be given to an observant patient to show the separation in torsion. Also, in each gaze patient should be asked the amount of separation subjectively and its increase in a particular gaze.</p>\r\n<p>Interpretation of a diplopia chart</p>\r\n<p><strong>To interpret the diplopia chart the most important questions are</strong></p>\r\n<p>The position in which diplopia appears</p>\r\n<p>The position in which the separation of the image is the greatest</p>\r\n<p>In the direction of the action of the paralyzed muscle, the double vision or the separation would be greatest because of the underaction of the muscle and overaction of the antagonist muscle and yoke muscle.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Charting</strong></p>\r\n<p>It aids in the diagnosis of ocular motility defects. It measures the deviation and the amount of underaction and overaction of muscles. It is a repeatable and reliable record of the condition and is, therefore, a good way to show improvement or deterioration of the condition.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Chart (principle)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The principle is the foveal projection. The chart is plotted based on Hering's and Sherrington's law of innervation. The dissociation of two eyes is by the means of colors or mirrors (as in Less screen). Now foster torches are used for projection of the target.</p>\r\n<p>There is an illuminated Hess screen on which each target can be lit up in turn and its position indicated by the patient using a linear green light. Less screen used the principle of the mirror.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Chart (method)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The test is performed with each eye fixating in turn. It is done at 50 cms. The patient wears complimentary red and green glasses. The left eye is tested first followed by right eye. The read glasses are placed on the right eye first (Red for right, R for R)</p>\r\n<p><strong>The chart has electronically operated board</strong></p>\r\n<p>with small red lights. The red lights can be illuminated as needed separately. The foster torch is of green light and is in the patient's hand. The patient is asked to place the green light in each of the points on the red light as illuminated on the chart. Next, the goggles are changed and the left eye has red goggles and the eye to be tested is the right eye.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Chart (recording)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The recording, as mentioned above, is done first with the red glass over the red-eye and repeated with red over the left eye. The eye that has the red glass is the fixing eye. The eye with the green glass is the eye being tested. The required points are joined to form an inner and outer square.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Chart (precautions)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The patient's head must remain straight throughout the procedure/ test. Occasionally, it becomes necessary to hold the head in the correct position. The foveae must have a common visual direction</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Chart (indications)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Any patient who complains of double vision should be tested on the Hess chart. Specific indications are</p>\r\n<p>All patients of incomitant strabismus with normal retinal correspondence (NRC).</p>\r\n<p>Patients of esophoria or intermittent Esotropia of divergence weakness type to rule out 6th nerve palsy.</p>\r\n<p>To provide a baseline in conditions likely to develop defective ocular movements like in thyroid-related orbitopathy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Chart (interpretation)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The interpretation of Hess chart is done on basically three broad parts: Position, Size and Measurement, and Shape</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Chart (position)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The basic principle of Hess chart if foveal projection, therefore, the higher field belongs to the higher eye. This is the opposite of diplopia charting where the higher image is of the lower eye. The position of the central dot indicates whether the deviation is in the primary position or not. The position of the central dot is to be seen both fixing the right eye and fixing the left eye.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Chart (size)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The variation in the size of the Hess chart of each eye is due to the Hering's law. The small field belongs to the eye with the primary limitation of movement. Underaction can be seen with the inward movement of the dots and therefore the whole curve. Maximum displacement occurs in the direction of the affected muscle if the patient has presented early before the spread of comitance.</p>\r\n<p>Overaction can be seen by noting the outward displacement of the dots. Maximum displacement occurs in the direction of the main action of the overacting contralateral synergist in the larger field.</p>\r\n<p>Overaction can be seen by noting the outward displacement of the dots. The maximum displacement of the dots occurs in the direction of the main action of the overacting contralateral synergist in the larger field.</p>\r\n<p>If the inward and outward displacement is less marked, secondary underactions and overactions are present as a result of the development of muscle sequel. The outer field should be examined for small underactions and overactions which may not be apparent in the inner field.</p>\r\n<p>A narrow field restricted in opposing directions of movement denotes a mechanical restriction of ocular movement. Equal sized field denote either symmetrical limitation of movement in both eyes or a non-paralytic strabismus</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Chart (Shape and measurements)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Each small square on the grid subtends 50 at the working distance of 50 cm, therefore the amount of deviation can be calculated. In the primary position, the amount could be calculated by fixing either eye by the displacement of the pointer from the center dots. The amount of underaction and overaction can be calculated in the various positions and hence the amount of excursions can also be calculated. Cyclotropia can also be measured in degrees by the torsion placement of the chart. A linear pointer can also be used to calculate the same.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hess Chart (value)</strong></p>\r\n<p>It can be used to assess the progress of the disorder. It helps in finding out whether the underaction in a particular gaze is improving or not. This could help the ophthalmologist in planning the treatment and evaluate the results. However, a Hess chart should not be viewed in isolation; the importance of a good clinical ocular motility examination cannot be understated. Apart from the clinical examination, diplopia charting and binocular visual field testing also help in the better management of the patient.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Option Explanations:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Option A: Snellen Chart</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <strong>Snellen chart</strong> is used for <strong>visual acuity testing</strong>, not for evaluating <strong>ocular motility or strabismus</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>It consists of letters arranged in decreasing sizes to measure central vision at a standard distance (usually <strong>6 meters or 20 feet</strong>).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option B: ETDRS Chart</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <strong>Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart</strong> is used for <strong>accurate visual acuity measurement</strong>, particularly in <strong>research and clinical trials</strong> for diabetic retinopathy and low vision.</li>\r\n<li>It has a <strong>logarithmic progression of letter sizes</strong> and is used at a <strong>4-meter testing distance</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Option D: Pelli-Robson Chart</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <strong>Pelli-Robson chart</strong> is designed for testing <strong>contrast sensitivity</strong>, which is important for detecting conditions like <strong>optic neuritis, cataracts, and early glaucoma</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>It features letters of the same size but <strong>varying contrast levels</strong>, unlike the Hess Chart, which evaluates eye muscle function.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <strong>Hess Chart</strong> is specifically used for assessing <strong>ocular motility defects</strong> by identifying <strong>muscle paresis, overactions, and mechanical restrictions</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>It is different from <strong>visual acuity and contrast sensitivity charts</strong>, which assess different aspects of vision.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Diplopia charting and Hess charting</strong> are complementary tools for diagnosing <strong>ocular misalignments and nerve palsies</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>The Hess Chart helps in <strong>tracking disease progression</strong> and <strong>planning treatment</strong> for strabismus and other motility disorders.</li>\r\n</ul>",

Acute leukaemia is characterized by the replacement of bone marrow with immature (blast) cells. Chronic leukaemia is associated, at least initially, with well-differentiated (mature) leukocytes and occurs almost exclusively in adults. The four major variants of leukaemia are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acute lymphocytic (lymphoblastic) predominantly affects children, in whom there is around a 90% 5-year survival rate.</li>\n<li>Acute myeloid (myeloblastic) is most frequently seen in older adults.</li>\n<li>Chronic lymphocytic has a very chronic course and many patients die from unrelated disease.</li>\n<li>Chronic myelocytic has a progressive clinical course and often a less favourable prognosis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ocular features</strong></p>\n<p>Ocular involvement is more commonly seen in the acute than the chronic forms and virtually any ocular structure may be involved.</p>\n<p>Primary leukaemic infiltration is fairly rare. Secondary changes such as those associated with anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperviscosity and opportunistic infections are more common and include intraocular bleeding, infection and vascular occlusion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fundus</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Retinal haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots are common.</li>\n<li>Roth spots are retinal haemorrhages with white centres, the whitish element is thought to be composed of coagulated fibrin in most cases.

In chronic leukaemia they may give rise to a 'leopard skin' appearance.</li>\n<li>Scattered haemorrhages may occur in patients with thrombocytopenia.</li>\n<li>Optic nerve infiltration may cause swelling and visual loss.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Other features</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Orbital involvement, particularly in children</li>\n<li>Iris thickening, iritis and pseudohypopyon Spontaneous subconjunctival haemorrhage and hyphaema.</li>\n<li>Cranial nerve palsies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option B: HB Estimation</strong> - While anemia is common in leukemia, <strong>HB estimation alone</strong> cannot diagnose leukemia or chloroma.

      "solution": "<p>The parietal lobe is one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex in the brain of mammals. The parietal lobe is positioned above the temporal lobe and behind the frontal lobe and central sulcus.</p>\n<p>The parietal lobe integrates sensory information among various modalities, including spatial sense and navigation (proprioception), the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch in the somatosensory cortex which is just posterior to the central sulcus in the postcentral gyrus, and the dorsal stream of the visual system. The major sensory inputs from the skin (touch, temperature, and pain receptors), relay through the thalamus to the parietal lobe.</p>\n<p>Several areas of the parietal lobe are important in language processing. The somatosensory cortex can be illustrated as a distorted figure - the cortical homunculus (Latin: \"little man\") in which the body parts are rendered according to how much of the somatosensory cortex is devoted to them. The superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule are the primary areas of body or spatial awareness. A lesion commonly in the right superior or inferior parietal lobule leads to hemineglect.</p>\n<p><strong>Functions of the parietal lobe include:</strong></p>\n<p>Two point discrimination - through touch alone without other sensory input (e.g. visual)</p>\n<p>Graphesthesia - recognizing writing on skin by touch alone</p>\n<p>Touch localization (bilateral simultaneous stimulation)</p>\n<p>The parietal lobe plays important roles in integrating sensory information from various parts of the body, knowledge of numbers and their relations, and in the manipulation of objects. Its function also includes processing information relating to the sense of touch. Portions of the parietal lobe are involved with visuospatial processing. Although multisensory in nature, the posterior parietal cortex is often referred to by vision scientists as the dorsal stream of vision (as opposed to the ventral stream in the temporal lobe). This dorsal stream has been called both the \"where\" stream (as in spatial vision) and the \"how\" stream (as in vision for action). The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) receives somatosensory and visual input, which then, through motor signals, controls movement of the arm, hand, and eyes.</p>\n<p>Various studies in the 1990s found that different regions of the posterior parietal cortex in macaques represent different parts of space.</p>\n<p>The lateral intraparietal (LIP) area contains a map of neurons (retinotopically-coded when the eyes are fixed) representing the saliency of spatial locations, and attention to these spatial locations. It can be used by the oculomotor system for targeting eye movements, when appropriate.</p>\n<p>The ventral intraparietal (VIP) area receives input from a number of senses (visual, somatosensory, auditory, and vestibular). Neurons with tactile receptive fields represent space in a head-centered reference frame. The cells with visual receptive fields also fire with head-centered reference frames but possibly also with eye-centered coordinates</p>\n<p>The medial intraparietal (MIP) area neurons encode the location of a reach target in eye-centered coordinates.</p>\n<p>The anterior intraparietal (AIP) area contains neurons responsive to shape, size, and orientation of objects to be grasped as well as for manipulation of the hands themselves, both to viewed and remembered stimuli. The AIP has neurons that are responsible for grasping and manipulating objects through motor and visual inputs. The AIP and ventral premotor together are responsible for visuomotor transformations for actions of the hand.</p>\n<p>More recent fMRI studies have shown that humans have similar functional regions in and around the intraparietal sulcus and parietal-occipital junction. The human \"parietal eye fields\" and \"parietal reach region\", equivalent to LIP and MIP in the monkey, also appear to be organized in gaze-centered coordinates so that their goal-related activity is \"remapped\" when the eyes move.</p>\n<p>Emerging evidence has linked processing in the inferior parietal lobe to declarative memory. Bilateral damage to this brain region does not cause amnesia however the strength of memory is diminished, details of complex events become harder to retrieve, and subjective confidence in memory is very low. This has been interpreted as reflecting either deficits in internal attention, deficits in subjective memory states, or problems with the computation that allows evidence to accumulate, thus allowing decisions to be made about internal representations.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options Explanation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Frontal lobe</strong> - While the frontal lobe is involved in motor planning and voluntary movement control, it is not primarily responsible for hand-eye coordination. The premotor cortex and supplementary motor area contribute to movement initiation but rely on sensory input from the parietal lobe for spatial accuracy.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C: Occipital lobe</strong> - The occipital lobe is primarily responsible for visual processing, but it does not directly mediate hand-eye coordination. It provides visual information that is then integrated by the parietal lobe to guide movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: Optic radiation</strong> - Optic radiation consists of neural pathways that transmit visual information from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. It plays a role in vision but does not mediate coordination between hand and eye movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>parietal lobe</strong> is essential for hand-eye coordination as it integrates visual and somatosensory information to guide movement. The <strong>posterior parietal cortex (PPC)</strong> plays a critical role in spatial awareness and visuomotor transformation, ensuring accurate targeting and execution of actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe</a></p>",

      "solution": "<p>Neonatal conjunctivitis is a form of conjunctivitis (inflammation of the outer eye) which affects newborn babies following birth. It is typically due to neonatal bacterial infection, although can also be non-infectious (e.g. chemical exposure). Infectious neonatal conjunctivitis is typically contracted during vaginal delivery from exposure to bacteria from the birth canal, most commonly Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.</p>\n<p>Antibiotic ointment is typically applied to the newborn's eyes within 1 hour of birth as prevention for gonococcal ophthalmia. This practice is recommended for all newborns and most hospitals in the United States are required by state law to apply eye drops or ointment soon after birth to prevent the disease.</p>\n<p>If left untreated, neonatal conjunctivitis can cause blindness.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>Neonatal conjunctivitis by definition presents during the first month of life. Signs and symptoms include:[citation needed]</p>\n<p>Pain and tenderness in the eyeball</p>\n<p>Conjunctival discharge: purulent, mucoid or mucopurulent (depending on the cause)</p>\n<p>Conjunctival hyperaemia and chemosis, usually also with swelling of the eyelids</p>\n<p>Corneal involvement (rare) may occur in herpes simplex ophthalmia neonatorum</p>\n<p>Time of onset</p>\n<p>Chemical causes: Right after delivery</p>\n<p>Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Delivery of the baby until 5 days after birth (early onset)</p>\n<p>Chlamydia trachomatis: 5 days after birth to 2 weeks (late onset - C. trachomatis has a longer incubation period)</p>\n<p><strong>Complications</strong></p>\n<p>Untreated cases may develop corneal ulceration, which may perforate, resulting in corneal opacification and staphyloma formation.[citation needed]</p>\n<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Non-infectious</strong></p>\n<p>Chemical irritants such as silver nitrate can cause chemical conjunctivitis, usually lasting 2-4 days. Thus, prophylaxis with a 1% silver nitrate solution is no longer in common use. In most countries, neomycin and chloramphenicol eye drops are used, instead. However, newborns can develop neonatal conjunctivitis due to reactions with chemicals in these common eye drops. Additionally, a blocked tear duct may be another noninfectious cause of neonatal conjunctivitis.[citation needed]</p>\n<p><strong>Infectious</strong></p>\n<p>The two most common infectious causes of neonatal conjunctivitis are N. gonorrheae and Chlamydia, typically acquired from the birth canal during delivery. However, other different bacteria and viruses can be the cause, including herpes simplex virus (HSV 2), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.[citation needed]</p>\n<p>Ophthalmia neonatorum due to gonococci (N. gonorrhoeae) typically manifests in the first 5 days after birth and is associated with marked bilateral purulent discharge and local inflammation. In contrast, conjunctivitis secondary to infection with C. trachomatis produces conjunctivitis 3 days to 2 weeks after delivery. The discharge is usually more watery in nature (mucopurulent) and less inflamed. Babies infected with chlamydia may develop pneumonitis (chest infection) at a later stage (range 2-19 weeks after delivery). Infants with chlamydia pneumonitis should be treated with oral erythromycin for 10-14 days.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis is performed after taking swab from the infected conjunctivae</p>\n<p>Prophylaxis needs antenatal, natal, and postnatal care.</p>\n<p>Antenatal measures include thorough care of mother and treatment of genital infections when suspected.</p>\n<p>Natal measures are of utmost importance, as most infection occurs during childbirth. Deliveries should be conducted under hygienic conditions taking all aseptic measures. The newborn baby's closed lids should be thoroughly cleansed and dried.</p>\n<p>If the cause is determined to be due to a blocked tear duct, gentle palpation between the eye and the nasal cavity may be used to clear the tear duct. If the tear duct is not cleared by the time the newborn is 1 year old, surgery may be required.</p>\n<p><strong>Postnatal measures include:</strong></p>\n<p>Use of 1% tetracycline ointment, 0.5% erythromycin ointment, or 1% silver nitrate solution (Crede's method) into the eyes of babies immediately after birth</p>\n<p>Single injection of ceftriaxone IM or IV should be given to infants born to mothers with untreated gonococcal infection.</p>\n<p>Curative treatment as a rule, conjunctival cytology samples and culture sensitivity swabs should be taken before starting treatment.</p>\n<p>Chemical ophthalmia neonatorum is a self-limiting condition and does not require any treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum needs prompt treatment to prevent complications. Topical therapy should include:</strong></p>\n<p>Saline lavage hourly until the discharge is eliminated</p>\n<p>Bacitracin eye ointment four times per day (because of resistant strains, topical penicillin therapy is not reliable, but in cases with proven penicillin susceptibility, penicillin drops 5000 to 10000 units per ml should be instilled every minute for half an hour, every five minutes for next half an hour, and then half-hourly until the infection is controlled.)</p>\n<p>If the cornea is involved, then atropine sulfate ointment should be applied.</p>\n<p>The advice of both the pediatrician and ophthalmologist should be sought for proper management.</p>\n<p>Systemic therapy: Newborns with gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum should be treated for 7 days with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, or crystalline benzyl penicillin.</p>\n<p>Other bacterial ophthalmia neonatorum should be treated by broad-spectrum antibiotics drops and ointment for 2 weeks.</p>\n<p>Neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis caused by C. trachomatis should be treated with oral erythromycin. Topical therapy is not effective and also does not treat the infection of the nasopharynx.</p>\n<p>Herpes simplex conjunctivitis should be treated with intravenous acyclovir for a minimum of 14 days to prevent systemic infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options Explanation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Haemophilus influenzae</strong> - While H. influenzae can cause conjunctivitis and respiratory infections, it is <strong>not a common cause of neonatal conjunctivitis</strong>. It is more frequently associated with childhood conjunctivitis rather than infections in neonates.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C: Streptococcus</strong> - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) can cause neonatal pneumonia and sepsis, but it is a <strong>rare cause of neonatal conjunctivitis</strong>. It usually presents with severe systemic infections rather than isolated conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D: Mycoplasma</strong> - Mycoplasma pneumoniae is <strong>not a typical cause of neonatal conjunctivitis</strong>. It is more commonly associated with <strong>atypical pneumonia in older children and adults</strong> rather than neonates.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></p>\n<p>Chlamydia trachomatis is a <strong>leading cause of neonatal conjunctivitis</strong>, especially when symptoms appear <strong>after 5 days of birth</strong>. It can be associated with <strong>pneumonitis</strong>, leading to <strong>X-ray infiltrates</strong>, making it the most probable infection in this case. <strong>Oral erythromycin</strong> is the treatment of choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_conjunctivitis\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_conjunctivitis</a></p>",
