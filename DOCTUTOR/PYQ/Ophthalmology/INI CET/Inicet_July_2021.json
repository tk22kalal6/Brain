      "solution": "<p>Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy afflicting children. The estimated incidence varies by country from 3.4 to 42.6 cases per million live births. Within the United States, the incidence is 11.8 cases per million live births among children less than 5 years of age, and retinoblastoma represents 6.1% of all cancers in this age group. Retinoblastoma typically affects young children with the highest incidence in patients less than 4 years old. It occurs equally in males and females. On presentation, approximately 60% of cases are unilateral, and the remaining 40% are bilateral. Patients diagnosed with retinoblastoma are categorized by whether the mutation is germline or somatic. Patients with bilateral presentation are presumed to have germline mutations, and although most unilateral cases have somatic mutations, 15% of unilateral cases will still have germline mutations.</p>\n<p>Diagnosis</p>\n<p>Screening</p>\n<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on Red Reflex Examinations in Neonates, Infants, and Children recommends that all neonates, infants, and children should have an examination of the red reflex before discharge from the neonatal nursery and at all subsequent routine health supervision visits. The red reflex test is performed in a dimly lit or dark room with a direct ophthalmoscope or a retinoscope from a distance of about 1-1.5 feet from the patient. Leukocoria (whitening of the red reflex) is the most common presentation of retinoblastoma, and all infants or children with an abnormal red reflex require immediate referral to an ophthalmologist skilled in pediatric examinations.</p>\n<p>Newborn screening is of greatest utility in offspring and siblings of patients with retinoblastoma. Offspring and siblings of affected patients require regular screening examinations in childhood. Genetic counseling for families with known retinoblastoma can help to determine whether other family members are at risk for developing disease.</p>\n<p>Clinical Presentation</p>\n<p>Leukocoria in a retinoblastoma patient. (c) 2014 one.aao.org</p>\n<p>Early diagnosis of retinoblastoma can maximize the patient's visual prognosis as well as survival rate. Retinoblastoma must always be in the differential diagnosis for any child who presents with strabismus, leukocoria, a red eye, or a cellulitis-like picture. Retinoblastoma is the most important differential diagnosis for a child with leukocoria. Leukocoria, or the loss of the red reflex, is secondary to this tumor filling the globe. Strabismus can also be a presenting sign of retinoblastoma so all patients undergoing a strabismus evaluation should also receive a dilated funduscopic examination.</p>\n<p>In rare cases, retinoblastoma can present with pain and inflammation and have a similar presentation to endophthalmitis, uveitis, hemorrhage or preseptal or orbital cellulitis. This more often occurs when the tumor has spread outside the globe, portending a poor prognosis. Retinoblastoma can demonstrate local spread along the optic nerve directly into the orbit. It can also metastasize hematogenously to bone, liver, brain and other organs.</p>\n<p>History</p>\n<p>A careful history of present illness, family history, and thorough ophthalmic examination (as well as appropriate ancillary studies) are critical for prompt diagnosis. The clinician must specifically inquire about a family history of blindness, eye tumors, childhood malignancies, or enucleations. A family history of other cancers such as sarcomas may also be suggestive. The parent should be asked if either leukocoria and/or strabismus have been observed. If known, the duration of time from discovery of the leukocoric reflex to presentation in the ophthalmologist's office should be documented. The results of any ancillary testing done prior to the ophthalmologist's initial consultation with the family should be obtained.</p>\n<p>Physical Examination</p>\n<p>Age-appropriate visual acuity testing should be performed monocularly. External examination should rule out proptosis and signs of orbital cellulitis. Slit lamp examination should look for ciliary injection, pseudohypopyon, iris neovascularization, or signs of secondary glaucoma. The presence or absence of an afferent pupillary defect should be determined. As mentioned earlier, a dilated fundusopic examination is critical. If there is any suspicion for retinoblastoma, the patient should undergo an examination under anesthesia. An examination under anesthesia with careful scleral depression to evaluate the entire retina is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of retinoblastoma as well as to determine the exact location and extent of the tumor(s) and the tumor staging. Photographic documentation for future comparison is recommended. Complete retinal examination of both eyes is necessary to rule out bilateral disease.</p>\n<p>Fundus Examination</p>\n<p>Retinoblastoma classically presents with one or multiple nodular, white or cream-colored masses often associated with increased vascularization. There are two primary clinical patterns of retinoblastoma growth. If the tumor grows anteriorly into the vitreous it is known as an endophytic tumor. This form of retinoblastoma often shows vitreous seeding, which causes vitreous haze and opacities. This can eventually progress to involve the anterior chamber and can cause secondary glaucoma and inflammation. When the tumor shows a growth pattern more posteriorly that extends beneath the retina (subretinal) it is described as an exophytic tumor. These tumors can cause exudative retinal detachments and may be associated with significant subretinal seeding.</p>\n<p>Examination under anesthesia with extended ophthalmoscopy is required for patients with retinoblastoma for diagnosis and staging; retinal photography is also important for documentation, the education of the patient and family, and for future comparison.</p>\n<p>Diagnostic procedures</p>\n<p>Additional testing should include A and B-scan ultrasound. Ultrasound is often useful for diagnosing and characterizing retinoblastoma. The appearance of a hyperechoic intraocular mass with hyper-reflective foci and associated posterior shadowing consistent with calcium is essentially diagnostic for retinoblastoma in a child. It can also help define tumor height and thickness and confirm associated retinal detachment and calcification.</p>\n<p>Though computerized tomography (CT) scan can help demonstrate the presence or absence of calcium deposits and help define the size of the tumor, it should generally be avoided with preference for an MRI when available. CT scan exposes patients with germline mutations to radiation increasing the risk of secondary malignancies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often performed to evaluate optic nerve involvement, extraocular extension, and also to consider for the possibility of concomitant primitive neuroectodermal tumor (trilateral retinoblastoma with pinealoblastoma). As mentioned, MRI is currently the preferred imaging modality for most clinicians because of radiation associated with CT scans. High doses of radiation can be harmful to all young children but especially to this patient population, where heritable and germline retinoblastoma patients are especially at increased risk for secondary tumors. Bone marrow examination or lumbar puncture may also be performed in patients where there is concern regarding the extent of disease, particularly with extraocular extension to rule out cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or bone marrow metastases.</p>\n<p>Differential Diagnosis</p>\n<p>Leukocoria should immediately make the clinician think of retinoblastoma. However, the differential diagnosis includes other entities such as a cataract, Coats' disease, retinopathy of prematurity, toxocariasis, choroidal coloboma, vitreous hemorrhage, myelinated retinal nerve fibers, and other retinal tumors such as astrocytic hamartoma. Corneal opacities can also produce a white reflex but this can be easily differentiated by more thorough clinical exam. Differentiating retinoblastoma from conditions such as Coats' disease, persistent fetal vasculature (PFV), or toxocariasis can be a clinical challenge.</p>\n<p>Coats' disease often has a more yellow appearance with yellow subretinal exudates compared to retinoblastoma. On fluorescein angiography, Coats' has more characteristic telangiectatic and dilated vessels, regions of nonperfusion, and aneurysms with leakage; in contrast, retinoblastoma has less leakage and more often shows irregular perfusion abnormalities consistent with tumor vascular patterns, such as dilated vessels with nonperfusion. In Coats' disease, abnormally dilated, tortuous vessels may be associated with significant exudation causing a mass-like lesion of lipid with associated telangiectatic neovascularization. The exudate in Coats' disease is more yellow than white because of the presence of cholesterol. Furthermore, Coats' disease is typically unilateral and predominantly affects boys between 6 to 8 years of age, which is older than the typical patient with retinoblastoma.</p>\n<p>PFV is a congenital condition, and leukocoria becomes noticed clinically early in life. It is typically a unilateral condition, and eyes tend to be microphthalmic. A cataract is often present and may be associated with elongated ciliary processes. Retinal detachment in PFV is more often tractional and tent shaped whereas retinoblastoma retinal detachments are more likely exudative with subretinal fluid and possible seeds. If present, these features can help differentiate PFV from retinoblastoma.</p>\n<p>Ocular toxocariasis can cause a white, peripheral retinal mass with a similar appearance to retinoblastoma. Toxocariasis is usually unilateral and associated with more signs of inflammation than retinoblastoma such as injection, pain, photophobia, and anterior chamber and/or vitreous cells. Patients should be questioned about contact with puppies and eating dirt. In addition, a history of fever, eosinophilia, pneumonitis or hepatosplenomegaly would be suggestive of systemic manifestations of peripheral larva migrans. Serum titers positive for toxocara canis would further confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>A and B-scan ultrasound is helpful to differentiate retinoblastoma from these conditions. Ultrasonography can detect calcification, which would favor a diagnosis of retinoblastoma. It can identify a retrolental mass and a shorter anterior-posterior dimension compared to the unaffected eye, which would favor PFV. Fluorescein angiography would show dilated vessels in retinoblastoma with variable degrees of nonperfusion and less leakage than Coats'. In contrast, Coats' disease classically shows focal telangiectasias with profuse leakage into the subretinal space.</p>\n<p>Retinoblastoma can appear like several conditions with vitreous seeding being mistaken for inflammation or even Coats' disease. A good rule of thumb is to avoid entering an eye for a biopsy. It is always helpful to have additional opinons.</p>\n<p>Incorrect Options:</p>\n<p><strong>Option A: Lymphatic spread</strong> - The eye lacks lymphatic drainage, making this route of spread <strong>unlikely</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B: Hematogenous spread</strong> - Although retinoblastoma can metastasize via the blood to organs like the <strong>bone marrow, liver, and brain</strong>, it is <strong>less common</strong> than direct spread along the optic nerve.</p>\n<p><strong>Option C: Direct</strong> - While the tumor can invade <strong>locally</strong>, it primarily spreads via the <strong>optic nerve</strong> rather than general direct extension.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaway:</p>\n<p><strong>Retinoblastoma</strong> most commonly spreads <strong>along the optic nerve</strong>, allowing extension into the <strong>brain</strong>. Hematogenous spread is <strong>less common</strong>, and <strong>lymphatic spread</strong> is <strong>rare</strong> due to the absence of lymphatic vessels in the eye.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The goal of treatment in uveitis is to control inflammation in order to prevent vision loss while also limiting the side effects of therapy. Treatments include medical management with ocular or systemic therapy, as well as surgical interventions for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes and for the treatment of complications of uveitis. Treatment strategies depend on the etiology of inflammation and the disease severity and course. If the underlying etiology is infectious, then this must first be treated with appropriate therapy. If the underlying etiology is idiopathic or associated with systemic inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, then a stepladder approach utilizing anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy may be necessary, often times in coordination with other specialists.</p>\n<p>Mydriatic and cycloplegic agents are utilized in uveitis to relieve symptoms of pain and photophobia (by relieving spasm of the ciliary muscle and pupillary spinchter). They are also used to prevent or break posterior synechiae. The choice of agent and frequency of use is tailored to the severity and course of inflammation</p>\n<p>Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</p>\n<p>As a primary treatment modality for ocular inflammatory diseases, NSAIDSs are generally ineffective in both local and systemic formulations; however, an exception might be some cases of non-necrotizing anterior scleritis. NSAIDs might also provide some utility as an adjunct to other forms of therapy, such as the use of topical NSAIDs in the treatment of macular edema. The use of systemic NSAIDs with systemic corticosteroids increases the risk of gastric ulcers; therefore, histamine-H2 receptor antagonists or proton-pump inhibitors should be prescribed to reduce the risk.</p>\n<p>Corticosteroids</p>\n<p>Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment in uveitis and can be administered via multiple routes: topical, local injections (periocular or intraocular), or systemically via oral or intravenous routes.</p>\n<p>Topical Steroids</p>\n<p>Several steroids exist in topical ophthalmic preparations, and each has unique properties that may provide advantages and disadvantages in specific clinical scenarios. Examples include difluprednate, dexamethasone, prednisolone acetate, fluorometholone, and loteprednol</p>\n<p>Local Steroid Injections</p>\n<p>Periocular or intraocular steroid injections through subconjunctival, transseptal, sub-Tenon, or intravitreal routes can be considered in the following clinical scenarios:</p>\n<p>Severe unilateral uveitis</p>\n<p>Uveitis complicated by cystoid macular edema</p>\n<p>To supplement systemic therapy or when systemic therapy is contraindicated</p>\n<p>Poor patient compliance with topical or systemic therapy</p>\n<p>Complications may include subconjunctival or retrobulbar hemorrhage, globe perforation, optic nerve injury, cutaneous changes, orbital fat atrophy, cataract, elevation of intraocular pressure, ptosis, and retinal vascular occlusion.</p>\n<p>Systemic Steroids</p>\n<p>Systemic steroid therapy may be indicated in cases of vision-threatening uveitis, when there is poor response to topical or local steroid therapy, and in cases of bilateral or systemic involvement. Treatment should consist of high dosage initially and then tapering according to clinical effect. In cases of severe uveitis, intravenous methylprednisolone may be considered (typically 1g/day for three days). Initial dosing of oral prednisone is typically 1-1.5 mg/kg/day. Too rapid tapering or early discontinuation of systemic steroids may lead to disease recurrence. If steroid therapy is continued at a dose of more than 7.5mg/day for a duration of more than 3 months, then steroid-sparing agents should be considered. A typically adopted steroid tapering schedule is as follows:</p>\n<p>Immunomodulatory Therapy (IMT)</p>\n<p>An important goal in the treatment of uveitis is to minimize the use of corticosteroids and its myriad ocular and systemic adverse effects. The use of immunomodulatory therapy is an essential treatment strategy in the management of noninfectious uveitis (NIU). The Fundamentals of Care for Uveitis (FOCUS) International Consensus Group of uveitis specialists (both ophthalmologists and rheumatologists) outlined the following indications for noncorticosteroid systemic immunomodulatory therapy (NCSIT):</p>\n<p>Ocular factors such as acute sight-threatening disease, chronic persistent inflammation, exudative retinal detachment, posterior and macular involvement, and binocular sight-threatening disease</p>\n<p>Therapeutic needs such as failure of regional or systemic steroid therapy, high dosage of systemic steroid therapy, relapse after reduction of systemic steroid therapy, and steroid intolerance or need for steroid-sparing effect</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect options explanation : </strong></p>\n<p><strong>(Option B) Beta-blockers:</strong> These are safe and commonly used in uveitic glaucoma. They lower IOP by reducing aqueous humor production without exacerbating inflammation.</p>\n<p><strong>(Option C) Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (CAIs):</strong> These are also safe and effective in uveitic glaucoma. They reduce aqueous production and can be used topically or systemically.</p>\n<p><strong>(Option D) Mannitol:</strong> This is an osmotic agent used in acute IOP spikes and does not worsen inflammation. It helps reduce IOP by drawing fluid out of the eye via osmosis.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaway:</p>\n<p>Prostaglandin analogues should be avoided in uveitic glaucoma due to their pro-inflammatory effects, while beta-blockers, CAIs, and osmotic agents are safer alternatives.</p>\n<p>https://eyewiki.aao.org/Treatment_of_Uveitis</p>",

Azithromycin can be used in children from the age of six months and in pregnancy.

      "solution": "<p>Function of superior colliculus</p>\n<p>In primates, eye movements can be divided into several types: fixation, in which the eyes are directed toward a motionless object, with eye movements only to compensate for movements of the head; smooth pursuit, in which the eyes move steadily to track a moving object; saccades, in which the eyes move very rapidly from one location to another; and vergence, in which the eyes move simultaneously in opposite directions to obtain or maintain single binocular vision. The superior colliculus is involved in all of these, but its role in saccades has been studied most intensively.[citation needed]</p>\n<p>Each of the two colliculi - one on each side of the brain - contains a two-dimensional map representing half of the visual field. The fovea - the region of maximum sensitivity - is represented at the front edge of the map, and the periphery at the back edge. Eye movements are evoked by activity in the deep layers of the SC. During fixation, neurons near the front edge - the foveal zone - are tonically active. During smooth pursuit, neurons a small distance from the front edge are activated, leading to small eye movements. For saccades, neurons are activated in a region that represents the point to which the saccade will be directed. Just prior to a saccade, activity rapidly builds up at the target location and decreases in other parts of the SC. The coding is rather broad, so that for any given saccade the activity profile forms a \"hill\" that encompasses a substantial fraction of the collicular map: The location of the peak of this \"hill\" represents the saccade target.[citation needed]</p>\n<p>The SC encodes the target of a gaze shift, but it does not seem to specify the precise movements needed to get there. The decomposition of a gaze shift into head and eye movements and the precise trajectory of the eye during a saccade depend on integration of collicular and non-collicular signals by downstream motor areas, in ways that are not yet well understood. Regardless of how the movement is evoked or performed, the SC encodes it in \"retinotopic\" coordinates: that is, the location of the SC 'hill\" corresponds to a fixed location on the retina. This seems to contradict the observation that stimulation of a single point on the SC can result in different gaze shift directions, depending on initial eye orientation. However, it has been shown that this is because the retinal location of a stimulus is a non-linear function of target location, eye orientation, and the spherical geometry of the eye.</p>\n<p>There has been some controversy about whether the SC merely commands eye movements, and leaves the execution to other structures, or whether it actively participates in the performance of a saccade. In 1991, Munoz et al., on the basis of data they collected, argued that, during a saccade, the \"hill\" of activity in the SC moves gradually, to reflect the changing offset of the eye from the target location while the saccade is progressing. At present, the predominant view is that, although the \"hill\" does shift slightly during a saccade, it does not shift in the steady and proportionate way that the \"moving hill\" hypothesis predicts. However, moving hills may play another role in the superior colliculus; more recent experiments have demonstrated a continuously moving hill of visual memory activity when the eyes move slowly while a separate saccade target is retained.</p>\n<p>The output from the motor sector of the SC goes to a set of midbrain and brainstem nuclei, which transform the \"place\" code used by the SC into the \"rate\" code used by oculomotor neurons. Eye movements are generated by six muscles, arranged in three orthogonally-aligned pairs. Thus, at the level of the final common path, eye movements are encoded in essentially a Cartesian coordinate system.</p>\n<p>Although the SC receives a strong input directly from the retina, in primates it is largely under the control of the cerebral cortex, which contains several areas that are involved in determining eye movements. The frontal eye fields, a portion of the motor cortex, are involved in triggering intentional saccades, and an adjoining area, the supplementary eye fields, are involved in organizing groups of saccades into sequences. The parietal eye fields, farther back in the brain, are involved mainly in reflexive saccades, made in response to changes in the view. Recent evidence suggests that the primary visual cortex (V1) guides reflexive eye movements, according to V1 Saliency Hypothesis, using a bottom-up saliency map of the visual field generated in V1 from external visual inputs.</p>\n<p>The SC only receives visual inputs in its superficial layers, whereas the deeper layers of the colliculus receive also auditory and somatosensory inputs and are connected to many sensorimotor areas of the brain. The colliculus as a whole is thought to help orient the head and eyes toward something seen and heard.</p>\n<p>The superior colliculus also receives auditory information from the inferior colliculus. This auditory information is integrated with the visual information already present to produce the ventriloquism effect.</p>\n<p>Incorrect Options Explanation:</p>\n<p><strong>Option A : Red nucleus </strong>- Located in the rostral midbrain, the red nucleus is involved in motor coordination and is part of the extrapyramidal system. It does not house the nucleus in question.</p>\n<p><strong>Option B : Inferior olive level </strong>- The inferior olivary nucleus is located in the medulla and is mainly responsible for motor learning and coordination via connections with the cerebellum. It is not at the level of the superior colliculus.</p>\n<p><strong>Option D : Inferior colliculus </strong>- This structure, located in the midbrain, is part of the auditory pathway and processes sound information before relaying it to the thalamus. It is not associated with the nucleus in question.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaway:</p>\n<p>The <strong>superior colliculus</strong> is located in the <strong>midbrain</strong> and is involved in <strong>eye movements and visual reflexes</strong>. It is at the level of the <strong>oculomotor nucleus (CN III)</strong> and plays a crucial role in coordinating vision and movement.</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_colliculus</p>",
