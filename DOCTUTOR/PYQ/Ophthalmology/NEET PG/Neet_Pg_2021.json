      "solution": "<p><strong>Lesions of optic tract</strong></p>\r\n<p>The optic tract is a continuation of the optic nerve that relays information from the optic chiasm to the ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), pretectal nuclei, and superior colliculus. The optic tract represents the first stage in the visual pathway in which visual information is transferred in a homonymous nature. Main characteristic feature of lesion involving whole optic tract is homonymous hemianopsia. A lesion in the left optic tract will cause right-sided homonymous hemianopsia, while a lesion in the right optic tract will cause left-sided homonymous hemianopsia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Causes</strong></p>\r\n<p>The optic tract syndrome is characterized by a contralateral, incongruous homonymous hemianopia, contralateral relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), and optic atrophy due to retrograde axonal degeneration. Causes of optic tract lesions are also classified into intrinsic and extrinsic forms. Intrinsic lesions include demyelinating diseases and infarction. Such lesions produce optic tract syndrome type II. Extrinsic or compressive lesions are caused by pituitary craniopharyngioma, tumours of optic thalamus. Other causes include syphilitic meningitis, gumma and tubercular meningitis etc.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p>Visual field-homonymous hemianopia</p>\r\n<p>Wernicke's pupillary reaction- No pupillary reaction when light shown to the blind half of retina, but if light is shown to seeing half, pupil shows reaction.</p>\r\n<p>A lesion in the <strong>left optic tract</strong> results in <strong>right homonymous hemianopia</strong> (loss of vision in the right halves of both eyes). The optic tract carries visual information from the contralateral visual field, meaning a lesion in the left optic tract will affect the right visual field of both eyes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>(B) Right Occipital Lobe:<br /> </strong>A right occipital lobe lesion can also cause <strong>left homonymous hemianopia</strong>, but <strong>macular sparing</strong> is often present due to dual blood supply from the <strong>posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA)</strong>. Since macular sparing is not mentioned in the question, this is less likely.</li>\r\n<li><strong>(C) Optic Chiasma:<br /> </strong>A lesion at the <strong>optic chiasm</strong> typically causes <strong>bitemporal hemianopia</strong>, affecting the peripheral vision of both eyes. The question specifies vision loss in the <strong>right halves of both eyes</strong>, which rules out this option.</li>\r\n<li><strong>(D) Right Optic Nerve:<br /> </strong>A lesion in the right optic nerve causes <strong>complete vision loss in the right eye</strong>, not in both eyes. Since the patient has vision loss in <strong>both eyes</strong>, this is incorrect.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Homonymous hemianopia (same side field loss in both eyes) = Optic tract or Occipital lobe lesion</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Right homonymous hemianopia = Left optic tract lesion</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Left homonymous hemianopia = Right optic tract lesion</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Bitemporal hemianopia (peripheral vision loss) = Optic chiasm lesion</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Complete vision loss in one eye = Optic nerve lesion</strong></li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>The spherical equivalent is the spherical lens which places any astigmatic eye in a condition of meridional balance. That is, it changes the astigmatism into equally-mixed astigmatism and produces retinal images made up of diffusion circles.</p>\r\n<p>implantable collamer lenses (ICL) are a type of posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens (pIOL). pIOL are usually used for high degrees of refractive error or when corneal refractive surgery is contraindicated. Advantages over corneal refractive surgery also include quicker recovery and reversibility. Posterior chamber pIOL provide a more cosmetically appealing alternative to anterior chamber (AC) pIOL because they are less visible externally and create less risk of endothelial cell loss (ECL) as they are placed further away from the cornea. They are a safer alternative to refractive less exchange which carries a risk of retinal detachment and loss of accommodation. There have been a number of posterior chamber phakic intraocular lenses on the market prior to the development of the implantable collamer lens. These include the Chiron Adatomed pIOL which was a rectangular, silicone plate IOL that was eventually discontinued because of high rates of AC inflammation and cataracts. The PRL Phakic Refractive Lens (CIBA Vision) was another 1-piece pIOL made of hydrophobic silicone elastomer designed so the haptics would rest on the zonules and the lens would float above the natural crystalline lens; however this lens was taken off of the market due to high incidence of subluxation of the lens into the vitreous cavity secondary to zonular dehiscence. Currently there is only one FDA approved posterior chamber pIOL in the US which is the implantable collamer lens (ICL).</p>\r\n<p>The best management for a <strong>15-year-old with myopic astigmatism who refuses to wear glasses</strong> is prescribing <strong>spherical equivalent glasses</strong>. At this age, the <strong>cornea is still developing</strong>, and refractive surgeries like <strong>LASIK, Femto LASIK, or ICL</strong> are not recommended until the refractive error stabilizes (typically after 18-21 years of age). The <strong>spherical equivalent</strong> helps correct vision without requiring astigmatism-specific glasses, making it a more acceptable option for the patient.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>(A) LASIK:<br /> </strong>LASIK (Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis) is a laser refractive surgery used to correct myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. However, it is <strong>not recommended for individuals under 18</strong>, as their refractive error is still changing. Performing LASIK too early can result in <strong>regression of the correction and unpredictable outcomes</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Femto LASIK:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Femto LASIK</strong> is a more advanced version of <strong>LASIK</strong>, using a <strong>femtosecond laser</strong> instead of a microkeratome to create the corneal flap.</li>\r\n<li>Despite being <strong>safer and more precise</strong>, it is still <strong>not advised for individuals under 18 years</strong> due to ongoing <strong>corneal growth and refractive instability</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><strong>(C) ICL (Implantable Collamer Lens):</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>ICL is a <strong>posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens (pIOL)</strong> used for patients with <strong>high refractive errors</strong>or those <strong>unsuitable for LASIK</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>It is <strong>not the first-line treatment</strong> for mild-to-moderate myopic astigmatism and is <strong>not recommended for a 15-year-old</strong> due to the <strong>risk of cataracts, glaucoma, and corneal endothelial damage</strong> over time.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<p>For a <strong>15-year-old with myopic astigmatism</strong>, <strong>spherical equivalent glasses</strong> are the best option because they are <strong>safe, effective, and non-invasive</strong>. <strong>LASIK, Femto LASIK, and ICL are not suitable</strong> at this age due to the <strong>unstable refractive status</strong> and the potential risks associated with <strong>early surgical intervention</strong>.</p>",

Fundoscopy shows tortuosity and dilatation of all branches of the central retinal vein, dot/blot and flame-shaped hemorrhages throughout all four quadrants and most numerous in the periphery, and optic disc and macular edema.

Patients with severe central retinal vein obstruction typically have severe visual loss, usually less than 20/200; a marked afferent pupillary defect; severe tortuosity and engorgement of all branches of the central retinal vein; extensive deep blot and flame-shaped hemorrhages involving the peripheral retina and posterior pole; and severe disc edema and hyperemia.</p>\r\n<p>This may lead to profound vascular leakage, rubeosis iridis and raised intraocular pressure. The prognosis is extremely poor due to macular ischemia. Rubeosis iridis develops in about 50% of eyes, usually between 2 and 4 months (90-day glaucoma), and there is a high risk of neovascular glaucoma. Retinal neovascularization occurs in about 5% of eyes. Where possible, patients with ischemic CRVO should be seen monthly for 6 months to detect the onset of anterior segment neovascularization. Subsequent review should usually be for up to 2 years to detect significant ischemia and macular edema.</p>\r\n<p>Hard exudates are largely made up of extracellular lipid which has leaked from abnormal retinal capillaries, hence there is often associated retinal oedema (which is not visible using direct ophthalmoscopy). The underlying problem is often apparent as the exudates will form a ring or &lsquo;circinate&rsquo; pattern around the leaking vessels (which may be seen as a cluster of microaneurysms).</p>\r\n<p>Hard exudates are found principally in the macular region and as the lipids coalesce and extend into the central macula (fovea), vision can be severely compromised.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>xerophthalmia refers to the spectrum of ocular disease caused by severe Vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Vitamin A serves several essential functions in the eye, and deficiency can lead to a constellation of ocular signs and symptoms that affect the conjunctiva, cornea, and retina. Xerophthalmia continues to be a leading cause of preventable blindness in developing countries. Unfortunately, xerophthalmia signifies a severity of VAD that causes significant morbidity and mortality from malnutrition and increased susceptibility to mucosal infections.</p>\r\n<p>Diagnosis</p>\r\n<p>Clinical Signs</p>\r\n<p>Night blindness (Grade XN): Defective vision in dim light or night blindness is one of the most common manifestations of VAD, especially in children age 2-6 or pregnant or lactating women. Although it is considered one of the earliest manifestations, children with VAD may develop one of the more severe signs, such as corneal ulcers, after infection or diarrhea without any of the classically early signs. Children may not be able to verbalize their symptoms, and parents need to be asked if they have noticed their children behaving differently in the dark, e.g. becoming less active or fearful. Night blindness is considered to be both a sensitive and specific indicator for serum retinol levels.</p>\r\n<p>Conjunctival xerosis (Grade X1A): Conjunctival xerosis is characterized by a dull and dry appearance of the conjunctiva with slight wrinkling. It is caused by the loss of goblet cells and insufficient mucin secretion, and it can be subtle and difficult to detect clinically.</p>\r\n<p>Bitot spots (Grade X1B): Bitot spots are collections of desquamated, keratinized epithelial cells mixed with the gas-forming bacteria Corynebacterium xerosis. They appear as triangular patches of foamy, whitish, opaque deposits, typically located on the bulbar conjunctiva near the limbus at the 3 and 9 o&rsquo;clock positions. They are more common temporally.</p>\r\n<p>Severe corneal xerosis progressing to keratomalacia. Credit: EyeRounds.org, The University of Iowa. Reprinted without modification from an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.</p>\r\n<p>Corneal xerosis (Grade X2): Conjunctival xerosis is characterized by a dull and hazy appearance of the cornea that is caused by drying of the cornea secondary to conjunctival gland dysfunction. It may initially present with bilateral punctate corneal epithelial erosions, and it can quickly progress to the stage of corneal ulceration. Up to this stage, high-dose Vitamin A supplementation can result in the full preservation of vision.</p>\r\n<p>Corneal ulceration (Grade X3A and B): Corneal xerosis can lead corneal ulceration and melting if not treated urgently. Keratomalacia, the melting away of the cornea by liquefactive necrosis, is the most severe form of xerophthalmia. It can perforate and destroy the cornea in just a matter of days. A child who appears relatively healthy but develops keratomalacia should be questioned about a recent history of measles or diarrhea, which could rapidly deplete already deficient vitamin A stores.</p>\r\n<p>Corneal scar (Grade XS): Corneal scarring due to VAD is often symmetric and bilateral. Other causes of corneal scarring must be ruled out.</p>\r\n<p>Xerophthalmic fundus (Grade XF): prolonged VAD can lead to structural changes in the retina. Fundus changes appear as small, white, deep retinal lesions scattered throughout the posterior pole.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Exposure keratopathy (EK) is damage to the cornea that occurs primarily from prolonged exposure of the ocular surface to the outside environment. EK can lead to ulceration, microbial keratitis, and permanent vision loss from scarring.</p>\r\n<p>Under normal circumstances, the eyelids and tear film protect the cornea, an avascular, nonkeratinized epithelium, from trauma, desiccation, and microbial attack. The tear film, a composite fluid of three layers, has several important roles: it nourishes and lubricates the cornea, aids in crisp visual acuity, and protects the cornea from bacterial invasion (Figure 1). Several factors help maintain an adequate distribution of the tear film; these include an intact blink reflex, normal blink rate, and complete eyelid closure during sleep and blinking. Disruption to this system may lead to an epithelial defect. The corneal epithelium serves as a barrier to the outside world through the use of tight junctions and damage to the integrity of this structure can facilitate penetration of microbes and external debris.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p>\r\n<p>Patients at risk for EK include those who suffer from conditions that interfere with the ability to protect the cornea such asincomplete eyelid closure, inadequate blink reflex, inadequate blink rate and/or decreased protective lubrication of the cornea. A summary of risk factors and conditions is listed below.</p>\r\n<p>Lagophthalmos</p>\r\n<p>Lagophthalmos is the inability to close the eyelids completely. Because of this, a portion of the eye remains open during a blink and during sleep, and is subject to damage from exposure. The etiologies of lagophthalmos can be divided into the following subcategories:</p>\r\n<p>Facial nerve dysfunction (paralytic lagophthalmos)</p>\r\n<p>Eyelid dysfunction</p>\r\n<p>Excessive scar tissue or excessive eyelid removal during surgery (cicatricial lagophthalmos)</p>\r\n<p>Physiologic lagophthalmos (as in the case of nocturnal lagophthalmos).</p>\r\n<p>Medication effect (particularly sedatives or neuromuscular blockers)</p>\r\n<p>Paralytic lagophthalmos is most commonly due to facial nerve dysfunction. The facial nerve (CN VII) controls most of the eyelid muscles, and facial nerve dysfunction will therefore lead to weakened eyelid closure (Figure 2). It can be damaged by trauma, cerebrovascular accidents, Bell&rsquo;s palsy, tumors, infections, immune-mediated causes, and congenital cranial dysinnervation syndromes. Trauma, can be secondary to fractures to the skull base or mandible, or from surgery (particularly neurosurgery). Additionally, the facial nerve is supplied by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and as such may be susceptible to cerebrovascular accidents. Bell&rsquo;s palsy is a type of facial paralysis that results in a weakness of facial muscles on one side of the face. It holds its own host of possible causes, most notably, reactivation of herpes simplex virus. Other infectious causes of Bell&rsquo;s palsy include Lyme disease, varicella, mumps, poliomyelitis, Guillaine-Barr&eacute; syndrome, leprosy, diphtheria, and botulism. Tumors that have the potential to cause facial nerve dysfunction include acoustic neuromas in the cerebellopontine angle as well as metastases. Lastly, cranial dysinnervation syndromes, such as Mobius&rsquo; syndrome and congenital facial palsy, are characterized by facial nerve dysfunction and subsequent lagophthalmos.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Proptosis</strong>, a term commonly interchanged with exophthalmos, is anterior displacement of the eyeball with respect to the orbit. This protrusion of the eyeball may be so great as to disrupt normal eyelid closure. Conditions that are associated with proptosis include craniosynostosis syndromes, thyroid disease, orbital tumors and Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome. Patients with pulsatile exophthalmos syndromes may also present with EK; such patients may include those with aortic regurgitation, neurofibromatosis 1, carotid-cavernous sinus fistulae, arachnoid cysts, and trauma.</p>\r\n<p>Thyroid eye disease warrants special mention as it is one of the leading causes of EK (Figure 3). Thyroid eye disease can cause proptosis of the orbit, eyelid retraction, and chemosis. Proptosis occurs secondary to increased volume behind the orbit due to cellular proliferation, inflammation, and accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the eye muscles and retroorbital adipose and connective tissues. Additionally, patients with thyroid disease may have eyelid retraction as well as periorbital edema secondary to decreased venous drainage from the congested orbital space. Both of these factors contribute to incomplete eyelid closure and increase the risk for EK. Additionally, patients with thyroid dysfunction may suffer from corneal nerve dysfunction and subsequent malfunctioning of the blink reflex, further increasing the risk of EK. Grave&rsquo;s disease is an autoimmune disease that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism). Although thyroid eye disease is traditionally associated with Graves&rsquo; disease, it is also occasionally seen in euthyroid patients and in patients with hypothyroid chronic autoimmune thyroiditis.</p>\r\n<p>Patients with either neurologic or neurotrophic diseases may have an impaired blink reflex that could predispose them to EK (Figure 4). Examples of neurologic disease include Parkinson disease or neuromuscular disease. EK results from decreased blink rate and blink force.</p>\r\n<p>Neurotrophic diseases are the result of decreased corneal sensation. They are characterized by corneal nerve dysfunction, which interferes with the normal blink reflex that is needed to lubricate the eye and protect it from the external environment. Neurotrophic disease can be either acquired or hereditary and infectious or non-infectious. Non-infectious non-hereditary forms of neurotrophic keratitis can be secondary to a pathological change, due to autoimmune disease, iatrogenic, substance - induced, or as part of a polyneuropathy syndrome. Examples of decreased corneal nerve function secondary to the effect of ophthalmic pathological changes can be seen in keratoconus, bullous keratopathy, and atopic keratoconjuctivitis. Autoimmune causes of decreased corneal nerve function include Graves&rsquo; disease and Sjogren&rsquo;s syndrome. Iatrogenic corneal nerve dysfunction may occur in refractive vision corrective procedures. Intranasal cocaine abuse may also impair corneal nerve sensitivity and may predispose to EK. Lastly, systemic polyneuropathies may lead to impaired blink reflex secondary to decreased corneal nerve sensitivity and include peripheral diabetic neuropathy, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, and alcoholism.</p>\r\n<p>Hereditary forms of sensory and autonomic neuropathies that have the potential to compromise corneal nerve integrity include Riley-Day syndrome, congenital aniridia, ocular-auriculo-vertebral dysplasia, and multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A and 2B. Lastly, infectious agents that can affect the corneal nerves include herpesviridae (herpes-simplex virus type 1 and varicella-zoster virus, the latter of which can present as Ramsay-Hunt syndrome), Mycobacterium leprae, Acanthamoeba, and fungi.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lid malposition</strong> can prevent adequate closure of the eyelids, leading to EK. Causes of lid malposition include cicatricial retraction, as previously mentioned, ectropion, entropion, and eyelid coloboma.</p>\r\n<p>Ectropion is an outward rotation of the eyelid margin, whereas entropion is an inward rotation of the eyelid margin. Ectropion can be either congenital, involutional, paralytic, cicatricial, or mechanical. Congenital ectropion of the upper lid may be associated with Down syndrome, whereas congenital ectropion of lower lid may be associated with blepharophimosis syndrome. Involutional lower lid ectropion may be caused by disinsertion of the lower lid retractors, laxity of the medial and lateral canthal tendons, and atrophy or degeneration of the orbicularis oculi. This can occur as part of the natural aging process. Paralytic ectropion may be caused by facial nerve palsy leading to laxity of the orbicularis oculi (Figure 5). Cicatricial ectropion can be caused by shortening of the anterior lamella or skin of the orbicularis oculi muscle from actinic skin changes, resection of skin lesions, trauma, burns, toxic reactions to topical eye medications, skin diseases, and aggressive blepharoplasty. A rare cause of cicatricial ectropion is cutaneous anthrax infection, whereby the Bacillus anthracis organisms proliferate at the site of inoculation and form a papule that progresses to form a vesicle, pustule, and ultimately a necrotic black ulcer. When the eyelid is the primary site of entry, progressive lid edema may lead to cicatricial ectropion. Lastly, mechanical pulling of the eyelid may cause ectropion such as in the setting of a tumor.</p>\r\n<p>The causes of entropion may be congenital, acute spastic, involutional or cicatricial. Congenital entropion can occur in the setting of retractor dysgenesis and shortened posterior lamella. Acute spastic entropion may be caused by ocular inflammation or irritation as can be seen with trichiasis. Involutional entropion is associated with medial and lateral canthal laxity or dehiscence, disinsertion or stretching of the lower lid retractor complex, override of the preseptal orbicularis, and extension of orbital fat anterior to the orbital rim. Lastly, cicatricial entropion may be caused by shortening of the posterior lamella from inflammation which may be caused by trachoma, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, herpes zoster, chemical injuries, and toxic reactions to certain topical medications.</p>\r\n<p>Eyelid coloboma is another cause of eyelid malposition that may lead to EK. Eyelid coloboma may be isolated or as part of a syndrome. Isolated eyelid colobomas may present with corneopalpebral adhesions and may be complete, incomplete, or of the abortive type which has variable size and a diverse range of corneopalpebral adhesions. Syndromic variants of eyelid coloboma include Fraser syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, CHARGE syndrome (coloboma of the eye, heart defects, atresia of the nasal choanae, retardation of growth and/or development, genital and/or urinary abnormalities, ear abnormalities and deafness), or several other more rare associated syndromes.</p>",
