      "solution": "<p><strong>Satellite lesions</strong> are a characteristic finding of <strong>fungal keratitis</strong>. These multifocal stromal infiltrates appear as small, round, white lesions surrounding a central ulcer. They are often considered a hallmark feature of fungal infections of the cornea. The presence of these satellite lesions is a key indicator for diagnosing fungal keratitis, particularly when the integrity of the epithelial surface is compromised, allowing the fungus to invade the tissue.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>B. Dendritic ulcer<br /> </strong>Dendritic ulcers are typically associated with <strong>herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis</strong>, not fungal infections. They appear as branching, tree-like patterns on the corneal surface and are not characteristic of fungal keratitis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>C. Ring abscess<br /> </strong>Ring abscesses are more commonly seen in <strong>bacterial keratitis</strong>, particularly with <strong>pseudomonas infections</strong>. They can appear as a ring-shaped infiltrate with an abscess, but they are not a typical finding in fungal keratitis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>D. White Hypopyon<br /> </strong>A <strong>white hypopyon</strong> refers to the accumulation of white blood cells (WBCs) in the anterior chamber, which is usually associated with <strong>inflammatory conditions</strong> like <strong>infectious keratitis</strong> or <strong>uveitis</strong>, but it is not a specific finding for fungal keratitis.

      "solution": "<p>CME is a disorder that involves the central retina, caused by an accumulation of extracellular fluid in the macular region with secondary formation of multiple cystic spaces. Histological studies show that radially orientated cystoid spaces consisting of ophthalmoscopically clear fluid are often clinically detectable in the macula area. These cysts seem to be areas of the retina in which the cells have been displaced. It is the result of cystic accumulation of extracellular intraretinal fluid in the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layers of the retina.</p>\n<p>The exact pathogenesis of CME remains uncertain. CME following disruption of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB). When the BRB is damaged, fluid accumulates within the retina both intra- and extracellularly . M&uuml;ller cells are thought to play an important role in acting as metabolic pumps that keep the macula dehydrated. However, intracellular fluid accumulation in the M&uuml;ller cells may also occur in CME and further reduce macular retinal function. Vitreous traction may also play a part in the development of CME . Macular edema is the most frequent and severe complications of pars planitis, HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis, sarcoidosis, birdshot retinochoroidopathy, Behcet's syndrome, toxoplasmosis, Eales' disease, idiopathic vitritis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, and scleritis. CME can follow cataract surgery in the Irvine-Gass syndrome, because after cataract surgery, inflammatory mediators from the anterior chamber diffuse posteriorly into the vitreous, causing leakage from the retinal vasculature.</p>\n<p>CME is the consequence of diabetic retinopathy. The edema in the macular area occurs secondary to an abnormal permeability of the capillaries surrounding the macula (failure of inner retinal blood barrier), and in turn to a failure in the outer retinal barrier (formed by the retinal pigmented epithelium). Retinal vein obstructions (RVO) represent another cause of CME. Increased rigidity of a crossing artery because an atherosclerotic process has been suggested to cause compression of the underlying vein, provoking turbulent blood flow, endothelial damage, and thrombus formation. Likewise, a common vitreous adhesion at the obstruction site has also been reported, suggesting a possible role of vitreovascular traction in the etiology of some cases of BRVO. Atherosclerosis is a chronic low-grade inflammatory disorder and inflammation within the vascular wall contributes to the development of CME . Due to BRB breakdown secondary to damage at the tight junctions of endothelial cells, fluid diffusion from the occluded veins into the tissue can lead to CME. In addition, through such mechanisms, inflammatory responses and vascular dysfunction can all interact to cause retinal ischemia, which induces the expression of VEGF and others inflammatory agents, which participate in a complex chain of events that has yet to be fully defined.</p>\n<p>Many authors reported ocular side effect after therapy with niacin. Fraunfelder et al. reported that 3 g or more per day of nicotinic acid, could cause blurred vision, eyelid edema, toxic amblyopia, proptosis, loss of eyelashes or eyebrow, superficial punctate keratitis and CME. Some cases of blurred vision were reported in the literature , and 18 cases were reported to the National Registry or the FDA spontaneous reporting system. In these cases, the average dose of niacin was 1.5-2 g per day, with a duration of therapy varying from 6 weeks to 1 year. Follow-up reported complete resolution of visual symptoms after discontinuing niacin. Dry eye was explained because this vitamin may be secreted and concentrated in human tears, thereby irritating an already dry eye. Niacin can cause ocular signs and symptoms reversible dose related, so if the patient wishes to continue this therapy, it may be feasible to reduce the dose of the drug . Cases of niacin related maculopathy there is a 10:1 male: female ratio. Most cases were in their third to fifth decade of life and were being treated with an average dose of 3-6 g of niacin per day. The etiology of niacin's effect on the macula is unknown, A first hypothesis suggests that, in patients with vascular or inflammatory diseases, niacin induces the release of prostaglandins, causing the blood-retinal barrier compromise with extracellular accumulation of fluid in many cystic spaces. This theory is not entirely accepted for the absence of fluorescein leakage.</p>\n<p>The second and the most reliable hypothesis supports that the niacin has a direct toxic effect on M&uuml;ller cells, without disruption of the blood-retinal-barrier. Alterations in cellular metabolism cause intracellular fluid increase and swelling of these cells, with secondary formation of cysts between the glial spaces. After the discontinuation of niacin therapy, there is a complete regeneration of the M&uuml;ller cells and their normal function . Reports from the literature suggest that the onset of maculopathy ranges from 1 to 36 months after initiation of relatively high-dose therapy (3 g or more daily). There have also been reports of this condition with lower dosages (1.5 g daily). This patient had increased the dosage of niacin to 3 g daily nearly 2 months before documentation of CME. In a previous case report a very low dose of niacin was administered (18 mg) and niacin maculopathy appears 4 weeks later with a complete resolution after discontinuation of drug, confirming the relationship between drug administration and macular edema appearance. In this patient, funduscopic examination showed bilateral macular edema, but no signs of diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy excluding the presence of other factors that may contribute to the capillary dysfunction associated with edema onset. At funduscopic examination, the foveomacular area had a peculiar aspect: the foveola takes on a bright yellow hue, similar to an exudate. Cysts primarily involve the foveal area, and they are smaller than those seen in post-surgical or inflammatory CME . FA and OCT are useful to confirm the diagnosis. FA showed the absence of fluorescein leakage or vascular alteration, whereas OCT confirms the presence of cystic hyporeflective spaces in the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layers. The cystoid spaces were more numerous and larger in the outer plexiform layer compared with the inner nuclear layer. Indeed previous studies reported that the fluor-angiographic pattern is atypical.</p>\n<p>On the left, there is an image of Stratus OCT 2 weeks after the start of niacin treatment. On the right fluorescein angiography of the same patient after 3 weeks after the beginning of niacin treatment with the typical absence of leakage also in later phases</p>\n<p>Gass described reversible bilateral CME with no angiographic fluorescein leakage in 3 patients taking doses of niacin greater than 1.5 g daily to treat hyperlipidemia . Although Gass described transmitted hyper-fluorescence with a cartwheel pattern in the fluorescein angiograms of his patients, later reports described typical fluorescence in similarly affected patients. In all these cases, symptoms resolved over 4 to 8 weeks following discontinuation of niacin. First-line treatment for CME of toxic origin, such as that induced by niacin, is the removal of the offending agent. In milder cases of maculopathy, symptoms have resolved within a few days of drug discontinuation.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A. Vitamin-A</strong></p>\n<p>While <strong>Vitamin-A</strong> deficiency can lead to <strong>night blindness</strong> and other vision issues, it is not typically associated with macular edema or macular cysts. However, excessive intake of Vitamin A can lead to toxicity, but this primarily causes other issues such as hypervitaminosis A and does not generally result in macular edema or cysts.</p>\n<p><strong>B. Vitamin-D</strong></p>\n<p>While<strong> Vitamin-D</strong> toxicity is associated with hypercalcemia, which can lead to kidney stones, bone pain, and other systemic effects, but it is not typically linked to macular edema or macular cyst formation.</p>\n<p><strong>C. Vitamin-E</strong></p>\n<p>While <strong>Vitamin E</strong> is a potent antioxidant, excessive intake generally leads to bleeding and other side effects but is not commonly associated with macular edema or cyst formation.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> <strong>Niacin (Vitamin B3)</strong> in supraphysiologic doses can cause <strong>macular edema</strong> and the formation of <strong>macular cysts</strong>, which is an important consideration when using niacin for treating high cholesterol or other conditions requiring high doses of this vitamin.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO), also called spared eye injury, is a diffuse granulomatous inflammation of the uveal layer of both eyes following trauma to one eye. It can leave the affected person completely blind. Symptoms may develop from days to several years after a penetrating eye injury. It typically results from a delayed hypersensitivity reaction.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong></p>\r\n<p>Eye floaters and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye (uveitis) with pain and sensitivity of the eyes to light. The affected eye often remains relatively painless while the inflammatory disease spreads through the uvea, where characteristic focal infiltrates in the choroid named Dal&eacute;n-Fuchs nodules can be seen. The retina, however, usually remains uninvolved, although perivascular cuffing of the retinal vessels with inflammatory cells may occur. Swelling of the optic disc (papilledema), secondary glaucoma, vitiligo, and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></p>\r\n<p>Sympathetic ophthalmia is currently thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response toward ocular antigens, specifically a delayed hypersensitivity to melanin-containing structures from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina. The immune system, which normally is not exposed to ocular proteins, is introduced to the contents of the eye following traumatic injury. Once exposed, it senses these antigens as foreign, and begins attacking them. The onset of this process can be from days to years after the inciting traumatic event.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>\r\n<p>Diagnosis is clinical, seeking a history of eye injury. An important differential diagnosis is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), which is thought to have the same pathogenesis, without a history of surgery or penetrating eye injury.</p>\r\n<p>Still experimental, skin tests with soluble extracts of human or bovine uveal tissue are said to elicit delayed hypersensitivity responses in these patients. Additionally, circulating antibodies to uveal antigens have been found in patients with SO and VKH, as well as those with long-standing uveitis, making this a less than specific assay for SO and VKH.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>\r\n<p>Because SO is so rarely encountered following eye injury, even when the injured eye is retained, the first choice of treatment may not be enucleation or evisceration, especially if there is a chance that the injured eye may regain some function. Additionally, with current advanced surgical techniques, many eyes once considered nonviable now have a fair prognosis.</p>\r\n<p>However, only if the injured eye has completely lost its vision and has no potential for any visual recovery, prevention of SO is done by enucleation of the injured eye preferably within the first 2 weeks of injury. Evisceration-the removal of the contents of the globe while leaving the sclera and extraocular muscles intact-is easier to perform, offers long-term orbital stability, and is more aesthetically pleasing, i.e., a greater measure of movement of the prosthesis and thus a more natural appearance. There is concern, however, that evisceration may lead to a higher incidence of SO compared to enucleation. Several retrospective studies involving over 3,000 eviscerations, however, have failed to identify a single case of SO.</p>\r\n<p>Once SO is developed, immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment. When initiated promptly following injury, it is effective in controlling the inflammation and improving the prognosis. Mild cases may be treated with local application of corticosteroids and pupillary dilators. More severe or progressive cases require high-dose systemic corticosteroids for months to years. Patients who become resistant to corticosteroids or develop side effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy (osteoporosis and pathologic fractures, mental status changes, etc.), may be candidates for therapy with chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, or ciclosporin.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>B. Blunt ocular trauma<br /> Blunt trauma</strong> to the eye does not typically lead to sympathetic ophthalmia. SO is more commonly associated with <strong>penetrating trauma</strong>, where the eye's contents are exposed to the immune system.</p>\r\n<p><strong>C. Chemical injury<br /> </strong>While chemical injuries can cause severe damage to the eye and lead to other complications like corneal scarring or loss of vision, they do not directly result in <strong>sympathetic ophthalmia</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>D. Urinary tract infection<br /> </strong>A <strong>urinary tract infection</strong> is unrelated to the development of sympathetic ophthalmia, which is specifically triggered by penetrating eye trauma, not systemic infections.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> <strong>Sympathetic ophthalmia</strong> is a rare but serious condition most commonly caused by <strong>penetrating trauma to the eye</strong>. It is a delayed immune response that affects both eyes, and early intervention is crucial to manage inflammation and preserve vision.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a condition where a blood clot forms in the cavernous sinus, a large vein located at the base of the skull. The condition often presents with unilateral proptosis that may later become bilateral. This occurs due to the venous congestion and obstruction in the cavernous sinus. Bilateral sixth nerve palsy is a hallmark sign of CST because the sixth cranial nerve (abducent nerve), which controls the lateral rectus muscles of the eye, passes through the cavernous sinus. The pressure from the thrombosis affects both sides, causing the bilateral palsy of the abducent nerve and resulting in double vision or an inability to move the eyes laterally.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>B. Thyroid ophthalmopathy<br /> </strong>Thyroid eye disease, or thyroid ophthalmopathy, usually presents with bilateral proptosis but is not typically associated with bilateral sixth nerve palsy. It is caused by the swelling of extraocular muscles and orbital fat behind the eyes, leading to proptosis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>C. Retinoblastoma<br /> </strong>Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the retina, typically seen in children. It does not commonly present with proptosis or bilateral sixth nerve palsy as primary symptoms. Retinoblastoma usually causes a leukocoria (white pupil reflex) rather than nerve palsies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>D. Orbital pseudotumor<br /> </strong>Orbital pseudotumor is an inflammatory condition that affects the orbit, often leading to unilateral proptosis. While it can cause some cranial nerve palsies, including involvement of the sixth nerve, it does not typically result in the bilateral palsy seen in cavernous sinus thrombosis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> <strong>Cavernous sinus thrombosis</strong> is a serious condition that can present with unilateral proptosis and bilateral sixth nerve palsy, due to the involvement of the sixth cranial nerve, which passes through the cavernous sinus.</p>",

The optic tract represents the first stage in the visual pathway in which visual information is transferred in a homonymous nature. Main characteristic feature of lesion involving whole optic tract is homonymous hemianopsia.

      "solution": "<p>B) Incomitant squint</p>\n<p>Incomitant squint is a squint in which the angle of deviation differs depending upon the direction of gaze i.e, amount of deviation varies in different directions of gaze. There are many type of incomitant squints (paralytic, restrictive, 'A' &amp; 'V' pattern), however the most common type is Paralytic squint and the word incomitant squint is usually used for paralytic squint. Therefore, I will explain paralytic squint here Paralytic squint is the most common type of squint in adults. Paralytic squint is the strabismus resulting from complete or incomplete paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles. There are many causes like neurogenic (e.g. meningitis, cranial nerve palsy etc.), myogenic (myopathies), or neuromuscular junction lesions.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptoms of paralytic squint are :-</strong></p>\n<p>i) Diplopia : It is the main symptom. It is most marked in the direction of action of paralysed muscle. For example in left rectus palsy, the maximum diplopia occurs when patient tries to see horizontally on left side and in left superior oblique palsy (causes Dextrodepression) diplopia is maximum when patient tries to look downward and right.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting here that in diplopia, if the images are separated horizontally it is probable that either a lateral or a medial recuts is affected; when the images are separated vertically or the image is tilted (torsion) it is likely that one or more of the vertical recti or the tilted (torsion) it is likely that one or more of the vertical recti or the obliques are affected.</p>\n<p>ii) Other symptoms : Confusion, nausea &amp; vertigo, ocular deviation,loss of stereopsis.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs of paralytic squint are :-</strong></p>\n<p>i) Secondary deviation is more than primary deviation:- Primary deviation is the deviation in the affected eye and is away from the action of paralysed muscle. Secondary deviation is the deviation of normal eye seen under cover, when the patient is made to fix with the squinting eye.</p>\n<p>ii) Restriction of ocular movements</p>\n<p>iii) Compensatory head posture :- Patients with a paralytic squint move their head such that the eyes occupy a position in the orbit where the angle of squint is minimal and this can avoid confusion and diplopia. Head is turned towards the action of paralysed muscle.</p>\n<p>When the horizontal recti (medial or lateral) are affected, the characteristic posture is a turn of the face to right or left, e.g. in left lateral rectus palsy the head is turned to the left and in left medial recuts palsy the head is turned to the right. When a vertical rectus (superior or inferior) or an oblique muscle is affected, a tilt of the head to the right or left with depression or elevation of the chin is adopted to reduce both the vertical deviation and rotation, e.g in superior oblique palsy (dextrodepression of left eye is affected) the head is tilted to left so that the left eye can see down and medially.</p>\n<p>iv) There is false projection or orientation</p>\n<p>v) There is no amblyopia and visual acuity is normal as paralytic squint develops in adults when visual acuity has already develop</p>\n<p><strong>Incorrect Options Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>(B) Incomitant Squint</strong> - While <strong>paralytic squint is a type of incomitant squint</strong>, the term <em>incomitant squint</em> is a broader category that includes both <strong>paralytic</strong> and <strong>restrictive squints</strong>. The defining feature of <strong>incomitant squint</strong> is that <strong>the angle of deviation varies depending on the direction of gaze</strong>, but since paralytic squint is the most common form of incomitant squint in adults, <strong>paralytic squint is the best answer</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>(C) Restrictive Squint</strong> - Restrictive squint occurs due to <strong>mechanical restriction</strong> of ocular movements, such as in <strong>thyroid eye disease, trauma (orbital fractures), or fibrosis of extraocular muscles</strong>. Unlike paralytic squint, restrictive squint does not usually show <strong>secondary deviation greater than primary deviation</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>(D) Pseudo Squint</strong> - Pseudo squint refers to a <strong>false appearance of strabismus</strong> without actual ocular misalignment, commonly seen in infants due to <strong>epicanthal folds or wide nasal bridges</strong>. It is not associated with diplopia or restricted ocular movements, making it an incorrect choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paralytic squint is the most common type of incomitant squint in adults.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Secondary deviation is greater than primary deviation, a key distinguishing feature of paralytic squint.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Diplopia is maximal in the direction of action of the affected muscle.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Diabetes and hypertension are common risk factors due to their association with cranial nerve palsies.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Restrictive squint is due to mechanical restriction, while pseudo squint is only a false appearance of strabismus.</strong></li>\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>Nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI), also known as orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, idiopathic orbital inflammation ( IOI)and orbital inflammatory syndrome is the most common cause of painful orbital mass in adults. NSOI can be localized or diffuse. When localized, inflammation can affect the extraocular muscles (orbital myositis), lacrimal gland (dacryoadenitis), sclera (scleritis), uvea (uveitis), and the superior orbital fissure and cavernous sinus (Tolosa-Hunt syndrome). Others include periscleritis, perineuritis, and mass. When diffuse, NSOI may diffusely involve the orbital fatty tissues. NSOI is the third most common orbital disease after thyroid eye disease and orbital lymphoma. NSOI can both radiologically and clinically mimic a malignant process. Therefore, it is a diagnosis of exclusion, only after all other causes of inflammation have been eliminated. Treatment options are varied and can include surgery, steroids, chemotherapeutic agents and irradiation.</p>\r\n<p>All patients with suspected NSOI require a full ophthalmic assessment/workup. NSOI is typically characterized by the abrupt onset of pain, proptosis and other inflammatory signs such as swelling and erythema. Unilateral presentation is more typical but bilateral presentations are not uncommon. Pediatric NSOI differs from the adult presentation and is more commonly characterized by bilateral manifestation, uveitis, disc edema and eosinophilia. Pain is the most common symptom in adult NSOI and occurs 58-69% of the time followed by diplopia (31-38%). Periorbital edema/swelling is the most common sign and occurs 75-79.2% of the time (figure) followed by proptosis (32-62.5%), EOM restriction (54.2%) red eye (48%), chemosis (29%), decreased vision (20.8%), and ptosis (16.7%).34-35 Therefore, physical examination of patients with suspected NSOI involves lid assessment (retraction/lid lag/lagophthalmos), orbital assessment (proptosis), extraocular muscles (restriction), globe (injection/chemosis), and optic nerve function (visual acuity/color plates/relative afferent pupillary defect). Because of the association between rheumatologic disease and NSOI the typical laboratory work-up for suspected NSOI should include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, thyroid function studies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme level, rapid plasma reagin test, and rheumatoid factor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key features in the question:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Middle-aged woman</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Bilateral proptosis</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Restricted ocular movements</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Chemosis (conjunctival edema/swelling)</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These symptoms are highly suggestive of <strong>Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (IOI), also known as Orbital Inflammatory Pseudotumor</strong>, which is the correct answer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why Not the Other Options?</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>(A) Orbital Cellulitis:</strong> Usually unilateral, associated with fever, pain, and systemic infection signs.</li>\r\n<li><strong>(B) Thyroid Ophthalmopathy:</strong> Commonly presents with bilateral proptosis but typically has <strong>lid retraction</strong> and occurs in hyperthyroid patients.
