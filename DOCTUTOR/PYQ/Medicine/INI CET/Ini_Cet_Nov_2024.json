      "solution": "<p>Choice B. Diarrhea:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: Diarrhea typically leads to a normal anion gap (non-anion gap) metabolic acidosis. It is caused by the loss of bicarbonate-rich intestinal fluids, which decreases the bicarbonate concentration in the plasma but does not usually increase the anion gap.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation : </strong></p>\r\n<p>Choice A. DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: DKA is a classic example of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). It occurs when there is an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin and an increase in insulin counterregulatory hormones, leading to lipolysis and excessive ketone production (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), which are acidic.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Choice C. AKI (Acute Kidney Injury):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: AKI can lead to a high anion gap acidosis due to the accumulation of sulphates, phosphates, urate, and other organic acids that are normally excreted by the kidneys. This results in an increased production and decreased excretion of acids.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Choice D. Inborn Error of Metabolism:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: Many inborn errors of metabolism, such as organic academia&rsquo;s and urea cycle disorders, lead to the accumulation of organic acids in the blood, thus increasing the anion gap. These metabolic derangements often result in HAGMA due to the overproduction of metabolically derived acids.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway : </strong></p>\r\n<p>High-AG Acidosis:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Four Principal Causes of High-AG Acidosis:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lactic acidosis</li>\r\n<li>Ketoacidosis</li>\r\n<li>Ingested toxins</li>\r\n<li>Acute and chronic kidney failure</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Initial Screening for High-AG Acidosis:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>History Probe: Check for drug and toxin ingestion and possible respiratory alkalosis, especially from salicylates.</li>\r\n<li>Diabetes Mellitus Presence: Check for history related to diabetes that might indicate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).</li>\r\n<li>Evidence of Alcoholism: Look for signs of alcoholism or elevated levels of &beta;-hydroxybutyrate indicating alcoholic ketoacidosis.</li>\r\n<li>Uremic Signs: Look for clinical signs of Uremia and check blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels for uremic acidosis.</li>\r\n<li>Urine Inspection: Check urine for oxalate crystals, which can indicate ethylene glycol ingestion.</li>\r\n<li>Clinical Settings for Lactate Increase: Recognize settings that may increase lactate levels, such as hypotension, shock, cardiac failure, leukemia, cancer, and drug or toxin ingestion.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Diagnostic Approach:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comprehensive initial evaluation based on patient history, clinical examination, and laboratory investigations to correctly categorize the type of acidosis and its potential cause.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>",

      "solution": "<p>Choice D. Any rise in serum creatinine will be s/o acute renal allograft rejection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explanation: Any rise in creatinine is potentially significant and warrants further evaluation for rejection among other differential diagnoses, making it a safe clinical practice guideline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>Choice A. Rise of creatinine by more than 10% is s/o acute rejection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explanation: While a rise in creatinine is indeed a sign of potential rejection, specifying more than 10% as a criterion is not universally accepted for diagnosing acute rejection alone. Acute rejection should be considered with any significant and unexplained rise in serum creatinine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choice B. Rise of creatinine by more than 5% is s/o acute rejection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explanation: This statement is closer to clinical practice compared to a 10% rise, but still, the specificity of just a 5% increase might not be sufficient alone for diagnosis without further assessment and investigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choice C. Serum creatinine does not rise in acute renal allograft rejection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explanation: This statement is incorrect as a rise in serum creatinine is a common and early sign of acute renal allograft rejection. Lack of rise does not rule out rejection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Renal Allograft Rejection:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clinical Signs of Rejection:\n<ul>\n<li>Rejection might only present with a rise in serum creatinine, sometimes accompanied by reduced urine volume. Other clinical signs like fever, swelling, and tenderness over the allograft are rare but possible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Diagnostic Approaches:\n<ul>\n<li>Doppler Ultrasonography: Used to assess changes in renal vasculature and blood flow. It can also detect renal vein thrombosis, urinary obstruction, or perirenal collections.</li>\n<li>Allograft Biopsy: Considered the gold standard for diagnosing T cell-mediated and antibody-mediated rejection, characterized by immune cell infiltration and endothelial injury, respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Treatment Strategies:\n<ul>\n<li>T cell-mediated Rejection: High-dose steroids, typically IV methylprednisolone; refractory cases may require anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG).</li>\n<li>Antibody-mediated Rejection: Managed with plasmapheresis, IVIG, rituximab, and bortezomib. It's challenging due to the complex immune response involved.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Innovations in Monitoring and Diagnosis:\n<ul>\n<li>Noninvasive biomarkers such as circulating donor-derived cell-free DNA, urine chemokines (e.g., CXCL9), and analysis of urine exosomes are emerging tools that help in detecting and monitoring rejection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>",

      "solution": "<p>Choice D. E. coli O157:H7</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explanation: E. coli O157:H7 is a well-known cause of HUS, especially the diarrheal-associated form (D+ HUS). It produces Shiga toxins that can lead to severe kidney damage and the triad of symptoms defining HUS: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation: </strong></p>\n<p>Choice A. Shigella flexneri</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explanation: Shigella flexneri is a cause of bacterial dysentery, characterized by bloody diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps. It is not typically associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), which is more commonly linked to specific strains of E. coli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choice B. Salmonella enteritis</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explanation: Salmonella enteritis can cause gastroenteritis with symptoms including diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Like Shigella, it is not commonly associated with HUS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choice C. Aeromonas</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explanation: Aeromonas species can cause gastrointestinal illness, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, leading to watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sometimes bloody diarrhea. It is not a typical cause of HUS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS):</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shiga Toxin-Producing E. coli (STEC) HUS:\n<ul>\n<li>Most common form known as D+ HUS.</li>\n<li>Typically follows a gastrointestinal infection with E. coli strains producing Shiga toxins.</li>\n<li>Symptoms include diarrhea (often bloody), abdominal pain, and vomiting. Fever is typically absent.</li>\n<li>Neurological symptoms more common in adults, including seizures and stroke.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Pathophysiology:\n<ul>\n<li>Shiga toxins bind to globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) on renal cells, disrupting cellular function and triggering inflammation.</li>\n<li>This leads to platelet aggregation and the characteristic microangiopathy of HUS.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Other Causes of HUS:\n<ul>\n<li>Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated HUS, linked with neuraminidase activity exposing antigens that cause immune reaction.</li>\n<li>Atypical HUS (aHUS), driven by genetic mutations affecting the complement system, often leading to more severe renal damage and chronic conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Diagnosis and Treatment:\n<ul>\n<li>Diagnosis largely based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings of MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.</li>\n<li>Supportive care is critical, with specific treatments depending on the underlying cause (e.g., plasma exchange for aHUS).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prognosis:\n<ul>\n<li>Varies based on the HUS type; STEC HUS has a better prognosis compared to aHUS, which often progresses to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>",

      "solution": "<p>Choice D. Renal failure</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: Although renal impairment can occur in TTP, it is not as prominent or as common as in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). TTP primarily involves severe ADAMTS13 deficiency leading to extensive microvascular thrombosis with less emphasis on renal failure as a primary feature.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Choice A. Thrombocytopenia</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: Thrombocytopenia is a defining feature of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). It is characterized by a significantly reduced platelet count due to platelet consumption in microscopic clots throughout the body's small blood vessels.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Choice B. Thrombosis</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: Thrombosis in the microcirculation is another hallmark of TTP. The formation of small blood clots in the small vessels throughout the body can lead to multiple organ dysfunction.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Choice C. Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) occurs in TTP when red blood cells are mechanically fragmented as they pass through partially occluded microvessels filled with clots, leading to hemolysis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare blood disorder characterized by clotting in small blood vessels (thromboses), leading to a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low red blood cell count due to destruction (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia), occasional renal impairment, and sometimes neurological symptoms. The disease is caused primarily by a deficiency or inhibition of the ADAMTS13 enzyme, which is necessary to cleave von Willebrand factor multimers. Without this cleavage, unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers accumulate, leading to abnormal clotting in the microcirculation.</p>\r\n<p>Treatment typically involves plasma exchange and immunosuppression to reduce the antibodies against ADAMTS13 if present. The prognosis has greatly improved with these treatments, though relapses are common, and close monitoring is required.</p>",

If a tourniquet is needed, tie and release as soon as sample is collected</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Using a tourniquet can affect blood flow and potentially alter the concentration of various substances in the blood, including calcium. However, the key here is the duration the tourniquet is applied. A brief application typically used during blood sample collection usually does not significantly alter serum calcium levels. Thus, it is important to tie and release the tourniquet as quickly as possible to minimize any potential impact.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice B. Collecting after exercise</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Exercise can affect calcium levels due to changes in hydration status, blood flow, and the release of calcium from the bones during and after vigorous physical activity. Therefore, collecting a blood sample for calcium measurement immediately after exercise could potentially lead to a transient alteration in calcium levels, making this a factor to consider avoiding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Choice C. Making a fist is not recommended.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When patients repeatedly make a fist, it can lead to localized increase in venous pressure and haemoconcentration, which may falsely elevate certain blood constituent concentrations including calcium. Therefore, it is recommended to keep the hand relaxed to avoid these potential changes in blood composition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Choice D. Staying immobilised for long periods of time increases bone resorption and increases calcium levels</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Long-term immobilization can indeed lead to increased bone resorption, where calcium is released from the bones into the bloodstream. However, this process occurs over extended periods (such as weeks or months of immobilization), not typically relevant in the acute setting of blood sample collection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></p>\r\n<p>For <strong>accurate serum calcium measurement</strong>, the <strong>tourniquet should be applied briefly and released immediately</strong> after collecting the sample to <strong>prevent hemoconcentration</strong>.

ALL: T phenotype</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: This form of ALL arises from T-cell progenitors and shares many clinical features with B-cell lineage ALL, including impact on the bone marrow and peripheral blood. However, T-cell ALL can also involve mediastinal masses and more pronounced lymphadenopathy. It is less common than B-cell ALL in children.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL):</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pathogenesis: ALL involves malignant transformation and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors either in the bone marrow or lymphatic system, leading to an accumulation of immature leukemic cells.</li>\r\n<li>Clinical Manifestations: Common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, infections, and hemorrhage, often prompting medical evaluation. Tumor bulk may cause symptoms like lymph node enlargement and hepatosplenomegaly.</li>\r\n<li>Diagnostic Approach: Diagnosis is primarily made through peripheral blood and bone marrow examination. Confirmation and subtyping require additional tests such as cytochemical stains, immunologic markers (determining B-cell vs. T-cell lineage), and cytogenetic and molecular analyses.</li>\r\n<li>Treatment and Prognosis: Treatment typically involves chemotherapy, with prognostic outcomes varying based on genetic factors and the patient's response to treatment. Immunologic markers play a crucial role in guiding treatment decisions and prognosis assessment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Differences Between B-ALL and T-ALL</strong></p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/202504180e92a1bb-14fb-4fea-b215-c70e478e9256.jpg\">",

      "solution": "<p>Choice B. Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD) ARVD is a genetic disorder often related to mutations in genes encoding cardiac desmosomal proteins. It is characterized by fibrosis and fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium. Patients typically present with palpitations, syncopal attacks following exercise, or cardiac arrest due to sustained monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). The ECG frequently shows T-wave inversions in V1-V3, an epsilon wave, and other signs such as a prolonged S-wave upstroke.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Choice A. Uhl's Disease it is a rare cardiac condition characterized by the almost complete absence of myocardial muscle in the right ventricle, which is replaced by fibro-fatty tissue. This disease is not typically associated with the described ECG patterns of coved ST-segment elevation or the clinical presentation of exercise-induced syncopal attacks.</p>\r\n<p>Choice C. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) HCM is the most common genetic cardiovascular disorder, marked by the thickening of the cardiac muscle, which can lead to sudden cardiac death, especially in young individuals. It does not typically feature the ECG pattern of coved ST-segment elevations seen in Brugada syndrome but can include various arrhythmias, including VT. Clinical manifestations may include syncope, often related to physical exertion or stress.</p>\r\n<p>Choice D. Brugada's Syndrome Brugada syndrome is characterized by ST-segment elevation with a coved shape and negative T waves in the anterior precordial leads (V1-V3), which fits with the ECG description provided. This syndrome is associated with episodes of syncope or cardiac arrest due to polymorphic VT, typically without structural heart disease. It can be particularly triggered during sleep or by febrile states.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Comparative Features of ARVD, HCM, and Brugada Syndrome</strong></p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/20250418888c523f-483c-441e-9ac0-5dee79854e74.jpg\">",

      "solution": "<p>Choice D. HLA DQ6 and HLA DQ11 (Correct Option)</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: The histocompatibility antigens HLA DQ2 and DQ8 are strongly associated with celiac disease, as these are necessary for presenting deamidated gluten peptides to immune cells, leading to an autoimmune reaction. HLA DQ6 and DQ11 are not associated with celiac disease, making this option the correct answer for not being associated with the condition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Choice A. IgA Transglutaminase Positive</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase are a hallmark of celiac disease. Tissue transglutaminase modifies gluten peptides, enhancing their immunogenicity and triggering an immune response in genetically predisposed individuals.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Choice B. IgG Antigliadin Positive</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: Deamidated anti-gliadin IgG antibodies can be diagnostic in patients with celiac disease who are deficient in IgA. These antibodies target modified gliadin peptides and are used in screening, especially in the context of IgA deficiency.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Choice C. Modified Marsh Classification</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: The Modified Marsh Classification is a diagnostic tool used to categorize the histological findings in small-intestinal biopsies from patients suspected of having celiac disease. It quantifies the severity of mucosal damage and is pivotal in confirming the diagnosis post-serological testing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Celiac Disease: An immune response to gluten that results in small intestinal enteropathy. Gluten, found in wheat, rye, barley, and some oats, is the trigger.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Epidemiology and Genetics: Increasing prevalence globally, with necessary but not sufficient genetic predisposition related to HLA DQ2 and DQ8.</li>\r\n<li>Presentation: Symptoms vary from asymptomatic to severe malabsorption. Common signs include diarrhea, weight loss, and iron-deficiency anemia.</li>\r\n<li>Mechanism of Symptoms: Caused by villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in the proximal small intestine, leading to malabsorption and fluid hypersecretion.</li>\r\n<li>Associated Conditions: Higher risk of autoimmune disorders like type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis is also closely linked.</li>\r\n<li>Diagnosis: Screening with serum antibodies (tissue transglutaminase IgA, anti-endomysial, deamidated anti-gliadin). Biopsy of the small intestine showing villus blunting and crypt hyperplasia confirms diagnosis. Modified Marsh Classification is used to assess histological damage.</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "solution": "<p>Choice D. In ischemic stroke, BP should be reduced to &lt;140/90 mmHg immediately. (Incorrect)</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: In ischemic stroke, there is controversy about acutely lowering blood pressure due to the risk of reducing blood flow to the ischemic penumbra. Immediate aggressive reduction to &lt;140/90 mmHg is not typically recommended unless specific conditions such as planned thrombolytic therapy or malignant hypertension are present.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Choice A. In hemorrhagic stroke, reduce the BP to less than 160/100 mmHg with antihypertensives to prevent rebleed</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: In cases of hemorrhagic stroke, lowering blood pressure to prevent further bleeding is critical. A target of less than 160/100 mmHg is generally supported by guidelines and aims to prevent rebleeding while ensuring adequate cerebral perfusion.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Choice B. In hemorrhagic stroke, aggressive use of IV antihypertensive if SBP &gt; 220</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: For hemorrhagic stroke patients presenting with extremely high systolic blood pressure (SBP &gt; 220 mmHg), aggressive management with IV antihypertensives like nicardipine, labetalol, or esmolol is recommended to rapidly reduce the risk of hematoma expansion.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Choice C. In ER multiple blood pressure readings should be taken before starting anti-hypertensive therapy immediately</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explanation: Multiple readings are necessary to ensure the accuracy of the blood pressure measurements before commencing treatment, as fluctuations can occur due to stress, pain, or the acute medical condition itself.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAY:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Hypertension Management in Stroke</p>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/202504188ac58bc0-100a-4c2e-8c07-618067371987.jpg\">",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Choice A. Decreased arterial compliance.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Decreased arterial compliance refers to the reduced ability of arteries to expand and contract in response to pressure changes. This condition leads to increased stiffness of the arteries, which can cause higher systolic pressures and relatively high diastolic pressures, thus decreasing pulse pressure. It's the primary mechanism in older individuals where the arteries become stiffer due to age-related changes and atherosclerosis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect choices explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice B. Increased cardiac output.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This would typically lead to an increased pulse pressure rather than a decrease, as it would raise systolic pressure more than diastolic pressure. Therefore, this option does not explain a decreased pulse pressure in the context provided.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>ChoiceC. Increased sympathetic outflow.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Increased sympathetic outflow generally leads to vasoconstriction, higher heart rate, and increased cardiac output. Similar to increased cardiac output, this would likely increase pulse pressure rather than decrease it, making it an incorrect choice for explaining decreased pulse pressure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Choice D. Increased myocardial contractility.</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Increased myocardial contractility refers to the heart's increased ability to contract, which would raise systolic pressure more significantly than diastolic pressure, potentially increasing pulse pressure. Hence, it does not explain a decreased pulse pressure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Blood Pressure Trends:</strong> In industrialized societies, blood pressure rises steadily with age. Men generally have higher systolic pressures in early adulthood, but women experience a steeper increase in systolic pressure with aging.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Diastolic Pressure Trends:</strong> Diastolic pressure increases until about age 55, after which it tends to decrease, leading to an increased pulse pressure in older ages.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Arterial Stiffness:</strong> Arterial stiffness is both a consequence and contributor to hypertension. It reduces the arterie's ability to buffer flow changes, leading to a mismatch between central and brachial pressures and increasing pulse pressure.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Pulse Pressure Determinants:</strong> Pulse pressure is influenced by the functional properties of the arteries and the dynamics of blood wave propagation and reflection.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Clinical Implications:</strong> Measures of arterial stiffness (like pulse wave velocity and aortic augmentation index) are important predictors of cardiovascular risks and are associated more with central than brachial pressures.</li>\r\n</ul>",
