Lumbar spine and hip are the sites that are commonly preferred. T scores compare the result obtained for an individual with race and sex matched young adult population. Z scores compare individual result to age and sex matched reference population. Values are between -2.5 to +2.5. a T score &lt;2.5 in the femur or lumbar vertebrae is diagnostic of osteoporosis. A score between -1 and -2.5 is low bone mineral density. &gt;50 % fractures occur in low bone mineral density</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/20250402069e4450-2f61-4a1c-bdaf-30261b8bd05b.jpg\">\r\n<p>The absolute fracture risk assessment is made by calculating the FRAX score. It takes into account age, sex, height, weight, fracture history, history of fracture in parents, steroid use, history of rheumatoid arthritis, other secondary causes and bone density in femur. It calculated the 10 year fracture risk.</p>\r\n<p>Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) can be done using DEXA scan by using lateral view of thoracic or lumbar spine. Since most of the vertebral fracture are asymptomatic, it can be detected using vertebral abnormality, age, gender and BMD.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>CT, USG MRI and high resolution quantitative CT are research tools. HRQCT uses peripheral bones like tibia.</li>\r\n<li>Tetracycline labeling and bone biopsy allows for evaluation of bone remodeling and evaluation of metabolic bone disease.

With the advent of antiresorptive agents, the bone resorption declines earlier than bone formation. Hence the measurement of markers of bone resorption before initiating treatment and repeated 2-6 months after initiating treatment is batter assessment of treatment response than density of bone. These are indicated for treatment with Bisphosphonates, Denosumab and estrogen and are not used for weaker agents like calcitonin and raloxifene. Teriparatide is the agent which stimulates osteoblasts. Response to treatment can be assessed by bone formation markers like PINP(most sensitive) or osteocalcin.</p>",

In a suspected patient the gold standard investigation is CT angiography with 1mm cuts. If an acute embolic occlusion is detected, surgical exploration with resection of the ischemic bowel.

In &gt;75% cases the source of emboli comes from the heart and lodges in the SMA</p>\r\n<p>Non occlusive ischemia is seen in acute hemodynamic instability as seen in hypovolemic shock or drugs causing vasoconstriction.

Combination is preferred for people with more than 2 lesions. Lesions in the subarachnoid space need prolonged treatment and here Methotrexate or anti TNF agents can be used as steroid sparing agents. High dose steroids are needed since antiparasitic drugs will elicit an inflammatory response. Steroids will enhance the first pass effect of Praziquantal and it should be co administered with Cimetidine. For multiple lesions and diffuse cerebral edema, steroids are the initial mainstay and antiparasitic drugs should be avoided. Surgery is the main treatment for ocular disease. Spinal disease may worsen with antiparasitic lesions and may lead to irreversible damage. Either medical or surgical treatment can be used for spinal disease.</p>",
