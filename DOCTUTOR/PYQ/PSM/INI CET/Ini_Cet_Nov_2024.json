      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Mass screening: - </strong>Simply means the screening of a whole population or a sub group. It is offered to all, irrespective of the particular risk individual may run of contracting the disease in question.</li>\r\n<li><strong>High-risk or selective screening: - </strong>Applied selectively to high-risk groups, the groups defined on the basis of epidemiological research. For example, since cancer cervix tends to occur relatively less often in the upper social groups, screening for cancer cervix in the lower social groups can increase the yield of new cases. One population sub-group where certain diseases (diabetes, hypertension, breast cancer) tend to be aggregated in the family, so by detecting the other members of the family the physician can detect additional cases.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Multiphasic screening:</strong> - It has been defined as the application of two or more screening test in combination to a large number of people at one time rather than to carry out separate screening tests for single diseases.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice A: Multiphasic screening - Incorrect<br /> </strong>Multiphasic screening involves conducting multiple screening tests at once for various diseases in a large population. While this may be useful in public health settings, the scenario described focuses on individuals with a specific familial risk, making high-risk screening the better choice.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice B: Mass screening - Incorrect<br /> </strong>Mass screening refers to testing an entire population or a large subgroup regardless of individual risk factors. The scenario specifies that screening is being done for family members of affected individuals, which aligns with high-risk rather than mass screening.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice D: Anonymous screening - Incorrect<br /> </strong>Anonymous screening is conducted without collecting identifying information about individuals being tested. This is typically used in diseases with social stigma, such as HIV/AIDS, rather than in a familial setting for diabetes and hypertension.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>High-risk screening</strong> is the most appropriate approach for screening family members of individuals with diabetes and hypertension since these diseases have a strong familial aggregation.</p>",

You will be able to first read the RDT result within 15 minutes.</li>\r\n<li>If the RDT is positive, you know that the person has falciparum malaria. You should give treatment for falciparum malaria. You need not send the slide to the laboratory.</li>\r\n<li>If the RDT is negative, you know the person does not have falciparum malaria, but you do not know whether the person has the less dangerous form, vivax malaria, or not. Hence, you should send the slide to the laboratory and wait for the result.

      "solution": "<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Evaporation: - </strong>About 27% of the heat is lost by evaporation from the skin, mucous membranes and respiratory passages. It occurs in 2 forms: <strong>a) By Perspiration: -</strong> Perspiration occurs due to continuous diffusion of fluid through the epidermis. It occurs over the whole of the body surface at uniform rate and is largely independent of environmental conditions. This heat loss is not under control and therefore, cannot be changed as required. <strong>b) Evaporation of sweat: -</strong> Thermal sweating from eccrine sweat glands increases when the external or internal body temperature rise. Sweat is vaporized from the skin, which decreases its temperature. Evaporation decreases to a great extent if the humidity of the atmosphere is high.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Radiation: - </strong>Refers to transfer of heat from an object to another object with which it is not in contact. The magnitude of heat loss by radiation depends on the size of body surface and the average temperature difference between skin and surrounding objects.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Conduction:<em> - </em></strong>Refers to heat exchange between objects at different temperatures that are in contact with one another. The amount of heat transferred by conduction is proportionate to the temperature difference between two objects.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Incorrect Choices Explanation</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Choice B: Radiation - Incorrect</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Radiation is a major heat loss mechanism in cooler environments</strong>, where heat transfers from the body to cooler surroundings.</li>\r\n<li>In <strong>Jaisalmer's high temperature (40&deg;C)</strong>, the <strong>environment is hotter than or equal to skin temperature</strong>, so <strong>radiative heat loss is minimal or even reversed (heat gain from surroundings).</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Choice C: Conduction with air - Incorrect</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Conduction occurs when heat is transferred through direct contact.</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Air is a poor conductor of heat</strong> and, in hot climates, does not effectively cool the body unless <strong>wind enhances convective heat loss</strong> (which is different from conduction).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Choice D: Conduction with objects - Incorrect</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Conduction with objects occurs when <strong>the body touches cooler surfaces</strong> (e.g., lying on a cool floor).</li>\r\n<li>In <strong>hot desert conditions, surrounding surfaces are also hot</strong>, so <strong>conduction does not significantly contribute to heat loss.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></p>\r\n<p>In high-temperature, low-humidity environments, evaporation is the most effective heat loss mechanism, as sweat readily evaporates, removing body heat efficiently.</p>",
