      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The <strong>RMNCH+A</strong> strategy is a comprehensive approach launched by the Government of India to integrate interventions across the life cycle. The acronym stands for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>R</strong> - Reproductive health</li>\r\n<li><strong>M</strong> - Maternal health</li>\r\n<li><strong>N</strong> - Newborn health</li>\r\n<li><strong>C</strong> - Child health</li>\r\n<li><strong>+A</strong> - Adolescent health</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Family Planning</strong> is a core component under <strong>Reproductive health</strong>. <strong>Geriatric health</strong> is not a part of this specific strategy, which focuses on the reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent age groups. <strong>(Option A and D ruled out)</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The strategy formally recognizes adolescence as a distinct phase of life. It integrates maternal and child health initiatives with broader reproductive health services, which include family planning, adolescent health programs, HIV care, gender-related services, and the management of preconception and prenatal diagnostic techniques. Furthermore, the approach strengthens the connection between home- and community-based care and clinical services provided in health facilities. It emphasizes the establishment of robust linkages, referrals, and counter-referrals across all tiers of the healthcare system. This creates a seamless, continuous pathway of care, thereby generating a synergistic effect that enhances overall health outcomes and impact.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Related important points and concepts:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The \"+A\" for Adolescent health was added to the earlier RCH (Reproductive and Child Health) program to emphasize the importance of this age group.</li>\r\n<li>The strategy aims to reduce maternal and infant mortality and address the unmet needs for contraception and reproductive health.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>RMNCH+A covers Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent health.</li>\r\n<li>Geriatric health is not included in this framework.</li>\r\n</ul>",

(<strong>Option B ruled out)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg:</strong> The standard starting dose for HCTZ is <strong>5 mg - 25 mg</strong>. 50 mg is a high dose not used for initiation due to increased risk of metabolic side effects. <strong>(Option C ruled out)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Metoprolol 100 mg BD:</strong> Beta-blockers like Metoprolol are <strong>not preferred as first-line</strong> therapy for uncomplicated hypertension according to most contemporary guidelines due to inferior outcomes compared to CCBs/ARBs/Thiazides.
