In such cases, patients often use alternative methods to produce speech. <strong>Tracheoesophageal speech is a common method used by laryngectomy patients.</strong> It involves the surgical creation of a small opening between the trachea and the esophagus, through which air can be redirected from the lungs into the esophagus. By expelling air from the esophagus, patients can produce speech sounds and communicate.</p>",

They can be measured using a sensitive microphone placed in the ear canal. OAEs are used to assess the function of the cochlea and are particularly helpful in screening for hearing loss in newborns.</li>\n<li>Pure Tone Audiometry: <strong>Pure Tone Audiometry is a subjective test</strong> that relies on the patient's response to pure tone sounds of different frequencies and intensities. <strong>The patient indicates when they hear the tones, and the results are plotted on an audiogram</strong>.
