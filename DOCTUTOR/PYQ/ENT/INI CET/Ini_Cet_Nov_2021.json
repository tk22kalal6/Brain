      "solution": "<p>Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid (Baha)</p>\n<p><strong>Baha is the most suitable option for individuals with bilateral anotia.</strong> Bilateral anotia means the absence of external ears on both sides. <strong>In such cases, conventional hearing aids cannot be worn due to the lack of ear structures to hold them in place</strong>. Cochlear implant surgery typically requires access to the cochlea, which is challenging in the absence of external ears and middle ear structures.</p>\n<p>Baha, on the other hand, is designed to bypass the middle ear and directly stimulate the inner ear using bone conduction. It involves implanting a small titanium fixture into the skull bone behind the ear. The sound processor is then attached to this fixture, and sound vibrations are transmitted through bone conduction to the cochlea, enabling the sensation of hearing. Since Baha does not require external ears or a functional middle ear, it is a more suitable option for individuals with bilateral anotia.</p>\n<p>b) Cochlear Implant</p>\n<p>Cochlear implants are not the most suitable option for bilateral anotia. Cochlear implants require the insertion of an electrode array directly into the cochlea to stimulate the auditory nerve. However, in cases of bilateral anotia, there are no external ears or a normal middle ear structure to facilitate the placement of the electrode array.</p>\n<p>c) Electrode Array</p>\n<p>An electrode array is a component of a cochlear implant and cannot be used as a standalone solution for individuals with bilateral anotia.</p>\n<p>d) TORP (Total Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis)</p>\n<p>TORP is a middle ear implant used to reconstruct the ossicular chain in cases of middle ear pathologies, particularly those affecting the ossicles (bones of the middle ear). It is not a suitable option for individuals with bilateral anotia, as it does not address the absence of external ears or the direct stimulation of the inner ear.</p>",
