Around 1 in 50 patients will develop a haematoma, and in almost all cases this will develop in the first 24 hours.</li>\r\n<li>If an arterial bleed occurs, the tension in the central compartment pressure can rise until it exceeds venous pressure. Venous oedema of the larynx can then develop and cause airway obstruction, leading to death.</li>\r\n<li>When closing the wound, avoiding a watertight closure of the strap muscles may allow a haematoma to escape into the subcutaneous tissues.</li>\r\n<li>Wound drains have not been shown to have a protective effect. Close monitoring of the wound is advised postoperatively. If a haematoma develops, clinical Staff should know to remove skin sutures in order to release some pressure and seek senior advice immediately.</li>\r\n<li>Endotracheal intubation should be used to secure the airway while the haematoma is evacuated and the bleeding point controlled.</li>\r\n<li><strong>RLN paralysis and voice change RLN injury</strong> may be unilateral or bilateral, transient or permanent. Early routine postoperative laryngoscopy reveals a much higher incidence of transient cord paralysis than is detectable by simple assessment of the integrity of the voice and cough.</li>\r\n<li>Such temporary dysfunction is not clinically important, however, but voice and cord function should be assessed at first follow-up 4 weeks postoperatively.</li>\r\n<li>If an RLN is injured during surgery and the transected ends are identified, they should be anastomosed. In the event that a length of nerve is excised (owing to invasion by malignancy, for example), <strong>anastomosis of the ansa cervicalis</strong> may be considered.</li>\r\n<li>This does not return mobility of the vocal cord but maintains neurological input to the muscles of the larynx. By avoiding denervation and related muscle atrophy, the vocal quality is improved. Permanent vocal cord paralysis should be treated conservatively with speech therapy. If voice quality is unacceptable, medialisation procedures can be performed.</li>\r\n</ul>",

The <strong>prostatic glands are surrounded by a layer of myoepithelial cells</strong>. The first change associated with carcinoma is the loss of the basement membrane, with glands appearing to be in confluence. As the cell type becomes less differentiated, more solid sheets of carcinoma cells are seen.</p>\r\n<p>A classification of the histological <strong>pattern based on the degree of glandular differentiation and its relation to stroma</strong> has been devised by Gleason. Prostate cancers exhibit heterogeneity within tissue, and so two histological areas of the prostate are each scored between 3 and 5. Grades 1 and 2 are now not reported as their outcome is similar to grade 3. Grade 3 cancers almost never metastasise. The scores are added to give an overall Gleason score of between 6 and 10; this (and the volume of the cancer) appears to correlate well with the likelihood of spread and the prognosis. The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) and WHO have recommended a simplified grading system composed of five prognostic grade groups. Each group has prognostic significance and a higher grade group has a poorer prognosis.</p>\r\n<p>Grade groups are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1 = Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6</li>\r\n<li>2 = Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7</li>\r\n<li>3 = Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7</li>\r\n<li>4 = Gleason score 8 (4 + 4 = 8, 3 + 5 = 8, 5 + 3 = 8)</li>\r\n<li>5 = Gleason score &ge;9 (4 + 5 = 9, 5 + 4 = 9, 5 + 5 = 10)</li>\r\n</ul>",

They are usually renal in origin and can be managed non-operatively, although they may sometimes require angioembolisation.</li>\r\n<li>Zone 3 (pelvic): as with zone 2, these should only be explored if they are expanding or pulsatile or penetrating injury is present. Pelvic haematomas are exceptionally difcult to control and, whenever possible, should not be opened; they are best controlled with compression orextraperitoneal packing, or, if the bleeding is arterial in origin, with angioembolisation</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<img class=\"w-100\" style=\"height:auto; display:block; vertical-align:middle; border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/V4/NEETPGMCQ/20250415d7815746-644f-411d-bf36-96121f71a333.jpg\">",
