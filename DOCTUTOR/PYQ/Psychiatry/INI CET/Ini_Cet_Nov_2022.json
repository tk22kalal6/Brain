Key symptoms include agitation, confusion, hallucinations, insomnia, tremors, and autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating, tachycardia).</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong>, such as <strong>diazepam</strong>, are the first-line treatment as they help manage agitation, reduce the risk of seizures, and stabilize autonomic dysfunction.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Thiamine</strong> is crucial to prevent <strong>Wernicke's encephalopathy</strong>, a severe neurological condition caused by thiamine deficiency commonly seen in chronic alcoholics.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Incorrect Options:</strong></h3>\r\n<p><strong>(A): Only Thiamine injection</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>While thiamine is essential, it alone does not address the symptoms of delirium tremens, such as agitation and autonomic instability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>(B): Olanzapine</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Olanzapine is an antipsychotic and is not the first-line treatment for DTs.

      "solution": "<p><strong>Varenicline</strong> is an oral medication specifically used to help individuals quit smoking. It works by acting on <strong>nicotinic receptors</strong> in the brain. Varenicline <strong>partially stimulates</strong> these receptors, reducing nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms, while also blocking nicotine from attaching to these receptors. This dual action helps to make quitting smoking easier by reducing both the pleasure from smoking and the urge to smoke.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Why the other options are incorrect:</strong></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>(B): Muscarine</strong>: Muscarine is not used for smoking cessation. It is a naturally occurring alkaloid found in some mushrooms and has no therapeutic application for quitting smoking.</li>\r\n<li><strong>(C): Cevimeline</strong>: Cevimeline is used to stimulate salivary gland secretion, mainly for conditions like <strong>Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome</strong>, but it is not used for smoking cessation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>(D): Atropine</strong>: Atropine is an <strong>anticholinergic</strong> agent used for other medical conditions, such as pupil dilation and treating bradycardia, but it is not used for smoking cessation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3><strong>Key Point:</strong></h3>\r\n<p><strong>Varenicline</strong> is the drug of choice for helping individuals quit smoking due to its specific action on nicotine receptors in the brain.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>The use of SSRIs(Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) by a pregnant mother can have various effects on the newborn and it's important to consider the potential risks associated with SSRI exposure during pregnancy. Here's a detailed explanation for each option:</p>\r\n<p>Low APGAR score: The APGAR score is a quick assessment of a newborn's physical condition immediately after birth, evaluating factors like heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflexes and color. A low APGAR score(typically below 7 out of 10) suggests that the newborn may require medical attention and monitoring.</p>\r\n<p>ADHD(Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder): ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. It is not caused by SSRIs, but it is more common in children who were exposed to SSRIs in utero.</p>\r\n<p>Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn(PPHN):</p>\r\n<p>PPHN is a rare but serious condition in which a newborn's circulation and lung function are compromised. It can result in breathing difficulties and is potentially life-threatening.</p>\r\n<p>There is evidence to suggest that SSRI use during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of PPHN in the newborn. This risk is considered higher when SSRIs are used in late pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>Delayed Developmental Milestones:</p>\r\n<p>SSRI exposure during pregnancy has been associated with potential delays in developmental milestones in some cases. This includes delays in areas such as motor skills, language development and social interactions.</p>\r\n<p>The degree of impact on developmental milestones can vary widely among individuals and may depend on several factors, including the specific SSRI used and the timing of exposure during pregnancy.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The use of SSRIs during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of various complications for the newborn, including low APGAR scores, ADHD, persistent pulmonary hypertension, and delayed developmental milestones. Therefore, the correct answer is <strong>(A)</strong>, which includes all of these risks.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>5HT1A blockade influences weight loss and positive, this mechanism is not correctly matched. 5-HT1A receptors are a subtype of serotonin receptors that are widely distributed throughout the brain. There is no direct evidence to suggest that blocking these receptors influences weight loss or positive symptoms. Weight gain is a common side effect of many antipsychotic medications, and it is primarily attributed to their antagonistic effects on histamine H1 and serotonin 5-HT2C receptors. Positive symptoms, on the other hand, are primarily influenced by dopamine D2 receptor blockade.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.Anticholinergic blockade reduces EPS caused by antipsychotics:</strong></p>\n<p>This mechanism is correctly matched. Anticholinergic drugs, such as benztropine and trihexyphenidyl, are commonly used to counteract extrapyramidal symptoms(EPS) caused by antipsychotic medications. EPS refers to a range of movement disorders that can occur as side effects of antipsychotics, including parkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia and tardive dyskinesia.</p>\n<p><strong>B.D2 blockade in the mesolimbic pathway reduces positive symptoms:</strong></p>\n<p>This mechanism is correctly matched. The mesolimbic pathway is a dopaminergic pathway in the brain that plays a crucial role in reward and motivation. Excessive dopamine activity in this pathway has been implicated in the development of positive symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions.</p>\n<p><strong>C.5HT2A blockade influences negative symptoms:</strong></p>\n<p>This mechanism is correctly matched. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia refer to deficits in emotional expression, motivation, social interaction and cognitive functioning. Antipsychotic medications that block 5-HT2A receptors have been shown to improve negative symptoms in some individuals with schizophrenia. By modulating serotonin activity, these medications may enhance dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in brain regions involved in negative symptomatology.</p>\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>5HT1A blockade</strong> does not play a significant role in weight loss or positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
