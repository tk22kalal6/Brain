Affected individuals are often confused, unable to remember key personal details, and may even forget their name. The onset is usually sudden and may last from minutes to days, though most cases resolve in less than a week. The history of confused travel away from home makes dissociative fugue a better answer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dissociative identity disorder (Option B): </strong>Dissociative identity disorder is characterised by emotional and<strong> behavioural instability</strong>, often accompanied by memory lapses and behaviours that appear inconsistent with the person's usual self. These manifestations are linked to the presence of <strong>alternate identities</strong>, or 'alters,' which take control of the individual's behaviour for varying durations. <strong>Shifts between alter</strong>s are commonly triggered by stressful experiences, conflicts among the alters themselves, or other psychological struggles. Dissociative fugue can be seen in dissociative identity disorder as well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Transient global amnesia (Option D): </strong>Transient global amnesia typically affects individuals in <strong>late middle age</strong>, presenting with<strong> sudden disorientation</strong> and repetitive questioning about identity, location, and activity. It involves both anterograde amnesia for new information and retrograde amnesia for recent past events, usually resolving within 24-48 hours, though memory gaps for the ictal period may persist. Recurrence occurs in some cases, and while often linked to migraine, <strong>temporal lobe seizures</strong>, or posterior circulation abnormalities, the lack of neurological signs may sometimes result in mistaken psychiatric diagnoses.</p>",

      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The given clinical scenario of an individual's belief that he is spoken to by God through birds is suggestive of a <strong>delusional perception</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Delusional perception</strong> refers to a sudden, unique, and often self-referential delusion triggered by a <strong>neutral perceptual event.</strong></li>\n<li>Two main models describe it: Schneider's two-link model, where delusional meaning arises from an abnormal interpretation of an intact perception, and Matussek's one-link model, where the delusional meaning is built into an altered perception.</li>\n<li>Both views agree that delusional perception represents a <strong>primary delusion</strong> embedded within the altered experiential framework typical of <strong>schizophrenia</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of other options:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sudden delusional idea (Option A): </strong>A delusional idea is a distorted version of reality where a known phenomenon is either exaggerated or diminished to an abnormal degree, making it an <strong>understandable</strong> but false belief.</p>\n<p><strong>Delusion of reference (Option C): </strong>Delusion of reference is a false belief where a person thinks that others' actions, or neutral events and objects, are <strong>directly related to them</strong> in a special or unusual way, often negatively. This stems from an <strong>idea of reference</strong>, in which individuals wrongly feel that others are talking about them, such as believing people on TV or radio are speaking to or about them.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual hallucination (Option D): </strong>Hallucinations are defined as sensory experiences that occur <strong>without any external stimulus</strong>, and they can involve different senses such as auditory, visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory. Visual hallucinations may involve seeing shadows or flashes, even in individuals without psychosis, and can appear at times like<strong> hypnagogic states</strong> between wakefulness and sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35588694/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35588694/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4471966/\" target=\"_blank\">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4471966/</a></li>\n</ol>",
