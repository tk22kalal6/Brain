      "solution": "<p>FHH is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It results from a defect in serum calcium sensing by the parathyroid gland and renal tubule, causing inappropriate secretion of PTH and excessive renal reabsorption of calcium. The calcium-sensing receptor is sensitive to extracellular calcium concentration, suppressing PTH secretion and therefore resulting in negative-feedback regulation. Many different mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor have been described in patients with FHH. These mutations lower the ability of the sensor to bind calcium, resulting in excessive secretion of PTH and subsequent hypercalcemia. Urinary excretion of calcium is very low, with reabsorption more than 99%. The hypercalcemia is often detected in the first decade of life. This contrasts with primary hyperparathyroidism, which rarely occurs before age 10. Few clinical signs or symptoms are present in patients with FHH. These patients have excellent outcomes, and surgery or medical therapy is rarely necessary. Jansen&rsquo;s disease refers to mutations in the PTH receptor.</p>",

It leads to the normalization of IGF-1 levels in more than 90% of patients with no adverse impact on glycaemic control or glucose tolerance as compared with the somatostatin analogues.

(c) There is extensive infiltration of the parenchyma by a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate containing small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and well-developed germinal centres. The thyroid follicles are atrophic and are lined in many areas by epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, termed H&uuml;rthle cells, which represent a metaplastic response of the normally low cuboidal follicular epithelium to chronic injury. All of these features are suggestive of autoimmune (Hashimoto&rsquo;s) thyroiditis. (d) There should be monotonous uniform infiltration by atypical lymphocytes.</li></ul>",

(b) Glucokinase gene mutations can lead to maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), which is far less common than type 2 diabetes. (c) Nodular glomerulosclerosis, as shown in the figure, is a characteristic feature of renal involvement in diabetes mellitus and explains her proteinuria (which may progress to nephrotic syndrome). Peripheral insulin resistance is strongly linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her history is classic for type 2 diabetes, as is the elevated haemoglobin A1c. Note that although premenopausal women are relatively protected from ischemic heart disease, diabetes tilts the balance and can promote development of coronary artery disease in younger women. (d) Although localized amyloid deposition in islets can be seen with type 2 diabetes, it is not linked to conditions such as multiple myeloma that involve additional organs with amyloid deposition.</li></ul>",

The tumors are composed of clusters of polygonal to spindle-shaped chromaffin cells or chief cells that are surrounded by supporting sustentacular cells, creating small nests or alveoli (zellballen) that are supplied by a rich vascular network. Uncommonly, the dominant cell type is a spindle or small cell; various patterns can be found in any one tumor. The cytoplasm has a finely granular appearance, best demonstrated with silver stains, due to the presence of granules containing catecholamines. The nuclei are usually round to ovoid, with a stippled &ldquo;salt-andpepper&rdquo; chromatin that is characteristic of neuroendocrine tumors.
