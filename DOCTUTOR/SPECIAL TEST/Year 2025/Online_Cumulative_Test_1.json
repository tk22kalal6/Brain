Birbeck granules are seen on electron microscopy, not on histopathology.</strong></p><p>The term histiocytosis is used for a group of proliferations of dendritic cells, Langerhans cells or macrophages and includes both benign and malignant examples. While histiocytic sarcoma, Langerhans cell sarcoma and dendritic cell sarcoma are clearly malignant lymphomas and are uncommon, monoclonal proliferation of Langerhans cells are grouped under Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and are somewhat more common. LCH includes three clinicopathological related conditions occurring in children: eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schuller-Christian disease and Letterer-Siwe syndrome. As a group, all the three conditions are associated with proliferation of 3 types of cells: histiocytes, lymphocytes and eosinophils. Earlier, this group was referred to as histiocytosis-X but now following facts about this group are known:</p><p>Firstly, histiocytosis-X are not proliferations of unknown origin (X-for unknown) but proliferating cells are actually Langerhans' cells of marrow origin. Langerhans' cells are normally present mainly in the epidermis of the skin but also in some other organs.</p><p>Secondly, the three conditions included under histiocytosis-X are actually different expressions of the same basic disorder. This concept has emerged from 2 features:</p><ul><li>Demonstration of common antigens on these cells by immunohistochemical stains for S-100 protein, CD1a and HLA-DR.</li><li>Electron microscopic demonstration of histiocytosis-X bodies or Birbeck granules in the cytoplasm. These are rod shaped structures having dilated tennis-racket-like terminal ends. Their function is not known but they arise from receptor mediated endocytosis of langerin found in human epidermal cells, a protein involved in Birbeck granule biosynthesis.</li></ul><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"width:50%;height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizApr2025/CummTestI06042025/34E.jpg\"><p>Langerhans cell histiocytosis-eosinophilic granuloma.

      "solution": "<p>The question deals with heat related illness. Our Patient is a relatively young and healthy male who is a manual laborer. He has presented with the temperature of 105 degree F and symptoms of Heatstroke. The type of heat stroke that occurs in young and healthy individuals is Exertional heat stroke, Where the patient will be diaphoretic despite dehydration. Hence, option D is the right answer.</p><ul><li>The classical triad of a heat stroke are core temperature &gt;40&deg;C, exposure to heat and CNS dysfunction.</li></ul><p>There are two types of heat stroke</p><ol><li>Classical heat stroke: Occurs in elderly patients with multiple co morbid illness, during periods of heat waves, where they will be exposed to high ambient temperature and humidity for long periods. They are often compliant on medications that impair tolerance to heat stress. Heat dissipation mechanisms are overwhelmed by endogenous heat production, exogenous heat stress and limited access to fluids. The patients will be dry and dehydrated. They have multisystem dysfunction. Hepatocytes are particularly sensitive to heat stress and the levels may reach &gt;100 times the baseline. AKI can occur. DIC likes pictures. Hypernatremia.</li><li>Exertional heat stroke: It occurs in young and healthy individuals who are exposed to high temperatures, like manual labourers, military recruits etc. they will be diaphoretic despite dehydration, unlike CHS. They have striking rhabdomyolysis and AKI. They will have hyponatremia and hypoglycemia.</li></ol><p>For both EHS and CHS the common findings are myocardial injury called thermal cardiomyopathy. CVP may be elevated despite dehydration. Ards can occur. Tachyarrhythmias can occur. Management of arrhythmias is rapid cooling and not antiarrhythmics.</p><p>At a core temperature of &gt;42&deg;C, there will be irreversible damage of all the thermosensitive enzymes. Hence rapid cooling strategies should be initiated.</p><p>Prior to initiating cooling ET intubation and continuous core temperature monitoring should be initiated.</p><p>Hypoglycemia should be corrected. IV crystalloids should be infused with noradrenaline as there will already be vasoconstriction and impaired heat dissipation.</p><p>COOLING STRATEGIES:</p><ol><li>EVAPORATIVE COOLING, where cool water 15&deg;C is continuously sprayed over the exposed skin and fan will ensure continuous airflow. Ice packs should be applied to the axilla, groin and neck as adjuncts. Cardiac monitoring is possible by applying electrodes to the back of the patient.</li><li>IMMERSION COOLING, by immersing the patient in ice cold Should be tried only in otherwise healthy patients with EHS. Here cardiac monitoring is not possible. Cooling should be stopped once temperature reaches 38-39&deg;C.</li></ol><p>Cooling with commercially available cooling blankets is not effective as it takes time to reduce the core temperature. Infusion of cold IV fluids is also not effective.</p><p>Fluid resuscitation should be continued despite high CVP as CVP is high due to myocardial injury. &Alpha; adrenoreceptor blockers should be avoided as there is already vasoconstriction and further vasoconstriction impairs heat dissipation. If inotropes are needed Dopamine or Dobutamine should be started.</p><p>Antipyretics have no role and are detrimental too.</p><p>There is no single investigation to confirm the diagnosis of heat stroke. Response to cooling is one method by which we can confirm.</p>",

Although the search results indicate that Enalapril can be safely co-administered with Metformin, the caution arises from the fact that both drugs can impact renal function, especially in patients with existing conditions like COPD, which may complicate their overall health status.</p><p>Glimepiride (option b) is a sulfonylurea that can cause hypoglycemia but does not have the same renal considerations as Metformin.</p><p>Acarbose (option c) is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that works in the intestines and does not significantly interact with Enalapril.</p><p>Sitagliptin (option d) is a DPP-4 inhibitor that is generally well-tolerated and does not have significant interactions with Enalapril.</p><p>While the search results indicate that Metformin can be safely used with Enalapril, the caution is warranted due to potential renal implications and the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in a patient with compromised pulmonary function.

      "solution": "<p>Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator commonly used to manage acute pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension. By dilating blood vessels, it reduces preload and afterload on the heart, thereby decreasing the work of the heart and improving cardiac output. This can help alleviate pulmonary congestion and edema. Therefore, IV nitroglycerin is often considered the treatment of choice for acute pulmonary edema associated with hypertension.</p> <p>Other CXR findings include:</p> <ul> <li>Upper lobe venous congestion,</li> <li>Thickened interlobular septum,</li> <li>Interstitial edema,</li> <li>Kerley B lines. Once PCWP is elevated to moderate or severe levels</li> </ul> <p><strong>A. Oxygen + Antibiotics:</strong>While oxygen therapy is crucial for maintaining adequate oxygenation in patients with pulmonary edema, antibiotics are not typically indicated unless there is a concurrent infection. Antibiotics would not directly address the acute pulmonary edema associated with hypertension.</p> <p><strong>B. Intravenous Salbutamol (Albuterol):</strong>Salbutamol is a bronchodilator commonly used in conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While it may help alleviate some symptoms associated with pulmonary edema by reducing bronchospasm, it is not the primary treatment for acute pulmonary edema.</p> <p><strong>D. Nebulized Salbutamol (Albuterol):</strong>Nebulized salbutamol is similar to intravenous salbutamol in its mechanism of action as a bronchodilator. While it may provide some relief for respiratory symptoms, it is not the primary treatment for acute pulmonary edema.</p>",

Enhanced sodium-chloride delivery to the collecting duct stimulates potassium secretion leading to <strong>hypokalemia</strong>. It also causes hydrogen ion secretion resulting in <strong>metabolic alkalosis</strong>. <u>Accelerated kinin and prostaglandins</u> secretion may account for the <strong>vascular unresponsiveness</strong> to the pressor effect. This explains the absence of increase in blood pressure and oedema despite the elevated levels of renin and aldosterone. Indomethacin inhibits prostaglandin and restores normal physiological vascular response.</p><p>Hypokalemia with hypertension is seen with disorders that are related to the ENaC Conn's Syndrome, Liddle syndrome.</p><p>Bartter's syndrome is associated with increased urinary excretion of potassium and chloride.</p><p>IN Bartter's syndrome, the addition of Spironolactone, Amiloride or ACE inhibitors improves hypokalemia, but worsens the hypovolemia.
