Ansa cervicalis is a branch of the cervical plexus which hangs in front of the internal jugular vein. It innervates the strap muscles. The hypoglossal nerve winds behind the internal jugular vein, then sweeps around lateral to the carotid vessels and into the floor of the mouth, where it innervates the tongue muscles. The phrenic nerve lies on top of the anterior scalene muscles, it then travels through the thorax to innervate the diaphragm. Finally, the vagus is found in the carotid sheath, it is associated with the common carotid and the internal carotid arteries.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Textbook of Gray's Anatomy for students, 3rd Edition, Head and neck, Page number - 900</p>",

To do this, the surgeons must enter the carotid sheath, which means that any structure within that sheath or near that sheath might be injured. This question specifically asks which structure in the sheath could be injured, so the correct answer is the vagus nerve. The carotid sheath contains 2 nerves: the vagus and the superior ramus of ansa cervicalis. It also contains 3 vessels: internal carotid, common carotid, and internal jugular vein. Any of these structures could be damaged during the procedure.</p><p>The accessory nerve is most closely associated with the posterior triangle of the neck. It cuts through this triangle to innervate sternocleidomastoid and trapezius and lies posterior to the carotid vessels The cervical sympathetic trunk lies in front of the prevertebral muscles in the prevertebral fascia. The glossopharyngeal nerve comes out of the jugular foramen and divides into 2 branches-pharyngeal and lingual branches. This nerve sweeps near the carotid sheath, but it's not in the carotid sheath. The hypoglossal nerve travels lateral to the carotid vessels before entering the floor of the mouth. It crosses the carotid artery, but it's not in the sheath.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Textbook of Gray's Anatomy for students, 3rd Edition, Head and neck, Page number - 900</p>",

      "solution": "<p>This patient cannot extend her knee, so her quadriceps muscle must be injured. Remember, the quadriceps is the major muscle responsible for extending the knee. Also, note that the quadriceps is innervated by the femoral nerve, which is the nerve that would be easily damaged by a penetrating injury to the femoral triangle.</p><p>Adductor magnus adducts the thigh; it is innervated by the obturator nerve. Although the obturator nerve might be damaged by an injury to the femoral triangle, the symptoms do not fit with a deficit of this nerve. Biceps femoris is innervated by the tibial nerve and common fibular nerve; gluteus maximus is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve; gluteus medius is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve. All of these nerves are found in the posterior thigh, and they would not be related to an injury in the femoral triangle.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Textbook of Gray's Anatomy for students, 3rd Edition, Lower Limb, Page number - 557</p>",
