Some tumors may be well circumscribed and encapsulated; others infiltrate the adjacent parenchyma and have ill-defined margins. The cut surface sometimes reveals papillary foci that point to the diagnosis (Fig.). The microscopic hallmarks of papillary neoplasms include the following:</p><ul><li>Branching papillae having a fibrovascular stalk covered by a single to multiple layers of cuboidal epithelial cells. In most cases, the epithelium covering the papillae has well-differentiated, uniform, orderly cuboidal cells, but more pleomorphic or even anaplastic morphologies may be seen.</li><li>Nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin, which imparts an optically clear or empty appearance, giving rise to the designation ground-glass or <strong>Orphan Annie eye nuclei</strong>. In addition, invaginations of the cytoplasm often give the appearance of intranuclear inclusions (\"pseudo-inclusions\") or intranuclear grooves. These nuclear features are sufficient for the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma, even in the absence of papillary architecture.</li><li>Concentrically calcified structures termed psammoma bodies are often present within the lesion, usually within the cores of papillae.These structures are almost never found in follicular and medullary carcinomas.</li><li>Foci of lymphatic invasion by tumor are often present, but involvement of blood vessels is relatively uncommon, particularly in smaller lesions.

      "solution": "<p>Asbestos as a mineral is known to mankind for more than 4000 years but its harmful effects have come to light during the last few decades. Asbestos is a Greek word meaning 'unquenchabl'. In general, if coal has a lot of dust and little fibrosis, asbestos is little dust and a lot of fibrosis. Prolonged exposure for a number of years to asbestos dust produces three types of severe diseases: asbestosis of lungs, pleural disease and tumours. In nature, asbestos exists as long thin fibrils which are fi re-resistant and can be spun into yarns and fabrics suitable for thermal and electrical insulation and has many applications in industries. Particularly at risk are workers engaged in mining, fabrication and manufacture of a number of products from asbestos such as asbestos pipes, tiles, roofs, textiles, insulating boards, sewer and water conduits, brake lining, clutch castings etc.</p><p>There are two major geometric forms of asbestos:</p><p>\"Serpentine consists of curly and flexible fibres. It includes the most common chemical form chrysotile (white asbestos) comprising more than 90% of commercially used asbestos.</p><p>\"Amphibole consists of straight, stiff and rigid fibres. It includes the less common chemical forms crocidolite (blue asbestos), amosite (brown asbestos), tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite. However, the group of amphibole, though less common, is more important since it is associated with induction of malignant pleural tumours, particularly in association with crocidolite.</p><p>CLINICAL FEATURES: Asbestosis is a slow and insidious illness. The patient may remain asymptomatic for a number of years in spite of radiological evidence of calcified pleural plaques and parenchymatous changes. However, onset of interstitial fibrosis brings about dyspnoea with dry or productive cough. More advanced cases show development of Caplan's syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale and various forms of cancers.</p><p>Pathogenesis:</p><ul><li>The inhaled asbestos fibres are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages from where they reach the interstitium.</li><li>The asbestos-laden macrophages release chemo-attractants for neutrophils and for more macrophages, thus inciting cellular reactions around them.</li><li>Asbestos fibres are coated with glycoprotein and endogenous hemosiderin to produce characteristic beaded or dumbbell-shaped asbestos bodies.</li><li>All types of asbestos are fibrogenic and result in interstitial fibrosis. Fibroblastic proliferation may occur via macrophage derived growth factors such as interleukin-1. Alternatively, fibrosis may occur as a reparative response to tissue injury by lysosomal enzymes released from macrophages and neutrophils or by toxic free radicals.</li><li>Asbestos fibres are carcinogenic, the most carcinogenic being crocidolite. There is a high incidence of broncho genic carcinoma in asbestosis which is explained on the basis of the role of asbestos fibres as tumour promoters or by causing cell death of the airways so that it is exposed to the carcinogenic effect of cigarette smoke. The development of pleural mesothelioma in these cases is probably by carrying of asbestos fibres via lymphatics to the pleura.</li></ul><br><img class=\"w-100\" style=\"width:50%;height:auto;display:block;vertical-align: middle;border:0; \"src=\"https://d3fkkq5frqjyl8.cloudfront.net/Quiz2025/NEETPG/QuizMay2025/PathologySAI26052025/6E.jpg\"><p>Microscopic appearance of asbestos body.

      "solution": "<p>(a) Achlorhydria is incorrect because the formation of peptic ulcers requires at least some gastric acid secretion.</p><p>(d) Peptic ulcer disease refers to breaks in the mucosa of the stomach and small intestine, principally the proximal duodenum, which are produced by the action of gastric secretions. The pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease is believed to involve an underlying chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori. This pathogen has been isolated from the gastric antrum of virtually all patients with duodenal ulcers and from about 75% of those with gastric ulcers. H. pylori gastritis is the most common type of gastritis in the United States and is characterized by prominent chronic inflammation of the antrum and body of the stomach. The inflammatory infiltrate includes large numbers of plasma cells, often in clusters or sheets, within the superficial lamina propria. These are accompanied by increased numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils within the lamina propria. Neutrophils infiltrate across the basement membrane and accumulate in the lumens of gastric glands, or pits, to create pit abscesses. In addition to peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori gastritis is a risk factor for development of gastric adenocarcinoma and lymphoma. Eradication of H. pylori infection is curative of peptic ulcer disease in most patients.</p>",
