      "solution": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Refeeding Syndrome</strong> is a potentially life-threatening metabolic complication that occurs in <strong>severely malnourished patients</strong> who are started on <strong>enteral or parenteral nutrition</strong>-most commonly with <strong>total parenteral nutrition (TPN)</strong>.</li><li><strong>Pathophysiology: </strong>When carbohydrates are reintroduced after starvation, <strong>insulin secretion increases</strong>, driving <strong>phosphate, magnesium, and potassium</strong> into cells for glycolysis and energy production. This leads to <strong>severe electrolyte depletion</strong> in the serum.</li></ul><p><strong>Characteristic Laboratory Abnormalities:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Hypophosphatemia</strong> - hallmark finding</li><li><strong>Hypomagnesemia</strong></li><li><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></li><li><strong>Hypocalcemia</strong> may also be seen in some cases due to shifts related to phosphate metabolism</li><li><strong>No significant hyponatremia</strong> - sodium levels are generally unaffected</li></ul><p><strong>Clinical Consequences:</strong></p><ul><li>Cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (due to low phosphate and magnesium)</li><li>Respiratory failure (due to diaphragmatic weakness)</li><li>Rhabdomyolysis</li><li>Neurologic symptoms (confusion, seizures)</li></ul><p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p><ul><li>Identify high-risk patients (e.g., anorexia nervosa, chronic alcoholism, prolonged fasting, post-surgical malnutrition).</li><li>Reintroduce calories gradually.</li><li>Supplement <strong>phosphate, potassium, and magnesium</strong> before and during refeeding.</li></ul><p><strong>Explanation of Incorrect Options:</strong></p><p><strong>Hypophosphatemia (Option A): </strong>The <strong>most characteristic</strong> finding in refeeding syndrome due to rapid cellular uptake of phosphate for ATP production.</p><p><strong>Hypocalcemia (Option B): </strong>Secondary to hypophosphatemia and intracellular shifts during refeeding.</p><p><strong>Hypomagnesemia (Option C): </strong>Magnesium is driven into cells, contributing to cardiac instability and neuromuscular irritability.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p><p><strong>Refeeding syndrome</strong> is caused by metabolic shifts after nutritional replenishment in malnourished individuals and is characterized by <strong>hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia</strong>-<strong>not hyponatremia.</strong></p>",
