Competitive </strong><em>(equilibrium type): </em>The drug being <strong><em>structurally similar</em></strong> competes with the normal substrate for the catalytic binding site of the enzyme so that the product is not formed or a nonfunctional product is formed, and a new equilibrium is achieved in the presence of the drug. Such inhibitors <strong><em>increase the kM but the Vmax remains unchanged.</em></strong></p><p>A <strong><em>nonequilibrium</em></strong><em> type </em>of enzyme inhibition can also occur with drugs which react with the same catalytic site of the enzyme but either <strong><em>form strong covalent bonds or have such high affinity for the enzyme</em></strong> that the normal substrate is not able to displace the inhibitor. e.g.</p><p>Organophosphates react covalently with the esteretic site of the enzyme cholinesterase.

Noncompetitive: </strong>The inhibitor reacts with an <strong><em>adjacent site</em></strong> and not with the catalytic site, but alters the enzyme in such a way that it loses its catalytic property.
