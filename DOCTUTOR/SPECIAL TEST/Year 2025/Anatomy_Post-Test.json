Additionally, an ulnar nerve lesion would affect sensation on the dorsal aspect of the medial hand, which is not preserved in this scenario.</p><p>B) Incorrect: While ulnar nerve injury can cause clawing of the ring and little fingers (ulnar claw), it would not affect all fingers. The median nerve innervates the lateral two lumbricals, preserving function in the index and middle fingers. Furthermore, sensory loss would be limited to the ulnar nerve distribution, not the entire palm.</p><p>C) Incorrect: Although the ulnar nerve does innervate one of the primary wrist flexors (flexor carpi ulnaris), weakness in wrist flexion alone is not a hallmark of ulnar nerve injury. The ability to flex the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger is preserved in ulnar nerve lesions, as it is controlled by the flexor digitorum profundus (lateral half), which is innervated by the median nerve.</p>",

      "solution": "<p>C) Correct: This answer is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms. The inability to make an 'O' shape with the thumb and index finger suggests weakness in the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) and the lateral half of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), both innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN), a branch of the median nerve. The flattened thenar eminence indicates atrophy of the thenar muscles (abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, and superficial head of flexor pollicis brevis), which are innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve in the hand. The sensory loss pattern described matches the median nerve distribution. These findings collectively suggest a median nerve injury proximal to where the AIN branches off, which occurs in the cubital fossa.</p><p>A) Incorrect: While an ulnar nerve injury at the cubital tunnel would cause hand weakness, it would not explain the patient's inability to make an 'O' shape or the specific sensory loss pattern described. Ulnar nerve injury typically affects the medial aspect of the hand and the ring and little fingers.</p><p>B) Incorrect: Although carpal tunnel syndrome involves compression of the median nerve, it occurs distal to where the AIN branches off. Therefore, it would not explain the weakness in muscles innervated by the AIN (FPL and lateral FDP). Carpal tunnel syndrome primarily affects sensory function initially, with motor deficits occurring later and limited to the thenar muscles.</p><p>D) Incorrect: While a C8-T1 radiculopathy would affect the medial cord of the brachial plexus, which contributes to the median nerve, it would not fully explain the patient's symptoms. The described sensory loss pattern involves C6 and C7 dermatomes as well, which are not part of a C8-T1 radiculopathy. Additionally, this option doesn't account for the specific motor deficits observed, particularly those innervated by the AIN.</p>",

The superficial perineal pouch is inferior to the perineal membrane.

The urine may further extravasate into the scrotal and penile layers, and anterior abdominal wall.</p><p>(a) Posterior urethral rupture involving the membranous urethra: Incorrect. A posterior urethral rupture occurs at or distal to the urogenital diaphragm, which includes the membranous urethra. Urine would likely into the deep pouch and potentially to the pelvis. Perineal membrane prevents the extravasation into the superficial perineal pouch (until ruptured).</p><p>(c) Anterior urethral rupture involving the penile urethra, with extravasation limited by Colles' fascia: Incorrect. While Colles' fascia does limit the spread of extravasation, towards the ischiorectal fossa, its is usually the case of bulbar rupture (not the penile urethra rupture); an injury to the penile urethra (which lies more superficially still than the bulbar urethra) is likely to initially present in penile layers, until buck's fascia is also ruptured.</p><p>(d) Posterior urethral rupture extending into the deep perineal pouch, then limited by the pelvic diaphragm: Incorrect. A posterior urethral rupture would involve the membranous or prostatic urethra (above the urogenital diaphragm) and would lead to urine extravasation into the deep perineal pouch and likely beyond, into the pelvis; but not being collected in the superficial pouch.</p>",
