Allison and Tasuku Honjo</em>received <strong>Nobel prize</strong>in physiology or medicine for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation. Normally, there are certain checkpoints, so that immune cells (like T-cells) do not attack self antigens. Certain receptors like PD-1 (programmed death receptors) or CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein) are present on T-cells. When ligands on other cells (PDL-1 or CD-80/86 respectively) bind to these receptors, T-cells are inhibited. Same method is utilized by some cancer cells to evade destruction from T-cells. These tumor cells over express the ligands like PDL-1 and inhibit T-cells. Monoclonal antibodies targeting these interactions result in disinhibition of these brakes and thus, T-cells can destroy cancer cells.</p><p>(a) PD-1 and PDL-1 inhibitors</p><ul><li><strong>Nivolumab</strong>,<strong>Pembrolizumab</strong>and<strong>Cemiplimab</strong>are monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 receptors on T-cells.</li><li><strong>Atezolizumab</strong>,<strong>Avelumab</strong>and<strong>Durvalumab</strong>are monoclonal antibodies against PDL-1 present on cancer cells.</li></ul><p>(b) CTLA-4 Inhibitor:</p><p>Normally CD-80 or CD-86 present on antigen presenting cells bind to CD- 28 present on T-cells. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a CD-28 homologue expressed on T-cells. Binding of this with CD-80/86 molecules inhibit the T-cells. <strong>Ipilimumab </strong>acts as CTLA-4 inhibitor resulting in T-cell activation and destruction of cancer cells. It is approved for treatment of <strong>malignant melanoma</strong>.</p>",
